The CEOs of Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook will testify remotely in a House Judiciary Committee Hearing starting at noon on Wednesday.   When the hearing begins, it may be hard to tell who is the most powerful person in the room.   \"Google controls nearly all of internet search in the United States,\" Rep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, said. \"Amazon controls nearly half of all online commerce in the United States. Facebook has approximately 2.7 billion monthly active users across its platforms, and finally, Apple is under increasing scrutiny for abusing its role as both a player and a referee in the App Store.\"   A year-long congressional investigation is looking for ways to check that power in what experts say will require a new understanding of U.S. competition law.   \"(The) major point of these hearings is to move away from a conception of competition law as focusing on the well-being of citizens, as purchasers of goods and services, and to adopt a broader conception that looks at the citizen as an employee \u2014 as a resident of a community, as a consumer of news,\" Willam Kovacic, the former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission said.   The four companies have all denied anti-competitive behavior. Last week, Apple even commissioned a study that found its App Store commission rates were in line with other companies.   Several large tech companies have voiced concerns that congressional regulation might make them less competitive globally.   \"I worry that if you regulate for the sake of regulating it, it has a lot of unintended consequences,\" said Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google's parent company, Alphabet. \"If you take a technology like artificial intelligence, it will have implications for national security and other important areas of society.\"   Even as the COVID-19 pandemic has made tech companies more essential and more valuable, they have been facing a growing backlash. Protests have taken place across the country over safety concerns at Amazon warehouses , and advertisers have been boycotting Facebook over the site's failure to properly police hate speech.   \"I think they come into the hearing not with a halo, but with great concerns about exactly whose side they are on. And that should be a matter of concern,\" Kovacic said. \"Again, you look at the mood of the Congress. You look at how Republicans join Democrats today in scolding these companies. That's a combustible environment for the leading enterprises.\"   The House investigation is expected to lead to a recommendation for new legislation, perhaps bringing along with it greater scrutiny of tech acquisitions \u2014 like Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google's purchase of YouTube and Fitbit. It could also ramp up pressure on other ongoing investigations of large tech companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42712061544</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-GFW1-F07F-82S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"531\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>PIX11</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The powerful executives are defending their companies as buttressing competition and offering essential services to consumers. The four CEOs are testifying remotely for a hearing Wednesday by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.     Zuckerberg, Bezos among tech leaders to testify before U.S. Congress on antitrust     President Donald Trump , meanwhile, continued to denounce the big tech companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general. In a tweet, he challenged Congress to crack down on the companies.    \u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\u201d Trump tweeted before the start of the hearing. \u201cIn Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!\u201d   If Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!   \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2020   Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can\u2019t use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.   Trump\u2019s Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter . The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.              1:15  Kenney says feds have told Google and Apple not to work with provinces on tracing apps        Kenney says feds have told Google and Apple not to work with provinces on tracing apps    The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world\u2019s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.   Critics question whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.   In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding is needed.     Turkey passes social media regulation bill that could increase online censorship      Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.   \u201cSimply put, they have too much power,\u201d Cicilline said in opening remarks Wednesday, as he laid out data pointing up the power of the four tech companies as essential cogs of commerce and communications.   He also said that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cthese giants stand to profit\u201d and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online.

The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices.   Veering from the issue of market competition, a leading conservative Republican on the panel aired longstanding grievances against the big tech companies of censoring conservative viewpoints.   \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.     Trump backs doctor who believes in COVID-19 cure and \u2018demon sperm\u2019      Each company has a distinct profile and each tech titan has his own approach and story to tell.   For Bezos, who presides over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal \u201csmart\u201d tech and beyond, it will be his first-ever appearance before Congress.   Bezos is introducing himself, in a way, in his hearing testimony, unusual for the occasion. He lays out his challenging life story growing up in New Mexico as the son of a single mother in high school, and later with an adoptive father who emigrated from Cuba at 16. Previewing his written testimony in a blog post Tuesday, Bezos traces his origins as a \u201cgarage inventor\u201d who came up with the concept of an online bookstore in 1994.   He addresses the issue of Amazon\u2019s power in what he describes as a huge and competitive global retail market. The company accounts for less than 4% of retail in the U.S., Bezos maintains. He affirms his rebuff to critics who call for the company to be broken up: Walmart is more than twice Amazon\u2019s size, he says.             1:26  Activists paint mural outside Jeff Bezos\u2019s home demanding PPE for Amazon workers        Activists paint mural outside Jeff Bezos\u2019s home demanding PPE for Amazon workers    Bezos initially declined to testify unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He\u2019ll likely face questioning over a Wall Street Journal report that found Amazon employees used confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusations.    In the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook\u2019s handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook\u2019s refusal to take action on inflammatory Trump posts that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters.             1:41  Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg to review content policies after backlash        Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg to review content policies after backlash    Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage.   \u201cWe believe in values \u2014 democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression \u2014 that the American economy was built on,\u201d he says in his testimony prepared for the hearing.   \u201cI understand that people have concerns about the size and perceived power that tech companies have,\u201d Zuckerberg\u2019s statement says. \u201cUltimately, I believe companies shouldn\u2019t be making so many judgments about important issues like harmful content, privacy and election integrity on their own. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve called for a more active role for governments and regulators, and updated rules for the internet.\u201d    European regulators have concluded that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the e-commerce market, and fined Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., a record $2.7 billion. Google has disputed the findings and is appealing.             2:26  Facebook and Google suspend China\u2019s data requests, TikTok to pull out of Hong KongFacebook and Google suspend China\u2019s data requests, TikTok to pull out of Hong Kong    Attorneys general from both parties in 50 states and territories, led by Texas, launched an antitrust investigation of Google in September, focused on its online advertising business.   \u201cGoogle operates in highly competitive and dynamic global markets, in which prices are free or falling, and products are constantly improving,\u201d Pichai says in his written testimony. \u201cCompetition in ads \u2014 from Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Comcast and others \u2014 has helped lower online advertising costs by 40% over the last 10 years, with these savings passed down to consumers through lower prices.\u201d     Trump says he didn\u2019t ask Putin about Taliban bounty reports, calls it \u2018fake news\u2019      Apple, whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world, faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay.   \u201cApple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,\u201d Cook says.   He is making the case that the fees Apple charges apps to sell services and other goods are reasonable, especially compared with what other tech companies collect. In over a decade since the App Store launched, \u201cwe have never raised the commission or added a single fee,\u201d Cook says in his testimony.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Pichai and Amazon's Jeff Bezos will testify before the antitrust panel that is working on proposals to reform and regulate the digital market, the Washingtonexaminer.com reported on Monday.   Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the Democrat-led committee, and David Cicilline, the Democratic leader of the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee said the testimonies of the four CEOs were essential to complete the investigation as they play a central role in the lives of American people.   \u201cSince last June, the Subcommittee has been investigating the dominance of a small number of digital platforms and the adequacy of existing antitrust laws and enforcement,\u201d Nadler and Cicilline said in a statement.   'Given the central role these corporations play in the lives of the American people, it is critical that their CEOs are forthcoming. As we have said from the start, their testimony is essential for us to complete this investigation,' the statement said.   The hearing is set for July 27, and under House rules during the coronavirus pandemic, witnesses and members are allowed to appear virtually, the statement said.   Attorney General William Barr said in late June that he would soon decide on \u201cactions\u201d for the Justice Department to take in its broad investigation of Big Tech companies, the Washington Examiner reported on Monday.   The US Justice Department has opened a sweeping antitrust review into online platforms, threatening some of Silicon Valley's most powerful companies.   Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren have said both Facebook and Amazon should be split up.   Republicans, too, have raised concerns that major online companies have gained too much power, the report said.

Apple''s Tim Cook, Facebook''s Mark Zuckerberg, Google''s Pichai and Amazon''s Jeff Bezos will testify before the antitrust panel that is working on proposals to reform and regulate the digital market, the Washingtonexaminer.com reported on Monday.   Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the Democrat-led committee, and David Cicilline, the Democratic leader of the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee said the testimonies of the four CEOs were essential to complete the investigation as they play a central role in the lives of American people.   \u201cSince last June, the Subcommittee has been investigating the dominance of a small number of digital platforms and the adequacy of existing antitrust laws and enforcement,\u201d Nadler and Cicilline said in a statement.   \"Given the central role these corporations play in the lives of the American people, it is critical that their CEOs are forthcoming. As we have said from the start, their testimony is essential for us to complete this investigation,\" the statement said.   The hearing is set for July 27, and under House rules during the coronavirus pandemic, witnesses and members are allowed to appear virtually, the statement said.   Attorney General William Barr said in late June that he would soon decide on \u201cactions\u201d for the Justice Department to take in its broad investigation of Big Tech companies, the Washington Examiner reported on Monday.   The US Justice Department has opened a sweeping antitrust review into online platforms, threatening some of Silicon Valley''s most powerful companies.   Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren have said both Facebook and Amazon should be split up.   Republicans, too, have raised concerns that major online companies have gained too much power, the report said.

Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Pichai and Amazon's Jeff Bezos will testify before the antitrust panel that is working on proposals to reform and regulate the digital market, the Washingtonexaminer.com reported on Monday.  Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the Democrat-led committee, and David Cicilline, the Democratic leader of the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee said the testimonies of the four CEOs were essential to complete the investigation as they play a central role in the lives of American people.  \"Since last June, the Subcommittee has been investigating the dominance of a small number of digital platforms and the adequacy of existing antitrust laws and enforcement,\" Nadler and Cicilline said in a statement.  \"Given the central role these corporations play in the lives of the American people, it is critical that their CEOs are forthcoming. As we have said from the start, their testimony is essential for us to complete this investigation,\" the statement said.  The hearing is set for July 27, and under House rules during the coronavirus pandemic, witnesses and members are allowed to appear virtually, the statement said.  Attorney General William Barr said in late June that he would soon decide on \"actions\" for the Justice Department to take in its broad investigation of Big Tech companies, the Washington Examiner reported on Monday.  The US Justice Department has opened a sweeping antitrust review into online platforms, threatening some of Silicon Valley's most powerful companies.  Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren have said both Facebook and Amazon should be split up.  Republicans, too, have raised concerns that major online companies have gained too much power, the report said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Uncertainty is fueling this record level of pessimism. Climate change could provide a positive opportunity for companies.</p><p>Across the globe, business bosses are showing record levels of pessimism about economic growth, a new report has found.</p><p>And there\u2019s one thing behind this lack of confidence \u2013 uncertainty. PwC\u2019s Annual Global CEO Survey represents the views of almost 1,600 chief executives in more than 80 territories, and it found the number that are \u201cvery confident\u201d their revenue will grow in 2020 to be at its lowest level since 2009.Have you read?</p><p>What it means to be a global CEO has changed. Here's how This is what the world's CEOs really think of AI These 79 CEOs believe in global climate action</p><p>The results make interesting reading as CEOs\u2019 revenue confidence, PwC says, can be a reliable indicator of trends in global GDP growth.</p><p>Here are four key things that are on top bosses\u2019 minds for 2020.</p><p>1. A rocky road for growthCEO's have shifted from record optimism toCEO's views on economic growth have changed in the past two years.Image: PwC</p><p>Two years ago, the same PwC survey found record levels of optimism. Today, it\u2019s a very different story \u2013 in fact, the percentage of CEOs that think the rate of global GDP growth will decline has increased tenfold in that time, from 5% to 53%.</p><p>Uncertainty is fueling this fear, the report says. Over-regulation is seen as a top challenge, followed by concerns about uncertain economic growth, trade conflicts, climate change and cyber threats.</p><p>2. Technology regulationMost CEO's forsee legislation in internet content, the breakup of big tech companies and compensation for personal dataCEO predictions for tech regulation.Image: PwC</p><p>Many CEOs think the internet will become more fractured as a lack of global regulation leads to governments increasingly introducing their own legislation.</p><p>Globally, 50% think local laws around content, commerce and privacy will create a more splintered internet, while 40% say it will become less fractured. And nearly 7 in 10 CEOs foresee an increase in legislation around content regulation and to break up dominant tech companies.</p><p>The report says CEOs will increasingly need to collaborate with governments on solutions around how technology and data are used that both protect consumers and foster innovation. This will become more important as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) advances and the use of technologies like artificial intelligence increases.What is the World Economic Forum doing about the Fourth Industrial Revolution?</p><p>The World Economic Forum was the first to draw the world\u2019s attention to the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the current period of unprecedented change driven by rapid technological advances. Policies, norms and regulations have not been able to keep up with the pace of innovation, creating a growing need to fill this gap.</p><p>The Forum established the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network in 2017 to ensure that new and emerging technologies will help\u2014not harm\u2014humanity in the future. Headquartered in San Francisco, the network launched centres in China, India and Japan in 2018 and is rapidly establishing locally-run Affiliate Centres in many countries around the world.World Economic Forum Centre for the Fourth Industrial R...</p><p>The global network is working closely with partners from government, business, academia and civil society to co-design and pilot agile frameworks for governing new and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous vehicles, blockchain, data policy, digital trade, drones, internet of things (IoT), precision medicine and environmental innovations.</p><p>Learn more about the groundbreaking work that the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network is doing to prepare us for the future.</p><p>Want to help us shape the Fourth Industrial Revolution? Contact us to find out how you can become a member or partner.How effective are your upskilling programmesCEO's answer how effective their upskilling programmes are at achieving certain outcomesImage: PwC</p><p>As the 4IR introduces new ways of working, new technical, digital and soft skills will be required. But these are in short supply, according to the report, leading to a consensus among CEOs that retraining and upskilling are the most important routes to closing potential skills gaps in their organizations.</p><p>Just 18% of global CEOs report significant progress in establishing programs to help employees do this.

Growing frustrated with the continued presence of dangerous content online, the EU Commission called on tech firms to remove this radicalizing material within one hour of being notified of its existence. 'We still need to react faster against terrorist propaganda and other illegal content which is a serious threat to our citizens' security, safety and fundamental rights,' Digital Commissioner Andrus Ansip said, writes Counter Extremism Project (CEP) Executive Director David Ibsen (pictured). Europe continues to be justifiably alarmed after seeing so many of its citizens become victims of terrorists who continue to be inspired and trained through materials readily available online. </p><p>The response from EDiMA\u2014the European trade association representing tech giants like Google/YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter\u2014to the EU Commission's latest voluntary standard was disappointing but predictable. The tech industry's response revealed the widening chasm between the powerful for-profit technology companies and those dedicated to protecting the public, and why many see regulation of this industry as inevitable. Rather than acknowledging the harm that radicalizing extremist materials have perpetrated, accepting responsibility, and pledging to dedicate the requisite resources to guarantee and measure the permanent removal of prohibited extremist content, the tech industry and EDiMA instead stressed the need to 'balance the responsibility to protect users while upholding fundamental rights.' This rhetoric is of course patently absurd, and represents tech's attempt to distract from policy discussions about public safety and security and spin them into nebulous, unserious suggestions designed to prevent meaningful reforms. It is bizarre for the tech industry to declare itself a protector of 'fundamental rights' writ large. These for-profit companies, through EDiMA, argue that the one-hour takedown period could be detrimental to tech's ability to somehow uphold the 'fundamental rights' of its users. But the companies' rhetoric remains vague how they define these rights, whether or not they\u2014as private corporations\u2014are in a position to define those rights, and who's rights they claim to be protecting. It strains credulity to believe that tech companies, for profit entities whose business model is based on selling advertising gleaned from user data, could be more committed to protecting rights than governments and elected officials. Moreover, as the saying goes, actions speak louder than words. And as much as the tech industry would like us to believe otherwise, their track record on this issue is lacking. Tech companies may tout their support for free speech, for example, but they are regularly removing content all the time\u2014including expressly legal content\u2014based on rules enshrined in their Terms of Service. The general public and lawmakers should not let tech's clever rhetoric obscure the obvious issues\u2014their continued failure to tackle extremism online in an effective manner. We must compare tech's speech with tech's actions. If technology companies are truly interested in the rights and freedoms beyond their own, in the interest of transparency, maybe they could list them explicitly. That way, the public can evaluate whether their rights are being protected or constrained by the whims of Terms of Service enforcement actions. Returning to the freedom of expression example, if expressing oneself on social media platforms is truly a fundamental right, then surely the social media companies are the world's greatest violator of users' fundamental rights as it is they that remove copious amounts of users' posted content all the time with little or no notification\u2014essentially at the whims of a corporate leader. Tech companies want us to believe they are working hard to make the world a better place. Their frequent media statements are replete with sincere apologies and vows to 'do better' in the aftermath of each successive terrorist attack, and often detail their purported progress in combatting hateful material on their platforms. The unvarnished truth is that any progress made by technology companies to take down extremist content has been due to the threat of reputational harm, lost ad revenue, and the prospect of regulation. We saw it in March of last year, when Google profusely apologized and made changes after advertisements were discovered alongside extremist content on YouTube. Troubled by what they see online, the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers has called for an independent body to regulate content on social media platforms based on a common set of standards. Unilever recently went a step further, warning tech firms that retaining their advertising depended on tech companies controlling the proliferation of extremist material, fake news, child exploitation, racism, and sexism. Following revelations about Facebook and the misuse of user data, it is increasingly difficult to believe that big tech companies care very much about terrorist and extremist content, hate speech, child pornography, fake news, or other disturbing issues infecting their platforms. As EDiMA's response to a very measured set of recommendations from the EU Commission clearly revealed, absent significantly more pressure from consumers, advertisers, and lawmakers, tech companies plan to continue to resist industry-wide standards for removing extremist content or deploying existing technology capable of detecting and preventing the re-upload of that same material. Instead, the big tech companies will continue to talk about rights, rather than responsibilities, when their behavior is called into question. As long as they're allowed to get away with it. David Ibsen serves as executive director for theCounter Extremism Project[1](CEP), a not-for-profit, non-partisan, international policy organization formed to combat the growing threat from extremist ideologies.

My name is Mike Fitzgerald. I'm the NASDAQ Relationship Manager for Cerence. I'm delighted to be the first to welcome you here today for today's opening bell.</p><p>To kick things off, I'd like to introduce our NASDAQ Executive Host, Chief Client Officer, Joe Brantuk. Joe, come on up.</p><p>JOSEPH BRANTUK;NASDAQ;CHIEF CLIENT OFFICER: All right. Thanks, Mike. All right. Well, good morning, everyone. All right. Not bad for a packed house here.</p><p>It is truly my great pleasure to welcome Cerence and its CEO and Director, Sanjay Dhawan, to the NASDAQ market site. Now I'd also like to extend a warm, warm welcome to members of the management team, employees and, frankly, to all our distinguished guests this morning. We are truly, truly excited that you could all join us right here from the crossroads of the world in Times Square, New York as we get set to ring today's opening bell.</p><p>Now there is certainly a lot to celebrate this morning, and I would like to start off by congratulating all of you on the successful spin-off from Nuance and listing on NASDAQ. This is certainly a major, major milestone, and we are thrilled to be celebrating with you today. Congratulations, guys. What do you say? I think that deserves a big round of applause.</p><p>So Cerence is the leader in voice and AI assistance for the automotive world. As the innovation partner to the world's automakers, you have truly transformed how our cars feel, respond and learn. With decades of leadership, putting more than 325 million voice-enabled cars on the road, I could say without question that Cerence is mapping the road ahead for us all, and the horizon sure looks bright.</p><p>So Sanjay, we know that this is certainly a team effort, so congratulations again to you and the entire team on all your success. We are exceptionally proud to be your partner, and we are certainly looking forward to supporting you as you continue to grow and continue to innovate as a NASDAQ-listed company.</p><p>And now please join me in welcoming Sanjay to the podium. Come on up.</p><p>Congratulations. [I'm really happy for you.]</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, CERENCE INC.: Thank you so much. So thank you, Joe, and thank you to NASDAQ for inviting Cerence to open the market today.</p><p>As a newly formed public company, we are very excited to unleash Cerence, our market leader in voice and AI, to revolutionize voice assistance in a car and to dramatically change the relationship between people and their vehicles.</p><p>At Cerence, our vision is to create a safer, more enjoyable journey for everyone. We achieve that by allowing drivers to speak to their car in more than 70 language and dialects, phone calls, navigation, music, e-mail or text, flight information or restaurant reservations, all through voice, all powered by Cerence.</p><p>We are the #1 supplier of this AI technology with almost 325 million cars on the road today and another 45 million to 50 million being added each year. In fact, last year, 1 of 2 cars sold around the world relied on Cerence technology. For all you drivers out there, you know firsthand that user experience inside the car is becoming a key feature and an important brand differentiator. Our role in all this is to help our customers, the world's carmakers, deliver the most efficient enjoyable and safe driving environment for all of you.</p><p>Each year, more and more cars makes and models are adding voice assistance as part of their driving experience. And these cars are now increasingly connected. This is one of the key reasons why we're growing at a much faster rate than the annual production of cars. On top of that, we are innovating faster than ever, you might say at Formula 1 speeds, introducing new forms of integration such as gestures, eye tracking, emotion detection for your next car purchase. These are exciting times for Cerence.</p><p>I want to thank you, Joe, for -- and all of NASDAQ for being such a strong partner of Cerence.</p><p>Before departing, I want to offer my heartfelt thanks to our employees around the world. I'm here in New York with 10 people from my leadership team today, but there are another 2,000 Cerence team members in all of our offices through Europe, Asia and North America. I wish I could have every one of them on the stage with me today, but obviously that's not possible. It's through their energy, their innovation and their drive that we are able to stand here today. So once again, thank you so much. Our future is bright and the horizon is vast. Go Cerence!</p><p>JOSEPH BRANTUK;NASDAQ;CHIEF CLIENT OFFICER: Great job. Well, as a car buff, I just want to say thank you just for increasing the user experience. It really is remarkable. I also want to thank you for your trust and partnership in NASDAQ. We can't think of a better way to celebrate all your success than having you and your entire team and also the team watching on the webcast, joining us this morning to ring today's opening bell.</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: Thank you.</p><p>JOSEPH BRANTUK;NASDAQ;CHIEF CLIENT OFFICER: To commemorate that, I would like to present you with the opening bell crystal. Congratulations.</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: Thank you.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN, VP OF IR, CERENCE INC.: All right. Well, I think the walls are coming down, but we can start as those proceed. Welcome, everyone, to the NASDAQ mark site to Cerence's inaugural Analyst Day. It's very exciting to have you all here. We really appreciate you're taking the time to join us today. We have a very full and exciting schedule for you, and I'm hopeful that you'll find that they're very productive.</p><p>A few housekeeping things to start with. Number one, the format of the presentations are going to be prepared remarks and then followed by Q&amp;A. So we just ask you that while the speaker is speaking that you hold your questions until we get to that point in time. We've allotted 20 minutes for prepared remarks and 10 minutes per speaker for Q&amp;A. So we know how important that is.</p><p>Second of all, we will be serving lunch at noon right next to us. But it's going to be a working lunch. So what we're going to ask you to do is quickly go grab some lunch and come back to your seat because we have, again, a very full schedule. We want to make sure we get everything in and get everyone through on time.</p><p>If you need to go to the men's room or ladies room, that door over there is the exit to get there. So we don't have any breaks built into the schedule other than that time at noon for grabbing lunch. So just please discreetly, if you need to go, go out that door and then come back in.</p><p>Okay. So that's the logistics of the event. I will start now just by forward-looking statements, safe harbor statement. So just -- I ask everyone to certainly understand the risk factors, all of our SEC filings, identify those. We will be talking about future events or products or business models. We feel no obligation to update those -- that information, so we please ask you take care of looking -- spending the time to look at our forward-looking statements and safe harbor statement.</p><p>Okay. With that, I'm sure all of you have come here with goals in mind in terms of what you hope to get out of the day. I just want to share what my -- with a few comments from me because you don't really want to hear from me. You can talk to me. I've talked to most of you already. You're going to hear from everyone else mostly today. But what I'm hoping that you'll do today is come away with a few different things. Number one, that you see that there's a very experienced, knowledgeable, extended executive team here that has the ability to implement the vision that our CEO, Sanjay, will be talking to you about.</p><p>Secondly, we're a relatively new company. And so what I hope to be able to do for everyone, either listening on the webcast or here today, is to level-set in terms of what are the capabilities to products, the go-to-market strategies that we have as a company so that you have a really thorough understanding of that. And also an understanding of our competitive position and the advantages that we feel we have and the strong competitive moat that we have primarily because of the innovation that we continue to apply to the industry and to our products and also just from focusing on this particular industry; and finally, pulling that all together, that we're able to do all that and deliver a profitable growth story. And that's something that we'll wrap up in the final presentation with the finances -- financial discussion from our CFO, Mark Gallenberger.</p><p>So if there aren't any other questions or any questions, we'll kick things off. Okay. So our first speaker is Arun Sarin. He's our Chairman of the Board. And so we're very excited to have him here joining us to kick things off. Arun served as Chief Executive Officer of Vodafone Group from 2003 until his retirement in 2008. He began his career with Pacific Telesis Group in 1984, where he progressed through various management positions there; and at AirTouch Communications, which Pacific Telesis has spun off in 1994. He was named President and Chief Operating Officer of AirTouch in 1997. AirTouch merged with Vodafone in 1999. He left Vodafone in 2000 to become Chief Executive Officer of InfoSpace. And from 2001 and until 2003, he served as Chief Executive Officer of Accel-KKR Telecom. After his retirement in 2008, he served as a senior adviser to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. for 5 years. Arun currently serves as a Director at Cisco Systems, The Charles Schwab Corporation and Accenture. He previously served as a Director of Safeway from 2009-2015 and Blackhawk Network Holdings from 2009 to 2018. He holds an MBA from -- [in] Master of Science from University of California-Berkeley and a B.S. from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, India.</p><p>So with that, I'd like to welcome Arun up to the dais.</p><p>ARUN SARIN, INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, CERENCE INC.: First Cerence Analyst Day. It's a big day for us. Some things never change, and that is the folks who come here first get to get the best seats, and most of the best seats are in the last row there. And people who showed up here at 10:29 all have to sit in the front row. So things change, but some things really don't change that much.</p><p>Look, we've got a great program for you. We've got the Chief Executive and his senior management team here. There were just 3 or 4 points that I wanted to make to you. One is, as you know, we're a spin-off from Nuance. We are off and running. We have our Board in place. We have our management team in place. We have established processes. So if some of you are thinking about, look, this is a new company, it's a spin-off, there are obviously some interdependencies between us and Nuance. And over a period of time, they'll sort of wear away. I'm here to basically say that this company now runs like any other mid-cap-sized public company. And I'm very pleased to be part of this team and very pleased to be part of the Board.</p><p>We have a very accomplished and well-qualified and diverse Board. And we have 2 former CEOs on the Board. We've got 3 former CFOs on the Board. So I feel like the Board has the qualifications and the diversity of thought and ideas in terms of making this company and governing this company properly.</p><p>We have all the committees, the Audit Committee, the Non-Gov committee, the Comp committee, et cetera. So we are good there. In terms of the kinds of things that we're spending time on thinking about these days in the Board have to do with strategic issues. As you know, this is a fragmented industry. A lot of things are changing as we move into sort of the digital car world with electrification and over a period of time, autonomous, et cetera. So we spend a lot of time thinking about our position and other people's positions, and therefore, how is the cookie likely to crumble.</p><p>We also think a lot about the operational metrics, how we're doing on a day-in, day-out, month-in, month-out basis. We worry about the talent pool and the human resource issues that the company has to face. And finally, we monitor the financial health of the company, making sure we're sort of monitoring that and moving the company along over a period of time.</p><p>I'm particularly proud of the team that has been assembled by Sanjay. There's a very good mix of former Nuance folks who are now Cerence folks and then some people from the outside who bring a fresh perspective on the whole digital auto sector and cloud and other things. So I think that's a very good sort of combination. And we also have a -- this is -- even though it's a mid-cap company, it's a genuinely global company. We've got, obviously, employees here in the United States, but we've got a large group in Canada. We've got a large group in Germany and in Europe. We've got a large group in China. So we are actually quite a global company, and the management team reflects that.</p><p>So in summary, the company is off and running. It's being governed. It's being managed, and I'll now turn it back to Ritch for you to hear from management and spend the remaining 3 or 4 hours asking them where the world is going and where we are going in the digital car world.</p><p>So thank you very much for your time, and welcome again.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: Okay. Our next speaker is Sanjay Dhawan, our Chief Executive Officer. With more than 30 years of technology leadership and extensive experience in the automotive industry, Sanjay brings a deep understanding of AI and machine learning and applications with a particular focus on developing solutions at the intersection of devices, sensors, cloud solutions and data integration.</p><p>Prior to joining Cerence, Sanjay served as President of the Connected Services Division and Chief Technology Officer of Hartmann Industries International (sic) [Harman Industries International] until 2019. Previously, he served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Symphony Teleca Corporation since 2010.</p><p>Sanjay holds a Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering from Brunei University, England -- Brunel University, England and a Bachelors Science Degree in Electronics and Communications from REC Kurukshetra, India.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: Perfect. Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Now firstly, a very warm welcome to all of you. Thank you for taking the time from your busy schedules to come and join us in here.</p><p>Our story. We, myself, I am Sanjay Dhawan. I'm CEO of Cerence. I'm going to be joined by my whole management team, many of us who are presenting to all of you with regards to how we see our business moving forward. So we're really excited to basically share that with all of you.</p><p>Today was a very exciting day for us for many reasons. Number one, we did our NASDAQ bell ringing. So pretty exciting in the morning, a lot of adrenaline flowing and so on and so forth. But more importantly, we're -- we were really excited and looking forward to sharing our thoughts with all of you.</p><p>And also, we'll be joined today on the stage by one of our key customers, Mercedes Benz. Nils came all the way from Stuttgart, Germany to share his views with all of you as well. So I'm really excited about that as well.</p><p>So as I get started, as many of you know, Cerence is -- we're entering our fifth month as an independent company. We're standing strong post the spin that became effective on October 1 more and off to the races, and we're going to share the details with all of you. The main reason for the spin basically was to have Cerence focus exclusively in the automotive space. So we, as a company, are totally focused on transportation and mobility. We were embedded inside the bigger Nuance. And as the technologies were diverging and then the focus was being lost, a decision was taken by Nuance to spin the business into an independent company so that we can focus on transportation and mobility, especially in the automotive space.</p><p>So we're a company that -- we use a tagline that says, \"We're a company, [we're] AI, we are the AI for the world of motion.\" We have a key focus to bring human-machine interactions through voice inside the cars. And as the day goes, you'll see why 1 out of 2 cars basically ship with our technology.</p><p>Our, obviously, vision is to have a more safer and enjoyable journey for everyone. Voice plays a very important role in the car. It's nice to have voice on your -- in your home or on your phone or in your business interactions. But when you're driving, your hands are supposed to be on the wheel and your eyes are supposed to be on the road. So voice becomes a key interaction mechanism for the digital car.</p><p>What's really interesting basically is that if you look at the automotive sector, we're right in the middle of it. I think one thing that is very clear is that the car is getting more and more digital. As car gets more connected, car gets more autonomous, car gets more electric. Digital technologies are going to be playing much, much more important role inside the car. And the human-car interaction is what's going to be the center of our AI platforms that we basically bring inside the car.</p><p>So we pretty much work with every OEM on the planet. They use, I mean, our technology to basically enable that voice and digital interaction inside the car. We work with almost all the Tier 1s. And also, we work very closely with the content providers and the big tech companies out there. So right -- sits right in the center of the whole automotive ecosystem.</p><p>Although we're a young company, we have a very strong heritage. Like I said, we were spin -- we were a spin from Nuance 5 months ago, 4 months ago. And -- but the company has technology and has created a leadership in the voice platforms for the last 20-plus years. Very strong IP portfolio, 1,250-plus core patents. In fact, we believe we own the wake-up word. So when you hear, \"Hey, Mercedes\" or \"Hey, BMW\" and some of the other tech companies also basically use that, the whole wake-up word concept is -- was very early patented by Cerence. So we have a very strong IP portfolio.</p><p>The piece on this slide that I want to draw your attention to is 325 million cars have -- we have shipped with our technology. We're shipping at about 12 million cars per quarter, about 48 million cars a year. We're adding to this. So as we finish 2020, with this number, we'll be close to 400 million cars plus. So you can imagine there is a lot of installed base. And what you'll hear is how do we plan to kind of add on more products onto our core voice platforms and monetize this for our shareholders. That's many of you here in this room.</p><p>Very strong R&amp;D team. We're now the right size. Previously, when we were part of Nuance, where we were 1 of the 3 and the smallest division of Nuance. And like I said, the focus was getting lost a little bit. Now that we are an independent company, we are very focused on automotive, very focused on transportation and mobility. And we have almost 1,500-plus R&amp;D and professional services engineers. So it's a right size where we can basically focus them to innovate. And you'll hear about the nice and cool things that we're building.</p><p>One thing that is very important in voice platforms is language coverage. When you talk to our OEM customers, you'll hear basically that they really want to build a single platform that they can ship across the world. And our language coverage is better than even any other bigger tech companies, 70-plus languages covered.</p><p>Great leadership team. Like Arun said, it's a nice mix of experience from the past and also some new talent that has come in. Most of the colleagues are here today to basically present to you and interact with you. So feel free to ask us any questions.</p><p>Also very honored to be working with a great Board. Like Arun said, there are 2 ex public company CEOs. Arun obviously led Vodafone and many other companies. We also have Sanjay Jha, who led Motorola as its CEO until Motorola was sold to Google. And then we have 3 public company CFOs on the Board. So you can imagine, right, in terms of the compliance and governance and so on and so forth, we're already very thorough as a team.</p><p>I want to make a point very loudly to all of you, which is that Cerence is a completely independent company. We were spun out of Nuance, but we are trying to build our own culture. If you look at my background, you will see a lot of start-ups in my background. I'm based in Silicon Valley for the last 30-plus years, and I've led 4 different private companies. And my last one -- including 2 companies, 2 private equity-owned companies, a KKR company. And my last one was acquired by Harman. Not Hartmann, Ritch. It was acquired by Harman, and I was part of the Harman's management team for 4.5 years, including the transition of Harman from public company to -- from a private -- from a public company to Samsung.</p><p>And the -- having said that, the core in me is all about kind of start-up and innovation. Because in technology companies, you have to kind of innovate and innovate at a fast speed. And that is what we are trying to do. We're very agile as a management team as a -- including our 2,000-people employee base. We're very innovative, and you'll see the direction that we are taking, and extremely customer-focused. It starts with me. As the CEO of this company, I have to basically set the culture. And I have done that kind of -- that was my first step that I took once I joined Cerence to basically create with the management team, with the key employees as to what is Cerence going to stand.</p><p>So this slide here basically captures some of our kind of key things that we are focused on: very customer-focused, very employee-focused. Transparency, trust, respect are the key cornerstones of how we operate. Speed of innovation is very, very important to us. We implement -- many of you may have heard OKRs, Objectives and Key Results. So I publish my OKRs to my whole company, and it basically kind of goes down to make sure that there is complete transparency and in our operational rhythm as we all kind of try to move our business forward.</p><p>We're off to a very good start. We just, last week, announced our earnings. The spin from Nuance is all but complete. Like Arun said, we are standing strong as a completely independent company. The Q1 results were good. We met or exceeded all the consensus numbers and our own guidance. And we're staying very extremely focused on both the strategy that we have defined that we'll share with you today and also the execution, which is equally extremely important.</p><p>I think we've -- I've talked earlier about the major trends in the car and how we become center to those trends. Voice and multi-modality-based interactions is key. We use AI, deep learning, machine learning, deep into our core algorithms as a technology to basically enable these interactions inside the car and obviously, work very closely with all the OEMs. We're -- and with that, basically enable key functionality inside the car, whether it's virtual voice assistant or helping with distracted driving or helping with other major trends in the car.</p><p>This space is moving very well in terms of -- if you basically look at any data, more than 50% of the car owners are using voice in the car. 58% are -- is going to increase as we look forward here basically. And more than 62% people are telling us that they -- the digital component and how human-machine interface works inside the car, including voice, is a key consideration when they buy a car. And I think that basically gives us a very strong foundation for our future growth.</p><p>As I told you earlier, we're very focused on innovation. And so you'll hear from our CTO today in terms of the new areas that we are thinking about innovating and so on and so forth. You'll hear from our -- head of our core products business, Stefan, about why 325 million cars are -- have been shipped so far with our technology and what's -- and how we are further kind of enhancing our platforms.</p><p>So what I want to now focus on is how are we going to deliver further value to our shareholders. Many of you are our key shareholders here, and I want to tell you that there are 3 key things that we are very focused on.</p><p>Number one, launching new products. We want to increase our content in revenue per car, and I'll talk about that in a minute a little bit more. We want to drive and add new opportunities. With a huge installed base, we want to basically add and layer in new products. And now I will chat about that in a second. And finally, on the operational side, we want to improve the efficiencies.</p><p>So let me take one by one. In terms of launching new products, you will hear from my colleagues many new examples of new products that we'll be launching. And pay close attention to the presentation that Stefan and then Charles will make, and you will see kind of the sort of new products that we're bringing in. Our goal is to double our revenue per car. So that's one key kind of broad metrics that we are very focused on.</p><p>We're expanding our portfolio. And the presentations -- the next few presentations that you will see basically will give you examples of -- some of these new products we have announced. These were built up towards CES, and we had a very successful CES. But -- and there are more products coming as we move forward.</p><p>Second piece is that from a growth driver standpoint is that we're enhancing the business model of our products. And what I mean by that is that today, we are aligned with the COGS of a car. So we are one of the line items on the cost of goods sold. And obviously, like I said in my previous slide, we want to increase that by adding new products, new functionality for our customers. But once we have done that, what we are also doing basically is that some of our new products, we want to ship. We want to ship it in SaaS model, which basically means that we want these products to be tied to the life of a car. So today, our revenue is tied to the revenue ship -- the new car shipment. But as soon as we kind of tie our products to the life of a car, it -- obviously, the TAM, you can multiply it by 7 to 10x, right? The -- we announced one such product called Car Life, and I will have our colleagues talk a little bit about it; and we have a few others planned as we look forward here basically.</p><p>So we're also looking at adding certain products into cars, which have already shipped but may not have the technology ours or other voice technologies. So we're also looking at how do we add some of this new technology into cars which have already been shipped. So we'll talk about that as well with you.</p><p>Finally, improving efficiencies is a very important focus for us. We're -- we, as a management team, are very operationally focused. I drive myself and the management team around KPIs. I mentioned, okay, the objectives in the results is key to us. And we drive ourselves by the numbers. And so here, obviously, we're looking at how do we further improve our various different operational efficiencies.</p><p>Today, we spend almost 28% of our revenue on R&amp;D as we scale further and as we optimize our R&amp;D spend. We see this kind of stabilizing around 25%. And that is not reducing the spend. That is basically making the spend more optimal. I want to make it very, very clear. We're a technology company, and R&amp;D is core to us to kind of keep us competitive and innovative from an investment standpoint. And we continue to plan to do that.</p><p>We're also looking at how do we improve margins and so on. On pro services side, our utilization -- bill utilization is a little low, and we want to basically improve that. We want to reduce some of our COGS line item when it comes to our hosting costs and so on and so forth. And as you hear from my colleagues who are going to follow me, you will see how we, as a company, are improving our operational efficiencies so that we can kind of deliver better results.</p><p>And towards the end, Mark, our CFO, will be presenting to you kind of how we see all this kind of add up in terms of top line growth and how does all this add up towards the margin expansion as well.</p><p>So with that, I'm absolutely very, very excited with welcoming all of you in starting our journey that we started about 4 months back. This is our first Analyst Day and just extremely excited that all of you have decided to join us and hear us on through our journey.</p><p>We're very focused on growth. We are very focused on accelerating and contributing through innovation, new technology for our customers. And we're also very committed to financial excellence in terms of how all this kind of translates into better growth and better profitability for our company.</p><p>So with that, I would welcome any questions, please. Thank you so much.</p><p>We have, Ritch, time for a few questions, right? So I think the format that we have is that after every speaker, we'll do Q&amp;A, just so that any questions on anybody's mind is not lost. Any thoughts -- any questions that anybody wants to share?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: Back there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Can you talk a little bit about your inorganic [store] cash on both driving some of those new opportunities? And then maybe if you can expand a little bit further on some of the ways that you're adding revenues (inaudible) Saas model. On cost of goods sold, you have the ability (inaudible) right?</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: Sure. Very good questions. So firstly, organic versus inorganic. Our #1 focus as a team is to deliver organic growth. We -- I firmly believe that any company has to first figure out how to grow organically. And what you will see is basically, today, what we're going to share with you is our organic growth plan for our company.</p><p>Having said that, the automotive ecosystem is transforming. And one of the biggest change that's taking place is that, just like what happened on the PC or on the phone, that hardware and software are being decoupled. And the reason that decoupling is very important basically is because with that decoupling, you can then go and upgrade and add new capability independent of each other, right?</p><p>And so we want to participate in that opportunity as it materializes. So like Arun said, at the Board level, we're very focused on strategy, both in the management team and the Board, to look at as that transition happens in our segment, do we need to do any inorganic additions as well to our company.</p><p>At this stage, we, as a management team, have not taken anything to the Board on the inorganic side because we have been saying -- we have been very focused on kind of, a, standing up the company strong and also focusing on the organic growth part.</p><p>Your second question was about the -- any little bit more details about the new business model, the SaaS business model. So let me use Car Life as an announced product that we have already announced and how does that work, right? And I'll tell you the OTA/cloud part. Because remember, in our platform, we have 2 components. We have embedded piece of our software that runs inside the car, but then we also have cloud piece that runs in the cloud. And because we have our software running in the cloud, many of the new functionality we can add through the cloud. So in some -- certain functionality, yes, we need the OTA support. And we have to work with the OEM to bring that software down into the car. But some of the new capability, we can basically enable it through cloud. Right?</p><p>So in this case, Car Life is basically an add-on product, which enables the OEM to support the complete life cycle of the car. And what I mean by that basically is that once the car is built, the first thing that happens is the OEM has to sell the car. There are many studies done that the salesman who basically sits and tries to describe the future of the car doesn't know more than 1/3 of the features, right? Wouldn't it be great to kind of have a virtual salesman which is enabled through the voice command, who can basically then tell you about that car. Right?</p><p>Once the car is sold, the first thing that the new driver does is onboarding. Many of the times, once the car is sold, they just kind of going to hand you the key and say, \"Okay. Good luck\", right? Wouldn't it be great to kind of do a quick-start guide, which is onboarding a driver through cloud again, right, and voice as a channel.</p><p>I have been driving 40 years now. Started at 3. No, just kidding. And I've owned 10, 15 cars probably, right? And every time I buy a new car, I say to myself, \"You know what, this time, I'm going to read the manual, and I'm going to learn my car and so on and so forth.\" How many times have I done that? Zero. And every time I ask this question, right, it's the same answer. Won't it be great to kind of basically, through voice, have these modules -- learning modules that are available to you that while you are driving and you have some time and sort of listening to radio or something else. You say, hey, in the first 6, 9, 12 months of the car ownership, tell me about my car, right, and so on.</p><p>The next part in the journey of car ownership basically is if something goes wrong, you want to basically kind of go and ask the car, \"Hey, how do I measure tire pressure? How do I do this? How do I do that,\" right? And so we have an AI-based QA, question-and-answer module, which is part of this product, which can basically enhance that, right?</p><p>And last piece is service scheduling, which is basically attaching to the DMS, some of the dealer management system to schedule service and so on. So this is a complete life cycle product, which can be added through cloud into -- onto our existing platforms.</p><p>Any other questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: The first question would be, can you talk a little bit about -- with the R&amp;D, is this sort of Cerence-driven? Or are these coming from requests from automakers [just from, yes?] And then, I guess, building on top of that with some of the new business models, the automakers, I guess, are sort of notoriously bureaucratic in their ways in terms of purchasing. I mean, what's sort of been the reception to change basically how you charge for your product with them?</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: Sure. So the R&amp;D is driven by both customers and us. So we have a dedicated product management team, about -- almost about 30 people in our product management team, led by a gentleman by the name of Christophe. And he's our Head of Product Management. And he basically -- he and his team work very closely with our OEM customers to basically define the product road map, which then gets implemented by our 700-plus-people R&amp;D team.</p><p>The other 700 people -- you saw a number, 1,500 number. The other half of the engineering team basically works with our OEM customers to take our products and basically integrate it as the new car gets created. Okay? So very mutual where we have our own thoughts, but then we work very closely with the OEMs to define a product road map.</p><p>Second piece -- second part of your -- what was the second question? Sorry, the...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Automakers.</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: Yes. The buying patterns basically of the automakers. The -- yes, OEMs do have -- and we have one sitting here, but they have very strong purchasing teams. And yes, because traditionally, we are part of a COGS line item, every vendor goes through that.</p><p>I sold my last company, which was Harman's largest acquisition. And I experienced it myself in the 4.5 years that I was part of that team that every Tier 1 kind of goes through that same purchasing team just like we do. Having said that, in some of the new products, we're moving away from COGS line item more into kind of driver enablement, more the marketing side of the car, more on the operational side of the car. And that, we're hoping that we'll have a little bit more flexibility on pricing and so on and so forth with our OEM customers.</p><p>Any other questions? One last one. I guess we have 41 seconds.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Can you just talk about competitive landscape? And who your main competitors are? And how you're going up against them?</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: Sure. So we have -- on the competitive side, we will talk in a little bit more detail as the presenters come, but I'll just kind of touch it at a high level. We have certain companies whom we compete with. There is a Silicon Valley company called SoundHound, which is a spinout of Stanford. They are a good competitor. Nine out of 10 times we win. So we think we are better, obviously. There is a company -- a Chinese company called iFlytek. So there is about half a dozen kind of smaller companies. But when it comes to automotive space, transportation, mobility, we're very strong in terms of -- if you look at our win rate and adoption and so on and so forth.</p><p>One other thing that is very misunderstood about us is how do we coexist with the big tech companies. Obviously, you hear about Google, you hear about Alexa and so on and so forth. And car is an important part where these companies also want to be present inside the car. And the thing that's most misunderstood about us is that we -- the story of Cerence is us or big tech companies. The reality is that it's us \"and.\" The reason I say that basically is because just think about it, you, as a consumer, each of you are a driver. Each of you is an end customer of what we do. Every day, you use your Apple devices. You use Apple services. You use Google services. You use Amazon. You use Microsoft and others. You don't use one or the other. You want car to be an extension of your digital life whatever your digital life outside the car is. And what we are trying to do is basically enable that.</p><p>We announced a new product today, since we were meeting with all of you. It's our cognitive arbitration in a product, which basically is like a voice router inside the car and will enable the OEMs to offer private-label services, white-label services but also provide a mechanism to interface with the other tech ecosystems which exist outside the car.</p><p>Here in the U.S., we think about Google and Amazon. But if you're a Chinese consumer -- and by the way, 1/3 of the new cars, shipped to China. You basically have to think about Alibaba or Tencent or Baidu as an ecosystem. If you want to ship your car into Russia, you have to think about Yandex, right? You don't have to think about Google or Amazon. So what we do is, basically kind of through this cognitive arbitration, enable the internal voice ecosystem to be extended to the outside world.</p><p>Other piece, some of you on the analysts side have written that the competition to us is with Android Auto and Apple Car Play. You know what, I can give you dozens of cars that have shipped today which enable Android Auto and Car Play but also has a license that Cerence is deriving its revenues from those. And you'll hear about some of our new products. You'll hear about a product called Cerence ARK, which would further kind of add capabilities for very low -- voice capabilities for very, very low-end cars, right? Where the Android Auto or CarPlay can't even exist because there may not be a display or the processing power to basically implement Android Auto and CarPlay. And we will have basically a solution for voice-enabled assistance for those low-end cars as well.</p><p>So I think this is one area that's very misunderstood about us. But if you talk to our customers and if you talk to go people into the space, you'll see kind of how we operate.</p><p>Thank you so much, and again, welcome to all of you. Thank you.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: Thank you, Sanjay. Our next speaker is Dr. Stefan Ortmanns. He's an Executive Vice President and Head of the core business that we have within Cerence. Stefan joined Nuance in 2003 and has served as its Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Automotive division since March 2018. As GM, he was responsible for hybrid conversational AI-powered solutions for the digital car and automotive-related services that are used by almost all of the world's leading automotive manufacturers.</p><p>He previously held other positions at Nuance, including Senior Vice President of Engineering and Professional Services for the former Mobile division. Stefan started working in the speech industry in 1993. But before joining Nuance, he worked at Philips Speech Processing, Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies and the University of Technology Aachen. He holds degrees in mechanical engineering, computer science and a PhD in computer science. Stefan?</p><p>STEFAN ORTMANNS, EVP, CERENCE INC.: Thank you. Also a very warm welcome from my side. I'm delighted to be here in the city today to present our capabilities, our core capabilities and the foundation of our hybrid AI platform solutions.</p><p>Over the next couple of minutes, you will hear a bit more about our strong fundamentals, about our go-to-market strategy. I personally believe that we are uniquely positioned here in this field.</p><p>And when looking at the growth drivers, I see actually 5. Of course, the first one is expanding our strong position in the market, driving disruptive AI solution. And when saying disruptive, you will see it later on.</p><p>The other one, for sure, is helping our OEMs creating rapid AI prototypes that can be done in the prepackaged way or do-it-yourself, so that we can also accelerate here the deployment cycle for the OEMs becoming more and more important. The other one is another important aspect. You know that we have built over the last 2 decades a strong network of partners. We are still expanding this, and you will also hear more about this.</p><p>And the last one is actually operational efficiency. Sanjay already mentioned it. I think we need to lift this cost envelope, which is actually outstanding for R&amp;D. We are investing much more, but we need to do also this transformation that we can put more investment into novel innovations and, on the other hand, reducing the costs. And we just announced also that we have a new offshoring site, a big one in Pune. So you see that we're doing also here is the right steps for being innovative and driving also costs.</p><p>You have seen in the video clip at the beginning that we have actually a great year in 2019. We paved the way, actually, for Cerence in an excellent way. What you see here are the numbers from last year, 2019. I think this is very impressing, having more -- almost 130 SOP cars. That means cars -- new cars with our solutions on board.</p><p>Overall, we did better than the market. Roughly 47.2 million, 48 million of new cars shipped worldwide are using pieces or the complete solution from Cerence. And what you see also here, we see also a huge appetite for hybrid speech solution in 2019 fiscal year, roughly 600 million.</p><p>And now compare it with our Q1. We had a fabulous start here, almost 40 SOPs. That means year-over-year, plus 40%. Twelve million new cars in the first quarter in our fiscal year. When looking into the details, you see 9 million are more on the edge side. So advancing edge computing is all embedded, running on the head unit. And hybrid, that's the connection, it's between edge and cloud versus so-called smart arbitrator in between. And when just looking at the 3 million, that's a year-over-year growth of roughly 75%.</p><p>You see also here, and this is even more important. Last year, fourth quarter, 600 million transaction. Now, in the first quarter, we have already almost 295 million transaction. So within the next 2 to 3 quarters, I'm pretty sure that we will hit our hurdle of 1 billion in car automotive transcription. Also, here, we are leading.</p><p>Now looking at the competitive landscape and the go-to-market strategy. Our approach is based on OEM-friendly approach. It's hybrid asset, meaning edge, so what's running on the head unit and in the cloud. This platform is open and flexible and very important also for our lead OEMs, doing with them together joint innovations.</p><p>So -- and then we have a very rich ecosystem via the arbitrator. So we can bring in content. We can bring in the solutions from the big guys here. And our advantage, again, is that we have a global solution. We are just not focusing on the U.S. market or European market. So we are acting as a worldwide global supplier of our solution.</p><p>This is very important also, at least for China, right, where these guys, Google or Amazon, they have no access currently through the Chinese market. And we are collaborating with Alibaba, we are collaborating with Baidu and Tencent. And you will hear more from Charles about this collaboration. And we have deployed already some of this solution with Geely's [side], including cognitive arbitration.</p><p>The other important aspect is that I believe we are superior in the field of edge computing. So we own the complete set, including noise cancellation, very important. We're using this so-called speech signal enhancement technology also for multi-seat use cases, so that you can also interact in the back, for example. And we are going to combine this also as a multi-x solutions, and I will talk about later through this.</p><p>You see here, there are, of course, as Sanjay mentioned, some of the other players. I don't want to say that are niche players, but sometimes they are only visible in China or in the Western world, right? So we have this complete solution and the complete stake, from noise cancellation, wake word -- wake-up word, for example, hybrid speech, in combination with conversational AI and also augmented by emotional AI.</p><p>Our business model is actually based on a high-touch OEM in the operation. So you see here, our philosophy is that the OEM owns the data, owns the brand, owns the consumer and, equally important, owns the business logic, yes? Though we have the say, what will go in or not, right? And we'll provide the complete solution also for the so-called voice interoperability with all the other players.</p><p>Another important aspect is that we are tightly integrated in the head unit, in the platforms. That we have access to the sensors, right, the very sensitive data. And we have also developed new features like Cognitive Arbitration, in combination with Just Talk, meaning we have a conversation in the car, we're talking, \"Blah, blah, blah\" and then someone say, \"Navigate to...\" And the system has the intelligence to say, \"Okay, that will trigger an intent for my navigation system.\" Yes? And for privacy reason, everything runs on zim but the head unit. Nothing goes into the cloud and in real time.</p><p>Before tapping into the core of our hybrid AI platform, let me also share with you some of our design principles, yes? This is actually a brand-new architecture. We call it One Cloud. It goes hand-in-hand with our approach for One NLU and One ASR, meaning we have the same technology embedded, so for edge and in the cloud. This gives us a lot of productivity, scalability improvements, right? We can easily build one domain and then it's available on the head unit in the car and in the cloud, yes?</p><p>Beyond this, what does it mean for the consumer, right? The system has to be assisted, connected for sure. We understood also, for sure, right, and then be productive, be safe and be delighted. So sometimes you need also to bring a bit more fun into the car, yes? And we're doing this also with some of our big partners here.</p><p>You see at the bottom, that's all of our core technology stake, yes? So input AI is everything about speech. Then we have also, on the other hand, text to speech, yes, including natural language generation. All of our technology builds -- are built on deep learning solutions. And we have conversational AI, the complete reasoning, dialogue management, in combination also with emotional AI. And as Sanjay referred to, I think the natural interactions also with gaze, gesture AI, you see a warning light and then you just say, \"Oh, what is that?\" Yes? And you would expect a very good answer from the system here.</p><p>Another important aspect is audio. Here we have also superiority worldwide, as everything is going beyond, actually, hands-free communication, going beyond noise cancellation. You can do kind of [badge] in. You can do also multi-seat intelligence. This is all based on audio AI, in combination with voice biometrics. So the voice is my password, yes?</p><p>Then you see here the next level is the platform level, yes? And more importantly is the middle one, it's all in one menu. You can say whatever you like. And especially with new features and technologies, like Push Talk, you have complete flexibility. You can still say a wake-up word, yes? But I think it's annoying if you say always, \"Hi, Alexa. Hi, Siri. And hi, BMW,\" whatever, right? You would like to have a seamless interaction with your solution, yes?</p><p>And you see also here, what I said at the beginning, we have to help also our OEMs. We are building tools so that they can create their own domains, yes? And you'll hear -- you will hear a bit more from our colleagues from Daimler later today. This can be then easily interoperated with the complete solutions without being a speech expert, without being NLU expert. That's very important.</p><p>And then on the top, we can do this also or in combination with the OEMs. We can bring in our Cerence Drive User Experience, yes? So it's a complete interaction, multimodal, with gaze, with gesture UIs. And you will hear later on also about our prepackaged solution, we call it Cerence ARK. And then at the end, the OEM decides whether they want to create a custom voice with our help to have their OEM-branded -- custom-branded digital assistant experience.</p><p>Coming now to the 5 pillars of our growth story for the core business unit. So what I said here, we are really in a good position currently with all the cars in the market using our technology. Also think about a platform pull-through, right? We have created a solution, and then it's easy to take this solution for the next generation, right? So we have some advantages also then in lead time.</p><p>The other one, I will talk a bit more about our AI innovations. It's going a bit beyond speech. Yes, we're thinking also here about, for example, emergency vehicle detection, yes, in a very cost-effective way for the OEMs. We are using still the same microphones in the car, right? And then we can detect the various sirens.</p><p>Rapid AI development. Prototyping becomes also more and more important to show a fast progress into the car and to the system here. And also here, we have a lot of ideas what we're going to do. You will hear more about Cerence ARK but also about our Cerence Studio later today.</p><p>And then, that's also very important, right, collaborating with these players, with huge players in the market. You know that we have a great relationship, for example, with Harman. We have a great relationship also with a small German digital first-tier supplier called e.solutions, super important for Volkswagen. We are their preferred partner when it comes to speech.</p><p>And then there are also some big players. We have seen maybe the press release from Microsoft that we are the preferred partner for their Microsoft Connected Vehicle Platform solution. And you will see a bit more later on also for another important first-tier supplier, LG.</p><p>And then number five is drive growth internally. As Sanjay said, we have a very strong R&amp;D organization with a real focus on automotive applications, mobility, transportation applications here. And this team tries also new ideas and trying also in parallel to be very efficient when it comes to costs.</p><p>So that's the first one. And what you see here, in short, is -- I mean, maybe you have made your own experience with design and speech solution, yes? We said at the beginning 2014, 2015, the experience was not great, period. Yes? And we had here 2016 our first breakthrough when we launched, together with BMW, the so-called 35up solution. That was a first hybrid solution in the market.</p><p>In the same year, a bit faster, actually, we created for SAIC, who is the head of Banma, a novel solution, together with Alibaba, using our speech technology and NLU solution. And we saw already that the take rate or the retention rate was much, much higher but still not sufficient or, actually, it's still not in a certain range where we could say, yes, it's great.</p><p>Now with our latest releases in 2019. So SOP counts -- these new programs in 2019, you see here a retention rate of 90%, yes? So just think about, you have seen it in the movie, in the videos at TiEcon, these kind of cars, right? So I think we have made great progress also with the help, for example, of one of our lead innovation partner, Daimler, yes?</p><p>You see also here that, as Sanjay said, we need to increase the value per car, the value for the consumers, for the drivers and passengers here, right? We -- our solution is OTA-capable, meaning that we can easily bring in new technologies, new features, new solutions. And you see also that we can easily add more domains to a current solution, right, to make it more sexy and better than in the past.</p><p>The other one is disruptive AI solutions, yes? when comparing us, for example, with the big guys, I would see -- I would say that we are here actually leading with our multi-x solution stack here, multisensor, multimodal, multiseat, multi-assistant solution, yes? We can easily integrate all of the big players here. And we are supporting rear-seat infotainment with speech, for example. We have the cognitive arbitration, the arbitrator, in combination with Just Talk capabilities already launched in China, for example. And here is a focus also on regulatory innovations, meaning, for example, EVD, Emergency Vehicle Detection. To give you also some figures here, currently, our solution is capable of [handling] 400 different silent tones. And we have designed this for 15 languages, including the U.S., including China or the big player, Japan and Korea.</p><p>Another important aspect is, for us, we need to make a system much more intelligent, right? So why not combining some conversational AI with emotional AI, yes? Frustration detection, for example, in the car can also help the car or the user for better assistance and better interaction, yes? And then, as Sanjay already said, Car Life, that's a new product. And maybe I can keep it very brief and short. I think for the end user, it's very important to have a seamless buying experience and a post-maintenance experience, yes? That's actually given.</p><p>And what you see here, we have actually 2 surface here. The inner one is related to a system, yes? How can we improve the system? We have all the OTA capabilities so we can easily refresh the experience in the car, better domains, yes, also optimized and personalized, yes? And then we have here the outer circle, that's related to the life cycle management. As Sanjay said, we have actually 3 phases. The onboarding, in short, is more or less a better salesperson, so it's a better intelligent sales tool. You can also do with this, for example, creating scheduling appointments for a test ride. Sometimes it's really hard for doing this. Then when it comes to the onboarding, the system is more or less a kind of proactive teacher, right? And then postboarding is all about the typical maintenance stuff.</p><p>As said, this is actually our rapid AI development solution. Very important is the new open cloud platform with the new NLU stack and the new ASR. So it's smaller, so much more cost-effective when it comes to hosting, yes? You see here some also indications here. With our new approach, we can reduce costs, yes? And another important aspect, we are actually platform-agnostic. We're supporting more than 25 automotive solutions, for example, Alion, that's from Alibaba. QNX, different Android freewares, right? Automotive Grade Linux is all covered by us.</p><p>Yes. Then, as I said, expanding our partner network and maybe that just play the message here from I.P. Park. I.P. Park is the CTO and President of LG.</p><p>IL-PYEONG PARK, VP &amp; HEAD OF CTO SW CENTER, LG ELECTRONICS INC.: Hello, everyone. My name is I.P. Park. I'm the Chief Technology Officer of LG Electronics. I'm really happy to be part of today's event for a very special partner of ours, because Cerence and LG share the same vision to drastically transform the user experience in the car. At CES 2020 last month in Las Vegas, we introduced 4 levels of AI experience, aiming to share a structured framework for AI technologies across the industries. These 4 levels are: efficiency, personalization, reasoning and exploration, in the increasing order of intelligence. And I call this the AIX framework.</p><p>Cerence and LG have formed a strategic partnership to work closely together on this AI framework, to create use cases and collaborate on developing key technologies. We will integrate Cerence ARK and LG's webOS Auto to build a full-stack infotainment platform for a truly amazing AI-enabled experience, starting with AIX Level 1, to drastically simplify the driver or the passengers' interaction with the car, moving on to Level 2 and 3 for truly personalized in-car AI experience.</p><p>Cerence is unquestionably one of the most innovative AI companies that will transform the automotive industry. And no else can do this better than CEO, Sanjay Dhawan. So congratulations, and I really look forward to our continued great partnership. Thank you.</p><p>STEFAN ORTMANNS: Maybe 30 seconds more here. As Sanjay said, right, we are currently in a transformation process of our R&amp;D organization. What you see here, that was at the last days at Nuance for us, at Cerence, right? You see the focus on innovation was only 35%. Now, a year later, we're already at 64%, which is good, right? And you see here our key focus on the core, yes? We had actually a very scalable, productive and cost-efficient solution for the complete ASR, NLU stick, cloud and edge, right? Then adjacent focus this year on cognitive arbitration, you see Car Life, multimodality. And then we hope that we can also drive much more innovations much faster than within the next few quarters here, yes?</p><p>So maybe I stop here. Just to sum up, for us, is we are really a true partner of the OEMs and first-tier supplier. For us, it's very important that the OEM controls their business logic, and we are enabling them to do so. And with our, let's say, end-to-end hybrid platform, you saw it also this retention rate, we have made significant progress also in terms of quality. So I stop here and open the discussion for questions.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: So we're now available for questions.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: On your Slide #8, when you talked about the retention rate, transactions per user per month, two questions. One is, could you just address in 2019, how many of those transactions were for -- or transcriptions were for cloud interactions versus the embedded? And then the more general question is, do the OEMs -- are they tracking this number? Is this a key metric for them? Do they share your goal of getting the interactions up? Or how important is it to them? And how should we...</p><p>STEFAN ORTMANNS: Yes. Okay. So that's very important. So I think the lion's share goes, actually -- it's a mix between embedded and cloud, yes? Currently, I would say, embedded is a bit dominating, 60-40, roughly, yes? For our OEMs, it's very important to have this information. We have also a so-called tool-like hybrid analytics so they can see, okay, what is working, what is not working. And at the end, they can also think about how they can monetize this data, right? So it's super important for the OEMs. And this is also a big differentiator here. Because when working with Google and Amazon, you don't have access to those data.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Can I just follow-up in terms of, I guess, on this topic, in terms of the domains, it looks like there's many, many types of domains that can be acquired by the user in the car. What are some of the most popular domains? Is it navigation? Is it music? So can you say specifically like, how you're monetizing the [square region?]</p><p>STEFAN ORTMANNS: So the top 4 or 5 domains are, for example, dialing, yes, still a domain. Navigation, in my view, is the most important domain here. And we are supporting here hybrid navigation, unified destination entry. You can actually say whatever you like in a very natural way, yes? Music is a very important one. And you see also the demand for texting, yes, by voice.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And who are like the key partners in navigation and music, the domains that you're...</p><p>STEFAN ORTMANNS: We are here quite open, right? So for example, in Europe, we are using, for example, here -- our TomTom solutions here. In China, it's quite different.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: There's a slide where you talked about the Microsoft partnership. Can you just expand on that a little bit?</p><p>STEFAN ORTMANNS: I think from Microsoft, they have this so-called connectivity vehicle platform recently announced, yes? And they have asked us for providing our intelligence when it comes to speech. And you already know that they have their own solution, Cortana, but they believe that our solution is much, much better, including cognitive arbitration.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: Other questions? Thank you, Stefan.</p><p>So what we're going to be doing now is we're going to be taking a lunch break. So these walls will magically rise. And so you can grab your lunch next door. And we have a few minutes. So if you need the restroom or grab your lunch, that's fine. And then what we're going to do is come back in here, and we'll start around 12:15 with the rest of the agenda. So thank you, and we'll be back in a few minutes.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: Everyone, we're going to be starting up, so if everyone can make their way back in. Watch out. Okay. We have to keep on track. That's my main responsibility for today, so I'm trying to do that. What we are going to do, though, is leave these doors open a little bit. So people who need to get up and stretch a little bit, you'll have that opportunity.</p><p>All right. Our next speaker, we're very excited to have with us and very appreciative of, who's taken the time to travel here, Nils Schanz.</p><p>As Mercedes-Benz R&amp;D Head of User Interaction and Voice Control, Nils was responsible for the Mercedes-Benz User Experience, MBUX, and Hey Mercedes! His team develops the MBUX voice assistant that serves millions of transactions each month around the globe. Nils started to work with Daimler in 2008 and held several leadership positions in product management, in R&amp;D in Germany and Silicon Valley. He helped to build up the digital division of Daimler, including new hubs in Seattle, Berlin and Tel Aviv. Nils made an apprenticeship in computer science and studied international management at the University of Karlsruhe, Germany.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>NILS SCHANZ;DAIMLER AG;HEAD OF VOICE CONTROL: All right. So good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the future of voice AI at Mercedes-Benz. I think the video made one point: tech in the car is all about the interface.</p><p>My name is Nils. I'm responsible for the group at Daimler which develops the MBUX system, our Mercedes-Benz User Experience. Thanks for inviting me today to the Cerence team. It's a pleasure to be here, and I hope I can give you some insights about how we develop our UX at Mercedes-Benz.</p><p>The car you're seeing here is our vision avatar. Our CEO, Ola Kallenius, presented this car at this year's CES keynote, and it's showing the future design language of Mercedes-Benz. Of course, I will not talk about design today, but I wanted to show you one thing. If you look into the interior of this car, there is just 1 single control element for steering everything in this car. There is no more gas pedal, no more steering wheel, no more buttons, no more switches. Just this one. And you can imagine what kind of a major role voice AI will play in the future design of our cars if you look at this.</p><p>And yes, as seen in the video, right, it all began with literally a wooden stake as the first human machine interface. And we went through generations of generations of dashboards to a fully digital cockpit today, our MBUX. So we have launched that back in 2018. We have developed it together with Cerence, and it's now in thousands of cars already available. You see here our EQC, fully EV car we have launched last year. And of course, the highlight is our voice assistant, Hey Mercedes!</p><p>What is MBUX capable of? So first of all, it can be updated over the year. We are doing this constantly. We serve customers with new services and updates when it's needed in different markets. Second, we see MBUX as part of the IoT. Means we have integrated third party solutions, services and a lot of content, and we are doing this constantly during the time. Third point, it's based on artificial intelligence. So we are learning of the behavior of our customers, how they use the system, what they're doing, what they're asking for and can do proactively suggestions to them in all the different domains.</p><p>Another point is, we have a powerful chip from NVIDIA in the system. We have the best graphics, so our customers can experience their car in 3D renderings real-time in the system. So that's pretty unique. We are the only ones offering that, and we are pretty proud of that. Of course, it's easy to use. And as I said, you can talk to it in a natural way like you would do it to your friends.</p><p>And this is how we actually see the whole game, right? Let's take the industry view here. Our device is the car. Our platform, you can also say the operating system, is MBUX. And on top of that, we built our own voice assistant, Hey Mercedes! So if you compare that to the industry view -- let's take a tech giant, let's take Apple. The device is the iPhone, the platform is iOS and the system is Siri. We see it exactly the same way. And this shows to you that we have our own strategy here, means we are not looking for third-party solution or an out-of-the-box solution. We develop our own ecosystem, our own system here, and we need it customized and being a perfect fit for our brand and our portfolio.</p><p>Looking at that, that was an S-Class we have launched 1996. So basically, we have been pioneering in voice. It was the very first car in the industry offering voice recognition, and our customers were able to initiate a phone call out of their S-Class. The funny thing in this year that we -- exactly this year in 2020, we'll launch a brand-new S-Class again, and it will be fully packed with innovation based on voice AI. We are currently developing that together with the teams of Cerence, and we will launch it later this year.</p><p>Why is voice so important for us? And why do we focus on it? And why it's a focus area for us? You see it here, right? So customers say it's much easier to search for information, to find products, it's much faster. And maybe the most exciting one, and the most interesting one is the last one. So we are asking our customers over the last couple of years, every year, what is your favorite input HMI methodology? What do you prefer most when controlling your car? And since 2019 last year, it's our voices assistant, Hey Mercedes! So our customers around the globe, say, it's more important than a touch display or a button on the steering wheel or a touchpad or whatever. And we see this basically in all major markets. We see this in the U.S., we see this in China, we see this in Germany, in Korea and so on and so forth. So somehow, this world is changing, and it underlines and confirms why we have focused on that a lot over the last couple of years.</p><p>And of course, you can talk to it in a natural way. So via keyboard activation, Hey Mercedes, the system is up and you just talk like to a human. And this makes it so strong. So imagine, you're on a drive with your family, searching for a restaurant. Family's hungry, your child don't like sushi, but you want to have an Asian restaurant. You can just say, \"Hey Mercedes! Drive me to an Asian restaurant but not a sushi one, which has WiFi and is child-friendly.\" So imagine, you have to type that in on a keyboard on your touch display while driving. I would say it's almost impossible. At least, it would distract a lot. Our system is capable of doing that, such complex queries. And somehow, our system is so unique and very powerful of doing that, and our customers are loving that.</p><p>What are the challenges when it comes to in-car voice control? And what is the reason why we need special partners here? Some of them is, of course, noise and cross-talk. So noise is coming from the engine, from wind, from people talking in the car. So it's pretty tough to make it a great experience with -- in these conditions when developing that. Of course, it was mentioned before, sometimes you have limited connectivity, right? Our system is also running embedded and in the cloud, as mentioned before, and can perfectly interact in the 2 worlds. You have limited embedded resources, of course. And always, cost is a factor when it has to become automotive grade and you have to have the ability of updating it. And this is actually where we think Cerence has really the power and the unique know-how expertise to support us here. There are not that many players who can help you out with all of these points on this slide. And we have made very good experiences here with Cerence together of handling that. Because each and every car model is different, right? So the position of the microphone is different. We have convertibles, we have SUVs. And to make this a premium experience and that it really feels good, feels premium, feels luxury, you have to really focus a lot into these topics to make them happen.</p><p>What else? Our highlights of our voice assistant, which are -- which is on the market since 2018. Of course, NLU, I mentioned that the system is also capable of handling non-native speech. This means that for instance, a customer from China coming to the U.S. can still control the system in English with a Chinese dialect. The system is capable of understanding that. And it's super important for us because the system is used around the globe by a very, let's say, international customer group.</p><p>Another highlight is the recognition of the passengers. So we know whoever is talking in the car. So it means if the co-driver is saying, \"Hey, turn on the [massage,] \" we know it's coming from the co-driver side and will only turn on the [massage] on this side. This is also a great feature. Our customers love that because then we can really answer the queries very direct and very to the point.</p><p>Indirect speech is another highlight. So it's enough that you say, \"Okay, do I need an umbrella tomorrow in New York? Or hey, I'm freezing. I'm feeling cold.\" The system understands that and is capable of giving an answer here.</p><p>And better than cloud, I said that already. And then very important point, in my opinion, is the interaction between graphics and voice. That's also quite a challenge to make this a really premium and luxury experience. Voice output, at the same time you're showing something on the display, add some value or some information there, which our customer need. I have brought you one example here. And there you see also how much we go into the details when we develop together a new domain. This is ski weather. So if you are on the, on a trip to your favorite ski resort and you ask for the weather or for the ski weather forecast, you will not get -- not only get voice output with all the information. We have also the graphics on the display with a lot of important information, like, I don't know, the last snowfall, how many lifts are open and things like that. So you see it's not only offering the weather. It's making this experience when a customer is asking for weather really the best. So we go into the details. We add a lot of information. We make it nice that it shows beautiful and is joyful to use also.</p><p>Another example I brought to you is, again, our EQC car. So here, the idea is, okay, how can we make an EV journey for our customer best? And you see here, with these use cases we are supporting, you have to deeply integrate into the EE architecture of the car. So you need the AD, the safety domain, the comfort domain, the body control of the domain and, of course, the EV domain. And our assistant is connected with all these domains. We have all the interfaces, right?</p><p>This is an example showing you that a third-party solution would never be capable of doing that, right? I mean, the customer can easily say, \"Hey, I want my car ready tomorrow and charged to 80% and please precondition it.\" Things like that. I mean, there, you need all the interfaces in the car, and you need a very, very deep integration to make this a great experience than inside the car, and of course, also outside of the car, because our customers can only remote -- also remotely control their car via mobile app. So if I do an adjustment here via voice in the car, of course this should be reflected in the app as well. If I do it in the app, then the system should respond correspondingly and saying something to that. So this kind of interaction between the car, between the outside world and then going specifically in all of these domains, this is a very specific thing where we think only we can develop that.</p><p>Another strength. I mean, this is also one of the main reasons why we partner with Cerence is to create language support. So it was mentioned before, our system right now is available in 23 languages around the globe. And of course, that's super important for us because we are selling our cars around the globe, right? A Mercedes, you can sell almost everywhere, right? And we have many, many markets, which are super important for us, like Korea, for instance; like China, for instance. And of course, there, it's important to support the local dialect, the local languages. So alone in China, we are supporting 4 different dialects. Our customers can talk to the system in Sichuanese, in simplified Cantonese, in traditional Cantonese and in Mandarin. We're the only one doing that, and our customers love it. Because they feel, okay, they buy a Mercedes, and it's really customized for them.</p><p>I brought one more example. This is our smart Home domain. It's not yet live. We are currently developing it, but why I brought the solution is to show you how we developed it. So first of all, this domain will allow our customers to control their smart home from their car. And you might wonder, \"Hmm, why is Mercedes doing that? I mean there are other players out there which are pretty strong in the field, right?\" But what we see now is there is a big interest from smartphone aggregators, from smart device manufacturers, to integrate into our ecosystem of Mercedes. So they don't say, \"Okay, we are in Alexa. This is all our customers need. They are pretty interesting -- interested in getting into our cars so that our customers from their Mercedes can control their smart home.\" We will launch this domain in a few weeks. And for the market start, we will have the big players in the different regions available, like in China, Europe and the U.S.</p><p>And the interesting thing is here, how we developed it. So we use Cerence Studio. That's a powerful tool where we can customize our voice AI. We can train our own NLU models with our customer data specifically for this domain. And this is very strong, right? Because the question is always how can we differentiate to our competitors? And they are super important for us that the way the system is talking to our customers or the way a customer can talk to the system when it comes to the dialogue, that this is Mercedes-Benz specific. And this tooling here allows us, that we do it for our own, so my teams are developing that. With the support, of course, from Cerence and with the tooling from Cerence. And then it can be easily integrated through this tooling into the cloud and deploy it to our customers.</p><p>All right. So you see how, with the application of voice AI, we are shaping the future of mobility at Mercedes-Benz. To the benefit of our customers, we are doing this today with the strong support from Cerence, and we will continue to do so in the future. And with this, I wish you a great day. Thank you very much.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: Okay. Thank you, Nils. So Sanjay is coming back up to the stage. We're going to have a little fireside chat session, where Sanjay will engage with Nils with some questions. And we will also welcome questions from the audience. So you could be thinking if you have any questions for Nils, now would be a great time. Sanjay?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: Thank you. Thank you, Ritch. Nils, firstly, thank you so much for joining us on this great day. And I know many investors here in this room and others, were really looking forward to kind of hearing directly from one of our key customers. So thank you so much. I know how busy you are. I know how busy our joint teams are. And Nils talked to all of you about this new S-Class that's launching soon and the SOP dates are right in front of us and taking the time out from your busy schedule to come here. We really appreciate it. Thank you so much.</p><p>NILS SCHANZ;DAIMLER AG;HEAD OF VOICE CONTROL: Pleasure.</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: Let me start with asking you about your views on, now that you've worked with Nuance for many years and now that Cerence has spun out into an independent company, what changes, if any, do you see over the last 5 months?</p><p>NILS SCHANZ;DAIMLER AG;HEAD OF VOICE CONTROL: I mean, first of all, here, I think that it's making total sense, right, to focus only on automotive. I think this is the right direction to go for. It will help you kind of in prioritizing. And we feel that already when we are discussing our programs and our future strategy, right? It's somehow that we are speaking in the same language here. And so this is one thing. On the other side, I see that since Cerence was founded now, there is an even more and strong direction into becoming a software-driven company, an AI-driven company, right? You underlined that several times here. And this is what we are feeling. And last point, maybe, it's good that you joined, personally. And others in the leadership team, with kind of the start-up and Silicon Valley background, this helps a lot because we have to be super-fast when developing our programs. Customer needs, requirements are changing every day. And there, we need a partner which can really adjust together with us. We need a partner, and I'm saying partner, right? I'm not saying supplier or something. So this changed a lot. It's not that we asked Cerence for something and then we get something back in a few years. Our teams are mixed up. They are working together on a daily basis, right? They are somehow sitting together in the same locations sometimes. And there, we have to be really fast to adjust to that.</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: No, totally right. I think just to share with the group here, the -- as we work on the next-gen together, we're co-locating in Berlin, right? And we won't -- you won't -- you can't tell the difference between Mercedes-Benz engineers and Cerence engineers because they're co-located. Same thing right now Stuttgart, where we try to kind of be very close proximity to do our core customers so that we can kind of work in a very agile fashion, right? Can you talk a little bit about what role do you see the Apple CarPlay and Android autoplay, right, in a MBUX experience?</p><p>NILS SCHANZ;DAIMLER AG;HEAD OF VOICE CONTROL: We are, first of all, offering Apple CarPlay and Android auto, so it's nothing where we against -- so customers in all our car lines, not only with MBUX, also with the previous systems, they can buy Apple CarPlay. So we are selling it to them, and it's good that it's there, right? And we think that the customer should choose then the best way for him or her how to control the system. But what is interesting here, since we have launched MBUX, of course, we are looking into the data on how many customers are using it, actually. And there, it's not that much. So we're seeing around 5% to 10% more or less of our customers using CarPlay and Android auto together. But of course, it's depending a lot on the region and on the market. So it's completely different in the different regions. But overall, it's around 5% to 10%. So it means, at the same time, 90% are still using MBUX. And so somehow, this gives us, right, that a fully integrated solution where you can control almost all domains in the car, which is a luxury and a branded experience, former seat dispense. This seems to be still something our customers want to have and they like.</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: Right. I think I was standing back there and thinking about some of the use cases that you shared with the audience here. I mean, those are absolutely not possible if you have a pure phone in the car, especially the electric vehicle example that you shared, right? I mean there's -- and that's one key thing that our platform interfaces would integrate with almost 200-plus sensors in the car. And in those use cases then get enabled because of those sensor integration, which a phone just can't do it, right, because it's a different device, right?</p><p>Let me ask you 1 or 2 more questions, and then we'll just open up for the audience, if anybody has any more questions. There is -- what are the key considerations that you have in evaluating edge or connected services in a best fit for Daimler's goals?</p><p>How do you evaluate kind of which domains, what services and if there are any new areas that you think, both Cerence, as a company, we should focus on?</p><p>NILS SCHANZ;DAIMLER AG;HEAD OF VOICE CONTROL: I mean there, the most important question is always that whatever we develop, what we come up with, I mean there should be value -- added value for our customers. So we do not just develop because it's, I don't know, a new topic or something where, I don't know, someone is recommending a start-up to us or things like that. So there should always be a value for our end customer when we launch a new service, a new product or integrate content. That's the first thing. And then second, of course, it should be fitting into our portfolio and to our brand. So there, we are also really looking at, okay, what will help us to make this luxury experience even better one. And last but not least, of course, there should be a business case behind. So we are not doing that just for free. We want to make money at Mercedes, and this is why there must be a business case behind that, of course; and then, of course, to really serve our customers in each and every market specifically. So there are different needs in China than in Germany maybe. And this is super important to consider that. Talk there to our local teams, look into the data, look into what customers want, what they need, what they like to use and then develop on top of that.</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: Of course. Makes sense. It's -- as we talk about car becoming more and more autonomous, how do you think the user experience is -- architecture is going to change in the car? And what's your view on -- as a road map, we as a company are looking at combining kind of a bunch of other multimodal interactions. How do you see some of that kind of getting adopted in an autonomous and nonautonomous mode?</p><p>NILS SCHANZ;DAIMLER AG;HEAD OF VOICE CONTROL: I mean, multimodality is for sure also a key area where we focus on, right? We have some stuff already in the car, and now with the new generation of the S-class, this will be even more. And so there, we will combine several things together.</p><p>Autonomous driving, I would say that right now is a very hot topic. And this is my personal opinion now, very hot topic. I think in 5 or 10 years, maybe in 10 years, it will be somehow a commodity that all car OEMs in specific areas will have that, that in a specific area, this will be used.</p><p>And what is then, again, making the difference? This is the question for us. And there, we think the user experience in the car is again key because there, we can differentiate to others. There, we can reach our customers, and our customers will enjoy or will not enjoy the experience in the Mercedes-Benz cars. And of course, what will change then in AD is that people will have more time in their car, so focus is no longer driving. And there, there will be super, super areas where we can do new business, where we can integrate and develop new services like video streaming, music streaming, gaming, education, productivity, all these new areas. I mean there's a lot of potential to come up with new stuff.</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: Right. That makes sense. Perfect.</p><p>NILS SCHANZ;DAIMLER AG;HEAD OF VOICE CONTROL: Thank you.</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: All right. Let's do some Q&amp;A.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: We'll open it up, but please wait for a microphone so that the people here in the webcast can hear.</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: Yes. We have a overflow room as well, which is full, and the complaint during lunch that I got was that the Q&amp;A, please use the microphone so that they can hear the question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: A question regarding a slide you put up with this visual data as well as audio data for the ski mountain. How do you connect to get the data? And is it different for you versus if I use CarPlay or Android auto?</p><p>NILS SCHANZ;DAIMLER AG;HEAD OF VOICE CONTROL: I mean, first of all, the graphics you've seen here, we're developing in-house, so at Mercedes. So my teams are also developing these graphics, and then we are just looking at, okay, what is the use case about? Does it make sense for this use case to add graphics, yes or no? So we have also pure voice cases where we say, okay, a graphic would not add value. So it's depending on the use case. And then, I mean, we are just combining that, right? And the parts of it, as I said before, is running them embedded in the car, parts of it in the cloud when it comes to integrating data here. But we have to make sure that also without connectivity, both worlds are still -- work together and that still something appears on the display, which makes sense, right? So this is kind of the way how we do that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And how do you choose a service provider for the data between the edge and your cloud?</p><p>NILS SCHANZ;DAIMLER AG;HEAD OF VOICE CONTROL: Depending also on the data. Let's take, for instance, navigation. So there, in our system today, a customer can input destination also without connectivity. It means there is a database also running embedded. But then when it comes to cloud and there is connectivity, we will add even more data and choose then the best picks, right? So I don't know, we have, for instance, integrated the Yelp ratings in our system. This will only appear if you have the cloud connection. If there is no cloud connection and we will recommend a restaurant then without the Yelp ratings in this case because there, it's coming from the cloud. And of course, the data and the storage resources embedded are limited. So with the cloud, it's always the better experience. But we make sure that at least a basic experience is there where we can say, we help our customers here. And this is also, I mean, comparing it to CarPlay or others, they're not capable of doing that at all.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I wanted to ask about the connected home products. Can you talk a bit about who the key integrations are with there? I mean, obviously, Google and Amazon are pretty big in connected home. Are they white labeled? I mean, is it sort of a direct integration? Like how do you get the data from those players? And will you?</p><p>NILS SCHANZ;DAIMLER AG;HEAD OF VOICE CONTROL: So I cannot talk about the main set because we want to do announcements with each and every partner here, but it will not be white labeled. So customer will -- I mean today, the world is like that. So I have a smart home. I'm using a specific smart home aggregator or a company there, right? And then of course, if I order a Mercedes, I want to integrate specifically this smart home company because I have it at home, right? And so this means that the -- our customer can actually then integrate and do account linking with his provider. And from then onwards, in the car, you will be able to talk to your system via voice. And there, we chose the biggest players in the market. So we focused on the U.S. We focused on China because China is always very specific. And on Europe, and we'll integrate there for the market launch the 3 biggest players, in our opinion, the 3 biggest players then for the market launch. And then, of course, the whole system, the whole architecture is flexible. So we can add more and more providers then in the future.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Could you talk a little bit about how you see the ongoing opportunity for services over the life of the car? And how you -- if you can bound it at all, are you -- is Mercedes going to sell the ongoing services and white label with others? Or will there be other brands that come in? And how do you assess the willingness of the consumer to pay. I mean, how much money is available over a 7-, 8-year lifetime value of a car? I'm just trying to get a sense of -- because there's lots more that I think Cerence wants to do with you, but I'm trying to understand how you view the opportunity with your customer base.</p><p>NILS SCHANZ;DAIMLER AG;HEAD OF VOICE CONTROL: I mean, it's a focus area. So we have really 1 department at Daimler right now focusing exactly on that. So how can we, during the life cycle, add more services and make money out of it. And there are different ways, right? We sometimes integrate a service, completely white label it so that the third party is not at all existing. We are just using their technology or their data. Then there are areas where we do it together. And same what I explained right now is true with Cerence, right? There are areas where we do it together. So we bring something in, Cerence is bringing something in, or another partner, and sometimes we just completely take over from third party. So I can give you one example. So in the next days or weeks, we will launch Amazon Music in our cars. And there, I mean, we fully integrated Amazon Music so that with the voice assistant of Mercedes, you can control Amazon Music in a Mercedes-Benz car. Of course, we have not adjusted now the Amazon Music experience because it's good as it is. We just take over from Amazon, implemented natively in our car, so that then our customers can control it within -- without plugging in a smartphone. So it's depending on service by service. It's depending on what the expectation of the partner is also. And then there are sometimes ways where we find together or not. So this is basically the way, yes? But as I said before, when it comes to the integration of third-party content and new services, we also want to have a positive business case at the end. So it's about on our side or sharing with the partner, so it's both. Same is true for the data, by the way.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Could you share or maybe describe what's been your experience with Cerence's professional services team, whether it's I guess the level of integration, the types or duration of projects, the expertise Cerence is bringing that you don't have in-house or any other aspect, I guess?</p><p>NILS SCHANZ;DAIMLER AG;HEAD OF VOICE CONTROL: I mean, there are several stacks in the technology where we have not the know-how in-house at Mercedes. We are building it up not in every area, but we are building it up constantly. So we also have a huge area focusing on software overall. We are hiring hundreds of people there, have new locations and so on. But there are certain areas we will not enter, right? And they're clearly on the Cerence's side now in this case. ASR, NLU, these are things we will take over from their side. The challenges I talked about, right, with noise cancellation while driving and things like that. This is an area where we do not have the expertise in a way like Cerence is having it. And there, we clearly partner up with them and take over. What is important to know is that in all our cars worldwide, we have Cerence technology included. So there's not one car, not one market where we don't have that. And the experience with the professional services is quite good. So this is something where we saw a big improvement over the last couple of years and also now since Cerence became an independent company. So our teams are literally right now working together. So we have them in Ulm, we have them in Aachen, we have them in Stuttgart, we have them now in Berlin, and they are teaming up there. Same is true in China, same is true in Korea. This means really, they work in one Scrum team together. So a PO for a domain like navigation; there is one PO from Cerence, one PO from Daimler, from my team. And they partner up, have their development team and develop this domain for each and every market with the local teams then. So it's really hand-in-hand. This is what I meant. It's not longer, \"Hey, can you do this?\" And then we get something back. It's really pretty agile and pretty flexible and really hand-in-hand.</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: I'll add a little bit to it. I've been in auto industry for a very long time and I consider Mercedes-Benz, you guys, to lead technology in the car. For many, many years, you have done that and you are doing it. I obviously can't talk much about the new S-class. Let me tell you, I'm buying one because it's just absolutely amazing car, right? So the reason I'm saying this is because what this means is that in this partnership with you, Nils, and Mercedes-Benz, you guys drive us hard, because you drive us to the edge of kind of what's possible and basically because you want kind of leadership in the industry. And there are times when it's tough. But you know what? We love it internally here at Cerence because what that's doing is it's helping our products become better and obviously kind of making sure that we are the leading edge and so on and so forth. So that's kind of my view of how the pro services teams, et cetera, are working. And Prateek will tell you, it's -- we're burning 24/7 right now, right? As you know, right, 7 days a week, that's the mode that we are in to kind of get the new cars out.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: All right. Last question?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: You talked about Cerence being in every Mercedes-Benz car that's shipped globally. Can you talk a little bit about how SoundHound complements Cerence and why you decided to have both of them in some cars versus others? If you go to the SoundHound website, they talk about Mercedes as being a platinum partner and stuff like that. So just curious how the two intersect.</p><p>NILS SCHANZ;DAIMLER AG;HEAD OF VOICE CONTROL: Yes. This is what I said before, right? I mean Cerence technology, first of all, is in all our cars. So it's embedded in the software. Our software model in the car is purely Cerence worldwide. And then when it comes to specific markets, we add here and there cloud-specific solutions. There, we have SoundHound, for instance, in the U.S. market. We have some domains where we collaborate in China with Baidu today. And this is also the strategy we have, right? We want to partner with the best solution or the best company, offering the best solution market-by-market. And if there is a specific need in Korea or Japan, there might be a better player then. This does not mean that we stick to Cerence. We look at it, do a benchmarking on our side, see where is the biggest motivation, where is the best quality coming from, the best content and so on, and then we decide. But embedded, for the moment, it's worldwide Cerence. We think they have many, many advantages in this field. And we don't see other players like SoundHound right now being on this level.</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: If you know the auto industry deep well, the -- there is always a blueprint -- the term that's used, Nils, in your -- in our industry is blueprint partner, right? So the sole sourcing means kind of giving away the pricing negotiation also. There, let's just be very open about it, right? So it's always going to be and competition always makes us, all of us, better as well, right? So we're happy to kind of compete with whether it's SoundHound or anybody else.</p><p>All right. I think we're out of time. And so once again, I want to thank you, Nils, for joining us.</p><p>NILS SCHANZ;DAIMLER AG;HEAD OF VOICE CONTROL: Sure. You're welcome. You're welcome. What a pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: Thank you, Nils, and thank you, Sanjay.</p><p>Okay. On to the next section of the agenda. And that's going to be with Charles Kuai. So Charles serves as Senior Vice President, Greater China region. Prior to joining Cerence, he had held similar roles at Nuance. And previously, Charles served in a variety of roles in the Internet communications and telecommunications industry globally. Charles has held many senior level positions, including CEO and President of Ubee-AirWalk, a fast-growing global wireless networking company; Senior Vice President and General Manager Asia of ADB Holdings, a global media solutions company; General Manager, Wireless at Ericsson, formerly Nortel, Greater China, a global telecom networking company; and Executive Director of Technology at AT&amp;T, a global telecom operator. Charles has completed his MBA and graduated with distinction from Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management; and also holds a dual Bachelor Degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Southern Methodist University.</p><p>With that, Charles?</p><p>CHARLES KUAI, CORPORATE SVP &amp; PRESIDENT OF GREATER CHINA REGION, CERENCE INC.: Thank you, Ritch. Good afternoon. Can you hear me? Okay. Well, thank you, Nils. That was a very inspiring talk. And so far, I hope everybody is having a good time. It's hard to talk after lunch, so I'll try to make it interesting.</p><p>Cerence has been in China for a decade. But before I talk about Cerence in China, I want to just leave a couple key points about why China is so important in the automotive industry. I think Nils touched upon that. Number one, it's the largest auto market in the world. It is about 1/3 of the world market. And actually, it started the rise during this last czar. So about a 20-year period, it became number one, almost twice the size of the United States. The second data point I want to share with you is, China is the most fragmented market in the world. So you have about roughly 30 OEMs globally competing. Inside China, there's 90. So every OEM has a partner, so that's already 60 plus about another 30 EVs. So there's -- that's about 90. As I said, we've been in Greater China for a decade. We started going direct in 2009 through a small acquisition of an R&amp;D team, that was actually the Motorola speech team. And over the course of about 7 years, this is where we actually started penetrating into the speech, but none of it was really great end-to-end user experience, which is what Stefan talked about. Our opportunity came in 2015, 2016. At that time, we've identified that in order for us to succeed in Greater China, we have to partner with the largest OEM in Greater China. That's SAIC Motors.</p><p>SAIC Motors is 25% of the Chinese market. They operate under the brand of General Motors, Volkswagen as well as MG. And during that time, there was -- so SAIC, because they saw themselves at 25% market, they couldn't see themselves growing to 50% market. So they decided to actually resurrect and advance their indigenous brand, which is MG, or in China, it's called (foreign language), but they needed to find a very unique advantage in order for them to disrupt the European players. The largest European player at that time in China was Volkswagen. The hottest-selling car was Tiguan. So they've identified Internet car or digital car is their entry. So we've partnered with SAIC Motors. They have formed a joint venture with Alibaba called Banma, that was the world's first Internet car. I would say that is probably the world's first end-to-end usable, delighting experience for a digital car. Actually, that car became the #1 selling SUV in China. And then, it wasn't even ranked in the top 5. And then we -- I point a little bit more detailed review of that, what we found out something interesting. The consumer car market from -- in China was going from pre-born in 1980s to post-1990s. Post-1990s, these kids -- or kids, we could call them kids, I can call them kids. They are young people that were born with an Internet. So to them, a definition of a car or pre-1980s is very different. And they are the rising consumer base.</p><p>If you fast forward this, another rising star is Geely Group. Geely Group is a lead shareholder of Daimler now. They've actually bought Proton. They've just launched Lotus. So Li Shufu, the Chairman of Geely, decided, \"You know what, SAIC can do it, I can do it, too.\" So he formed his own subsidiary called ECARX and actually deeply partnered with us and basically used a very similar playbook of SAIC and advanced another end-to-end user experience. And this has become, in 2019 -- so this slide is a little bit -- scoot it to the right. In 2019, the hardest, fastest-growing domestic carmaker in China.</p><p>We've also partnered with leading device companies, whether it's Huawei or Xiaomi, for us to be actually local. So if you look at Greater China, we've had 3 phases. Phase 1 is operating like a western company in China. Phase 2 is a very important phase, which is One China strategy. We are effectively considered a local company. And as you know, as the world is becoming a one world, two systems, that has played an advantage to us because they want to deal with one global player, but they want a player to be actually localized to be able to meet their demands. And then down here, it just highlights a lot of the innovations, the patents that we've filed.</p><p>And also, another very important part that I want to highlight is the cloud. We have -- in our cloud, that's just 30 domains, but we have 1,200 AI expressions, which means that you can use it more naturally.</p><p>Another thing that we use China for is what I call an incubator market. Because it's so fragmented, the number of cars are so high, it allows us to have a really sizable market, a continent for us to experiment, innovate agile in areas of car life cycles, new business models as well as stretching our technologies. And I'm going to introduce in a second, ARK, AI Reference Kit. So if, imagine what we just talked about from MBUX, which is a great car, great experience, Banma is for SAIC, Geely is GKUI, suddenly, all the remaining 60 companies wanted the same thing. But we can't really scale that fast. So we decided to actually create a fully packaged solution end-to-end. It's an end-to-end product, which is what we call the ARK.ARK is -- ARK has a cloud, has an edge and a client. A client can sit on the head unit. He can sit on the mobile devices. And edge is actually embedded into the car itself.</p><p>Why is that important? Well, it's important because every car maker may have their own needs. So each one of those building blocks can be on a stand-alone. You can have an edge car that actually operates without cloud. We've launched that in Indonesia, actually, with SGMW, the hottest-selling car because Indonesia doesn't have really good 3G, let alone 4G, communication. You can also have it between a client and a cloud, whether it's a head unit or a smartphone or a combination of all.</p><p>This is the diagram of what this cloud and edge and client is, okay? This is our architectural diagram. But what does that mean for us in China? We're able to actually aggregate navigation from not just one map company, but multiple map companies. In China, there's at least 2, and there are some foreigners. This is a very important part, cognitive arbitration. We've actually connected our platform, end-to-end platform, to the leading virtual assistance in Greater China. The same thing can be portable outside of China. As I said, we used China as an incubator for the rest of the world. The third thing is the cloud app. Every carmaker wants to have their own cloud ecosystem. They want to be able to leverage the data and monetize future services. So this is a very OEM-friendly solution. And last is what I call car control, okay? This was actually invented in China where you open your sunroof, but it's now become global. And this is deeply integrated into the car. And this is why we launched ARK Edge, which is basically an ability to take our small footprint edge and put it on a basically a real-time OS. That means the car can be born with voice. The car doesn't have to be upgraded to voice.</p><p>Another thing is, because the consumer market is so digital, we actually started thinking about new ways to personalize the car, new ways to personalize the journey, new ways to personalize the product. And one of the things with the advances of our algorithms and our cloud technology, we were able to take some of the neural networks advancements to be able to create what I call commercially graded deployable voice clone. That means you can have the virtual assistant with your own voice or in the voice of a loved one. And it's a highly desired feature because this is pretty common in China. In all the maps, you can actually create your own voice or a celebrity voice. It gives you a better user experience, and it actually enhances attention. So if my daughter tells me, \"Daddy, please pay attention to the road\" is very different than a standard Cerence's virtual assistant telling me to pay attention to the road. So this is where we see some advantages. We've actually launched this with SAIC, which is another lead car company customer that we have, but the application is wide. The application could be when you send a message -- so I have my daughter today. She has an iPhone. She sends me messages. And after the emoji messages, she records a voice message. So I was like, \"Well, wouldn't it be interesting if the two are combined into one?\"</p><p>The second thing is the journeys of the car itself. Imagine your child is crying and you're reading a story, wouldn't it be great if the storytelling is your wife's voice to calm the child down? Also in that, we also thought about other areas of expansions in terms of voice clones. So I want to play a very short video to explain to you the concept. It's a little bit easier to see a video versus just the slide.</p><p>Can you play the video, please? Sorry, it's in Chinese, but it's dubbed.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>CHARLES KUAI: So as you capture your voice or voice of a loved one, imagine this, it can go wild in terms of its application. But it's not only it's personalizing, but it actually allows you to basically say, \"My car, my voice. Basically, I'm able to customize with all the various applications.\"</p><p>We have a very strong position in China. A decade of experience in Greater China, allowed us to be strong in 3 specific areas: number one, global brands such as Daimler and BMW and Audi. We are a one-stop shop globally. We talked about that earlier in Sanjay's presentation, Stefan's and Nils', they want to deal with one-stop shop. But they also want to have very localized solution, deeply, rapidly integrated, agile and connected to that local market because they have local languages, local Internet ecosystem, local flavors, local usage cases. Imagine, a BMW driver in China, average age is 35; in Germany, it's 55; in the United States, it's 45. Clearly, a 35-year-old and a 55-year-old, their needs are very different. So we're able to provide that because we've got a very large R&amp;D, fully integrated organization supporting that. Second thing is the Chinese brands have decided to disrupt the foreign companies, the foreign brands. They've defined digital car as one of the key, if not the key differentiation. So they're all-in out in this. And with the needs to expand, they're looking at export market as one of their major growth drivers, okay? And then we'll show you some examples of this a little bit later in terms of a quick video from one of our most successful launches we had succeeded in. So we decided to take what we've built in China, as I described, in terms of ARK. And I said, is that thing portable to other markets? Or is it unique to China? So we didn't know, right? So we said, is it applicable to Malaysia, to Indonesia, to India, to more markets? And we're very pleased that it's been very successful in all of these 3 markets. And then the last one is, although we are primarily focused on automotive and transportation, we also, in Greater China, we deeply connect with the mobile IoT device providers. And we actually support their needs in virtual-assisted voice globally. So that's another area of growth for us. I described this thing a little bit earlier in terms of 2 lead domestic car conglomerates have decided to go all-in for digital assistance and digital car. One being SAIC, and they formed a joint venture with Alibaba called Banma, powering all these brands, and they are going overseas. The other one is ECARX. ECARX is a predominantly owned company by Geely, minority share by Baidu, okay? And they are powering cars across all their portfolio, whether it's a Volvo, Proton, SAIC and Geely domestically. So we recently won an expansion with them into Europe. So that's been another successful partnership. We work very closely, like Nils described in Daimler, very similar model here with these 2 lead partners handing -- our people actually sit in their site. And we actually codevelop and co-come up with road maps, very much the same way as Daimler works with us. We work very closely with these 2 very strategic partners.</p><p>One of the highlights for 2019 was India. India is the fastest-growing car market, growth rate-wise. And as many of you know, India is a very tough market. And SAIC bought General Motors assets in India, billions of dollars. And they went all-in as digital car being the key differentiator for them to actually enter into this market. And I'm happy to report to everybody that this car has become the hottest-selling car in India. When Sanjay visited me in China, the CEO of SAIC informed him that we have a waitlist in a car. And actually, a second-hand car, after you buy it, it sells as a premium. So that's -- in a fossil fuel, I think that was the last time it happened was Mazda Miata. So we are very happy with the partnerships we created with SAIC. And there's a very short video from MG's CEO for India. He wanted to share his experience and also highlighting what is MG Hector.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>CHARLES KUAI: So we're seeing a lot of those emerging markets actually leapfrogging the, what I call, the Generation Y connected car into a pure digital car as a key differentiation. Because of the market size in China of 1.5 billion consumers, 24 million vehicles, we are also advancing our R&amp;D in collaboration with Stefan and Prateek to advance into computer vision and other modalities, voice, physical buttons as well as touch, SaaS. And we also are expanding into the full mobility solutions in transportation industry, cruise ships, as an example, 2-wheelers. We're actually just launching a 2-wheeler, which we'll be announcing very, very soon, with one of the lead consumer electronics brands in Mainland China, right? And there are others like trucks and boats and school buses, et cetera. So the market application for our technology plus its adjacent technologies and creating an end-to-end user experience is quite wide. And this is the area that we're going to be focusing on in the future as well.</p><p>So in summary, today, for Greater China, Cerence is a voice technology leader. Tomorrow, which we have already started, is voice plus AIoT. When I say AIoT, it means other modalities, computer vision, et cetera. Today, we're focused on what I call new car launches. Tomorrow, we will continue expanding new car launches, including what we call the entry-level so that it won't have a screen. The car will be a smart speaker as well as existing cars. Cars that are in the market, how do we actually enable a much more end-to-end life cycle with the car? Today, our revenue is linked to per car, and then we are actually also expanding into SaaS. Today, our market is predominantly in China, for Cerence China, but we -- as you can see, we've already taken this team to expand for our Chinese partners globally.</p><p>So thank you very much.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: Any question for Charles?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I was wondering if you could talk maybe about some of the geographic-specific competitors and maybe how your market share lines up versus what the company's overall market shares have been stated at.</p><p>CHARLES KUAI: Okay. When you say geographic competitors, so the way we see Greater China is there is a complete decoupling of the market with the United States. So we don't see competitors like Google, Facebook, Amazon. They don't exist. But we do see, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. And the strategy of coexistence is not a strategy in China. It's actually rolled out. So we are actually operating, for example, with SAIC on Ali's OS -- Alibaba's OS, Aliyun, connected deeply into Alibaba's ecosystem. We are partnering with Daimler, for example, or with ECARX and connected with Baidu's cloud, okay? So that's a coexistence. We have one what I call indigenous competitor that's another Internet-based. It's called iFlytek. Okay. iFlytek is -- you could consider it as a Chinese version of Nuance. And I'm happy to report that iFlytek had 2 very, very large customers: one being Geely and the other being SAIC. They happen to be convinced and have started completely using our technology. So we feel very confident in that space.</p><p>In terms of market share, because it's -- as you know, in China, there's a tremendous fragmentation. It's hard to have an exact number. But I'd say it's more than 50%, 60% for sure, okay? The rest, there are smaller players. There is, as you know, China has decided to peg AI as a high national strategic initiative. So there's lots of small start-up companies in that space. So that's, in summary, where we see the competitive landscape for us in China.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: No more questions? Okay.</p><p>CHARLES KUAI: Okay. Thank you.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: Thank you, Charles.</p><p>CHARLES KUAI: Thank you.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: All right, moving along. So our next speaker is Prateek Kathpal, Chief Technology Officer and Head of Pro Services.</p><p>Prateek brings more than 20 years of experience in fast-moving and high-growth environments to Cerence, where he serves as Chief Technology Officer. In this role, Prateek is responsible for Cerence's technology vision, core products and product road maps. He also serves as Head of Professional Services. Prior to joining Cerence, Prateek served as General Manager of AI and IoT products at View, responsible for leading product strategy, defining and driving the product road map and supporting M&amp;A activity to accelerate growth. Prior to View, he served as VP of Product and Solution Management at Polycom; Chief Strategy Officer at HighQ; and VP of Product Strategy at Accusof, which acquired Adeptol, a company Prateek founded. Prateek holds an MBA and a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Instrumentation and Process Control.</p><p>Prateek?</p><p>PRATEEK KATHPAL, CTO, CERENCE INC.: Hello, everyone. I'm Prateek. As Ritch said, I'm wearing dual hats. So I'm the CTO for the company, responsible for our product strategy and vision; but I'm also leading the professional services team, which is responsible for our connected experience and delivery. So this is a team which is responsible for going in and implementing the Cerence technology as a part of the cars, works very closely with the OEMs, and this gives me a chance to see where the problems are, where the OEMs and carbon fractures are investing, and then bring it back and implement it as a part of our future growth strategy as well as a part of our product vision, okay? So we'll talk about both of the things today.</p><p>So what we're going to talk about is our R&amp;D team and platform and where we are investing our technology differentiation. So basically, in terms of how we are compared to some of the other technologies out there and what sets us apart with our artificial intelligence platform and our deep learning technology that we have. And finally, we'll talk a little bit about our innovation priorities as we see this fundamental shift happening in the automotive world from combustion engine to electrification to autonomous driving and how we are be -- going to be a part of that whole revolution and how we set ourselves apart as a part of the innovation and growth that we're going to bring in, okay?</p><p>So in terms of -- just sizing, we're about 800-plus R&amp;D engineers and 750-plus professional services team. And this is a team which consists of PhDs and speech scientists coming with a wide background of artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks. And this team has been -- has a lot of experience. As I said, we have more than 1,250 patents. And we keep innovating on them and keep on adding more as we set for the future.</p><p>Now the Cerence platform is one of the largest installed bases in the car today. It's a stack of edge and cloud, which you have heard several times today. It's a stack which can run in both -- individually in edge board, which means embedded in the head of -- head unit of the car or in a cloud mode when the car is cloud connected or even in a hybrid mode when -- where both of the technologies can coexist. The automatic speech recognition over here and the natural language understanding, or NLU, as we call it, is based on sequence-to-sequence-derived architecture. Now what that means is when you are in an environment which is not connected, you could dial in and you could use your local functions much more effectively and faster like a phone dialing or getting -- opening the windows of the car. But when it is a function that you want to do or an action that you want to do, which has some cloud connectivity need with it like getting information from the cloud or turning on your lights at home, the cloud services piece comes in and brings it up together. Now they both can coexist as well. So there are cars where we will go in with a hybrid approach where both of them will coexist, and as Nils mentioned in Daimler, both the things go up in the -- at the same time. And based on -- if it's a good connectivity, the data sets are compared. And whatever is the best, we just display to the user. So with a good cloud connectivity, as Nils mentioned in Daimler session, the Yelp ratings might appear or if there's no connectivity, the ratings -- the data will still appear, but maybe without the Yelp ratings in that case. So again, both of them very much coexist and can work together.</p><p>Now definitely, the edge cloud and hybrid is one of the differentiation over here. But one other cool thing is that you could invoke the Cerence technology in multiple different ways in the car. You could push a button to start it. You could use a wake-up word like, \"Hey Mercedes! Hey, BMW.\" A custom wake-up word, basically. So the OEM can rebrand it to whatever they want. Or you can just use it to just talk. So you could normally be talking as you would and you could just, as a part of your conversation, say, \"Lower the windows.\" And the voice assistant just understands that and does then perform the action. That's one of our innovative cool differentiation features, I would say, that we have just announced.</p><p>Now finally, it's 70-plus languages support. So that's another big differentiator. And someone asked a question about domains. I think one of the biggest differentiation about Cerence is the in-vehicle control. We have a domain apart from navigation or media or phone control and sports. The in-vehicle control really sets us apart. We have those integrations, those actions already mapped out: lower the window, open the sunroof, do certain different things in the car, turn on the headlights, show me back-up camera. All those things are in-vehicle control, which we have already got the actions and dialogue flows mapped out, that really sets us apart.</p><p>Now when you're talking about cloud, there's a lot of data. The data is the first thing that comes up. And we're collecting all the data into the cloud. We're doing about 100-million-plus cloud transactions and 1,500-plus transactions per minute. And this data is just growing from here, right? And this is a data which I feel is untapped potential that Cerence has for the future where today, we're using this data to deep learn our artificial intelligence technology. But what we're looking at is sharing this data back with the OEMs and helping them monetize on this. And this is a data where they can use this data to further improve the user experience within the cars. So definitely a great opportunity here.</p><p>Just to give you guys an idea on the type of the data that we collect. We can tell whether a person in the car is a male or a female. We can tell whether the -- what age group that person is. We can tell whether you have a kid or a dog in the car, what time do you go to work, whether you stop at Starbucks for a coffee on the work. What happens when you are stuck in the traffic? Do you listen to music? Do you get on a phone call or do you simply just wait it out? Whether what times during the day are you distracted? What is your emotional level during different times of the day? Whether you are frustrated at certain points. So we have all this data that we can combine and use with a lot of different potential opportunities that we're looking at as different product sets.</p><p>So we talked about cognitive arbitration and, as Sanjay said, it's about extending your digital life to the car. I have a Google home assistant at home. I use Siri on my mobile phone. I have also got an Alexa-powered smart speaker. The cognitive arbitration is, think of it as a very -- as a rules-based engine which allows you to use any technology that you like or what you're used to in your digital life and lets them all coexist at the same time. So you could say, for example, lower the windows. And in that case, the cognitive arbitration understands it's a local command. I can just go and execute it locally using Cerence technology and performs the action. But you can also say, turn on the lights at my home. In which case, it uses your Alexa profile and passes that action to Alexa to execute that action at your home, Alexa speaker or Alexa lights, and returns with a response saying \"done,\" right? So that's what cognitive arbitration is. And whether you're using a iPhone or a Android phone, bringing that into the car and extending that same user experience across all is one of the other advantages of this. So you'll -- both of the users, irrespective of a full iPhone or Android phone, will get a very similar experience in the car.</p><p>Now when we talk about car, we're talking about a very complex moving object and building a speech technology for the car or building a voice listener for the car is -- gets very complicated because you get into this uncontrolled environment where there's lots of noises, where there's lots of challenges which can come up as compared to when you're in a home environment where the background noise might be a AC or a fan noise, right? Over here, you're looking at a wind noise or engine noise or even people might be sitting in different seats, not directly facing the microphone, right? So Cerence speech signal enhancement technology basically cancels all these noises and reduces the error rate by up to 82%, making it much more effective to have those conversations or to invoke the voice assistant to carry out certain action or command.</p><p>Now how many times it has happened to all of us that we're in a car and we have our kids with us in the car or we have passengers in the car, and we want to simply make a phone call. We want to make a business call or a conference call and we have to tell the kids or the passengers, \"Please be quiet for the next 10 minutes or 30 minutes and let me do this call.\" Now Cerence's speech signal enhancement technology allows you to selectively mute and unmute the participants, mute/unmute the people in the car as you require. So when you're having that business call, you can selectively mute a different passenger or kid. And then when you're having that call with the grandmother when you want everybody to participate in as a family, you can unmute them all. So it's very flexible and allows you to select who you would want to be participating as a part of the other call -- as a part of the call. And the other party only hears what you have invoked as a part of that.</p><p>Now when we talk about Cerence, we talk about voice. It's the first thing that comes to mind with Cerence. But Cerence is much more than that. We are -- we've introduced what we call as multimodality. So as we look at the next-generation human machine interface, it's no longer about just voice. It's about gesture, it's about emotional AI, it's about facial recognition. So Cerence has already started to do some of these technologies in multimodality phase, as we call it.</p><p>So when you are driving on the car, Cerence can help you make your journey much more safer. So using the Cerence text-to-speech technology, we can actually play a voice prompt when you're feeling drowsy or when you're distracted. So instead of just only playing a coffee icon, we can recommend you a rest stop to go back and take some coffee or start playing music automatically, so you can actually come back out of your distraction or drowsy mode. So that's one great example for that.</p><p>And then finally, another good example is bringing your outside world into the car. So a lot -- many times when we're driving, we'll see a billboard or a building that we want to have more information about. Cerence's multimode technology allows you to gaze at that billboard or that building, so you basically look at it and you say, \"What is it about? \" And Cerence's cloud will come into action, find you the more information and bring you back it into the car itself or make a note for you, so you can reference it later.</p><p>So let me show you that in action. Can you please roll the video?</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>PRATEEK KATHPAL: So as you could see, the multimodality uses your -- not only just your GPS, the speed at which your car is moving, the location where you are, but also where you're looking, your gestures, your face, your emotional AI-based techniques to bring all that information together.</p><p>So where do we go from here? Cerence technology today is available in a very light footprint and is very extensible. So we have obviously been playing in the automobile market, but as we look at expanding, we're looking at the adjacent markets now and mobility and ridesharing is one area which is definitely something where we are investing in. Now as you guys go and take a rideshare, wouldn't it be great that you could go into the ride share and you have your personal preferences, automatically transferred from your mobile phone on to the head unit and your favorite music starts playing, right, in that rideshare, during the duration of that rideshare? So those are some of the different areas that we are looking at, at this point of time, along with the personal cars and automotive space as well. And I know Charles talked about cruise ships. That's another area that we're expanding into and doing the POCs, where you could ask the voice assistant, what's the itinerary today for the ship? What are different shows going on? Or even use the cognitive arbitration even from there, to turn on the lights at home or open the garage door at your home. So all those things come up together, whether you are in the automobiles or motorcycles or the cruise ships, and those are some of the areas or markets that we're looking at.</p><p>Now professional services, as I said, was the second hat that I wear. Today, the professional services, as we define at Cerence is basically offering voice integration services, our integration services for the Cerence platform. Now as we expand the TAM for the professional services and improve the margin on the services, we're looking at expanding it beyond just voice integration. So we started to offer services like user-experience design or end-to-end product and testing or validation of some of the other integration services, along with telematics and connectivity. These are the areas which are very adjacent to the skill sets of the people that we already have. So we're expanding beyond just voice to even areas like acoustics testing or best placement of the microphones or user experience validation, or even giving recommendation to the OEMs on how their car is compared to where the market is going or how the adjacent -- the -- how their car is going to be different 2 or 3 years from now compared to where the other car OEMs are investing in. So those are some of the areas we're expanding in.</p><p>At the same time, I think, as I said from a margin improvement perspective, we're taking certain steps where we have opened up our new Pune R&amp;D and professional services office. But we're looking at offshoring some of the roles where you don't need to have all of them on site. As Nils mentioned, we are working very closely for -- with POs and some of the teams on-site as the car is being manufactured. But during the process of 2 to 5 years as the car now goes through a phase of development, there's certain roles which could be done off-site, there's certain core development which could be done off-site and those are some of the areas we're looking at, moving them offshore to improve the margin.</p><p>Okay. So in terms of innovation priorities, we want to penetrate the market with new offerings. So one NLU, one cloud, is definitely one of the areas where we want to go in and create a cloud segment, where we can train the models, create the artificial intelligence for cloud, but also use it as a part of the edge as well. We can learn from the cloud but bring that innovations and learnings into the edge device as well. Do-it-yourself product. A great example for studio mix that Nils of Daimler showed you guys. This is something where the OEMs can pick up our, what we call as our studio or do-it-yourself product and start building the voice interaction, start building the dialogue flows themselves. And then also expanding and building our developer ecosystem is one area where we are looking at.</p><p>For sure, improving the revenue per car is the focus. And we have introduced several state-of-the-art solutions and products, such as the life cycle of the car, cognitive arbitration that we had a press release today as well and ARK that Charles talked about.</p><p>Then finally, the emotional AI, which is linked to the multimodality that you guys saw the video of and voice biometrics. There is -- as we recognize a voice profile and create a voice profile of the users, we feel that the future is going to be where voice-based authentication is going to play a much bigger role. So that's one area where we're looking at, where as cars move towards in-car shopping experience or in-car transactions, a lot of authentication will end up happening with voice. So that's one area where we're investing in as well.</p><p>And finally, for increasing the market share, I think some of the things we talk about as well, is built on the data analytics. We're collecting a lot of data, and that data is just growing from here as more and more cars become cloud connected and come on the road. So our goal is to start building on the analytics solutions and make it available as products for the OEMs, maybe for the end users, and start monetizing on that. Multimodality is one area where we're expanding and then with professional services offerings like user experience and validation services, we'll be going in and investing more over there.</p><p>And finally, as 5G becomes a reality and cells -- cars become the micro cells, we are investing and looking at how connectivity and telematics is going to play a role in that. And this is one area where we're also doing some innovation and is also on our priority bucket.</p><p>So with this, I'll open up for any questions. All right. Thank you, everyone.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: Okay. Heading down the home stretch, but I'm sure all of you are quite interested in it since it is pulling all of the product information, all the marketing information together in terms of what does this mean from a bottom line perspective, in terms of investments, whether you're willing to make in the company or we do as a company.</p><p>So from that perspective, I would like to invite Mark Gallenberger up, who's our Chief Financial Officer. Prior to joining Cerence, Mark served as Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Xcerra Corp. from 2014 to 2018. Previously, he served as Xcerra's Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer from 2000 to 2014. Prior to joining Xcerra, Mark was a Vice President with Capgemini, Ernst &amp; Young's consulting practice. During his 6 years with Ernst &amp; Young, Mark established the Deals &amp; Acquisitions Group, where he was involved in numerous domestic and international strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, alliances and equity investments. Prior to joining Ernst &amp; Young, Mark served in several technical and management positions within Digital Equipment Corporation's semiconductor products group. He holds an M.B.A. from the Kellogg School of Management in Northwestern University and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Rochester Institute of Technology.</p><p>I think it's kind of interesting to note that our CFO is an engineer, our Chief Legal Counsel is an engineer, I'm an engineer. So there's quite a bit -- aside from the rest of the leadership team, which we've already heard about, a lot of engineering people in this company. But with that, I'll invite Mark up.</p><p>MARK J. GALLENBERGER, CFO, CERENCE INC.: Thank you, Ritch. Appreciate that. I was not a very good engineer, so I went into finance instead. So -- but welcome, everybody, and we're coming towards the end of today's presentation, and I want to wrap everything up with you. But one of the key takeaways that I want you to walk away from today with -- as it relates to Cerence, is really this slide here, really talks about the company historically has had a very good growth trajectory. Even in light of the fact that we're part of an auto industry that has low single-digit growth rates, we've been growing 10%, 15%. And so there's a secular tailwind that we have associated with the Cerence story. That's one of the key things that I want you to walk away from today with.</p><p>The other key is our visibility. We've got such a diverse customer base, we've got significant market share and we've got a large amount of backlog. Once we get designed into a next-generation design win, that is not for just one model year. That is for multiple years to come. And so typically, that decision is going to be for a 3- to 5-year platform design change. And so as a result of those decisions, and they're happening every single quarter, we have built up a significant amount of backlog. As of the end of last fiscal year, we were approaching $1.4 billion in our backlog. And the last piece is the company is profitable. We've had about 70% gross margins. EBITDA in the high 20s, and it's been consistent. And so that's really a couple of key takeaways from a financial point of view for today.</p><p>Just to level-set everybody in terms of our business, we've got basically 3 major revenue streams. And you can see on the pie chart, the breakdown of those revenue streams. So when we win a new customer, the first thing that we achieve is professional services. That's the first thing that you'll see as a result of a new design win. And so the professional services team that Prateek leads comes in, work very closely with the customer, works on the integration, customization of our solutions into our customers' solutions and platform. That revenue is recognized more or less on a percent of completion basis. And so that's what you'll see shortly after winning a new design, and that can typically go on from 6 months to 24 months, sometimes even longer, depending on the complexity.</p><p>Once the -- our design and our solution is designed in and our customers release those products -- their products and their vehicles into production, that's called SOP, start of production. That's when you'll see our next revenue stream, that's the license revenue. And so when that car ships, that's when we actually will have a perpetual license that gets activated on that vehicle. And then we take the revenue at that point in time and we also get paid within typically 30 to 45 days thereafter. And if that car is also connected -- okay, not all cars are fully connected, but if that car is connected, then you'll have a connected revenue stream as well. Very similar to the license revenue, with one exception. Instead of taking the entire revenue at time of shipment, that revenue gets amortized over the service duration period. So let's say, for example, a customer wants 5-year connected service. So we'll take that revenue, we'll put it on the balance sheet as deferred revenue and we'll amortize that straight line over that 5-year period. However, we do get the full cash upfront, similar to the license revenue. So about 30 to 45 days thereafter, that's when we get paid the entire cash upfront. So that's just a high-level summary of our major revenue streams.</p><p>For those of you who missed our announcement last week, we did announce our first quarter as Cerence and I'm happy to say that we met or exceeded all of our financial metrics that we had guided to The Street. So you can see on the right-hand chart, how that -- or on the column, how that compares to our guidance. We did not guide specifically for CFFO, free cash flow or the non-GAAP EPS, but you can see how we performed last quarter.</p><p>In terms of the quarter that we're currently in, which is our fiscal Q2, we did guide for sequential growth and year-over-year, we're guiding about 15% up. And then if you look at the first half of our fiscal year, we should be up approximately 11% year-over-year. And that's -- once again, that's in light of an auto industry that has really not shown significant growth over the same time period. So once again, it kind of plays into the story of the secular growth story that we have, and it's really attributed to the fact that the cars are getting more and more digital, more and more connected. So that's really helping us grow well above the auto industry SAAR.</p><p>In terms of the full year, we did provide guidance back in December. For the full year, we expect $321 million to $336 million in revenue. We reaffirmed that guidance last week as well. So we think that for the full year, we're comfortable still with that revenue guidance. However, based upon our Q1 actual results which came in, from a profitability perspective, came in better than expected, we used last week as an opportunity to increase some of our profitability metrics. And you can see how we've moved up our operating margin by about 1 point. The gross margin, we truncated the bottom half and tightened up that range from 69% to 71% to 70% to 71%. The CFFO, we moved that up about $1 million as well and we also introduced the non-GAAP EPS, which is something that we did not provide back in December. But now that we've got a couple of months under our belt, we felt like we should level set everybody on The Street what our non-GAAP EPS would be.</p><p>Okay. Another piece is we are a newly minted public company. So I wanted to level-set everybody on what the opening balance sheet look like. So as of October 1 of last year, the company had $110 million in cash and we had $270 million in debt on the opening day of our balance sheet. The $110 million of cash is broken down into 2 pieces. The top piece is $25 million, in which Nuance basically prefunded some onetime standup expenses that the company will be incurring through fiscal year '20. And so what I want you to really think about is, Cerence really has about $85 million of opening cash because the other $25 million has been earmarked to fund about $20 million of standup CapEx expenses and approximately $5 million of operating expenses. Those numbers may shift around a little bit depending on how much is going to be in capital, how much is going to be in operating, but more or less, it's still going to be approximately $25 million of onetime cash expenses. So you can see that we guided the CFFO to be $43 million to $51 million. Inside that number, we've got modeled about $5 million of the standup operating expenses. And then just below that is the onetime standup related expenses of $20 million.</p><p>This year, it's going to be a little bit heavier in terms of our, what I would consider normal operating expenditures for capital expenditures. And right now, we've got that model, that $15 million. On a run rate basis, I would be expecting approximately $7 million per year. But this year, and you've probably heard Stefan talk a little bit about One Cloud, the architecture, and we're -- that's going to be a key project to make ourselves more efficient and quicker time to market as well, that's going to take about $10 million of capital expenditures this year and that's part of the $15 million. Once that project is complete, which we fully expect to be done by the end of this fiscal year, that's -- so going into fiscal year '21 and beyond, we expect about $7 million of Capex.</p><p>In terms of our mandatory debt repayments, that's about $7 million for this year. Right now, it's amortizing at about 3.5% of the $270 million. Because of the timing of when we have to start the principal repayments, it's a little bit lighter this year than in future years. So even with some of these expenditures that are onetime in nature, we still expect our total cash to be positive for the full year. So free cash flow, clearly going to be positive $8 million to $16 million. That's even including these onetime expenses and our ending cash balance, we fully expect that to be positive as well for the full year.</p><p>So some of our financial objectives as Cerence going forward, comes then to 3 major buckets: revenue growth, you heard a lot about the opportunities today; operational excellence, that's another thing that we've been really focused on, now that we're a separate company from Nuance. We really want to make sure that the company stays very efficient and operationally excellent. And then capital allocation priorities.</p><p>So for revenue growth first. Our key -- some of our key pillars for growth, once again, the secular tailwind. That's the increasing penetration of more and more cars becoming more and more digital. That's the edge and the connected vehicle. Right now, or last year, 59% of vehicles that were shipped had edge capabilities. Only 12% of worldwide vehicles in 2018 had actual -- actually had native connectivity built into the vehicle. These numbers are expected to continue to grow. They've been growing for several years pretty consistently. And we're forecasting these numbers to grow to about 85% on the edge and to about 50% for the connected vehicles. That's going to continue -- allow us to continue to grow well above the industry -- the auto SAAR for the industry.</p><p>You also heard a lot about the revenue per vehicle and how we want to expand our offerings, expand our feature set, and we would expect that as we launch new products and new solutions and add more to the stack, we can sell these new technologies for a higher price. So expansion of our ASP, clearly is going to be one area.</p><p>And then lastly, you heard Charles, for example, talk a lot about China and other parts of Asia, where we clearly want to expand our presence in that area. And we also want to get into new markets, where we can take our model and move it more into a SaaS-like model. Even though we don't have a SaaS model today, some of our revenue characteristics are SaaS-like. And what I mean by that is, we don't get designed into the next year's model, and that's it. We get designed into the next generation. And that next generation, as I said before, typically is a 3, 4, 5 sometimes even longer period of time. And because of that, we get designed in for multiple years, which is similar to a SaaS-type model anyways.</p><p>Let's skip this slide, sorry about that. So just to look at our historical performance and why this secular trend has enabled us to grow pretty attractively, our CAGR has been 12% for the last several years. And so we expect that trend to continue.</p><p>Okay. Switching to the operational excellence. You've heard some of the BU leaders today talk a lot about what they plan to do with their businesses. You heard Stefan talk about transforming R&amp;D. Instead of being so R&amp;D-centric, we want to move more towards a product- or solution-centric model and really focus the R&amp;D activity to really deliver products quicker and more efficiently. We did establish recently a global development center in India. That's going to enable us to lower our overall cost of delivery as well. One of the other things that we're doing is we're using some other offshoring activities, such as I believe in the Ukraine, we're doing activities to basically help augment some resources that we've got local with our customers but to augment those resources with lower cost resources in other locations.</p><p>In terms of the professional services, we want to come up with more prepackaged solutions, things that don't have to be reinvented every single time. And that allows us to be more efficient in terms of that service delivery model. And so that's going to be another key area for us to continue to improve upon over the next several years. And then having technical centers, specifically for our pro services.</p><p>And one of the key areas for our connected business is the One Cloud architecture. Today, we have a, more or less, a single monolithic structure and we're moving that towards a more modular architecture, something that allows us to be more flexible and increase the time-to-market by a factor of 2. That's the project that we expect to do this fiscal year and that's going to be about the $10 million in capital expenditures that we've got for this year. So as we go into next year, certainly, 12 months from now at the latest, we'll have that project complete. So that project is already underway. We've already started it and within a year, we should see some gains from those activities.</p><p>In terms of our capital allocation. First and foremost, we want to continue to leverage our cash and our balance sheet to fund organic growth. Fund all the innovations, fund expansion into lower-cost regions and invest in One Cloud. So first and foremost, that's really what our strategy is as it relates to our capital. We want to make sure we fund our investments organically first. Of course, we're always going to be looking for ways to accelerate our growth or ways to expand into markets that make logical sense to us. Those would be strategic investments and we would evaluate those as those opportunities arise. But our clear priority as a company is grow organically. That's how the company has been able to grow for the last several years, and we think we've got the talent base to do that organically. But it's always good to look at other opportunities outside the company, in which we could actually complement or accelerate some of our own investment activities.</p><p>And right now, because of the debt that we've got, $270 million, any sort of excess cash that is not going towards funding investments, whether it's organic or inorganic, we want to use that excess cash to accelerate the paydown of our debt. One of the other things that I'm personally looking at is refinancing the existing debt. Right now, it's a pretty high interest rate and so I'm looking to see if we can find other alternatives that will allow us to significantly lower net interest expense. And so right now, I think there's opportunities to at least gain $5 million in interest expense savings. And so we'll be very focused on refinancing that $270 million in debt.</p><p>Okay. The infamous Slide #13. So this is the target model that we've put out, and we've given it a lot of thought internally. We met several times the last several weeks and with the BU leaders, and we think that because of all the things that you heard today as it relates to new products, as it relates to getting into new markets, as it relates to expanding our revenue per vehicle, we believe that we could grow our total top line from where we are today to about $600 million by fiscal year '24. That translates to about a 15% CAGR off of last fiscal year's results, which were $303 million. And we've also broken it down into these 4 revenue line items. Our core business, which is license, connected and pro services. That's what we deliver today and that's where we think the growth is going to be going forward.</p><p>I actually got a question over lunch. Someone read ahead and asked me, \"Why is the connected only 12%, because that seems like it should be a higher growth business for you, especially as more and more vehicles get connected?\" And so what's happening on the connected line is for many of you that already know about our legacy connected business which is actually declining, that's already factored into that 12% CAGR. If I adjust out the legacy business from these numbers, that 12% actually grows to about 16% CAGR. So when I'm looking at our new platform and our new connected business that actually is going to be the highest growth driver for the business going forward. So right now, it's showing 12% but if you adjust for the legacy and how that's declined -- slowly declining over the next several years, it's actually 16%.</p><p>We think that we can actually grow the gross margin line as well. Last year, it was 71% and we believe it's going to grow to about mid-70s. And a lot of that's going to be driven off of improvements in pro services margins as well as the connected margins. Connected margins, we've got modeled at about 65%. And today -- or last year, I think we were at about 55% total gross margins for the connected. And we do think that with some of the R&amp;D efficiencies, moving into Pune, leveraging other low-cost resources in places like the Ukraine, we're going to be able to get more R&amp;D efficiencies down in the OpEx. And so we're forecasting some margin improvement there.</p><p>And at the end of the day, EBITDA and CFFO. Historically, EBITDA and CFFO have been very close to one another. But for this year and for next year, because of the legacy contract that we've talked about in the past, that's been a cash flow headwind. Once we get through this year and next, that's going to flip and deferred revenue will now then be a source of cash again. And we also are expecting that by the time we get to fiscal year '24, we'll have generated enough excess cash to pay down the debt. So that will be also a significant improvement to our CFFO. And that's why we expect EBITDA and CFFO to be approximately the same.</p><p>So let's talk.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: Any questions for Mark?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mark, can I just ask about the cash flow? So as you pointed out, as you -- that legacy contract, as that rolls off, that will be a use of cash for the next 2 years and then it flips positive as a new contract comes in. Can you offer any more granularity about the price per car for say the old contract relative to the new contract? How many more cars we should be thinking about coming into that new contract, such that if the pricing is different, you maybe make up for that? Just any more detail you can give there will be helpful.</p><p>MARK J. GALLENBERGER: Sure. Sure. Yes, the legacy contract and just to level-set everybody, there is a legacy contract that Nuance acquired through an acquisition that they did back in 2013. And it was a -- what I would consider a one-off type of contract. It's not the way the typical model is today. And so there was a lot of, I would call, content-rich tied into that one contract. So it had very, very high ASP. And it was actually with one customer, that's why we call it sort of a one-off because it was a single customer. But it was a significant revenue and a significant cash driver for Nuance. Now that contract is nearing its end and so the billings have come down, and it's going to ultimately go to 0 next year. So this year is the last year in which we're going to have billings. But because of the amortization of the revenue, we still have to have the deferred revenue flow through the P&amp;L for the next several years. I think it's through fiscal year '26, would be the last year in which we would actually have revenue flowing through the P&amp;L. So that's just to level-set everybody. That's really what the legacy contract is.</p><p>The new contracts are not nearly as lucrative as this legacy one. Most of the content is actually sourced directly by our customers now. And so that's why the ASPs are quite a bit lower. We haven't said specifically because it isn't one customer, in particular. We don't want to disclose the exact amount. But it's a pretty significant drop in terms of the ASPs. Now the good news is the new contract is not just with one customer. It's with a whole series of new customers that are driving this business for the new platform and the new connected business. So that's really how -- but until -- we still need to ramp up the new customers as the legacy contract is trailing off. And because of that, the decline in the legacy business, okay, relative to the increase in the new business, there's a disconnect. And so that's why you're seeing a use of cash for the first 12 to 24 months, but then things will normalize again and deferred revenue will then become a source of cash again.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: Yes. If I could just add this, the other part of that, that we don't have experience with yet is the potential for the renewals, right? You may [be promising] (inaudible).</p><p>MARK J. GALLENBERGER: Yes, because a lot of these contracts are longer-term in nature. And so we don't have really any experience at this point in time. When these service contracts roll off, what's the renewal rate going to be? And so that's a TBD, quite frankly. But we do fully expect that some customers are going to come back and say, \"You know what, I want to renew 50% or 60%, whatever that renewal rate will be.\" And that will be another opportunity for us to add to that recurring revenue line because that would truly be something where it's not just tied to that car that ships, it's going to be tied to a car that's already out there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: That long-term guidance, for that 12% guidance for connected, like how much of that is from the legacy contract, which waterfalls in, I think you said through fiscal '26 versus the new billings that need to come and then waterfall into that as well?</p><p>MARK J. GALLENBERGER: Yes. So the growth on that is going to be almost entirely new because at this point in time, for the legacy contract, we're peaking the revenues. This year and next year, it's going to stay about flat. I think we've said publicly, it's about $63 million for this year and next year. And then you'll see a decline through fiscal year '26. So there's really no growth at all as it relates to the revenue for that connected. It's all going to be new connected customers.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: Other questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: On the legacy contract, why is it -- what's the alternative for that legacy customer if you're saying only 50% or 60% renewal? What's the alternative? They -- are they not signing on to your existing services?</p><p>MARK J. GALLENBERGER: They're signing on to -- the way they're doing the content is different than what the original contract was. And so the content now with new connected contracts, the OEMs will source that content directly. And so that's the key difference. So it's not that they've gone elsewhere, it's just that the whole model has completely changed.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: Just to clarify, are you asking about the transition from legacy to new? Or what happens to the legacy, for example, that don't renew?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: The latter.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: The latter? Yes. So that's his question is the latter. So in that case, there are cars that are no longer on the road that have been on the road for a period of time. Or there are cases where the customer isn't subscribing to having those connected services on an ongoing basis. Therefore, the OEM will not continue to offer them. And so they wouldn't renew that with us.</p><p>Anyone else? No other questions? Wait, go on. Here we go.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Just to confirm, there's no need for M&amp;A in these targets? And then what is your assumption on that car market size unit growth? Is it flat over this time period or what?</p><p>MARK J. GALLENBERGER: Yes. So the first question is, this is strictly organic. And so there is no need for us to acquire any businesses to hit the $600 million target. I think we can -- based upon our current roadmap and where we think we'll be taking our business, we don't need to augment or to -- augment our resources to hit that -- hit these targets. So if we do M&amp;A, if it's an existing business that has revenue, that would just be additive to this, okay?</p><p>Second question was?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Auto market unit growth.</p><p>MARK J. GALLENBERGER: Auto market. Yes. We just basically are looking at IHS forecast and so forth. And I think it's probably in the low single-digit growth, maybe 2%, 3% over this 4-year time period. So if that auto industry stays flat from where it is today, you probably shave 2 points of CAGR, off of that 15%.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. And then OpEx as a percentage of sales, I don't see much improvement with revenue doubling?</p><p>MARK J. GALLENBERGER: I think there was improvement here. So if you look at the operating margin, we're currently at about 24.5%, okay? And we see that grow to about 33%. So that's about 8-point improvement, 9-point improvement over that same time period. Now relative to this year, okay, and it's probably something I should have highlighted, for fiscal year '19, it's still part of Nuance. Now that we are a separate independent company, we had to reset the model for FY '20. And so that's why we lost about 5 points of margin because of public company costs, CEO, CFO, we got an IR person, D&amp;O insurance, we have our own Board. And once you add up all the costs, it translated to about $17 million of recurring costs that were not built into the fiscal year '19, while we were still part of Nuance. So that's why we lost about 5 margin points here. And then as we grow the business and we get some efficiencies, we think we can recapture those 5 points plus a few more.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: Next question, please?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: For the license revenue, the 12% 5-year CAGR, I think we can look back at this last quarter that, that year-over-year number was negative, and there was some noise there with the prepay versus the variable. So can you maybe just talk us through how to think through that impact and what the look-through effects are?</p><p>MARK J. GALLENBERGER: Yes. If you look at -- you got to first look at it holistically in terms of our license, so -- because we break it down between our variable license and our prepay. But at the end of the day, it's all license revenue. It's just how we split it out because we think that the prepay licenses is basically a fixed block, so we want to make sure that people understand the difference between that and just getting royalty reports from one quarter to the next. But -- so that's why we don't look at it as negative growth year-over-year. We look at the whole picture and make sure that we're still growing. So even though we had prepays coming down, our variable license revenue was actually up year-over-year for our fiscal Q1. But I think if you look at the overall trend line, our license revenue continues to trend upwards. But that's where I think, if you look at the connected revenue adjusted for the legacy contract, that's where more of our growth will be coming from in the future.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mark, as it relates to -- sorry, as it relates to, I guess your revenue, you mentioned that professional services starts out maybe 6 to 9 months initially in the contract. So for like a new technology or a new automobile platform, how long would it take to get to license revenue? Is there a gap between the two?</p><p>MARK J. GALLENBERGER: Not sure if there's really significant gap. How much do you think, Stefan? Do you think you're -- about 4 to 6 -- 4 to 6 quarters? Yes. Okay.</p><p>RICHARD YERGANIAN: Sanjay, do you want to...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: There is one quick one on that, the legacy revenue decline impacted, when will that actually start to turn and start to decline?</p><p>MARK J. GALLENBERGER: It will start to turn in fiscal year '22. So for fiscal '20, it's about $63 million, fiscal year '21, it's about the same, $63 million, and then you'll start to see a decline. All right, thank you.</p><p>SANJAY DHAWAN: All right. So we're coming to an end to the program. And I would like to invite all the speakers here on the stage, please? If you guys can come in. Any last minute, last final questions for any of us, happy to answer that.</p><p>I think a few points that I would like to just repeat on the license revenue line on that slide that Mark had. The clear goal of the management team is to increase the content per car, right? So that plays a very important role in the growth. And so we're very focused on kind of new product launches and so on and so forth. Also, another key attribute was probably noticed that the fourth category of our SaaS, ARR revenue, right? So on a conservative basis, we think we'll get to about $75 million in fiscal '24. So that's another kind of key focus areas for us to kind of deliver the growth to our company.</p><p>So with that, we're at the end. Once again, thank you so much for coming. Any last minute questions before we wrap up here for Nils, for Mark, for Prateek, Stefan, Charles? Anything else, any other parting comments as we close down our first Analyst Day.</p><p>Great. Well, on behalf of all of us, thank you so much for attending. Great day and have a good evening, all of you.

Welcome to Cerner Corporation's 2020 Investment Community Meeting. This is Allan Kells from Cerner Investor Relations, and I'd like to thank you for joining the webcast today. We are sorry we couldn't host this live in Orlando due to HIMSS being canceled, but we did want to go forward with the meeting because we have important information we'd like to share. Some of this information is forward-looking, and this slide contains the risks associated with these forward-looking statements.</p><p>Now I'd like to take you through the plan for this morning. We have 2 primary goals today. First, we'd like to highlight the 2019 successes, including financial results, key partnerships and overall progress on our transformation. I believe a lot of our 2019 success builds on work we started in 2018 as Brent began implementing changes. Then we clearly embraced the opportunity to accelerate our efforts in 2019, which has put us in a good place.</p><p>Second, we'd like to provide an update on our strategy and long-term plan. We spent significant time in 2019 refining our strategy and building a new long-term plan. These efforts have resulted in a more focused strategy and a plan that supports solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion and earnings growth. And we also expect to generate strong cash flow, which, combined with our balance sheet, position us to deploy capital for shareholder returns and investments in growth. I believe you'll walk away from this meeting with more clarity on our strategy and share our belief that Cerner is positioned to deliver profitable growth while also having a major impact on health care in the coming decade.</p><p>Looking at the agenda, our Chairman and CEO, Brent Shafer, will be our first speaker. He will cover several successes from 2019, progress on our transformation efforts and an update on our strategy. These topics will frame the rest of the presentation. Tracy Platt, who joined last year as our Chief Human Resources Officer, will then share how she is supporting our transformation and ensuring we have the right culture and workforce to achieve our strategy. Dan Devers, who oversees Cerner's cloud strategy and drove our selection process for our cloud partner, will share how we approached choosing our partner, the benefits we expect and some early progress.</p><p>We're also fortunate to have Dr. Shez Partovi joining us from AWS. He will share AWS' perspective on why they are excited to be working with Cerner and what they believe we can accomplish together. He'll be followed by Marc Naughton, our CFO, who'll provide a financial update and share our long-term financial targets. John Peterzalek, who is responsible for our client and services organizations, will provide an update on our core business, including marketplace observations, white space opportunities and revenue cycle. Travis Dalton, who runs our federal business, will follow John and provide an update on VA and DoD. Travis will be followed by Don Trigg, our President, who will discuss the areas of our business that make up our strategic growth organization. Art Glasgow will follow Don and provide more detail on our Data as a Service business opportunity. After Art, Don will make a few closing comments and then open the line for Q&amp;A. Please note that you will need to be dialed into the number provided on our website to ask a question.</p><p>With that, I'll turn it over to Brent.</p><p>DAVID BRENT SHAFER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, CERNER CORPORATION: Thank you, Allan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I think most of us -- we were looking forward to some time together in Florida at HIMSS. And certainly, the events that have unfolded over the last couple of weeks are dramatic, and we absolutely support the decision to cancel the conference in an effort to keep us all safe. So glad to be on the phone with you this morning, glad to be together and still have the opportunity to share some of the things that are going on at Cerner and our initiatives in front of us.</p><p>And as we just think about the world situation right now, I'd just like to say that as a company, we're in close coordination with the CDC and World Health Organization to shape both our corporate business continuity and associate safety plans as well as enhancements to our solution to support our clients' clinical efforts. And as I stand here this morning, just to reflect, I think this is my 34th year in health care. And thinking about the mission of Cerner and what we're here to do, I can't imagine a more relevant and more meaningful place to be because we are mission-critical. So those delivering care and in crisis situations like this, it certainly, I think, motivates us all to do everything we can to help and do the best we can to help -- the right care around the world. So -- and we're fully engaged. And you'll hear these initiatives today as we go through the morning.</p><p>So we're certainly encouraged by the broader health care community's efforts to mitigate global risk, and we'll all stay very close to this, as you can imagine. So today, I'll share an update on progress we've accomplished in the past year and previous strategies we put in motion to fuel Cerner's next era of sustainable and predictable growth and with specific focus on the transformation I spoke about on -- spoken about on previous calls.</p><p>So maybe if we take a moment and look back to 2019, I'll start by highlighting several of the more notable milestones in the last 12 months. First and most importantly, the past year included expansion of -- or initiation of many client relationships at the foundation of Cerner's ability to shape the future of health care. One example is the multiyear extension of our agreement with Intermountain Healthcare. Now CHIME-HIMSS recently named Intermountain's Marc Probst as the 2019 CIO of the Year, recognizing his pioneering work in health IT and the successes of Intermountain as a world-class health care system. The success of Intermountain and hundreds of other provider systems we work with each day reflect our company's extensive impact on health and wellness around the globe.</p><p>We also made good progress on our work to modernize the health records for the U.S. Departments of Defense and Veteran Affairs, which Travis Dalton will discuss in more details. And in July, we announced the strategic innovation partnership with Amazon and AWS to accelerate our work in creating a cognitive EMR. Through this collaboration, we'll modernize our core platforms to more rapidly deliver Cerner innovation to our clients, to reduce lengthy testing and upgrade cycles and to return the joy of practicing medicine to clinicians around the world. And this is a key initiative and absolutely needed in the marketplace. And Dan Devers is going to speak about this in more detail.</p><p>So we delivered financial results in line with our expectations, and we recently announced on our Q4 earnings call -- as we recently announced on the call. We made significant progress on our transformation, introduced our new operating model.</p><p>So let's talk a little bit about transformation. Cerner's transformation encompasses 3 efforts aimed at positioning the company for continued success as we enter a new post-digitization era of health care. The operating model reflects a realignment of our internal resources. It creates renewed focus on the success of our clients above all else, and it enables Cerner to more quickly deploy innovation and deliver predictable, profitable growth.</p><p>In addition to the operating model, we've initiated a series of transformative actions to more tightly align our processes with our internal structure. These actions include business simplification efforts aimed at reducing complexity and identifying efficiencies from our R&amp;D investment.</p><p>The third leg of the transformation is a refined strategic focus to extend Cerner's core business and see growth opportunities in adjacent segments of health care and other industries. Our growth strategy involves both organic and inorganic growth opportunities, as you'll hear more about later in the call.</p><p>So if we think a little bit about structure, people and process, we've approached Cerner's transformation through 3 lenses. And those are the 3. The operating model was introduced in early '19 as the structure around which we create internal clarity, [employment] and stronger accountability around our clients.</p><p>From a people perspective, we expanded our Board in April by adding 4 new directors: John Greisch, Melinda Mount, George Riedel and Halsey Wise. These new members are making major contributions to the company, in partnership with our existing Board members. We also added a new Chief Human Resources Officer, and you'll hear from her today. We also added a Chief Marketing Officer. I'm glad to have him on board and helping us move forward.</p><p>Last month, we announced organizational updates, including Don Trigg as President, and expanded responsibility for all business units and also broadened John Peterzalek's role as Chief Client and Services Officer to fully align all aspects of the client experience. In addition to new roles for Don and John, we announced the creation of a new Client Success Office, with Jody Buchman named as Cerner's first Chief of Client Success. This role is responsible for ensuring the delivery and measurement of exceptional experiences to all Cerner clients, leveraging resources from across the organization and new tools designed to enhance our client service model.</p><p>The final component of transformation involves the refinement and standardization of processes governing the development and life cycle of Cerner products and the client service experience. Through portfolio management and other process improvements, we can ensure that we're focused on delivering the right solutions to our clients as efficiently as possible.</p><p>Portfolio management. One example of our process improvement work is the standardization of portfolio management across Cerner. Through this process, we're better aligning Cerner development resources with a more selective group of opportunities as informed by extensive modeling of current and emerging market dynamics. This more programmatic approach to identify market entry and exit points will shape our ongoing core and adjacent market growth strategy.</p><p>Since launching the standardized portfolio management process, we've made several strategic decisions, including: divesting of country-specific assets in Germany and Spain that were not aligned with our core platform approach; exiting the RevWorks portion of our ongoing health IT relationship with Adventist Health; and entering relationships with third-party companies like ResMed, GetWellNetwork and others to integrate functionality from proven best-in-class providers into our core platforms.</p><p>So transformative actions. The objective of our transformation is to identify operating efficiencies through business simplification to make Cerner fit for long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. Across the organization, we've implemented programs to reduce waste, eliminate nonvalue-added work and increase productivity. Concurrent with this effort, we're refreshing our product catalog and introducing new processes for quoting, contracting, invoicing and other components of the client experience to make it easier to do business with Cerner. As a result, we've created new capacity to fuel a set of growth strategies that define our plan for the next 3 to 5 years.</p><p>Others will speak to these in greater detail today, but our plan for growth is captured within these corporate imperatives. First, we must retain and expand our client footprint with specific focus on delivering a world-class revenue cycle product and executing on all our commitments in the federal market. Next, we will modernize Cerner's core platforms and create a next-generation augmented EMR. We will establish HealtheIntent as a foundational enabler of evolving care delivery and reimbursement strategies across MSAs and communities around the world. We will be a category-leading, data-enabled services company. We will recruit and reimagine a high-performance workforce architecture, and we will continue to deliver consistent and predictable financial results.</p><p>Now Cerner is a health care technology company that is uniquely positioned to shape tomorrow's health care. And one example of this is yesterday's announcement by the Department of Health and Human Services, releasing final rules related to the interoperability and data-blocking components as part of the 21st Century Cures Act. And if you know us and studied us, you know that for decades, Cerner has been a strong advocate for all these efforts, government-initiated and privately led, to create a seamless and connected world where everyone thrives. I'm proud to have spoken recently with CMS administrator Seema Verma in support of the rulemaking process, and I look forward to continuing these discussions with her as well as Secretary Alex Azar and ONC coordinator Don Rucker as we move into the implementation phase of 21st Century Cures.</p><p>As a global health care community, we move closer to our vision by embracing progress, encouraging innovation and supporting collaboration in pursuit of better outcomes, lower cost and improved accessibility and usability of technology.</p><p>Fundamentally, we believe health care is too important to stay the same. That is why we ardently support the conditions of certification included in the rules announcement. The API, as envisioned by HSS, already are widely used at Cerner today. Through our many and varied collaborations with third-party developers and others who have used data to build powerful applications, we've seen firsthand that incredible scale and responsible information sharing enables -- what it enables. We look to all health IT organizations to unite around ONC rule to make data exchange an essential part of data -- patients' health care experience.</p><p>I'll now turn the call over to Cerner's Chief Human Resources Officer, Tracy Platt. Now Tracy joined the team last summer from Medtronic, where she did extensive work in transformation and change management. And Tracy will spend a few minutes talking about transforming Cerner's culture and reimagining our workforce. And I can tell you, it's been a great addition to our team, and we're glad to have Tracy with us and glad to have her sharing some (inaudible) with you this morning.</p><p>TRACY L. PLATT, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CHIEF HR OFFICER, CERNER CORPORATION: Thank you, Brent. Good morning. I joined Cerner a little less than a year ago with approximately 20-plus years of experience in the health care industry, with primary experience of the medical devices and distribution. As Brent referenced, most recently joining from Medtronic with a 10-plus-year career there, focusing in multiple market segments and extensively on transformation to enable reinvestment in R&amp;D and margin expansion, with strong experience in workforce architecture and culture.</p><p>You heard Brent cover the strategies for growth here at Cerner around client footprint, cloud strategy and health network as an example that has translated into a strong operational focus to deploy the supporting operating model around these key structural focus areas and in this required workforce capabilities also need to change to mobilize and capture these market opportunities.</p><p>In plotting our strategies into a continuum, we will double down on extending and defending our core business while also expanding capabilities of the cloud with our AWS partner set. We are activating on the additional horizons for growth through our emerging new and future growth businesses, such as health network and Data as a Service. To enable these strategies, I'm going to briefly speak to how we're actively mobilizing the necessary workforce capabilities and cultural attributes to sustainably deliver.</p><p>To illustrate, horizon 1 covers multiple talent segment requirements in order to maximize and modernize on opportunities with our core EMR business. A few of these include federal, cybersecurity and Software as a Service and the corresponding skill requirements as we further expand into cloud capability with our AWS partnership. Overall, we continue to attract and retain the necessary talent with augmentation of third-party skills providers.</p><p>For horizon 2, and drilling down into capability and skill requirements for health network as an example, we have identified and are mobilizing on experienced hire strategies in consumerism, strategic consulting and sales areas for further MSA market potential expansion.</p><p>And in horizon 3, as we work to continue to realize the promise of this with our Data as a Service business as an example, Cerner is bolstering and expanding its data analytics talent capabilities. When looking at the talent pool, it is evident that this is an extremely competitive space, and these are hard talent to find. However, Cerner has a data-rich environment that attracts the best and brightest. And we are going to leverage that and the intersections of health care and real-world evidence-based methods of research, which will provide many satisfying data science problems to tackle.</p><p>We have a strong global workforce in place, and we are continuing to make refinements. We'll do this through key strategic workforce planning strategies that are reflective of each of these. We will continue to double down on building the necessary skill requirements with our existing workforce. We will also, from a buy perspective, continue to deploy experienced hire strategies and applicable inorganic plays. From a borrow perspective, we're going to continue to work with skills partners, such as Lumeris or ResMed, and partnership in the consumer space to augment our talent pool.</p><p>One final area to highlight is related to the innovative and inclusive culture we are actively building and creating emphasis on here at Cerner to continue to attract, engage and retain the best and brightest talent in the world. I wanted to show -- share with you some examples of our early successes and progress, which has come with some exciting recognition over the past year, to include: Forbes' one of America's best places for diversity; and Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies listing. Additionally, WomenInc. named 3 of our Board members to the Most Influential Corporate Directors in 2019. We're proud of these achievements, and we are just getting started on what is possible.</p><p>In close, we have active talent and cultural strategies underway to enable Cerner strategies and market potential. We will bring highly skilled, capable and diverse leaders prepared to lead and partner in the transformation of health care and offer an employment value proposition that in fact retain required talent capabilities to fulfill business strategy requirement. The entire Cerner leadership team is committed to this, and notable progress is being made.</p><p>With that, I will turn it over to Dan Devers to speak with you on our AWS partnership and cloud strategy.</p><p>DAN DEVERS, SENIOR VP OF CLOUD STRATEGY &amp; CHIEF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OFFICER, CERNER CORPORATION: Thanks, Tracy. We'll transition from the people to the technology that will enable our plans. I'm Dan Devers, Senior VP of Cloud Strategy. This is my first opportunity to interact with this entire group, so I wanted to share a bit about my background, my experiences at Cerner. I'm a patent attorney and led the development of Cerner's industry-leading patent portfolio. I've had a legal and business role in starting a number of our new businesses at Cerner, including our CareAware device connectivity line. Additionally, I've worked on most of our large and unique client and industry partnerships and transactions, including our acquisition of Siemens Health Services and the formation of the CommonWell Health Alliance. Most recently, I focused on the selection and negotiation of our cloud partnership with AWS and Amazon. Our cloud partner objectives are all driven by innovation through migration and modernization of our key platforms: Millennium, HealtheIntent and CareAware. We will significantly shorten the time between creation of innovation to productive use of the innovation by our clients, thus getting more out of our substantial R&amp;D investment.</p><p>In the migration and modernization of Millennium, we will provide cognitive EHR experiences to our clients, as I'll describe later and Dr. Partovi from AWS will further amplify. Of course, our platforms will enjoy typical public cloud benefits such as high security compliance, reliability and elasticity. This will provide Cerner with the ability to provide an open platform for advanced interoperability, eventually transition to a Software as a Service business model and allow data science at scale.</p><p>The client reaction to our announcement and early progress to achieve these objectives has been overwhelmingly positive. In addition to the innovations gained through migration and modernization, the partnership with Amazon and AWS will lead to first-of-its-kind innovations in the health care industry.</p><p>With these objectives in mind, it becomes very clear why we selected Amazon and AWS. First, we have a shared vision with Amazon and AWS around the power of IT, and particularly the cloud, to transform entire industries. The health care industry is one that will greatly benefit from the power of the cloud.</p><p>Second, Amazon and AWS have extraordinary assets and capabilities in the consumer space. This is particularly relevant as the consumer becomes more engaged in the management and payment for their care. Consumer engagement is a key priority for our provider clients, and advancing their consumer strategies is critical to our success. Dr. Partovi will also address consumerism and the consumer in his remarks.</p><p>Third, AWS has industry-leading AI and ML capabilities that are very well suited to addressing the challenges in health care and advancing the innovation objectives described before. Finally, the infrastructure and security provided by AWS are market-leading and provide a key differentiation in our selection of AWS.</p><p>We're early on our journey, but we've made significant progress since announcing the AWS and Amazon partnership. I'll highlight a few of those. First, we've migrated the remaining eligible HealtheIntent clients to AWS. Notably, this work was done ahead of schedule and with no client interruption. Likewise, we are on a path to migrate Cerner-hosted CareAware clients to AWS by year's end.</p><p>On the EHR side, in addition to starting the foundational work to migrate and modernize Millennium, we are advancing our cognitive EHR strategy, including the digital scribe alpha prototype that I'll discuss in a moment.</p><p>Finally, additional solutions are migrating to the public cloud, including certain Cerner command center solutions that assist our clients in managing their health system operations.</p><p>As I mentioned before, AWS is important -- is a very important part of Cerner's broader cognitive EHR strategy. Fundamentally, we seek to make data actionable for health care and reduce the cognitive burden on providers. This will greatly enhance the joy in the practice of medicine. As set forth herein, the cognitive EHR requires data capture of voice and a variety of other data types. To make the data actionable, the data requires transformation, for example, through speech-to-text and image recognition. As a result of 40 years in the clinical space starting in the laboratory, Cerner's developed leading-edge ontologies and mappings to leverage this transformed data, for example, to enable intelligence across the entire continuum of care. Finally, these building blocks provide the fuel for Cerner applications to provide the Cerner -- to provide the cognitive EHR experience such as virtual scribe.</p><p>So virtual scribe is one example that leverages AWS technologies, specifically Amazon Transcribe Medical, for the speech-to-text transformation portion of the process. virtual scribe passively listens to interaction between a clinician and patient to identify and document clinical concepts as a by-product of care. This alpha solution eliminates much of the time required for the clinician to document in the EHR and eliminates the need for traditional transcription.</p><p>Building on Brent's comments, from a topical perspective, voice is a preferred mode of documentation in the clean [sterile] care environment required to deal with pandemics such as the coronavirus.</p><p>Building out on intelligence broader than merely cognitive EHR, the cloud is key to machine learning strategies to transform data into health care intelligence. As a frame to how we think about intelligence in health care, we break it down into 4 categories.</p><p>Descriptive intelligence. That describes what has happened in the past. This includes reporting. The second category is diagnostic intelligence that explains why something happened. Traditional analytics is an example of diagnostic intelligence. Machine learning becomes more relevant with predictive intelligence that addresses what could happen in the future. And then most valuably, prescriptive intelligence is what one should do about what could happen. By way of example, decision support could be tied to a predicted condition instead of an actual condition.</p><p>One example of our work with AWS around predictive and prescriptive intelligence is embodied by HealtheDataLab. This solution involves management of a number of AWS services to address a key issue in the space. That issue is that data scientists spend about 80% of their time working on data preparation. This solution allows data scientists to spend more time on mining data for patterns, refining algorithms and building training sets, the important work that they are trained to do.</p><p>Coupled with Cerner's first-mile expertise in extracting and structuring data and last-mile expertise in interjecting intelligence back into the workflow, Cerner is well positioned to execute its -- against this long-standing desire to first, structure, study and store the data to create new knowledge, and then close the loop.</p><p>To provide more color, I'd like to introduce Dr. Shez Partovi. Dr. Partovi is a Senior Leader at AWS for worldwide business development in health care, life sciences, genomics, medical devices and agtech. Additionally, Dr. Partovi has extensive Cerner experience, coming from Dignity Health, where he served a number of roles, including most recently, Chief Digital Officer and Senior Vice President of Digital Transformation.</p><p>I'll turn it over to Dr. Partovi.</p><p>DR. SHAHRAM (SHEZ) PARTOVI, WORLDWIDE DIRECTOR OF HEALTHCARE, LIFE SCIENCES &amp; GENOMICS, AMAZON WEB SERVICES, INC.: Thank you, Brent, for the invitation this morning. I'd love to just dive into what the partnership and collaboration between Amazon, AWS and Cerner is going to advance. You've heard some advanced notice of that from both Brent and Dan. And so let's go ahead and just take a look and see. There's 3 things basically that I would like to tell you this morning about what this collaboration can bring, and I'm going to give</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>basically predict patient health events. This is one of the key elements of the collaboration. And then second, we'll dive into how this collaboration can personalize the consumer health journey. And finally, we'll spend a few minutes and talk about how this collaboration can protect the clinician experience. You heard Brent talk about bringing the joy of medicine back. And so through these 3 lenses, we're going to go ahead and dive deep and talk about how this collaboration advance and bring about a cognitive electronic health record.</p><p>So let's start with the first one, predicting patient health events. So you might say, \"Well, what does Amazon have to say here? How -- what is your right of being in this space and doing this?\" Well -- so you might be familiar with sort of 1-day delivery. We've been doing a long -- we've had a long heritage of machine learning. Because when you think of your 1-day delivery, it's not because we have better ways of delivering things to your door through mechanical means but rather because we can predict which you're going to deliver and actually move it to a fulfillment center closest to you before you deliver it. So these kinds of machine learning predictions have been going on for a really long time at Amazon. When Netflix predicts what movie you like, when Lyft predicts the best path, when Snapchat predicts what channel your millennial family member wants to look at or Expedia predicts what next trip you might want to take, they're all based on these predictions. So what we want to do is bring that to health care and work with Cerner to bring that to predicting patient health events. And we talk about delighting consumers and patients we -- I would like to think we have a long heritage of delighting consumers there as well, Amazon Prime, and Amazon.com, to give you an example.</p><p>So let's take a look together at how that applies to health care, and in particular, with the collaboration with Cerner. So when we talk about moving Cerner to the cloud, it's not so much that we're simply trying to move from one data center to another. That would be a very narrow lens of thinking about this collaboration. What we're really saying is that AWS has a set of core services that we've built and hardened. All those companies I just mentioned, they have been using those services to advance their offerings in sort of the nonhealth care environment. What we've done is wrap these services and sort of hit eligibility, and now we can bring these to health care. And so with this collaboration, what we're going to do, together with Cerner, is take out the undifferentiated heavy lifting, the parts that have no added value to building a sort of a cognitive EHR platform, that stuff that's common across different industries, and then allow Cerner and Cerner's talent and its capital to all be focused on applying agile innovation to the things that make a difference at the bedside, to physicians, to nurses to patients. And so this, together, is bringing the undifferentiated heavy lifting from the parts of AWS that we've hardened over years, combining that with the talent and with the innovation and agility that Cerner's known for -- is what brings forward the cognitive EHR.</p><p>Just to give you an example, we worked together with Cerner, and we said, \"Well, can we predict what patient is going to get a congestive heart failure?\" is an example of this sort of cognition EHR, helping clinicians do the right thing. What we did is we looked at 210,000 patients together, anonymized patient sets, and built a machine learning model that when a patient is pulled up in the electronic health record, they can actually predict congestive heart failure 15 months prior to it occurring. So you have to think of that experience. As a clinician, when you bring up the EHR, the machine intelligence inside the EHR is looking at the data based on models that can predict -- built, providing predictions and insights on the side. These shards of intelligence built directly into the EHR is an example of what the collaboration can bring. And it's about predicting things like length of stay, predicting readmission, predicting admission to ICU. So as the clinicians use EHR, these models will help bring these insights directly into workflow with Cerner, together bringing this to the bedside.</p><p>Now let's turn our attention to personalize the consumer health journey. Now you -- as an example for that, I know we've talked a bit today this morning about voice. You might be familiar with a tool called Alexa. So I'm joking there a bit. But what you might not know that if you take the 2 As of Alexa, you end up with Lex. Lex actually is an AWS service, which means that voice inside that cylinder that you might have, that conversational agent is actually available to be embedded in any software. And so this is an example we're working with the Cerner engineering teams. We want to be able to embed that kind of voice activation inside the EHR, so that the interactions with patients and consumers and physicians, we'll come to that in a second, can be frictionless.</p><p>And so voice is one example of the kind of AI-based services we've built. There are things that help with image, video text, translation services and so on. And so each of those now become available as a set of embedded -- when we talked earlier about doing undifferentiated heavy lifting, these are all the services that can be plugged into that bottom layer that's undifferentiated to allow Cerner to focus on the parts that are differentiating.</p><p>And one last thought before we leave the consumer, you see here about bringing AI-based services to advance consumer experience and patient experience. It was not just AI services. Let's drop the word AI. And if you drop the word AI, you might remember that Amazon itself has a number of consumer-facing assets. And so this is where this think big, which leap off the conventional thinking, what would it look like as you potentially integrate these services, where orders of patients with diabetes that can be fulfilled at Whole Foods. So these kinds of leaping off of EHR and going to the consumer beyond sort of technology are the opportunities as we look at this collaboration together. Right.</p><p>The last thing I'm going to talk about this morning is talking about in addition to these 3 highly protected clinician experience through this collaboration. So let's zoom in on that one. We've mentioned, and Brent did and Dan as well, how voice can bring -- remove friction at the bedside. When you look at that computer icon on that screen, ideally, together we can remove the keyboard and mouse from the example from the bedside, from the clinic and bring about this ambient sense of -- so ambient intelligence. These services we mentioned earlier that advance the consumer and patient experience, well, we have at least 2 today and 1 underway that are directly focused on the clinician, Transcribe Medical and Comprehend Medical, which I won't dive into, but are examples of technology that's prebuilt wrapped with HIPAA services and can be leveraged by Cerner as the sort of undifferentiated heavy lifting to bring a whole set of transformation to the EHR for improving and protecting the clinician experience.</p><p>And the last thing before I give it back to Dan, is if you've ever been to an Amazon Go store, you might know that in the Amazon Go store, there are no cash. There's nobody around. You just sort of scan your bar code when you move in</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>of what you do. This is not just through RFID. It's through understanding the movement of consumers and so on. And now you have to imagine what it would look like with this ambient sensing when you walk up to, for example, the ED digital board. It recognizes that (inaudible). It transforms the digital board to be for what I want to see. And as you move away and the nurse comes, it redirects that digital board to something different. This idea that the environment becomes aware and is interacting with the EHR is the kind of stuff we've done in the consumer space and is again this opportunity to leap off the digital side and go into the real world and bring together sort of the experience that is transformative and what really is beyond what might be imagined today through conventional sort of digital experiences.</p><p>So together, predicting health events, personalizing consumer health journey and protecting the clinician experience are but 3 examples of how this collaboration can transform an electronic health record, the sort of clinical operating system and bring about the content EHR, EMR that Brent and Dan have spoken of.</p><p>Again, thank you so much for the invitation to be here this morning, and I will pass it back to the host. Right.</p><p>DAN DEVERS: Thank you, Dr. Partovi. Appreciate the additional color on your partnership in this regard. With that, I'll turn the program over to Marc Naughton.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, CERNER CORPORATION: Thanks, Dan. Thanks for all you're doing in driving our cloud strategy at Cerner. You're doing a fantastic job. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by taking you through the financial highlights.</p><p>2019 was a very solid year for Cerner. We grew our top line 6%, which is in line with our original expectations. The slide reflects our GAAP results, which were impacted by restructuring charges that we expect to wind down this year. Adjusted operating margins were 18.5% for the year. That reflects delivery of our Q4 target of 20%, which was 160 basis points higher than the Q4 of '18. Adjusted EPS was up 9% for the year, reflecting our margin progress and the impact of repurchases.</p><p>Our bookings declined for the year due to a significant decrease in long-term outsourcing bookings. Excluding this impact, bookings grew slightly for the year. We had solid cash flow and expect 2020 to be a year when cash flow begins to ramp up as we drive higher operating cash flow and reduce CapEx.</p><p>And finally, we deployed $1.5 billion of capital during the year, including $1.3 billion of share repurchases, over $100 million of recently initiated dividends and a small acquisition. So overall, a good year.</p><p>Before I go into the business model discussion of the presentation, I'd like to kind of take you back to '18 and explain a little bit of some -- a couple of some minor change that we've made to the model to really more accurately drive what we see as a contribution margin calculation. This slide reflects the changes we've made and the changes relative to 2018. The 2019 changes are comparable. The main change reflected on the slide is that some expenses related to our SaaS business model, which were included in SG&amp;A in our prior view, have been moved up to more appropriately reflect their impact on the specific revenue stream and arriving in contribution margin.</p><p>The result of this minor change is that our contribution margin calculation now aligns very closely with how many companies report gross margins. So we see that as a positive.</p><p>Now let's go to the 2019 Cerner business model. I'll walk you through the model. This slide gives you the detailed breakdown of our operating margin, starting with what is now basically a gross margin by business model then subtracting R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. I'd like to point out that our Q4 margin of 20.3% was 160 basis points higher than the full year, as I indicated, reflecting the back end-loaded nature of the year. This difference was driven by a higher contribution margin and lower SG&amp;A as a percent of revenue in Q4.</p><p>Now let me walk you through some of the changes compared to 2018. Revenue was up -- for license software was up 11% year-over-year with strong growth in SaaS. Contribution margin was down slightly, but it's important to note that approximately 50% of our total license software is now SaaS-based.</p><p>When we go to technology resale, that revenue was up slightly, and margin was down about 3% year-over-year due to a mix shift with a focus on equipment versus third-party software. Subscriptions revenue was up 10% year-over-year. Contribution margin was down 3% based on third-party costs directly attributable to subscriptions. Professional services revenue was up 10% year-over-year driven by federal primarily. Contribution margin of 24% was down slightly due to higher third-party services.</p><p>Managed services revenue was up 5%. Contribution margin was up to 43% -- or 42% due to cost leverage opportunities. Support and maintenance revenue was down 1% due to past health services client attrition and lower payments revenue. Contribution margin of 75% is basically flat year-over-year.</p><p>Going to the indirect expenses, R&amp;D was up slightly for the year, but SG&amp;A declined about 50 basis points at 13.9%, down from 14.4%. And that arrives at sort of the adjusted operating margin for the year of 18.5%.</p><p>So let me talk a little bit about the visibility of our revenue. Looking at our revenue mix, we continue to have a high percentage of recurring and visible revenue. About 63% is what we consider recurring. And that includes support, managed services, IT and RevWorks subscriptions and the SaaS portion of software, which I said is about half of our software. When you add our professional services revenue to this, about 90% of our total revenue is recurring or highly visible. Note that we do expect our Works businesses to decline as a percent of revenues, especially when the full year of Adventist is out. But this should be offset by growth in other recurring or visible revenue that is also more profitable. Finally, we continue to have nearly 85% visibility into revenue for the year based on contracted revenue that is scheduled to roll out.</p><p>Now at this point, I'd like to take you through the key -- 3 key topics I want to cover today: long-term revenue growth, margin and earnings growth and cash flow and capital deployment.</p><p>So on the long-term revenue growth, just to update to the model that we provide on an annual basis. As this slide indicates, we are now targeting 5% to 8% revenue growth after 2020, which is largely a reset year that we've discussed. There was some confusion during the Q&amp;A portion of our call on this topic. So I'd like to clarify a few things.</p><p>First, the 5% to 8% range is basically the same as what we said last year, adjusted for about 1% of growth that was previously expected to come from outsourcing revenue. Second, I want to emphasize that when we talk about the 5% to 8% range, it does include an assumption that some growth is inorganic, just like our 6% to 9% range did last year. One other change compared to last year is that we moved revenue cycle and ITWorks into core to further simplify the components, which leaves us with 4 key sources of revenue: core, federal, strategic growth and an inorganic component.</p><p>Now let me take you through each element. The model shows core declining slightly over the period, about 1% to 2%. This largely reflects a shift of revenue to new growth areas with the main example being services resources that are moving from core to federal as the VA ramps up. Core also reflects the impact of a mature U.S. EHR market and client attrition partially offset by growth in global and revenue cycle. If a goal is to have a view of total EHR activity, you would need to combine the core and federal components of the graph, which will reflect positive growth. We separate the 2 to provide additional transparency. Note that 2019 and 2020 core declines are highly due to divestiture activity.</p><p>The federal CAGR of about 15% primarily reflects continued execution on VA and DoD, which Travis will discuss in a minute. In 2019, we moved a group of businesses outside the traditional EHR business into an organization we call Strategic Growth. This organization grew more than 20% in 2019 to over $500 million. As Don will discuss, these areas represent over $75 billion of market opportunity, and we think we can continue to grow them 20% organically.</p><p>As the box to the right indicates, in combination of core, federal and strategic growth is expected to drive 4% to 5% organic growth. In addition to organic growth, we have an inorganic component that represents 1% to 3% of the targeted growth. The 1% to 3% inorganic growth is similar to what we had factored in last year and most likely will be focused on the strategic growth areas.</p><p>In summary, this plan reflects a significant amount of work during 2019. We completely rebuilt the plan based on our refined strategy and input from our Board throughout the year and feel good about our ability to deliver it.</p><p>Let's go to operating margins and earnings growth. In addition to have a -- having a more underpinned top line plan, we have made great progress on operating margin. This applies to both our near-term targets and things we are doing to position for longer-term efficiencies.</p><p>Starting with 2020. Our guidance reflects achievement of our Q4 target and a full year operate -- adjusted operating margin of about 21%. There's a 250 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year and reflects the benefit of work completed in 2019 and ongoing work this year. I'd like to emphasize that we believe that this is significant -- there's significant opportunity for ongoing margin expansion beyond 2020, and we are embedding an efficiency and process improvement mindset into our culture and planning process to deliver it.</p><p>As we look at our long-term plan, we believe we can drive an average of about 100 basis points of expansion after the big increase in 2020. This would get us to mid-20% range by 2024. Doing this, combined with share repurchases, would allow us to drive upper-single to low double-digit adjusted EPS growth. The range of margin expansion and EPS can vary based on several factors such as revenue growth rate, mix and the margin profile of any M&amp;A we do. But we think this is a very deliverable opportunity.</p><p>Going to free cash flow and the balance sheet. Clearly, if we deliver the revenue and earnings growth we expect, we'll drive stronger operating cash flow. Based on that and our expectation to reduce capital expenditures as we complete our campus build-out this year, we expect free cash flow to ramp quickly starting in 2020. We expect about $1 billion next year and about $1.5 billion by 2024.</p><p>Beyond this cash generation, even after taking on some debt last year, we ended the year below 1x leverage. So we clearly have capacity that can be used with capital return and M&amp;A. In fact, we took advantage of recent rate declines, locking in $300 million of additional debt at 2.5% for 10 years.</p><p>As I mentioned, we deployed about $1.5 billion of capital last year. We expect to continue deploying capital this year through a combination of returning to shareholders and M&amp;A. In fact, we've already repurchased about $400 million of stock so far in Q1.</p><p>So in summary, we've made significant progress in 2019, which included delivering against expectations, embracing an opportunity to accelerate our transformation efforts and implementing our operating model and portfolio management process to improve our focus and put us on path to higher-quality growth. We have a solid plan for driving revenue growth, strong margin expansion and strong earnings growth. And we expect to continue growing our cash flow and leveraging our balance sheet to create shareholder value through ongoing return of capital and M&amp;A.</p><p>With that, let me turn the podium over to John Peterzalek, Executive Vice President and Chief Client and Services Officer. John?</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK, CHIEF CLIENT &amp; SERVICES OFFICER, CERNER CORPORATION: Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everybody. In this section, I'm going to talk a little bit about the industry, the markets, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., a brief revenue cycle update and then what our 2020 focus is.</p><p>So on the industry, there are several focus areas that are influencing health care today. And these areas shape our strategies around our core business and reflect the strategies or initiatives or things that are embedded in our client strategies as well.</p><p>First, intelligent innovation. Intelligent innovation is the driver behind predictive analytics and AI. And as we look at the growth of big data, it's apparent that taking big data and making it small, data that is small, actionable pieces of information that can help with the clinical outcome, efficiencies, insights, and we can distill this massive amount of information that is out there into digestible chunks. In addition to this, if you look at the more than 20 billion connected devices out there, much of it collecting information about me and feeding that into our health journey, these small pieces of information, along with relevant pieces of information from big data, are the driver behind predictive analytics, artificial intelligence. And the ability to take this is the promise to turn these predictions into actionable insights and actions. As Dan and Shez shared a little earlier, Cerner's developing and have several products generally available, or close to GA, that are embedding real-time, predictive analytics capabilities to the workflows. This is the start of the next generation of capabilities in the EHR.</p><p>Next, the industry is seeking better ways to have better experiences and outcomes. Our clients are looking at ways to improve the health of the communities and to use real innovation to enhance the outcome for those that they serve. So our work in population health and advancing solutions to manage and improve populations one person at a time is designed to address these challenges. We have been driving this for almost a decade.</p><p>We continue to integrate health and social care through analytics, mobility, device integration. And we are continuing to advance interoperability to work across solutions and platforms in pursuit of better outcomes and better experiences. And if you combine all these together, it is what are we using to drive our position at Cerner as the leading platform for innovation in the industry.</p><p>Another key focus area is open and interoperable platforms. Frankly, our industry has not had the best reputation and looked upon favorably for being open and interoperable, whether you're a technology partner, a health provider, a health care system. We need the demand being open and interoperable and acknowledge that the patient or the person owns their data. This has become a public policy issue, a political issue and actually is the cornerstone of our capabilities for work with the VA. Cerner has been fully supportive, as Brent mentioned earlier, of this position for more than a decade. And I believe we are the leader in driving the open dialogue in our portion of the industry. And we are driving to be a platform for health. By default, open, interoperable are always current. We are advancing interoperability, not only to work across our solutions and platforms but the industry as well.</p><p>Cerner continues to have considerable market momentum. We are very competitive in our primary markets, and we continue to add market share year-over-year. No supplier has added more market share in the U.S. than Cerner since 2015. Over 30% of the market we have out there run noncurrent systems. And most of these systems are exploring potential for a replacement. And this is our market opportunity in the replacement space, in that space, where Cerner is considered more often than any other supplier, in the greater-than-200 bed market, which is where most of these noncurrent systems reside. And our platform modernization efforts that we have, not only sustain the path for the now but the next, and it's a clear differentiator for Cerner as we go forward.</p><p>Outside the U.S., we continue to focus on a world-class experience. Regardless of where you are in the world, you should expect to have the same high-value Cerner experience. We will have a consistent experience and provide the ability to innovate and drive your success.</p><p>We had mentioned the recent divestitures outside the U.S. This does not change our position. In fact, it frees us up to focus on the markets that we want to focus on and drive high value in those markets.</p><p>As we've discussed in previous calls, as we look at opportunities outside the U.S., with Millennium or HealtheIntent, these opportunities are generally done not at a single-hospital level, but they're done across the region, a state, a province. So these opportunities take advantages of all the capabilities of our integrated platforms and our population health capabilities.</p><p>The crucial part in why we focus on a world-class experience is that a strong delivery mechanism, a strong reputation, the ability to be consistent opens us up not only for expansion in our current markets but are pivotal in our upcoming procurements that are out there. And my final point, we also have a solution, i.s.h.med, that remains a lightweight and geographically diverse option that every opportunity does not have to be a Millennium opportunity at the EHR level.</p><p>If we look to revenue cycle, our focus in revenue cycle is improving the experience and executing our commitments. We continue to grow in this space with over 56 new client signing in 2019. And we have 49 go-lives, either in process or happened over the last year.</p><p>If we look into 2020, our focus is going to be on delivering and executing. We know we have gaps in some of our solution areas out there, and we intend to close these gaps. So we're going to deliver on our road map commitments.</p><p>We have proven assets, both in Soarian and Millennium, and you'll see us take an invest in both of those worlds and combining them to deliver a high-quality solution around revenue cycle. And as embedded in all of our solutions, we intend to open this solution up through APIs and other areas where we will be a platform company there as well.</p><p>We'll work on enhancing the client experience to make sure every interaction you have with us in our revenue cycle will be a high-quality interaction. And we'll deliver on the promises that we make.</p><p>When you're dealing with systems that are in various levels of financial stability in the health care world out there, where they may not have incredibly strong cash positions, flawless delivery and execution is crucial. So we're going to focus on making sure that we have a hard methodology and every implementation we have is delivered flawlessly. And then finally, post implementation, we'll continue our proactive surveillance, making sure we are addressing and hitting our KPIs and that we are along for the full journey with our clients.</p><p>We still have significant opportunities out there remaining in our core. Our strong revenue cycle and ambulatory growth is converting white space into real opportunity. If we look within our top clients, we have over 400 facilities that are not on a Millennium solution. This represents great opportunity for expansion within our base and further increasing our market share.</p><p>If we look at our existing clients, our existing clients are aligning with us and committing to the future. We had 10 clients in 2019 that contributed over $1.5 billion in bookings through extensions and expansions. Our revenue cycle and ambulatory solution offerings are key, not only in these extensions but key in replacing our competitors as we expand within our clients. And then Don will hit this in his section, but we're pursuing and deepening relationships in adjacent care venues as well.</p><p>So what we're looking at doing in 2020, Brent had mentioned this and we've been speaking about this for the last 2 years, is we are going to relentlessly pursue our clients' success. Brent had mentioned this, the creation of a client success office led by Jody Buchman, and we are going to continue to mature that office. We're going to continue to drive capabilities in this office to ensure that every single client is successful. We talked about providing a consistent and positive implementation experience. We'll still continue on that journey. We'll work with our clients to make sure that we can lift them to our most current versions, so they can take advantage of our most current innovations. We talked a little bit about improving the clinician experience. All on this call have heard about physician burnout, clinician burnout, caregiver burnout. This is something we take incredibly seriously. We need to provide the best experience for the clinicians, the caregivers, the physicians that are out there. And we talked about our revenue cycle road map.</p><p>In terms of growing the business, we will continue to maintain our greater than 50% win rate across our core business segments. We talked about white space. We have great opportunities to turn white space into real opportunity with our clients. We'll accelerate growth through our strategic growth businesses that are a key component of what we do in our core clients and our core business. And then also, as mentioned, we will continue to focus on high-quality revenue as we become very selective about our long-term business that we have out there.</p><p>With that, I'll turn it over to Travis.</p><p>TRAVIS S. DALTON, PRESIDENT &amp; GM OF CERNER GOVERNMENT SERVICES, CERNER CORPORATION: Thank you, John. Appreciate it. Good morning. My name is Travis Dalton. I'm the President of Cerner Government Services, accountable for all aspects of the work we do with government. Been with Cerner for 19 years and been in this role with the CGS since 2013.</p><p>Today, I'd like to cover our program progress with the DoD and the VA. First of all, I'd like to start with the kind of a reminder of the why, so level set on the mission and vision. Primary goal is to enable seamless care across the VA and the DoD with our commitment with community providers. VA and DoD will be in a single environment, and eHealth Exchange and CommonWell will be coming live later this year to connect community providers. The government is also interested in utilizing commercial technology, creating economies of scale with taxpayer savings, the items like the single-item master, workforce management and other tools at scale and innovating with analytics, which I'll talk about in more detail later.</p><p>VA and DoD represents the largest transformation effort in health care, over 18 million beneficiaries, 500,000 providers and 3,000 sites of care. We're making real and meaningful progress, and I'd like to discuss that today.</p><p>In terms of some federal highlights, the DoD has completed their IOC, which is their pilot project. They've had a successful Wave Travis, which is our first Wave go-live last year. And we have 4 waves in process. The DoD is operating at maturity. The VA has a national standard in place, which is a material accomplishment across an enterprise as vast as VA. They stood up a program called VITAL, which is a training program designed to prepare them for go-live readiness. We're going live with our scheduling module in April in Columbus, Ohio. And we've migrated over 23 million veterans health records into HealtheIntent. VA and DoD are also going live with a joint health information exchange in the spring, which is a major accomplishment for those agencies as they march toward interoperability.</p><p>From a CGS, from a Cerner Government Services perspective, we continue to make progress and focus on operational maturity. We're operating at a -- as a prime contractor at scale with over 30 partners. The acquisition of AbleVets was a big help in that as they brought people, process and tools to our prime contractor capabilities. We've delivered on our financial commitments, and we continue and expect to do that forward. And we're focused on stakeholder management, managing the vast number of stakeholders that we encounter, both at the agency, bill, VSO, media influence -- influencer and other levels. Good progress and good accomplishments from last year.</p><p>In terms of our program time line, we're on track. The both programs are moving forward, and joint agency efforts are much better aligned. The VA and the DoD have stood up an organization called the FEHRM, which is essentially a joint program office that's driving decisions, policy and joint schedule efforts, and that's been very beneficial.</p><p>In terms of DoD, they have 23 Waves in addition to their initial operating capability, which I've discussed. IOC and Wave Travis are live today. The joint HIE will be going live in the April time frame. And we have 4 Waves in process at Nellis, Pendleton, San Diego and with the Coast Guard, which we added as a -- added last year. And then Waves 7 through 23 will go live in the 2024, 2025 time line. So we're still on track with DoD.</p><p>With VA, we're going to have 47 Waves plus the initial operating capability. We have the joint HIE going live, as noted; scheduling in Columbus, Ohio as well, which is an important milestone for us and the VA; and then our IOC is in progress. Mann-Grandstaff will be our first site going live in July. That was originally scheduled for March that will going live in July. We're supportive of taking a little extra time to make sure that we're well prepared there. I'll also note that, that does not change the entirety of our time line. We're still on track based on our original schedule, and it doesn't change our IOC time line as that was just capability set 1 for Mann-Grandstaff. So essentially, we move capability set one back by a short period of time, and we're still planning to go-live capability set to in that November time frame in addition to Seattle. And then finally, a major accomplishment for us is we'll be kicking off Waves 1 through 5 as well, which is important for us to stay on schedule, both in terms of program and our financial outlook.</p><p>So how are we going to be successful? It's really important that we are focused in 4 key areas. So obviously, we deliver on program. John mentioned flawless execution. That's crucial here that we stay focused on program delivery. Development of new requirements with the DoD and the VA. An example would be that the VA is leading in terms of their deployment of HealtheIntent. We have the opportunity to go back with DoD and work with them to develop new requirements in order to use HealtheIntent in the same capacity. Leveraging new contract vehicles. Via the acquisition, we're able to acquire the T4 vehicle, which allows us to compete for business that we wouldn't have otherwise been able to peak for with VA. And then expanding into new agencies. We have potential opportunities with the state department, Indian Health Services, CMS, NIH and others that we're -- we'll be working to shape over the coming years.</p><p>To do that, we have to do a number of things. So technical execution is crucial for us. We're working closely with the DoD on a daily basis on our cyber posture and maturity. Operating at scale with program management, rare and discipline, so we're working on -- we'll continue to work on that. Managing the stakeholder environment, which I've mentioned previously. And then some of the comments that Tracy made earlier around finding great people, developing talent and creating leadership culture program that will span a decade or more. It's going to be important that we continue to move forward on those workforce initiatives.</p><p>And then finally, building our success. I'll just note that this work is transformational for Cerner, our service members and veterans. We're very close to creating a national interoperable network for VA and DoD, which I think will also influence the behavior of our commercial markets in and around those medical treatment facilities -- military treatment facilities and veteran medical centers. We have the VA data. We have 30 years of this data. We can better identify, diagnose and care for chronic conditions. Veterans are less healthy and sicker than the general population. So the opportunity to do some of the things that were discussed in the AWS section are crucial for us to predict outcomes and move into a preventive care and a wellness position with VA in particular. We'll have the opportunity to look at environmental and toxic exposures, which are unique to our servicemen and women, and then focus on suicide prevention in PTSD early identification of risk.</p><p>And then finally, we'll be using our opioid toolkit as well to proactively engage an opioid and substance abuse. We're partnering with VSOs, researchers and other charitable organizations that are doing incredible work like the Elizabeth Dole Foundation; and No Vet Alone, which is focused on suicide prevention and PTSD.</p><p>It's incredible exciting -- it's incredibly exciting and rewarding, and I believe the opportunities for us are endless. And we're pleased with our progress and our momentum forward.</p><p>With that, I'm going to turn it over to Don Trigg to discuss strategic growth.</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG, PRESIDENT, CERNER CORPORATION: Thanks, Travis. Good morning, everybody. So today, I'm going to do a couple of things. One, I'd like to talk a little bit about the financial performance of the businesses that make up strategic growth and both define them, talk a little bit about 2019 performance and highlights and then drill down a little bit on Marc's detail in terms of how we think about the 4-year CAGRs around these businesses going forward. Secondly, I'll talk a little bit about health network. So although we go to market from a point solution perspective, we have big ambitions around health network strategies in all 334 MSAs within the U.S. market and in our 5 global focus areas. And then finally, we'll talk a little bit about the data space, which is we think a huge strategic opportunity for the company. Brent talked a little bit about the path of digitization playing out over the last decade, and it's going to have big second and third order impacts, and we'll ask Art Glasgow to join us and talk a little bit about what the Data as a Service opportunity looks like for the company in the coming decade.</p><p>From a strategic growth market perspective, these are the businesses that make up the revenue strategy around how we move beyond Millennium, beyond the hospital-based EMR and beyond fee-for-service. We look for businesses that have significant strategic tailwinds, achievable market share but large addressable markets. As Marc described, we're looking for strategies that are EMR-agnostic, but at the same time, leverage key Cerner assets across our 3 key technical platforms. Fourth, we're looking for surmountable barriers to entry, including regulatory. And again, as Brent talked about, I think we have deep competency as a company around the regulatory space, and it can be a major strategic differentiator for us in the years to come. And then finally, we think a lot about speed to revenue as a meaningful dimension of how we over-attain against our 1-, 3- and 5-year targets for these businesses.</p><p>Just to level-set on how we think about the businesses that make up strategic growth, we really talk about 3 core go-to-market areas. First and foremost, as John described, we have a set of businesses that we think about in our core provider market, both provider organizations that use Millennium and also provide organizations that leverage one of our competitors. Secondly, we see some exciting opportunities in the nonprovider space, including the decade-long capabilities that we've built out around the employer; and the competencies and capabilities that they give us, both organically and with partner strategies like Amazon in the consumer space. And then finally, as I alluded to, we have 2 meaningful businesses that we're working to build out in the Data as a Service space, both in the release of information category as well as some emerging strategies around clinical trial candidate identification and participation --</p><p>From a 2019 performance perspective, as Marc framed, these businesses delivered 22.3% growth on a full year '19 basis. And I think importantly and as the right side of the slide highlights, some things happened foundationally over the course of the year that give us confidence that we can continue to sustain that growth performance on a multiyear basis. We are very happy with the progress around the Lumeris relationship as HealtheIntent becomes the foundation for how they think about their strategies around provider-sponsored plans in the Medicare Advantage space. Very strong performance around behavioral health within our long-term and post-acute business, not only best-in-class category leadership from a solution perspective but strong bookings growth and significant penetration outside our Millennium base.</p><p>David Bradshaw, the longtime CIO and Chief Strategy Officer at Memorial Hermann, came into Cerner and has had an immediate impact in the workforce health and consumer space. Record bookings there, but I think also, importantly, a real strategic opportunity for us to think about our health network concept against a set of very strategic nonprovider use cases.</p><p>And then finally, Art will spend some time and energy this morning talking a little bit about significant growth in the ROI business, including traction around consent-based legal. And I think, importantly, a key strategic partnership with Duke and their DCRI for profit CRO, which has been critical to us, stress testing our thinking around clinical trials.</p><p>As Marc said, from a go-forward perspective, as we think about 2020 and beyond for these businesses, we think there's achievable growth rates that put us on a sustained 20-plus percent performance level for these businesses. But again and I think importantly, as I'll segue here in a second, I think not just speed to revenue and point solution presence but really foundational strategies for this larger push around health network, which creates top line and revenue potentials well beyond what's represented here.</p><p>So let's talk a little bit about the health network strategy and how we think about that beyond the scope of the financial performance framed up in the first 1/3 of the deck. So as I talked about in the past, this is a strategy that really has a key technical foundation in our EHR-agnostic HealtheIntent platform. And the thing I'd really queue you in on here beyond just the native cloud, big data capabilities and the third-party recognition is the fact that this is a platform that is materially deployed is global in its orientation and we think is enabling for the foundational pieces that both provider and nonprovider network strategies require. You have to lay a data foundation for that network. You have to think about provider network management, and that's going to include both traditional and nontraditional network nodes, whether that's venues like the home, or nontraditional settings like retail pharmacy and grocery. We have to think about recording analytics and data science as key capabilities for how you activate those networks and put them to work against key business model strategies.</p><p>Because of the nature of health care and the friction that you find across those traditional disparate networks, continuity of care and how we think about care coordination and care management of the individual is an essential attribute of any successful network. And all of these play into larger strategies around how you think about taking first-dollar risk for alternatively managing high-cost episodic bundles. And from our perspective, and as Brent talked about, this is a strategy and a network that has the consumer at the center, and we have to develop the capabilities around that progression from patient to member to consumer. And so we think we're well down a path to do that, and many of the foundational strategies represented in the revenue trend line that I described play into this larger network strategy and approach.</p><p>So let me just talk quickly, if I can, about 3 network use cases, if you will. I'll take one that's specific to our Millennium footprint, one that represents an EHR strategy that is non-Millennium in its orientation. And then finally, I'll describe a nonprovider use case that, I think, is equally important as we play through strategy and approach.</p><p>The first use case is Roper St. Francis. It's a four-hospital system located in Charleston, South Carolina, and looking to build out its network strategy within that tri-county region. And having great success leveraging HealtheIntent against this use case, which really is how do they think about the post-acute assets as a meaningful dimension of how they not only optimize for fee-for-service, but I think, importantly, enable some of their value-based strategies, which include an innovative narrow network strategy with volume employees located in this marketplace.</p><p>The second use case I'll highlight is Hackensack Meridian, one of the largest provider organizations in the state of New Jersey. As you can see from the slide, they are a user of one of our competitors. But as they started to advance their network strategy and think about taking first-dollar risk with a team that very much understands that space and actually comes out of the payer category, they realized that there were key network dimensions that were relevant to how they wanted to design and activate the network that went well beyond the scope of both their acute facility footprint and their owned physician footprint. And so HealtheIntent became a key enabler of how they thought about bringing together not just 50 disparate EMRs but over 140 different data sources.</p><p>And again, if you think back to that framework that I've provided around the network and network design, aggregation of the data and that provider network are just the starting point dimensions of how you think about network advancement and approach. And what you can see are some very significant objectives that they've set out for the business around patient experience, management of multiple venues of care, leveraging nontraditional role strategies in the care team in a way that meets the expectations for the patient, and in this case, the member for meaningful interaction with their providers and the ability and opportunity to significantly increase gaps in care closure.</p><p>So this is a great use case of someone who's thinking about HealtheIntent as a network enabler to win the zip code and enable strategies, not just for MSSP, where many provider organizations in the market are today, but meaningful strategies around Medicare Advantage, and ultimately, leadership in the commercial category as well.</p><p>And finally, I'll just take one nontraditional nonprovider network strategy that David Bradshaw and team have done an excellent job advancing. And this is a relationship we have with a regional grocer called Hy-Vee. A $10 billion-organization, 8 different states and interestingly, 30-plus percent of total top line coming from health and wellness. So this is an organization very much committed to health and wellness as a strategy and looked to Cerner as an innovative leader around our own employee population and as a way to start a conversation around how we could help with chronic condition management for Hy-Vee employees in a way that would leverage both the pharmacy and grocery assets within their store footprint but now has expanded into a larger conversation around HealtheIntent as a network-enabling strategy across all of the MSAs in which they operate in.</p><p>And while this is an early pilot, we think it's got big potential. And it really, and I think, amplifies from our perspective on how we want to think about not just provider assets but also retail pharmacy. And the grocery has meaningful dimensions of what it looks like to create comprehensive care plans for patient, members and consumers, and ultimately, particularly in the context of taking first-dollar risk, help manage these populations at a lower cost and a higher quality.</p><p>So I want to close before handing it off to Art Glasgow by just amplifying a little bit on Brent's earlier comments relative to the final rulemaking, which came out this week. And I went back in anticipation of the final rule, and after some of the conversations between Brent and Administrator Verma and looked at some early positioning that the company had done around this concept of data liquidity. And I won't read the totality of the quote, but suffice to say, over 2 decades ago, this is an organization that made it clear that the medical record was the property of the individual and who imagined as an organization, what it would look like to be able to put that information to work on behalf of the best possible health and care. And so as we think about what data liquidity can mean in the context of, not only health care for the coming decade but also in the current environment as we think about COVID-19, imagine what it would look like for an individual on a cruise ship to have access to his or her medication history. Imagine what it would look like to think about the extension of our ICU capabilities and virtualization of that capacity in a way which allows us to better manage community-based populations. Imagine what it would look like for us to start to think about strategies around the data that allow us to think about the home as a meaningful venue of care and truly begin to leverage telemedicine strategies for both acute episodes but also non-acute episodes as well.</p><p>So this is the beginning of a very important and significant change in health care over the course of the next decade, and we see huge opportunities for the company, not just to describe what it should look like but actually to meaningfully lead it.</p><p>So with that, let me pivot and hand off to Art Glasgow. Some of you have had an opportunity to hear me talk about Art in the past, a longtime CIO at Duke but also the Chief Product Officer at Optum. He's come in, in the last year and provided a lot of clarity around our thinking around what the opportunities look like in the data space.</p><p>And with that, I'll hand it off to Art to talk a little bit about the progress we've made in the last year. And what we see the opportunity set looking like in the quarters to come.</p><p>ART GLASGOW, SENIOR VP, STRATEGIC GROWTH, CERNER CORPORATION: Great. Thank you, Don, and good morning, everybody. It's my pleasure to be able to spend a few minutes talking about the strategic growth opportunity, specifically in the data market that presents itself in front of Cerner.</p><p>Next slide. This is a pretty complicated topic, but if you could come away with 3 things today, I think it would really be a success. And the first is the data-dependent markets that we're focused on is primarily real-world evidence and the release of information are large markets and represent healthy growth avenues for Cerner. Secondly, our current provider clients are also looking at these markets and are actively pursuing solutions that are going to allow them to benefit from their data. And lastly, our position with the providers as well as our expertise with that health data put us in a unique position to add value to both sides of the equation.</p><p>Next slide. That unique opportunity is really about providing access to health data to nontraditional health markets. And I'll be -- I'll walk you through what markets we're currently focused on as well as some expansion that may be there.</p><p>Next slide. From a market overview, there are really 3 markets that represent the bulk of the data opportunity that are out there. The first is the life sciences market focused on therapy discovery. That is a $45 billion total addressable market. The second is the release of information market. We are currently focused on the legal and life insurance subsegments of that market, currently at $2 billion but much larger if you include the other submarkets. And lastly, the payer market, which we estimate to be a $22 billion addressable market.</p><p>Today, we're going to focus on really those first 2: life sciences and release of information, and I'll walk you through a few examples of how we're doing that. And while we do believe the payer market is a large addressable market, we continue to evaluate it, but there are business model concerns with our providers that would prevent us from making a full play in that market today.</p><p>Next slide. We believe now is the time, and we believe Cerner is uniquely positioned to pursue this for a couple of reasons. First, we do have the access to both the provider clients and the EHR data that we steward for them. And that scale and breadth of data represents one of the largest data assets in the world today across a demographically unique and important subset of providers. Secondly, the regulatory tailwinds, we've talked a little bit about the 21st Century Cures Act already. All of these push towards greater interoperability. The FDA is currently pursuing regulations that support the use of real-world evidence in clinical trials as a cost savings measure. Similarly, we see the same thing occurring outside the U.S. So now is the time from a regulatory standpoint. And lastly, the work that's been done over the last 20, 30 years to really build a digital foundation in health care, both in cloud computing, AI and basic interoperability has allowed for a portability of data that just simply didn't exist previously.</p><p>Next slide. So the first market that we're focused on is the real-world evidence market. And again, this is the use of health care data to support therapy discovery primarily in pharmaceutical and life sciences company. And we're going to talk a little bit about some of the things we've done organically here to prove that our data is worthwhile and valuable to life sciences and that we can partner with our providers to do this. But I do want to make a point that for us to reach meaningful scale, we believe this is the one area of the business that we are going to have to pursue an inorganic growth strategy on top of what we've done organically.</p><p>Next slide. So the problem is really that bringing drugs to market are really expensive. $2.5 billion in 10 years using randomized clinical trials in order to pass FDA regulations and receive a patent. That's really expensive and fraught with risk. And the idea is to use data in a real-world manner to lower the cost of that trial, either by creating segments of the trial that are done virtually or by using data to monitor drug device safety post release, expand the label indications and many more use cases. What's unique about what we're doing is we're really partnering with our providers to do this. So most use of data today is static. Companies gather data, clinical data as well as claims data, organize it and sell it to life sciences companies in order to be able to provide some of those services.</p><p>We're actually creating a network, the Cerner Learning Health Network, that brings our partners and in real-time, our provider partners and allows them both to participate in the servicing of data through life sciences, and allows them to also garner some benefit for doing so financially. So we're driving revenue back to our providers to do this. Now this requires a different data use rights agreement, which we've already negotiated with many of our providers and continue to negotiate today and is really the differentiator by which we're going to market to life sciences.</p><p>As an example, next slide, we created a small partnership with Duke Clinical Research Institute, which is a captive clinical research organization, to see if our data made sense to pharma and whether it could be used. And Duke Clinical Research Institute brought Janssen Pharmaceuticals to bear, who is looking for some help in creating registries around a multiyear, multi-site cardiovascular outcomes trial that they were running. We were successful in recruiting 3 provider sites who wish to participate with us. And within a matter of weeks, we're able to create a longitudinal cohort of over 400,000 patients, which would typically have taken the better part of a year for Janssen to do.</p><p>We continue to drive business off of this single pilot, including 3 additional follow-up contracts with Janssen, Amgen and Novo Nordisk and are looking to expand this beyond just the use of registry creation. But again, this was the first pilot that really proved to us and to our potential partners that there was value in this data and that Cerner could access it, and to our providers that there was value for our providers to openly partner with us in pursuit of this.</p><p>Next slide. Based on the success of that partnership, we have started looking at other CROs or nontraditional CROs in the market and are currently discussing with United BioSource Corporation a number of different pilots that expands just beyond registry creation. Well, of course, they're still interested in the creation of registries. UBC is working with us on a clinical trial design, using data to help pharma companies design more intelligent trials.</p><p>UBC is well known for their HEOR research and safety and efficacy programs as well as some of their commercial programs, and we're currently partnering with them to figure out how to use that data there as well. And then lastly, UBC actually does engage in trial management and are looking to partner with us for how we use that data to create RWE trials, which would greatly reduce the cost of trials for pharma. So we're very excited about what we've done here in the real-world evidence business. We've shown some great organic growth. But again, we're going to have to think a little bit larger to create some scale in this business as well.</p><p>Next slide. So I contrast that with the release of information business, where we think we have a great organic opportunity. And the release of information business is essentially providing access to health information for non-HIPAA use cases to nonhealth care markets.</p><p>Next slide. And again, the markets that we're currently focused on are the legal and life insurance markets. You can see some of the key competitors down there. Interestingly, our closest competitor from an EHR perspective has also decided to attempt to enter this market. And the reason why this market is so interesting to both of us is, this market has largely been, while large, a low-margin market than most of the competitors because of the people-intensive, high-cost approach that they have to take the gathering to health data from multiple provider sites in order to meet the request coming from various industries. That doesn't apply in our case. We are electronic. We can get to this data without human intervention, in most cases, and we can do it far faster than most of our competitors can as well.</p><p>So I'd like to talk to you on the next slide about a really exciting example that proved to us that we have a great growth opportunity here. So the 3M Corporation, as you probably have seen, is being sued for defective earplugs that were used in Gulf War and Afghanistan War. And they had multiple mass tort cases against them across the country. And when there's multiple mass tort cases, the government sometimes consolidates them into what's known as a multi-district litigation under a single federal court. And this federal court needed to hire a records retrieval firm to be able to support deploy of medical records across hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of potential plaintiffs in the case. We were fortunate to have been selected late third quarter, early fourth quarter last year to be the sole-sourced records provider. We've signed over 65 law firms to date growing daily, who are using us. We've pulled over 74,000 records on behalf of veterans this year-to-date. And we're doing it on approximately a 4-hour turnaround time, where previously it was taking weeks.</p><p>This model is one that we believe is going to show tremendous growth. And in fact, from a revenue perspective, based on this contract alone, the HealtheHistory business, which is the business that supports this area, is going to grow by a factor of about 30 to 40 in the course of a single year. Low revenue numbers, but still amazing growth. And we're currently competing for 2 additional multi-district litigation opportunities today.</p><p>Next slide. Likewise, in the life insurance industry, where every time you go to apply for life insurance, you sign a release that allows the life insurance company to access your health records to support underwriting, speed is key. And we signed USAA, one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies for their life insurance segment to utilize HealtheHistory to support that underwriting program. And we're consistently hitting within 30 to 60 days, meeting their underwriting requirements. And USAA has highlighted this as one of their key innovations of the last year that's really driving their ability to move faster and reduce shrink in their underwriting capability.</p><p>We believe it's important as well because when we expand beyond life insurance to areas like workers' compensation or government or property and casualty, having these existing relationships will allow for some immediate revenue growth organically, which we believe is the opportunity here in the release of information business.</p><p>So I want to thank you for your time and turn it back to Don Trigg.</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Thanks, Art. Before I open it up for questions and comments, I'll just make some closing comments. I think as you heard over the course of the morning, we feel very good about the state of our core business. John talked about some of the key areas of focus, inclusive of the work around revenue cycle and the white space opportunity there. And Travis laid out, I think, a strong forward path relative to our federal business. And hopefully, Art and I gave you a sense for not only the path to 20% organic growth inside our strategic growth business but some of, I think, the exciting opportunities for us to think about leveraging strong free cash flow and the balance sheet for inorganic strategies opportunistically in the quarters to come.</p><p>So all that fits in to a larger change initiative that Brent has been advancing over the last number of quarters that we think represents not only good progress in full year '19 but continues to make progress as we work through 2020.</p><p>So with that, let me close our prepared comments and open the line up for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.</p><p>ROBERT PATRICK JONES, VP, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I guess maybe just to pick up where you just left off, the real-world evidence opportunity, as you highlighted, is a very big one. I think there are several obviously players, as you also highlighted, that are in the market pursuing this opportunity. It sounds like for Cerner to maybe take more full advantage of this market opportunity, you'd need to do a deal. I'm just curious if maybe you could give us kind of order of magnitude of how big a deal you'd be willing to do in that space. And then within the capabilities that you have today relative to the others that are also out there with real-world data and real-world evidence offerings, what capabilities would you be looking to add on to that offering?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: This is Marc. Before Art answers the -- what we'd be looking for, I would indicate -- obviously, we can't really talk a lot about potential M&amp;A opportunities or size at this point. But I think it's fair to say that we're going to -- we'll take a look at what opportunities, and we have a strong balance sheet that allows us to do M&amp;A upsize. But at this point, we don't have any guidance to provide relative size. But Art, maybe you could talk a little bit about the elements that we think we need to have from a capability standpoint.</p><p>ART GLASGOW: Yes, absolutely, Marc. Thank you. So we don't believe it's necessarily a better, faster technology platform that's primarily needed, although those things could be interesting tuck-ins down the line. We believe primarily what we need is a business platform that has the existing relationships with pharma who's currently engaged in pursuing some of this business today. That does not mean a traditional CRO. In fact, we've largely excluded that because of the low-margin, people-intensive aspect of some of that business. But in terms of scale, I think you'll find there's kind of a sweet spot in the market for companies that tend to look like that, that have some technology ability, but more importantly, the relationships with pharma and the existing strategy that matches well with access to data that we can provide.</p><p>ROBERT PATRICK JONES: Okay. Great. I guess just one other more forward-looking as we think about the things that need to play out in order to achieve the long-term growth. Obviously, there's a number of initiatives. But I think one of the things you highlighted that isn't too inconsistent from the previous long-term growth outlook was around just the health network, which you guys spent some time talking about. It still sounds like you're calling for mid-20s growth there. I'm just wondering what needs to play out, both from internally what you need to do differently if there is anything you need to do differently. And then from the end market standpoint, what are you assuming as far as the shift towards more reimbursement structures that might drive the offerings within your Health Network's portfolio to maybe have a stronger uptake than what we've seen so far?</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Yes, it's a great question. So one, I think we have the good fortune of having made a material investment in the HealtheIntent platform and worked with a set of organizations that were, I'll say, early to risk. So really, we're doing more than sort of science projects around MSSP, but we're actually taking material business model risk and thinking about management of the first dollar. So I think the capabilities that we built out at Advocate in Chicago and accelerated across early adopters of that platform created really some best-in-class capabilities relative to key use cases around value-based care. And I think if you look at more near-term activity, like the partnership with Lumeris, specific to Medicare Advantage, we've not only thought through that now in the context of use cases with collaborative payers but also in the context of de novo planned start-up activities for provider organizations as well.</p><p>Having said that, what we spent time and energy talking about internally are what the path to larger value-based strategies look like. And a big line-of-sight focus for us is how do we think about the platform against key fee-for-service use cases. So how do you think about out-of-network referrals as a key dimension of how you manage your network? How do you think about network management contextual to key specialties and service lines? And how does all of that then become preparatory for an organization that has a handle on total cost of care and can advance value-based strategies over time and feel increasingly comfortable taking risk at the enterprise level? So we like the momentum in the market against key fee-for-service use cases. And we think as the trend towards value plays out, and we think that's a when-not-an-if reality, we think that will create additional traction and take rate around the point solutions that we're taking to market.</p><p>So there's always gaps that you have in your solution suite relative to things that you're wanting to do to differentiate, but we think we have a very strong toolkit to take out to the market today, and we're getting traction and take rate around it.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.</p><p>LISA CHRISTINE GILL, SENIOR PUBLISHING ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Marc, do we not get the joke if we're not there in person? I'm a little bit disappointed if not.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: I think it was intentional by Allan to bury me into the middle of this presentation.</p><p>LISA CHRISTINE GILL: All right. I guess we'll have to be there first in next year. So just as we think about, obviously, with everything with COVID-19 out in the marketplace, are you seeing any decision-making being pushed off on the IT side? I mean I don't really think of this as having any kind of long-term impact, but just curious if you're seeing any decision-making being pushed off as hospitals are focused on what's going on in the marketplace would be my first question.</p><p>And then secondly, as we continue to be focused on the consumer, and Don, I appreciated the comments that you had from Neal around the medical record and really being the property of the individual. How do we think about Cerner playing a role in that? How do we think about HIPAA? Do you become a more consumer-facing organization? Or has this come through the providers that then touch the consumer? Just how do we think about how that plays out?</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: Okay. This is John. I'll hit the first one on the impact of the coronavirus out there right now. But to date, we haven't seen a slowing or pausing of any activity our projects due to COVID-19. From a Cerner perspective, we continue to travel and support of our clients and our delivery for our clients. There's -- they're doing some preparation activities that we're supporting, but we continue to travel for those. The situation is always kind of fluid out there, as we know, but we'll continue to work closely with our clients to make sure we support them. I mean there's a real potential that we may see the demand for our client services, their health services increase with this. It's a little bit of an unknown. But to date, no impact in terms of our projects and initiatives.</p><p>One interesting note that I'm making, and Don had mentioned this, that several of our strategic solutions we have out there, think of things like telehealth, surveillance, analytics, the population health platform within HealtheIntent. They're actually playing crucial roles as our clients plan for the potential of delivery of care outside of their current environments. And Don had also mentioned that when the situation stabilizes, potentially there's real opportunity for increased funding around some of these capabilities that are out there.</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Lisa, this is Don. So this is an awesome question on what's it kind of looked like for us to think about the progression from patient-based use cases to member-based use cases to ultimately a health care market where we see elevated rates of consumerism. I think we're spending a lot of time and energy on that topic.</p><p>I think what I would say is we're trying to be smart about that progression. And so today, a lot of our work is around what I'll call the compulsories of supporting provider supply-side use cases around that patient member consumer continuum. So the well-being application that we brought to market with Geisinger, how we think about key partner strategies as a way to be provided to the patient in a way that is seamless to him or her, leveraging partnerships with [Kyris] and GetWellNetwork from a HealthLoop perspective, Amwell from a tele perspective. So really thinking about what are those partner capabilities that we want to provide on a plug-and-play capability to that patient or member today.</p><p>I think as we play forward around the strategy, where we believe there's a meaningful place to differentiate and where our partnership strategies around not just the AWS side of Amazon but pan-Amazon begin to feature, are how do we become a trusted steward for consumer data and consumer insights and then really become best-in-class in terms of how those consumer insights get activated within the last-mile workflow of the physician within a health network. And so I think our work in the employer space, our partnership with Lumeris, our ambitions around not just [BEPC] but larger strategies around episodic bundles, all those play into what it looks like to ultimately have a larger consumer strategy, mostly through a set of key partners to include providers within MSAs where we're driving business strategies. So I think short of kind of a pure kind of D2C orientation but really trying to be smart and sophisticated around path from patient member to consumer.</p><p>And then just the final thing I would say is also thinking a ton about the regulatory environment and thinking about it globally and what does it look like, not just to play through the information-blocking provisions within 21st Century Cures but also to think about what update strategies to HIPAA might look like, strategies around GDPR-style statutory changes and what those do or don't do to adoption rates around key strategies. So we have to be smart on that topic, and I think really differentiate ourselves from big tech and Silicon Valley-based start-ups because we understand what's playing out and how it will impact diffusion rates around our strategies.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.</p><p>GEORGE ROBERT HILL, MD &amp; EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. I guess, maybe Marc or John, would you guys talk a little bit about the size and the timing of the non-VA and DoD government opportunities that you see going forward? And kind of how should we expect that the kind of the processes look like going forward? And I imagine you guys expect pretty good win rates, but just we've seen these kind of be diffused with like L.A. hospitals and stuff. Would just love comments around that.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: This is Marc. Just to kind of level-set, the DoD and the VA are by far the largest opportunities in the federal space. So the other ones that are -- that Travis talked about are certainly opportunities and ability to leverage our experience with the government and the systems we're building. But from an order of magnitude, it's a nice ability to continue to grow that business. But order of magnitude, they're not multiple billions of dollars and most of these are. But I'll defer to John, Travis and the others to comment.</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: Yes. I would say that in the context of some of the things mentioned, stuff like the IHS and those type of things, those have been ongoing activities we've had for multiple years. The good thing is, is we now have a platform to either look at more of those types of things, but I see them just being a part of our normal process in terms of what we look at, how we onboard them and those type of things. We just have a better platform for which to look at those.</p><p>TRAVIS S. DALTON: This is Travis. I'll just add that I actually think we have an opportunity to utilize some of the things that Don is working on the strategic growth space. So we can actually utilize some of those capabilities and solutions into those other provider agencies beyond VA and DoD. So I think we've got opportunities beyond. But to Marc's point, the vast majority of our opportunity wise and clear execution on what it is we're on task due today, but we do have some possibilities beyond.</p><p>GEORGE ROBERT HILL: That's helpful. And if I could have a quick follow-up for Don. Don, is it safe to assume that the relative TAM bucket sizes that we called out in the 6 categories of strategic growth are reflective of their size, kind of in Cerner's strategic growth buckets? And I guess from a -- do we think that the time that those markets develop is generally over the same period? Or do you expect some of the markets are going to mature faster than others?</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Yes. It's a great question, George. I think what we tried to do there, which is a little bit of iterative work that we've done since JPMorgan has really give you a sense for what do we think the kind of nearer-term opportunities look like from a SOM perspective, where do we think there are clear line of sight to achievable opportunities beyond that. But I think -- so Marc highlighted the TAMs. But I would say, if you look at just a more narrow line of sight around offerings that we have today and which I enumerated on that next page, we feel very comfortable that we can achieve the growth rates that we laid out on a 4-year basis. So there's real growth here across all those markets, and we're very well positioned to do it today against current solution capabilities.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with BofA Securities.</p><p>MICHAEL AARON CHERNY, DIRECTOR, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Marc, I want to dive back into some of the margin targets and some of the comments that you and also Brent made on some of the process improvements. As you think about that 100 basis points of annual margin expansion, clearly with revenue growth, there should be some mix dynamics and incremental pull-through drivers that comes through it. But can you talk a little bit more about some of the process improvements in terms of some of the specifics you're pushing forward through beyond head count rationalization, some of the pieces you're putting in place to make sure you can -- you maintain a, I guess, more agile, more nimble overall organization?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. I think from a -- certainly, cost optimization has been kind of the initial focus in going through and making sure we are driving all the efficiencies we came out of the organization. And for the most part, you're seeing the benefit of that coming through our SG&amp;A line. And I will see, we will look out kind of over through the 2024 time, we would continue to see a lot of benefits accruing to the SG&amp;A line because that is where a lot of the optimization impact is going to occur.</p><p>But I also think kind of, as you mentioned, as we actually start continuing to grow the revenue line, you'll also see the contribution margin opportunities increase. Because I think many of the things that we're looking at that are going to be more efficient ways to host our solutions using AWS, more efficient ways for us to deliver our technology through HealtheIntent, all of those come with them a cost savings relative to the current operating models. As we continue to evolve toward a cloud-based platform, just moving Millennium to a native cloud environment could save $130 million of annual cost that we can incur today on sublicensed software that it takes us to run Millennium in our data center. So all of these are opportunities that would go directly to increasing the contribution margins for those businesses.</p><p>So I think, as I look at the past to the mid-20% range, probably around 25% by 2024, I see it coming from both the leverage we get out of SG&amp;A and leverage we're going to see that's going to come directly through contribution margins. So both of those will get some leverage on the R&amp;D standpoint, but a lot of our goals in R&amp;D is to get better and more efficient in how we do it and put out a whole lot more stuff.</p><p>DAVID BRENT SHAFER: Yes. Just to build on that, your comment about being agile and more productive overall. I mean part of doing this work is by bringing clarity, clarity around process, clarity around decision rights, clarity around roles and responsibilities. You enable people to just go a lot faster. And as we kind of -- as we started this journey, what we all talked about 1.5 years ago or so was this is a business that's built up over time. And as it built up, we built in a fair amount of complexity. And so everything that Marc just said is that's all about reducing the complexity and enabling speed and agile decision-making throughout the organization. So I think we're on the right path there.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Matthew Gillmor with Baird.</p><p>MATTHEW DALE GILLMOR, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to ask about the revenue cycle product road map. I think Brent and John had mentioned delivering world-class revenue cycle is one of the key strategic priorities. And I think you also mentioned you'll be looking to fill in some gaps. So maybe just sort of help us understand what the gaps that you're filling in. Is that more sort of on capabilities? Or is it more sort of execution? And sort of how long it will take to fill those gaps?</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: Yes. This is John. If you look at the gaps that are out there, there's a couple of things that we need to focus on. And we've actually published these to our clients in terms of our road maps in an expected time frame. So what I'd start by saying is we do have a competitive solution out there. So by saying world class, I don't want to give the impression that it's not a competitive solution. It is competitive and it gets more competitive every day as we drive to world class. But if we look at the primary gaps, I would say that they're on the back end of our solutions in terms of what you would say is patient accounting. And we look to fill those over the next 18 months. We released a 3-year road map about 18 months ago in terms of closing those gaps, and we're on schedule in context of delivering those.</p><p>I also mentioned that we want to ensure that every interaction we have with the implementation, not only of our revenue cycle but our other solutions, is a world-class experience. Experience is very important. Experience is important with the delivery of the clinical systems. It's important with the delivery of the revenue cycle systems. So we'll focus on ensuring that every single implementation is a world-class experience, and we'll continue to push that as well.</p><p>So we do have those solution gaps. We do have those to make sure that we have a world-class experience. And when we fulfill those gaps, the reality is there's those gaps in something. And we consider this to be an ongoing process as well. We're not done. And the fact is will never be done.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Sandy Draper with SunTrust.</p><p>ALEXANDER YEARLEY DRAPER, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I think, probably a question for John. There have been a couple of press releases about a couple of legacy customers moving over to a major competitor. Now I realize the sales cycles are long, and so those are probably reflective of what the competitive dynamic was 18 to 24 months ago. Just to get your thoughts on what your customers are saying today. How do you see retention because you highlighted that's important?</p><p>And then also maybe for Marc. One of your competitors noted this year they've got a headwind because of higher level of attrition from deals that happened a couple of years ago or were lost a couple of years ago. Is that something we should be thinking about maybe a couple of years out?</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: Yes. This is John. I'll go first on the question about some of the recent news. And in each one of these situations, you'd expect, are different and have their own story. But what I would say is that it really underscores our need to focus and execute on our plans around our client success functions. We had mentioned we had set up the client success office, but we need to make sure that every single day, every single client is being incredibly successful. And we know what our gaps are, and we know what our challenges are. To your point, these things don't happen overnight. They work over time, but there is the reality that this is a competitive environment.</p><p>And while we win new clients and we expand, as I mentioned in a couple of my comments, we expand in the vast majority of our clients in our client base. The folks that leave us, so the clients that leave us are incredibly disappointing. And again, that's why we have to have a deliberate focus on client success every day for each client. I'll also note that while these directional announcements are public, these clients will remain an EHR client of Cerner's for multiple years. And also important to note that post transition of the EHR, they will continue to be clients of Cerner with our other platforms, HealtheIntent and, in some cases, CareAware.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. This is Marc. The headwind from attrition from lost deals as John indicated, it takes a long time to unwind. Many of our clients do have other platforms such as HealtheIntent they're running. So you're really the support element. And we've talked about when we look at our core and our growth, the fact that the core, as we define it, increases slightly, and some of that is going to be from attrition. Now the reality is that you're kind of -- some of the attrition we saw from the Siemens acquisition is really kind of just now beginning to hit us. So that gives you a sense of the timing that it takes to get to that. So I think it does impact the support element, but I think John's team is really focused on how you avoid that. As John said, each one has a unique story, but we know the signs. Some of this is not keeping current on the software, things like that. So we are focused on getting our clients to the latest and greatest version of software, doing everything we can to make sure they're following our guidance because not every client follows exactly what we guide them to do. And so we need to be more forceful to make them successful, which will retain them as a client. But for our part, it's a slight headwind, but we don't have a whole lot of attrition. So it isn't material.</p><p>ALEXANDER YEARLEY DRAPER: Great. That's helpful. And I think this will be a very quick follow-up, probably for Art. You mentioned there are, I think, 400,000 records you accessed when you were doing the real-world evidence project for Duke. Was that -- that can't all be for Cerner. So I'm just trying to understand how you're getting access to that many records and people. And so just trying to understand HealtheIntent, how long the tentacles are in terms of reaching out?</p><p>ART GLASGOW: Yes. Sure. So those 400,000 records are all inherent as a subset of HealtheIntent. As you know, HealtheIntent, while sitting on top of Millennium, is EHR-agnostic and does have the ability to see the full community record as well.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>RIVKA REGINA GOLDWASSER, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: So a couple of questions here. So first of all, on M&amp;A and inorganic growth, you're projecting 4-year CAGR of about 1% to 3%, just for comparability. Can you just remind us how much inorganic was included in the strategic category in the guidance range that you provided in 2019? And also as we think about M&amp;A, what's the sweet spot that you think about in terms of size of deal? So that's question one.</p><p>Question two relates to the -- and if you have any updates for us on 2020. Obviously, you provided pretty wide revenue guidance range between 0.6% to 5% when you think about what happened since you provided guidance around European divestiture, the Advent deal, though I understand that it might take longer to flow through the numbers.</p><p>And also, you just -- I think, Marc, you highlighted the debt refinancing. So how do you think about guidance for 2020 from where you stand now? Let me stop here. And then I have one other follow-up.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Okay. I think that from an inorganic view, at least as far as our discussion on long-term growth last year compared to this year, they both included about the same amount of inorganic opportunities as we look at the long-term growth for the company. We've been clear that our expectation is to be able to leverage the balance sheet, and that would be our goal to do so, particularly targeting areas in the strategic growth area. I don't know that there's a sweet spot from an M&amp;A perspective. I think we're going to be very targeted on where we see something that can take our capabilities and leverage them to create a growth engine much faster than we could do it organically. That's the whole reason for us to do an inorganic. We're not looking for market share. We're looking for capabilities that leverage what we -- our plan but get us there just faster. So that's the sweet spot. There is not a dollar amount sweet spot that we're looking at.</p><p>Now relative to 2020, when we do our Q1 call, we'll be able to provide a little bit better update. At this point, we're not updating any views that we have relative to guidance on this call, but we should be able to give a little bit more color. Obviously, there are things to process, things going on that we'll have more clarity by that time and hopefully give you -- be able to take that range down to a little bit smaller level then. But as of now, there's nothing I can really share with you today.</p><p>ALLAN KELLS: Yes. Ricky, this is Allan. The only thing that's really changed is that the global divestiture was about $20 million of revenue a quarter. So when that closes, that's basically that amount would go away. So if you think of the middle of the year closing, you're maybe a $20 million a quarter after that. But as we indicated when we announced it, the profitability associated with that, we can offset through other initiatives. So it'd sort of be net neutral from an earnings standpoint. So that would really be the only update.</p><p>RIVKA REGINA GOLDWASSER: Okay. And then the presentation of AWS was very helpful. Can you just kind of like talk a little bit about the revenue model and kind of like what's the economic split between Amazon AWS and Cerner?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. This is Marc. There is no split between -- I mean, right now, at least currently, our activities with AWS as a partner involve them working with us, obviously, on the technology side, leveraging that. But that was kind of part of our deal for them to help us on the technology side. So that's just part of basically our agreement to basically use them as our hosting partner. And so their economics are, they're going to get a lot of hosting dollars. Our economics are we're going to get the lower cost relative to using AWS hosting and access to a variety of technologies, including cloud technologies, that will enable us to move our solutions forward faster with less development time on our side. So those are kind of the economics that are involved. There isn't, today, anything that splits. That's not saying that as we work more with AWS and Amazon that there might be some opportunities for us to work together in something that would include that. But at least it's in place today. I would say there isn't such a sharing today.</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Right. One of the things we talked about around the larger Amazon relationship and the work with AWS is one of the partnership selection criteria was the opportunity to really leverage capabilities and engage with Amazon across the breadth of their business. So there's a collaboration framework that's in place. We look at those on a case-by-case basis. And that was really a model designed out by Dan Devers and now that he is responsible for and will be driving.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.</p><p>CHARLES RHYEE, MD &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Wanted to ask about Lumeris. You guys talked -- it sounded like things are going very well with that JV there. And if I recall back when you guys first announced it, the idea was to help Lumeris use HealtheIntent to have it established as their platform, potentially to look to expand that further out into your client base that our providers are looking to take risk. Can you give us a sense on where we are in sort of that kind of road map? And is this something that we're still waiting on for certain things to happen? Or maybe give us a sense on where we stand today.</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Charles, this is Don. That's a great question. So I think the first thing I would say is just separate and apart from the partnership, as we get in the marketplace and have conversations, everybody is looking to grow key service lines. Everybody is looking to work their expense line and make money at Medicare rates, and everybody's thinking about risk-based contracting as a dimension of how they have to play toward their business strategy over the next 5-plus years. And so Lumeris is a really important framework for us to be able to take into our provider client accounts and have the right level of strategic conversation around where they're going on a 5-year basis and what our capabilities look like to support those strategies going forward. So it's meaningfully differentiated from other EMR companies and very relevant to the conversation that C-level executives want to have today as they put forward their 5-year plan around their business.</p><p>Secondly, from a Lumeris perspective, you'll recall that one of the discrete things that we were keen to do was to really think about their MA plan with 70,000 members in St. Louis as a driver client for best-in-class capabilities of HealtheIntent to manage first dollar risk. And that is an effort that played forward over the course of 2019. Like any legacy platform deprecation, Travis could walk through the VISTA variant of that in the VA space. They had discrete capabilities that we had to be able to match like-for-like. So we had a concept of parity plus as well as some areas that we wanted to innovate around both provider and member experience. And as I described on one of the slides, that's an effort that was successful over the course of 2019. And now we're in the process in 2020 of actually deprecating their legacy ADSP platform and really making HealtheIntent the differentiated platform that they're taking to market, not only in Millennium client environments but also in non-Millennium client environments. So it's a major step change for us in terms of the partnership. And it really affords us, we think, the opportunity on a go-forward 4-year basis to really start to think about, not only what's it looked like to align with our clients on business strategy and be relevant to what they're wanting to do from a risk perspective but also think about meaningful penetration of non-Millennium environments in a way that creates a take rate for HealtheIntent as an EHR-agnostic platform and allows us to increase the number of lives and the strategic relevance of those lives across multiple markets. So the information, very good progress. We continue to be deeply committed to the partnership and excited about the progress.</p><p>CHARLES RHYEE: And does that mean that sort of as we get through 2020, you're in a better position for 2021 to extend outwards? Would that be more like with the 2022 planned season?</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: No. Absolutely. We're going to see positive revenue impact starting in 2020. And over the course of the projections that were put in front of you, that lives in the health network line of the view that I provided from a segment and CAGR perspective. But we're getting an economic benefit from deprecation of ADSP. We're participating in all the 1,120 go-lives. And to your implicit point, as we start to see the number of lives within those they plan to grow, they are PMPM-based economics that have a value proposition to us out quarter out year.</p><p>CHARLES RHYEE: That's helpful. If I could sneak one more in for Don as well or maybe Art. When you -- it made sense from an earlier question how HealtheIntent, being sort of EMR-agnostic, you can pull a community record when you're doing real-world evidence. There are other data -- bigger data aggregators that are pulling claims data on an agnostic -- EMR-agnostic basis. Can you just maybe delve in a little more what differentiates HealtheIntent here specifically from some of these larger data aggregators?</p><p>ART GLASGOW: Yes. I'm happy to take that, Don, if you'd like. So I think what differentiates HealtheIntent right now is just its breadth and its speed. So HealtheIntent allows us really to create those cohorts that we talked about in the registry pilot extremely quickly. And HealtheIntent is not a static database as well. So most of those other data aggregators are gathering the data once and then it ages, months-over-months, years-over-years. HealtheIntent refreshes itself every 17 seconds in the cloud. So it's an extremely live database. Now I will say, moving forward, and one of the reasons why we focused on the need for inorganic growth in this area is as we expand the use cases by which we're going to service, pharma and life sciences, we're probably going to have to go deeper than the HealtheIntent data. But that data does exist below HealtheIntent and Millennium. So as we get deeper into the clinical data, into the unstructured clinical data, we'll only be able to add value to the overall data asset, that Cerner stewards, on behalf of our provider customers today.</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: And the only other thing I would just say, Charles, is Art's made a real point to talk about the composition of our client base. And so the opportunity for regional IDNs and, in particular, community hospitals to participate in a clinical trial activity and clinical trial economics is an interesting dimension as you think about our client footprint relative to some of the other competitors who have a very AMC-dominated client basis. So there's a differentiation, both to the clinical data but also from a market segment perspective in terms of some of the real strength of our client base.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Steve Halper with Cantor Fitzgerald.</p><p>STEVEN PAUL HALPER, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD &amp; CO., RESEARCH DIVISION: On Slide 73, you did highlight that the numbers exclude Millennium SaaS migrations in 2024, 2025. Is that the attrition that you talked about previously?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: No. Steve, this is Marc. It just indicated that we wouldn't -- there isn't an impact from a wholesale switch to a SaaS business model in the numbers because that's not our expectations of what will happen as we move forward given the approach we're taking toward going to the cloud. So that's the key element to that.</p><p>STEVEN PAUL HALPER: So that comment is not related to the planned attrition?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: No. No. It's the -- we're just saying that, certainly, it makes sense if you're going to build an accurate model that you assume there are some small level of attrition. But keep in mind, we also expect to sell back into that base. Revenue cycle has got a fairly significant white space still in our base, so just even in the core and the solutions that are included in the core. And I would stress that this is my model that reduces it. John's model does not have our core business reducing. He is going to do everything he can to make sure that core business grows because he sees the opportunity there. I think from a modeling standpoint, I'm being a little bit conservative on that.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Sean Dodge with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>SEAN WILFRED DODGE, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe, Marc, going back real quick to the Millennium staff migrations. I guess at a high level, how should we think about how those should affect revenues? Is the expectation they'll be somewhat growth-dilutive but drive up the proportion of recurring revenue? Or given you've already sold licenses and you're flipping them to SaaS, is this something that could be accretive to those ranges that you've laid out?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Well, once again, we kind of indicated that in the range we have for this period, SaaS isn't going to be an impact from a business model standpoint. I think it's important, when you look at us, when you think of SaaS, the recurring business, well, you look at our business. We have hosting. We have a lot of -- we have support. A lot of the elements of our business are already recurring in nature. So unlike many companies that flip to a SaaS model, we already have a majority of our revenue coming in on a pretty consistent basis. Your point that on the SaaS model, you continue to get paid for the license software in perpetuity as opposed to the one-time element that you have is certainly something that's on our radar. But once again, the projection that we provided don't really have any -- because of the time frame, don't have any impact on SaaS. And I think that's appropriate that SaaS won't have much of an impact in that time frame.</p><p>SEAN WILFRED DODGE: Okay. And then just a quick one on the VA contract. The delay in the go-live for the Mann-Grandstaff site, I know Travis, you said, it doesn't affect the rest of the project. Does it? Or how much does it impact your expectations for VA revenue for the year?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. This is Marc. It doesn't impact it.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with Keybanc.</p><p>DONALD HOUGHTON HOOKER, VP AND EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So on your slide, your outlook slide, you were referencing 4% to 5% organic growth. Can you maybe talk about kind of the stability of that over time? And should we expect kind of lumps ups and downs? I mean, obviously, the inorganic component of your outlook is -- presumably, it's pretty lumpy, obviously, and hard to predict. But the organic component, I mean, how much volatility should we expect there? Could we have sort of years of 6%, 7% growth and years of low single-digit growth? Or is it more stable?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. I think the graph that's included on that slide is intended to be somewhat indicative of kind of what you see the overall growth. We kind of indicated that 2020 is a reset year. But really, when you go from 2020 towards 2024, the growth rate isn't going to vary a whole lot from year-to-year. Now once again, that can change depending on inorganic activity and the timing of that inorganic activity. We've layered in kind of a ramp-up of inorganic that goes up in 20 -- basically kind of 2021 and then increases up from there. So it will depend on that. But otherwise, the growth is pretty level throughout the period of time that we look at.</p><p>DONALD HOUGHTON HOOKER: Okay. And then in the federal business line, the growth there, obviously, is a little higher with the VA. Can you just update us in terms of kind of the -- I would assume that's kind of a lower margin area. I mean, I guess, there are a number of revenues in that segment. But kind of maybe just ballpark sort of the profitability of entering that federal segment and the other -- some of the other segments you have?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Well, I think the federal segment, because we are -- it's basically a commercial contract vehicle. So it isn't a cost plus. We've -- it's similar to what our other businesses are certainly -- they get perhaps a bit of a volume discount when you buy -- we offer special deals. If you buy $10 billion, you get a special -- you get some off. But overall, it's going to be -- it will be comparable from an overall margin perspective because it does include software. It includes a lot of the elements that all of our business include, hosting and all those elements. So from a margin standpoint, it really isn't a lot different from the rest of the business. And that's why we're able to kind of continue to grow our margins with that becoming a bigger part of our business as we go forward.</p><p>TRAVIS S. DALTON: Yes. This is Travis. As Marc noted, it's a firm fixed price contract. So it's very similar to a commercial contract. We've got, I'd say, very good services rates. And also, it's consistent in terms of line of business mix that you would see in a commercial contract. So I expect similar margin profile.</p><p>DONALD HOUGHTON HOOKER: And then last real quick one. Can you update me -- update us on maybe your ambitions around perhaps taking more risk with clients around population health? Or is that not material in your strategic planning?</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Yes. It -- probably to speak to Marc's conservatism point, I think it's something that is interesting to us, and the chance to actually align with clients around their business strategies and to be aligned relative to performance is something that we think, when your technology and services can deliver it, it's exciting to talk through that with clients and think about how that might be a dimension of a contractual relationship. It's not something that we built into the model. And that features in the organic assumptions that we laid out this morning.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.</p><p>ADAM CHASE NOBLE, EQUITY RESEARCH ASSOCIATE OF HEALTHCARE, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is actually Adam Noble on for Kevin. I just wanted to ask first about the international segment. Any thoughts, particularly given the divestitures, around how that growth might compare to the domestic segment in the long-term revenue growth plan? And how should we think about some of the strategic growth buckets factoring into that international growth?</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: Yes. This is John. I'll answer that in a general comment. In terms of the strategic growth capabilities outside the U.S., they're very relevant outside the U.S., particularly as you look at some of the payer models that are out there, and most of the payer models out there tend to lean towards the ability to aggregate populations. They tend to lean towards the ability to use analytics to impact the cost of care for those countries or those entities. In terms of the -- I think the other question</p><p>is around the divestitures and those type of things looking at growth. I'm going to go back to the same comment that I believe Marc made and I made that it allows us to focus on exactly what we want to focus on outside the U.S. There's opportunities in other procurements, so we'll have an opportunity to focus on. And there's a lot of opportunities to expand within the markets where we already have a considerable footprint and ability to leverage that footprint going forward. So while there may be a reset post divestitures, I see a great opportunity for continued growth outside the U.S.</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Yes. Let me just amplify on -- from a health network perspective, if you look at a country like England and trend lines around the NHS, their strategy around integrated care systems fundamentally represents a network strategy across multiple regions within that geography. The same would be true from the Nordics and other focused global markets. So the extensibility of these strategies has actually never been higher, and that introduces some really interesting international growth opportunities for us on a go-forward 5-year basis from a network perspective. And then, obviously, as well in terms of the use cases that Art laid out, as we think about what it looks like to come up with a comprehensive clinical trial identification and participation strategy, that also introduces some interesting global potentials as well.</p><p>ADAM CHASE NOBLE: That's super helpful. If I could just ask one on capital allocation. I know you guys have talked about growing the dividend over time with free cash flow. You guys have some pretty healthy free cash flow growth in the long-term target. How should we think about the share repurchase in that context as well? Would you expect the additional free cash flow to mainly be deployed in M&amp;A? Or would you expect to be able to grow the buyback as well at the time?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. This is Marc. Certainly, our intent is to leverage our capital allocation to the benefit of shareholders. When we can find an investment opportunity that we think will move the business forward and enhance our growth opportunities and deliver our -- four our future growth, we only feel like that's the best investment for our capital. But we are going to be very targeted. We're not going to grow through acquisition. We're going to use it strategically. So in that case, we certainly expect to continue doing share repurchases. I think that as you go through the approach, certainly, dividend, increasing the dividend. Certainly, as our earnings increase, it increases dividend. It makes a whole lot of sense. Keeping repurchases somewhere in a base level of 50% of free cash flow would be kind of a target, but that's kind of, to some extent, will be determining on M&amp;A. And it might be a [mid] to minimum in a non-M&amp;A environment. So I think that overall, certainly, we see all of those elements as part of our capital allocation going to depend on which -- what opportunities we see. But -- and I think from a balance sheet perspective, we did plan some additional debt at very attractive rates. We think 1x leverage, absent M&amp;A is a pretty reasonable level of leverage for the balance sheet. And to the extent M&amp;A opportunities don't present themselves, we'll likely use that for repurchases. As I indicated today, we've already, in Q1, been very active in the markets and exceeded our 12-month target of the $1.5 billion. We were going to be purchased -- purchasing over $400 million already this quarter.</p><p>Why don't we take one more question?</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Jeff Garro with William Blair.</p><p>JEFFREY ROBERT GARRO, RESEARCH ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: I want to touch on the portfolio management review, and I know it's hard to give a precise time line. And last quarter, you said it would be ongoing. You've also mentioned that moves from here are likely smaller than the Adventist outsourcing move and the European divestiture. But I wanted to ask what to expect from here? And maybe more specifically ask about RevWorks or kind of broader selectivity in RCM professional services engagements.</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Sure. This is Don, Jeff. So as Brent framed, there was a very extensive portfolio management process that we work through over the course of full year '19, and I think some meaningful progress there. We not only talked about some of the strategies around global but also some of the key partnerships that have emerged as an outgrowth of making a decision to deprecate and move to a different solution strategy around things like home health, in-room entertainment strategies and the relationship with GetWell. And as part of that process, obviously, and the Adventist announcement thinking a lot about revenue cycle and to the very earlier good question about what does the right go-to-market strategy look like there, so the near-term strategies in that space have been focused on what it looks like to realize the white space opportunity. So how do we think about a new deployment model, which we put in place over the course of '19? How do we think about HealtheIntent as a key enabler of reporting capabilities that we know are necessary for managing post-conversion environments? Really good progress, I think, on the front end from a red sketch perspective, including API enabling and opening that up.</p><p>And then finally, and I think importantly, really trying to think about from a front, middle, back perspective, what are the best capabilities in Millennium and in Soarian that we can leverage to actually continue to not only meet the minimum viable product requirements but also differentiate the offering. So that's all work that's in-flight and in progress. And we're certainly thinking about skills partners and strategies in that space as part of how we actually fulfill what's a very measurable space and exceed the expectations of our clients. So I think more to come in terms of what the breadth of partnership activities may look like there. But I think that's some of the framework in which the decisions around that would fit in.</p><p>JEFFREY ROBERT GARRO: And then just to follow up. You mentioned more to come on partnerships and the spaces you're attacking. Can you give a little more commentary on kind of your focus on software versus services and a similar dichotomy in partnerships, whether those partnerships are more likely to be technology partners or services partners?</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Yes. So I mean, we're very focused on the software and the technology side of this business. That's where the R&amp;D and the IP investment is focused. I think as we API-enable pieces of the stack, it creates interesting opportunities for us to think about our relationship with Experian, which we announced last year, and front-end leverage, how we think about things like the relationship with Simplee and what it looks like to allow patient member consumer self-pay. So you're seeing some of those partnership strategies emerge. And yes, services is an area where we would be predisposed to want to think about skills partner strategies. That could be tech-enabling those strategies because there's an existing relationship inside a large client environment or it could be a skills partner that we partner with as part of a total solution offering.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Okay. I want to thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate the opportunity to share some of our successes in 2019 and provide an updated future view of the revenue growth and profitability. We really appreciate the insightful interactions we've had today, and I wish you all a good day.

Here's a brief run-down on what happened:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What they're saying</p><p>CES 2018 saw lots of conversation on the topic of connected cars, but the big truth remains that as the industry digs deeper into the attempt to create automated and semi-automated transport, it's becoming clearer that the challenge isn't only technical - regulatory, privacy, safety and a host of other puzzles also need to be resolved.</p><p>The slightly semi-autonomous Nissan LEAF 2018 stole plaudits at the show, while Ford promised a fully autonomous car by 2021.\u00a0In the background, BMW in 2017 introduced its first factory vehicle with CarPlay support.</p><p>All the same, to reprise Apple boss, Tim Cook, when it comes to truly smart vehicles it's: \"Going to be Christmas Eve for a while\".</p><p>What is CarPlay?</p><p>Apple's in-car iOS-based car/mobile integration system is called CarPlay. I imagine most readers are familiar with what it offers: voice control, calls, messaging, maps, information, voice control and so on.</p><p>Apple may (or may not) be developing its own carOS peer to its iOS platforms. It may (or may not) still plan to create its own vehicles.</p><p>However, when it comes to putting a little of the Apple hive mind inside today's autos, it has CarPlay, and that system saw plenty of attention at CES.</p><p>CarPlay at CES 2018</p><p>At or around the show (some announcements were made at the 2017 International Auto Show in Detroit) car manufacturers, including Hyundai, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Kia, Ford, Honda, Lexus and others all promised support for CarPlay in new vehicles. Mazda hasn't committed to a schedule for this, and long-term CarPlay hold-out, Toyota won't do so until the 2019 Avalon ships.</p><p>In related news, the 2017 International Auto Show in Detroit saw some truck manufacturers confirm future support for Apple's system. You can take a look at an extensive list of CarPlay supporting vehicles from 48 brands here.</p><p>You don't need a new car to put iOS inside your drive. When it comes to head units, CarPlay was everywhere:</p><p>Pioneer introduced its seventh compatible head unit, the MVH-1400NEX.Alpine Electronics showcased a new aftermarket 9\u2033 display called iLX-F309 that runs Apple's CarPlay system.Sony also gave a glimpse of its new XAV-AX5000 CarPlay-savvy head unit set to ship this spring.JVC/Kenwood also had CarPlay news for the show.</p><p>In other news, Ford introduced independent support for crowd-sourced navigation app Waze within its Sync 3 CarPlay-enabled vehicles.</p><p>Hit the fast lane</p><p>Apple isn't unique in offering CarPlay.</p><p>There's Android and auto electronics firms and big auto brands all offer their own take on mobile/motor integration. They don't trust the big tech firms and want to be able to collect more customer data as they seek future income streams. This makes it a competitive space, and while Apple can rely on the iOS walled garden to help it build a platform, it must also work to improve its offer.</p><p>One way it might make its offer more attractive might be to partner with Gracenote to make that company's newly-introduced at CES 2018 AM/FM app-based radio support through iOS more widely available.</p><p>The Mercedes-Benz MBUX infotainment system attracted plenty of positive interest at CES this year.</p><p>This will come as standard in A-Class vehicles from the firm. It offers the kind of features you expect (such as voice and music control), but adds a host of integration features, too: you can even control seat positioning and vehicle lighting with this system.</p><p>Driving things forward</p><p>That's the kind of vehicle integration must be a lovely dream for Apple and Google engineers attempting to improve their solutions.</p><p>Right now, auto makers seem unready to deliver integration to that extent, and Apple may need to figure out some way to open up CarPlay if it wants to avoid being left behind. Auto brands are already building voice assistant tech from other firms into their cars, and once they do that integrations like seat control cannot be too far behind.</p><p>Meanwhile, Alexa is also becoming an entity in this section of the space.</p><p>It is possible that Amazon's edge in smart speaker tech could in future become an advantage here - but Apple is thought to be on the cusp of updating Siri in preparation for the delayed HomePod introduction.</p><p>Will the company be ready to bring in some of the lessons it's learned from its initial work developing Apple Car? I don't think so - yet - but there's clearly work required if it wants to bring CarPlay up to speed.</p><p>\u00a0Google+?\u00a0If you use social media and happen to be a Google+ user, why not\u00a0join\u00a0AppleHolic's Kool Aid Corner community\u00a0and get involved with the conversation as we pursue the spirit of the New Model Apple?</p><p>Got a story? Please\u00a0drop me a line via Twitter\u00a0and let me know. I'd like it if you chose to follow me there so I can let you know about new articles I publish and reports I find.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPWLD-3248588</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPWLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RF7-XNK1-DY58-D1GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6943</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><timeReceived>05:18 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 IDG Communications, Inc.

Others are already generating revenue. Three of the winners were back from last year's list as they made interesting advances in their efforts to change the world, or my face[3]. P...entures' Opte, Zero Mass Water, and Impossible Foods have taken impressive strides in the last 12 months. I've expanded the group to include a few more fresh winners, so we've got 14 on the list this year. I'm glad I traveled the extra distance to see some of these products because they make me a believer again. It's easy to get jaded and dismiss everything. It's tempting to skip the show. But I always find that my curiosity takes me back to Las Vegas in search of the magical products that will change our lives. Some of these picks may not seem impressive on first glance. But they all caught my attention and stayed in my mind throughout the week. I feel like I got another glimpse into our future at CES, just as I have for the last 23 years or so. I've included videos where I have them, and I hope you enjoy the ride.Bzigo indoor mosquito detector[4] To our great agitation, mosquitoes are adept at avoiding human vision and then attacking us when we aren't looking. But now we can fight back with computer vision and a laser pointer. Bzigo spent a few years researching how to spot buzzing mosquitoes, and it showed up at CES with a prototype. Bzigo's infrared camera uses unique optics and has a processor running computer vision algorithms to actively scan the room, differentiating between a mosquito and other pixel-sized signals, such as dust or sensor noise. Bzigo trained its AI to recognize mosquitos and their erratic flight patterns. Then it follows them until they get tired and land. Ben Resnick, head of marketing, said in an interview that the product then shines a laser pointer on the spot and it notifies you by a text message that it has found a mosquito. You can then go and kill it. The team figured it can't use the laser to kill the mosquito because it's dangerous to have a high-powered laser zapping things in your home. But the tough part is finding where the mosquito lands.Delta Airlines Guardian XO Exoskeleton[5]Above: Guardian XO is an exoskeleton for Delta's baggage handlers Image Credit: DeltaThe mechs are coming. Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastian showed up to give a keynote speech at CES 2020, and much to our surprise, he brought technology with him. Bastian and Sarcos Robotics showed off Guardian XO, an exoskeleton that operates just like a mech suit from movies like Aliens. But instead of killing Xenomorphs, this exoskeleton lets luggage handlers save their backs. It enables them to pick up objects that are 20 times heavier than normal. An employee could lift 200 pounds continuously for eight hours. Delta could implement the tech for baggage handlers as early as this year.MedWand[6]MedWand aims to fulfill the potential of telemedicine, inspired by the Star Trek Tricorder, a magical device carried by Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy in the 1960s television show that could diagnose and heal injured people, said Samir Qamar, CEO of MedWand. MedWand has 10 different medical tools, such as a stethoscope, all built into a small handheld device that has software and a camera. It doesn't do any healing yet, but it can broadcast test results from the patient to the doctor, who can then conduct an office visit remotely. In real time, the doctor can collect a lot of vital signs and detect and follow numerous medical conditions from across town or around the world. As a physician, Qamar is biased toward allowing doctors to do the diagnosis themselves, rather than having the MedWand use AI to figure out what's wrong. The device is expected to be $400, and approval from the Food and Drug Administration is pending.Hyundai S-A1 flying taxi[7]Above: Hyundai's prototype for an Uber flying taxi. Image Credit: Dean TakahashiHyundai and Uber showed off a prototype for a flying car, an innovation that inventors have dreamed about for more than 100 years. During its press event, Hyundai showed a small-scale model and a VR trailer of what a future city could look like, with ground transportation hubs where automated shuttles could deliver people. The passengers could then hop aboard a four-seat taxi with a couple of vertical take-off and landing engines. At Hyundai's booth, the company displayed a full-scale prototype. The companies still have a long way to go in solving problems like regulatory approval, battery life, and other details. The aircraft has a range of 60 miles, could go 180 miles per hour, and fly 1,000 to 2,000 feet above ground. Let's hope these guys will get us where we need to go safely.Toyota's Woven City[8] This connected city of the future is purely an idea at this point. But Akio Toyoda, CEO of Toyota[9], gushed with excitement about it, and he said the automotive company is quite serious about building the town on the site of a former car factory in Japan. Toyota Woven City will combine a wide array of technologies, including robotics, smart homes, autonomous vehicles, the internet of things, digital health, and sustainable energy. It will be built on 175 acres of land. It will have streets with three types of lanes: pedestrians, bicycles and scooters, and autonomous vehicles. The idea is to test how to create a city from the ground up. The company hopes to house Toyota researchers and employees, families, retirees, retailers, students, and more. The company will build the city as a virtual world first, to test ideas and learn from mistakes, Toyoda said. 1 2[10] View All[11] [ 1]: <url

What new artificial intelligence service will blossom to become the next Amazon Alexa or Google Home? Can self-driving car technology take a meaningful step forward?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CES, the sprawling consumer electronics trade show that opens Tuesday and runs through Friday in Las Vegas, may provide a clue when it serves up a first look at the hot technology trends for the year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Will the rise of video streaming services accelerate following the successful launch of Disney Plus late in 2019? Are high resolution 8K TVs ready for prime time? What does the future hold for e-sports and smart cities?</p><p>Companies will launch products or demonstrate technologies in all of these categories and more at CES.</p><p>\"The technology trends that are driving a lot of what is happening at the show is the rollout of 5G as well as artificial intelligence - be it in transportation, health care and a variety of other industries,\" said Karen Chupka, executive vice-president of CES for the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on the show. \"Those two trends are showing up in almost all categories across the show.\"</p><p>CES is expected to bring 170,000 attendees to the Las Vegas Convention Center and nearby venues - 60,000 of whom come from outside the U.S. Some 4,500 exhibitors will take over 2.9 million square feet for the show.</p><p>It is the world's biggest circus tent for consumer electronics, where all kinds of interesting technologies and cool gadgets vie for attention. About 40 San Diego area companies will exhibit, including cellular technology giant Qualcomm, Rancho Bernardo's Sony Electronics, gaming/e-sports outfit Turtle Beach Corp., mobile hot spot maker Inseego, and mobile health records provider Humetrix.</p><p>Over the course of the show, CES spotlights hot button issues in tech. This year it's privacy. Apple, which hasn't directly participated in CES for more than 20 years, has made privacy a focal point of its marketing. On Tuesday, Apple's Senior Director of Global Privacy, Jane Horvath, is scheduled to join Facebook Chief Privacy Officer Erin Eagan, U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter and others in a roundtable discussion on what consumers can expect in terms of privacy with their electronics.</p><p>Here's a look at some additional trends expected to be showcased at the show.</p><p>8K, streaming and OLED</p><p>TVs are among the most eye-catching products at CES. This year, a top story line will be whether manufacturers try to push super high resolution 8K televisions into the mainstream market.</p><p>8K TVs are available today from Samsung, Sony and others. These ultra-vivid screens are expensive, however, and they typically come in large screen sizes of 55 inches and above. That makes them a niche product.</p><p>\"What I am curious to see is whether manufacturers expand on 8K and make big announcements around full lineups of 8K TVs that are much more affordably priced than they are now,\" said Paul Gagnon, executive director for Consumer Electronics Research and Analysis for IHS-Markit.</p><p>For now, there is very little that can be viewed in 8K, so TV makers would be trying to convince consumers to upgrade based on 8K content coming sometime down the road, said Gagnon.</p><p>Another thing to watch is how the popularity of streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu and Disney-Plus plays out for TV makers.</p><p>\"Streaming services are one of the most important reasons why people buy new TVs,\" said Gagnon. \"If you have a six- or seven-year-old smart TV, it might not necessarily work with the new streaming services. So a lot of people are upgrading to get access.\"</p><p>In addition, 2020 could be a pivotal year for OLED TVs, which serve up very crisp picture quality on ultrathin screens.</p><p>OLED TVs remain expensive, especially when compared with LCD TVs that sometimes are one-third the price for the same screen size. For instance, where an OLED TV can currently be purchased in the range of $1,500 to $2,000, an LCD set in an equivalent size can be had for $500.</p><p>\"There has been a slowdown in OLED sales worldwide because of how fast LCD prices have fallen in 2019,\" said Gagnon. \"It is not unreasonable to say that for the OLED TV category, it is a make or break year in 2020. There has to be some significant movement on pricing.\"</p><p>5G Momentum</p><p>Mobile network operators worldwide, including Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;amp;T and Sprint in the U.S., began rolling out faster, more reliable 5G cellular networks in 2019, and coverage is expected to expand dramatically this year.</p><p>While smartphones will lead the way for 5G, these new networks have been designed to enable wireless connectivity to a much broader array of devices, from cars to stoplights to health gadgets to environmental sensors.</p><p>\"5G is rolling out,\" said Gagnon. \"There are 5G products in the marketplace, so I think we'll see a lot of that at CES, and not just phones, but in other products, too.</p><p>\"We'll see some announcements from the big personal computer makers about 5G modems being embedded in laptops, for example,\" he continued. \"And certainly in automotive we are going to see some things around 5G.\"</p><p>Connected Vehicles</p><p>Top automakers have been coming to CES for years to show off the latest driver assist, navigation and infotainment systems. This year is no different, with the march toward autonomous vehicles underpinning a lot of what carmakers are doing.</p><p>Qualcomm is expected to make news at CES on the autonomy front. The San Diego company has established itself as a key supplier of connectivity, telematics, and infotainment systems to the auto industry. Now Qualcomm is making the leap into autonomous driving, offering up a technology system to power self-driving vehicles.</p><p>Details will be released at the show. But the move isn't a surprise. The company received regulatory permission in 2017 to test self-driving cars in San Diego County. It has conducted experiments on streets near its headquarters and on local highways. One of the most recent tests occurred in October when a portion of Highway 905 was closed while three Qualcomm self-driving cars manoeuvred along the roadway.</p><p>\"I think we have a fantastic starting point,\" said Nakul Duggal, senior vice-president and head of automotive product management for Qualcomm. \"Autonomous driving is just going to be transformative to the auto industry because it is going to bring the right technologies - machine learning, sensors and really advanced capabilities to the next generations of cars. I know our customers who have been working with us (in telematics and infotainment) are going to be very excited to see what we have to offer in these new categories.\"</p><p>Qualcomm is also touting CV2X, or Cellular Vehicle to Everything, at the show. This peer-to-peer technology lets vehicles communicate directly with other nearby vehicles and smart cities infrastructure at distances beyond line of sight. The technology is in its early stages of deployment, but Ford and several other carmakers are backing it.</p><p>\"CV2X is going to be a game changer for the industry,\" said Duggal. \"It is going to be directly responsible for avoiding accidents and saving lives.\"</p><p>Artificial Intelligence</p><p>Digital devices throw off a lot of data. Making sense of it so it's useful often relies on what's known as artificial intelligence.</p><p>These algorithms hunt for patterns. Probably the most common AI experience for many people is having targeted digital ads pop up based on an internet search.</p><p>But AI powers a lot more than that. Voice assistants, language translation, biometrics, facial detection and recognition all rely on AI. Those cool smartphone camera filters come from AI. So does the processing that creates focused, centred photos even in low light.</p><p>Much of the heavy lifting for AI occurs in data centres. But powerful processors on devices these days are bringing AI closer to users.</p><p>Device-based AI chips will likely find their way into a number of consumer devices this year, ranging from smartphones and smart speakers to wearables, according to consulting firm Deloitte's Technology, Media and Telecommunications Forecast for 2020.</p><p>Deloitte predicts that on-device AI will be popular with businesses too. Robotics, smart cities sensors, security cameras, environmental sensors and other internet of Things gadgets could tap the technology to deliver insights from data closer to the source.</p><p>\"John Deere is back this year with how AI is transforming the farming world,\" said Chupka, the executive vice-president for CES. \"Companies realize they need to develop a technology strategy for their own growth, and CES is the place where people showcase that.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020010656792291</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXD-CM41-F103-3049-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1452\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

Tulsi Gabbard is suing Google 'over claims that the tech behemoth violated her right to 'free speech.'' In a complaint filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, 'Gabbard alleged Google censored her presidential campaign when it suspended their advertising account for several hours last month,' according to the report. The Hawaii Democrat is seeking $50 million in damages. If Gabbard's allegations turn out to be true, it will represent a remarkable point in modern American history: a tech company trying to take down a presidential candidate. </p><p>But the lawsuit also raises questions about whether Gabbard, whose campaign has failed to gain much support in terms of polling numbers and financial contributions, is trying to grab headlines to raise her profile. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard formally announced her run for president in Waikiki in February. On Thursday she sued Google, claiming the company violated her First Amendment rights.Cory Lum/Civil Beat Indeed, The Hill observes that Gabbard's lawsuit 'marks the first time a presidential contender has sued a large technology company over such claims.' A spokesperson for Google attributed the brief suspension to sudden 'large spending changes' that set off Google's automated systems. The Gabbard campaign did not immediately respond to Civil Beat's request for comment Thursday. The 36-page complaint[2] was filed by the law firm of Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price ...cht[3], which has offices in Los Angeles, Boston, Cleveland, New York and Washington, D.C. Often reading like a campaign brochure, the complaint identifies Gabbard as 'a candidate millions of Americans want to hear from.'Google 'Plays Favorites'Gabbard's name is mentioned no less than 90 times in the lawsuit, many times by only her first name \u2014 as in 'With this lawsuit, Tulsi seeks to stop Google from further intermeddling in the 2020 United States Presidential Election.' While Google is identified as 'one of the largest forums for political speech in the entire world,' in practice the company 'plays favorites, with no warning, no transparency \u2014 and no accountability (until now),' the suit says. At the core of the complaint is this remarkable scenario to suggest what may have happened the day after the first Democratic presidential debate in late June:'On June 28, 2019 \u2014 at the height of Gabbard's popularity among Internet searchers in the immediate hours after the debate ended, and in the thick of the critical post-debate period (when television viewers, radio listeners, newspaper readers, and millions of other Americans are discussing and searching for presidential candidates), Google suspended Tulsi's Google Ads account without warning. 'For hours, as millions of Americans searched Google for information about Tulsi, and as Tulsi was trying, through Google, to speak to them, her Google Ads account was arbitrarily and forcibly taken offline.'If that really happened, and if it can be proved in court, it's shocking. The complaint accuses Google of trying to undermine Gabbard's campaign, thus causing 'irreparable damage' \u2014 hence the legal demand for $50 million. But why exactly the Mountain View, California-based Google, whose parent company Alphabet reported $137 billion in revenue in 2018, would want to target Gabbard is not made clear in the complaint. The complaint does say that Gabbard's has 'vocally called for greater regulation and oversight' of giant tech companies including Google. But Gabbard is not widely seen as a crusader on the issue, like U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who in March called for the breakup[4] of Amazon and Facebook. The lawsuit includes a tweet from Gabbard herself showing that she agrees with Warren and that she 'will be introducing similar legislation in the House.' But press releases from Gabbard's office since that time[5] do not mention any such legislation.Google Loves Top DemsThe lawsuit also alleges that Google is biased toward Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, who the lawsuit identifies as major recipients of donations from 'Google-Affiliated donors.' The suit states, 'Not surprisingly, the Obama Administration championed many of the top policies on Google's wish list, while Obama's Federal Trade Commission closed its antitrust investigation of the company without any meaningful sanctions.' Eric Schmidt, chairman of Alphabet, is identified as having counseled Clinton on strategy during her 2016 presidential campaign and that Google's 'pro-Clinton search bias may have shifted as many as 2.6 million votes to Clinton during the 2016 election.' While Google is portrayed as favoring Democrats \u2014 but not Gabbard \u2014 it is also depicted as opposing Republicans. Google co-founder Sergey Brin and other high-ranking Google officers are said to have been dismayed by the election of Donald Trump. This screen shot is taken from a June 27 email from Tulsi 2020 with the subject matter line, 'Tulsi won the 1st debate.' 'Their alarm may have been well-founded: In May of this year, Trump's Department of Justice announced it was exploring whether to open a case against Google for potential antitrust violations,' the suit says. In short, Gabbard contends that Google tried to damage her campaign by 'tweaking its search algorithm' to disfavor her, blocking the candidate from its ad platforms and keeping her communications from 'getting to interested voters' who use Gmail for email communications. But the accusations seem to contradict some earlier claims of the Gabbard campaign. On the night of that first debate \u2014 June 27 \u2014 Tulsi 2020 emailed supporters proclaiming in the subject line, 'Tulsi Gabbard Shines in Breakthrough Performance at NBC's Democratic Debate.' What was the source for this claim? Google. 'She has been trending online throughout the country ever since with her name surging to the very top of Google's top searched candidate list for night one,' the campaign said.'Clear And Present Danger'Whatever the merits of the complaint against Google, the Tulsi 2020 campaign on Thursday sent out an email request for donations citing the lawsuit as a reason to contribute. 'Google controls 88 percent of all internet search in the United States - essentially giving it control over our access to information' the campaign said. 'That's one reason why Tulsi has been a vocal proponent of breaking up the tech monopolies.' The email pitch adds, 'Big Tech's dominance represents a clear and present danger to our democracy.' Yours for $4.99: 'Show your support for Tulsi with this union-made, made-in-the-usa full-color bumper sticker! The sticker is made from an easily removable white vinyl.' Gabbard's lawsuit comes as CNN is set to air two nights of Democratic National Committee debates Tuesday and Wednesday. The candidate made headlines[6] earlier this week saying that another presidential candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), is not qualified to serve as commander in chief. Her campaign, meantime, has sent out multiple requests for donations so that she can meet the polling and donation threshold needed to qualify for the third round of DNC debates in September. She's not there yet. As Civil Beat reported last month[7], Gabbard's campaign is spending more than it is raising, and took in less money during the second quarter of the year than during the first. According to Real Clear Politics, polling data show Gabbard averaging 1.2% support[8], far behind Harris, former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). I'll give Gabbard credit: She's a tireless campaigner, and she knows how to get media attention. Still, it was five days after the telescope protests on Mauna Kea began before she finally issued a statement on the crisis in her own backyard. She appears to have done so on her way to Puerto Rico, where she again made headlines calling for the resignation of the U.S. territory's governor \u2014 even though Puerto Rican citizens can't vote for the U.S. president in the general election. The show of solidarity for Puerto Ricans garnered Gabbard more headlines. A Google search late Thursday for 'Puerto Rico + Tulsi Gabbard' turned up about 300,000 results. But a search for 'Puerto Rico + Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,' who also flew to Puerto Rico, turned up about 5,030,000 results. Of course, it could be that Google is biased.Read the complaint: Sign up for our FREE morning newsletter and face each day more informed.    Sorry. That's an invalid e-mail.   Thanks!

His post-hearing comments again sought financial sector involvement as Senate Commerce Committee privacy talks continue (see 1904040073).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., met with Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg Tuesday, an aide said. A company spokesperson said Sandberg was in Washington for regulatory framework discussions with policymakers, but the trip didn't concern the FTC. She was also expected to meet with civil rights groups, the company said.</p><p>Also Tuesday, Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., reintroduced legislation. It would provide consumer compensation for data breaches, mandatory penalties for credit reporting agencies and granting the FTC \"more direct supervisory authority\" over CRAs.</p><p>Crapo said Banking isn't planning to deliver separate legislation for the financial sector, but the question is whether the U.S. should continue its sectoral approach. If it does, lawmakers need to collaborate, he said. He declined to endorse Warner's bill. He said, \"The notion that we need to go further in this area and that the enforcement portion of our law may need to be beefed up, I do think, is probably correct.\"</p><p>The FTC \"has been asleep at the switch\" on data breaches like Equifax and Facebook, Warner told reporters. He said industry regards sloppiness as the \"cost of doing business.\" Warner's also working on a bill on data portability, the right to know about collection and the value of consumer data for platforms like Facebook and Google: \"If you had those valuations out there, new companies might be able to come in and disintermediate.\" Warner cited his bill with Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., dealing with dark patterns (see 1904090084). Dark patterns refer to deceptive user interfaces platforms allegedly use to manipulate consumers into sharing personal data.</p><p>Banking's data privacy hearing featured testimony from Pinboard founder Maciej Ceglowski, German Marshall Fund Senior Fellow Peter Chase and PwC Privacy and Consumer Protection Leader Jay Cline. The lesson from Equifax is that there's no punishment for blatant incompetence, Ceglowski testified. The EU's general data protection regulation is a good example of a law with teeth to address companies without regard for consumer data protection, he said, describing his business as small.</p><p>Ceglowski countered arguments from big tech against heavy-handed regulation like the GDPR. Cline argued during the hearing against the GDPR's 72-hour breach notification requirement. Sometimes, there are more questions than answers within 72 hours of a breach, he said. Cline said many companies are asking if the GDPR is going to become the default, global standard, saying many financial sector companies are preparing for that scenario. Ceglowski urged strict limits on industry data retention and greater information on how algorithms are affecting society.</p><p>Ceglowski conceded a law like the GDPR isn't a panacea, saying it doesn't fully address the issue of data brokers. Crapo cited data brokers as a major issue, saying it's difficult for consumers to consent to their practices when they don't deal directly with the brokers: \"There's not very obvious consent.\"</p><p>The GDPR recognizes direct marketing is useful, but it doesn't create a lot of flexibility to opt out of personalized advertising, Chase said, noting he spent about 25 years working on economic relations between the U.S. and the EU. He lauded the GDPR's requirements for consent in specific uses of data collection and sharing. This unambiguous consent means companies can't bundle permissions, helping cut out data brokers, he said.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica is an example of how a \"big pile\" of seemingly harmless data can be used for very harmful purposes, ranking member Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said. He also raised concerns about how targeted online ads contribute to the decline of print journalism. Ceglowski agreed, saying as targeting has shifted to individuals, it's ultimately Facebook and Google that benefit.</p><p>If the KGB had the data tools of Facebook and Google, the Soviet Union would have endured, Warner said during the hearing. Many consumers view these services as free, but he described platforms as \"giant\" sucking machines, extracting the data out of U.S. citizens. Data portability is difficult under an oligopoly, Ceglowski said, arguing Facebook will finds ways to extract data regardless of portability. \"My necktie is better regulated than my entire industry,\" he said.</p><p>Unless companies take a significant financial hit during a breach, there's no incentive to invest in cybersecurity, Warren said, citing her bill as a solution. The FTC and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have done \"nothing\" to deter such behavior, she said. She also blamed Equifax for not following \"best practices.\" Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., criticized Congress for not doing anything to tighten the Fair Credit Reporting Act. At the conclusion of the hearing, Crapo said, unlike on other issues on Capitol Hill, there's enough broad agreement on this to reach consensus.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2C-Y0S1-JC8G-80KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 08, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002M0H</classCode><className>EQUIFAX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The US congressman who chaired Wednesday's big tech antitrust hearing said Mark Zuckerberg's testimony proves Facebook displayed \"classic monopoly behavior\" and should be broken up.Rep. David Cicilline was interviewed Wednesday night after the House hearing on Axios \"Re:Cap\" podcast[5], where he said Facebook showed the clearest form of anticompetitive behavior. Cicilline told Axios that Zuckerberg's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were done as a way to control Facebook competitors.\"As a result he maintained and enlarged his market dominance,\" Cicilline said in the Axios interview. </p><p>\"That's a classic action of a monopolist.\"A trove of internal Facebook emails and text messages were also unveiled during Wednesday's hearing to demonstrate possible anticompetitive practices taken during the company acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. Lawmakers published several email threads and online chat logs showing conversations that showed the mindset and thinking of Zuckerberg and various Facebook executives at the time.\"I think in particular, when you think about Facebook \u2014 which Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged in this hearing \u2014 his acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram were part of a play to both buy a competitor and maintain his monopoly power, or dominance,\" Cicilline repeated. \"That's classic monopoly behavior.\"In emails Zuckerberg sent in 2012 obtained by The Verge, Zuckerberg called Instagram[6] a \"threat,\" and reasoned that[7] buying Instagram may be a way to successfully neutralize its success. Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom also voiced concerns Zuckerberg would go into \"destroy mode\"[8] if he didn't agree to Facebook buying Instagram.During the hearing, Zuckerberg acknowledged to lawmakers that Facebook saw Instagram as both \"a competitor and a complement to our services.\"Although Facebook's purchases of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 weren't challenged at the time, lawmakers at Wednesday's hearing heavily scrutinized the company's history.Zuckerberg \u2014 as well as the CEOs of Apple, Google, and Amazon \u2014 appeared in front of Congress to answer lawmakers' questions about any potential violations of antitrust regulations. Cicilline appeared to single out Facebook after the hearing.Cicilline told Axios that the committee's report is expected to come out in late August or early September Read the original article on Business Insider[9] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/watch-live-congress-big-tech-antitrust-apple-google-facebook-amazon-2020-7\">https://www.businessinsider.com/watch-live-congress-big-tech-antitrust-apple-google-facebook-amazon-2020-7</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/zuckerberg-2012-instagram-threat-to-facebook-harm-business-2020-7\">https://www.businessinsider.com/zuckerberg-2012-instagram-threat-to-facebook-harm-business-2020-7</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/big-tech-hearing-cicilline-facebook-apple-google-amazon-230cca9a-eadc-4293-ad73-fc9c41696d20.html\">https://www.axios.com/big-tech-hearing-cicilline-facebook-apple-google-amazon-230cca9a-eadc-4293-ad73-fc9c41696d20.html</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/big-tech-hearing-cicilline-facebook-apple-google-amazon-230cca9a-eadc-4293-ad73-fc9c41696d20.html\">https://www.axios.com/big-tech-hearing-cicilline-facebook-apple-google-amazon-230cca9a-eadc-4293-ad73-fc9c41696d20.html</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/0006334000063341.pdf\">https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/0006334000063341.pdf</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/0006322000063223.pdf\">https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/0006322000063223.pdf</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-cofounder-feared-zuckerberg-destroy-mode-facebook-acquisition-texts-2020-7\">https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-cofounder-feared-zuckerberg-destroy-mode-facebook-acquisition-texts-2020-7</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-david-cicilline-broken-up-antitrust-behavior-instagram-whatsapp-acquistion-2020-7\">https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-david-cicilline-broken-up-antitrust-behavior-instagram-whatsapp-acquistion-2020-7</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BZIN105645159613655049875776100211</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BZIN-5352</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GF-FT81-JCMN-Y2M8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><timeReceived>7:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Business Insider</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Text messages and internal emails unveil...</p><p>At Wednesday's big tech antitrust hearing , lawmakers grilled Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg about the company's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp as part of an investigation into possible monopolistic practices.  Text messages and internal emails unveiled during the hearing showed how Zuckerberg viewed both apps as competitors that could harm Facebook's business, and saw their acquisitions partly as an attempt to \"neutralize\" them.  The hearing, part of the House Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee's inquiry into big tech, saw the CEOs of Apple, Amazon, and Google testifying alongside Zuckerberg.  After the event, David Cicilline , the chair of the antitrust subcommittee, told Axios' \"Re:Cap\" podcast that he thought Facebook's testimony exhibited signs of \"classic monopoly behavior\" and that the company should be broken up.   The US congressman who chaired Wednesday's big tech antitrust hearing said Mark Zuckerberg's testimony proves Facebook displayed \"classic monopoly behavior\" and should be broken up.    Rep. David Cicilline was interviewed Wednesday night after the House hearing on Axios \"Re:Cap\" podcast , where he said Facebook showed the clearest form of anticompetitive behavior. Cicilline told Axios that Zuckerberg's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were done as a way to control Facebook competitors.  \"As a result he maintained and enlarged his market dominance,\" Cicilline said in the Axios interview. \"That's a classic action of a monopolist.\"A trove of internal Facebook emails and text messages were also unveiled during Wednesday's hearing to demonstrate possible anticompetitive practices taken during the company acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. Lawmakers published several email threads and online chat logs showing conversations that showed the mindset and thinking of Zuckerberg and various Facebook executives at the time.  \"I think in particular, when you think about Facebook \u2014 which Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged in this hearing \u2014 his acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram were part of a play to both buy a competitor and maintain his monopoly power, or dominance,\" Cicilline repeated. \"That's classic monopoly behavior.\"  In emails Zuckerberg sent in 2012 obtained by The Verge, Zuckerberg called Instagram a \"threat,\" and reasoned that buying Instagram may be a way to successfully neutralize its success. Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom also voiced concerns Zuckerberg would go into \"destroy mode\" if he didn't agree to Facebook buying Instagram.    During the hearing, Zuckerberg acknowledged to lawmakers that Facebook saw Instagram as both \"a competitor and a complement to our services.\"  Although Facebook's purchases of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 weren't challenged at the time, lawmakers at Wednesday's hearing heavily scrutinized the company's history. Zuckerberg \u2014 as well as the CEOs of Apple, Google, and Amazon \u2014 appeared in front of Congress to answer lawmakers' questions about any potential violations of antitrust regulations. Cicilline appeared to single out Facebook after the hearing.  Cicilline told Axios that the committee's report is expected to come out in late August or early September</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42724261546</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GD-YRD1-JCSC-J51T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"574\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Business Insider India</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Securities and Exchange Commission thinks so.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The US regulator this week proposed companies of any size could ?(EURO)oetest the waters?(EURO) for a potential initial public offering by gauging investor interest ahead of time.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The proposal builds on the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or Jobs Act, which in 2012 established that companies with less than about US$1 billion of annual revenue could test the waters ahead of an initial public offering.  </p><p>It would not be the first time the SEC has built on the Jobs Act in a bid to reverse a trend that has resulted in a decline in the number of public companies in the US. In 2017 the regulator extended to all companies the right to file initial IPO paperwork confidentially.  </p><p>Jay Clayton, the SEC chairman, has identified the issue as a priority amid warnings the public listing pool has grown shallow. From 1980 to 2000 an average of 310 companies went public a year, a figure that since 2001 has averaged 110 a year, says Jay Ritter, a business professor at the University of Florida.  </p><p>Unsurprisingly, companies have rather liked the opportunity to file early IPO paperwork confidentially and sort out any issues with the SEC away from prying eyes. It also keeps information out of the hands of rivals for a longer period ?(EURO)\" or indeed, forever ?(EURO)\" if the company decides not to proceed with a public listing. More than 85 per cent of all US IPOs in 2017 and 2018 began the process this way, according to Dealogic.  </p><p>The SEC?(EURO)(TM)s proposal has been cheered by those whose fortunes are tied to the IPO industry. For one, it eliminates potential confusion as to who can and cannot do it, lawyers said. The logic is companies will have a better idea of the price they may get in advance. Clayton said it would ?(EURO)oeallow companies to more effectively consult with investors and better identify information that is important to them in advance of a public offering?(EURO).  </p><p>Yet the SEC?(EURO)?s efforts raise questions about transparency and fairness. While the plan deserves ?(EURO)oestrong consideration?(EURO), Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, adds: ?(EURO)oeWe have some concern on the potential for unfair treatment of different investors in the US context, given public disclosures are the hallmark of our strong markets for listed companies?(EURO).  </p><p>Companies have liked the chance to file early IPO paperwork confidentially and sort out any issues with the SEC away from prying eyes. Small and mid-sized investors have long complained about being sidelined in IPOs where the roadshow can include top executives having one-on-one meetings with large, influential investors who then receive the biggest allocations.  </p><p>The moves run counter to a recent attempt by some companies to democratise the IPO process, Bertsch said. Slack, the workplace messaging app, plans to follow Spotify in bypassing the traditional IPO process by pursuing a direct listing in which the shares are available to everyone at the same time.  </p><p>Regardless of whether you see the Jobs Act reforms as progress, some argue they will do little to drive more public listings. Ritter says the effects would prove ?(EURO)oerelatively minor?(EURO) when set against the forces curtailing the number of IPOs.  </p><p>The first is the rapid growth of private funding ?(EURO)\" with cash pouring in from venture capitalists, sovereign wealth funds, family offices and mutual funds such as Fidelity Investments ?(EURO)\" that young companies can turn to before or instead of going public.

Maybe you are too. Not just a baseball guy, but one who was never close to good enough to play the game as an adult. Managed the kids in youth leagues, and they were pretty good, but this just wasn't their favorite sport. They were soccer guys. Had to learn the nuances of a sport that had just been a peripheral game in my own youth, either that or not coach my own kids. Not acceptable. At least not for me, but there were nights. Nights when we would still go to the batting cages. Nights when there were long lines for the 70 mph, and 80 mph cages, but not the 90+ mph cage. Nobody wanted any of that. You know me, and if you know me, then you know how athletic I become (in my mind) if my wife/girlfriend (same person) or my kids are watching. Of course I found a way to hit the ball in that cage, even if I had to start my swing a bit early and guess a little on location. I mean, c'mon. It's showtime. The wife and kids think I am \"that\" guy. I have to hit a couple of line drives. Either that or we stay all night.</p><p>The times have changed. The kids are no longer kids. The wife has not thought about a batting cage or a soccer game in a long time. Been even longer since she sat in the stands at one of my hockey games with either my home/road jersey on. Nothing makes a guy play harder than a gal in the stands wearing his number. Nothing. Those decades have passed into memories. Happy ones. Still, I find myself playing the game, this game... making a living, and trying to make sure those around me are \"okay\", harder than ever. The game has evolved from one of youthful exuberance to one of risk management, but the competitive fires that burn within still come in handy. The willingness to step into the batting cage that intimidated some of the other dads, even if I have to \"trust the force\" a little bit, still comes in handy. These markets don't always make sense, ahead of time. Trust me, they do, or they will in hindsight.</p><p>Mark Twain is often credited with having said, \"History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\" I can find no evidence of Twain having said this, but someone did, and it was not me. I do think this quote however, to be something we must all take with us as we venture on our way each and every day. Sometimes we think we know the game, given our years of experience, or what we see individually as our own cognitive abilities. Yet, light passes through the twin prisms of common sense and stressful conditions. Things look different under that light.</p><p>The short version of what I am trying to say early this Monday morning is the following. A lot has been priced in. A lot still has to be. None of us know for sure. About anything. To win, one must sometimes anticipate. One will win some, and yes, even lose some. To continue to compete one must learn to be flexible enough to adapt. A little pressure is a good thing. The ending is unknowable, as there is no ending, just one's own passage into the fabric of evolution. Know how you fit. Know thy purpose. Driven by love? Indeed. A little ego maybe? Not necessarily a bad thing. Who do you want to read the map when 12 other pimple faced, camouflage clad scared kids look for leadership? The kid who's a wreck every time he's out in the jungle, or that one kid who thinks he can do this?</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Short Weeks</emphasis><br/></p><p>They say that short weeks are always long. Mostly that's because for those who work for commission or make a living off of their book (profit/loss), holidays are unwelcome events. The pressure ramps up during weeks or months with less trading days, as one's monthly bills are not reduced just because the individual was offered less opportunity to make money. One's necessary daily average profit in order to make ends meet goes higher, as does the pressure. This delicate game becomes infinitely more difficult when markets become more challenging as they are right now.</p><p>Last week was a tough one for some markets that had not experienced \"tough\" in a good while. The Nasdaq Composite finally gave up it's own 50 day SMA on Friday, closing in the red for the fifth day in six, making Tuesday's rally, decisive looking at the time, appear rather feeble. The S&amp;P 500 looks different for now, even if that broadest of large cap indices still gave up 2.5% for the week, it managed to rally enough off of the lows on Friday to basically close flat for the day, and much more importantly, hold that important line.</p><p>The level of \"angry\" for the headline averages of course, is controlled in the year 2020 by the level of exposure that any said index has to the Information Technology sector, or mega-cap big tech to be more specific. This includes a few mis-categorized names that have been designated for membership in non-tech sectors. Among the highly followed FAANG (coined by Jim Cramer) names, Amazon  , Alphabet  , and Netflix  all surrendered this important 50 day line in the sand last week as well. Even Apple  , and Facebook  had to defend that spot on Friday though technically they came out of the week in better shape than the other three.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pressure</emphasis><br/></p><p>So, where does this pressure come from? Our current environment pits what has looked to be an early vee-shaped economic recovery, supported by extremely accommodative monetary policy and the simultaneous wild loosening of fiscal policy. The problems here are that fiscal authorities (both houses of Congress) have appeared to fail the public well before the pandemic threat to not just life but economic performance has passed. Now that our legislative leaders have disappointed, this puts the Fed in a similar position. It would appear that all that can be done at this point, is to talk up inflation. While recent producer and consumer prices have surprised to the upside, without more fiscal help, this trend likely halts in place by the end of September. Just a fact.</p><p>One just has to look at U.S. Treasury yields or a Materials sector last week that led the way, but did so without the help of packaging, steel, aluminum or paper, to question future prospects for either inflation or economic growth. This leaves election risk, and not normal election risk. The markets must price in abnormal risk around the election to include the potential for a length of time necessary to determine results that markets will not like, and may not tolerate. Contested results would exacerbate this negative impact. While we know that the polls still have one candidate well in front of the other, we also know that polls mean nothing after 2016. We also know that many of the betting sites across the pond that take money on this election have it very close to 50/50.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Help On The Way?</emphasis><br/></p><p>Oh, there are a ton of events scheduled this week. Plenty of it potentially positive. The FOMC will talk to us on Wednesday. That's fine. By Tuesday, most of you will feel as if you have put in a full week. Tuesday brings us Apple's \"Time Flies\" product launch event. Expected are a new line-up of smartwatches with increased healthcare applications and improved battery life. There is also talk of maybe a new tablet launched at this event, and then another such event to be held next month for the line-up of 5G capable smartphones.</p><p>Also, on Tuesday, both Adobe  and FedEx  report quarterly earnings amid an otherwise bare week for such releases, while Kraft Heinz  , Peloton  , and Camping World  hold investor days. In addition, Salesforce  presents at the Jefferies Virtual Software Conference.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Extra !! Extra !!</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">- Nvidia confirms the planned acquisition of Arm Holdings from Softbank for a cool $40 billion.</emphasis></emphasis> Nvidia  states that Arm will indeed continue to operate the open-licensing model that has made the firm central to virtually the entire cell phone/tablet market. This deal would be expected to be immediately accretive to both non-GAAP earnings and gross margin, according to the purchaser. I like the deal for Nvidia, not only because it takes sales for the elite chip maker from little more than $9 billion to roughly $11 billion, but also because Softbank ends up with a large stake in Nvidia. Do I expect there to be multiple regulatory hurdles across several jurisdictions? Very possibly. That will cause volatility. I love Nvidia, but I almost certainly sell some this morning on this pop in the share price.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">- As excited as I am for Nvidia, I am disappointed for Microsoft.</emphasis></emphasis> News broke on Sunday night that Microsoft  was out of the bidding for TikTok, and that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Oracle </emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> had won the right to partner with ByteDance</emphasis></emphasis>to \"address\" national security concerns in the U.S., as well as beyond. Some of this cooperative deal had been priced into MSFT and will now have to be priced out, then reallocated toward ORCL. Congrats to those of you long that name. The wildcard here remains the level of participation of Walmart  , as there is talk that America's largest retailer may be involved either way.</p><p>-Plenty of news broke over the weekend, or will break soon on the Covid-19 vaccine front as well. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">For one, AstraZeneca </emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> has said that it has received confirmation form the Medicines Health Regulatory Authority (UK) that it was safe to resume clinical trials in that country</emphasis>.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">-In a CBS News interview with Margaret Brennan, Pfizer </emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> CEO Albert Bourla said the firm should know if it's leading vaccine candidate \"works or not by the end of October\".</emphasis></emphasis> Bourla put the chances of such knowledge (regarding safety and efficacy) by that date at around 60%. Investors be alert that Pfizer holds a two day investor event starting today (Monday) that will include potentially a lot more than prospective Covid vaccines. Interestingly, Moderna  , another leader in developing a vaccine in this fight will hold their own day for analysts and investors this Thursday, September 17th.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economics</emphasis> (All Times Eastern)</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">No Significant Domestic Economic Data Scheduled for Release. </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Fed</emphasis> (All Times Eastern)</p><p>Fed Blackout Period.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Today's Earnings Highlights</emphasis> (Consensus EPS Expectations)</p><p>After the Close:  (1.58)</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Facebook, Salesforce, Nvidia, and Microsoft are holdings in Jim Cramer's  .

But with a recent billion-dollar investment, Lyft may show that ride-hailing is an exception.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The word ''monopoly'' has a distinctly nefarious ring to it, conjuring up images of thuggish industrialists in smoky rooms, scheming to undermine their rivals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet in Silicon Valley, it's not at all uncommon for one company to dominate a particular field. Google is the runaway leader in online search. Facebook is the largest social network in the world by a wide margin. Amazon is far and away the biggest e-commerce site.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even among so-called unicorns - private start-ups worth $1 billion or more - de facto monopolies are already the norm. As the technology writer Om Malik argued in The New Yorker recently, ''Most competition in Silicon Valley now heads toward there being one monopolistic winner.'' Airbnb dominates the apartment rental market, Snapchat is the big player in ephemeral messaging, and Spotify stands out as the major streaming music library. And when it comes to on-demand ride services, Uber, the most valuable private technology company in the world, is the clear leader.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But while market dominance is hard to break, that doesn't stop upstarts from trying. In the case of Uber, it is Lyft that is doing its best to keep up.</p><p>Last Monday, Lyft raised an additional $1 billion from investors including General Motors, increasing its total fund-raising to $2 billion. At the same time, it announced it was developing software for self-driving cars, and teaming up with G.M. to put more drivers on the road. These moves are part of Lyft's bid to distinguish itself and avoid being muscled aside by the runaway market leader, an all-too-common experience for technology companies.</p><p>''We're gaining share in the United States,'' said John Zimmer, Lyft's president and co-founder. ''That's not what happens when one player has a complete monopoly.''</p><p>Regardless of whether Lyft and Uber can both thrive, or if there is only one big winner in the booming ride-hailing industry, dominance in and of itself is not illegal. Problems arise only when a company ''unreasonably restrains competition'' or gains and holds power ''through improper conduct,'' according to the Federal Trade Commission's definition of monopolization.</p><p>Indeed, a line of thinking celebrates monopolies. In a unanimous decision from 2004, the Supreme Court said the ability to create a monopoly was a powerful incentive that should be protected.</p><p>''The mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system,'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in that opinion. ''The opportunity to charge monopoly prices - at least for a short period - is what attracts 'business acumen' in the first place; it induces risk-taking that produces innovation and economic growth.''</p><p>In the book ''Zero to One,'' which he wrote with Blake Masters, the PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel offers tips on how to create monopolies, arguing that once achieved, they lead to more innovation.</p><p>''Monopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate,'' he writes. ''Then monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can't dream of.''</p><p>And regulators have not been cracking down on Silicon Valley. Given how many big technology companies loom large in their respective markets, there have been relatively few big antitrust actions brought against tech giants.</p><p>''This is different from the old monopolies of the industrial age,'' Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, said of technology companies.</p><p>Unlike United States Steel or Standard Oil, two of corporate history's biggest brutes, today's tech monopolies are rarely the exclusive provider of an essential commodity. Instead, many achieve their initial dominance by distinguishing themselves in a crowded marketplace, then rapidly taking market share thanks to the power of network effects - that is, the more people use a service, the more valuable that service becomes to other people, who join in and make the service all the more popular.</p><p>Network effects helped Google, Facebook and Amazon run away from their competitors, and are helping Uber today. Google wasn't the first search engine, Facebook wasn't the first social network, and Amazon wasn't the first to sell goods online. There are still many other sites for search, social and e-commerce. But despite an array of options, users keep coming back to the market leaders.</p><p>Some argue, however, that the regulatory framework needs to adjust for a new kind of market dominance.</p><p>''The underlying problem here is that antitrust regulators are only looking at consumer welfare,'' Mr. Reich said. ''They aren't looking at the long-term potential for total dominance of a network, the possibility of predatory behavior once a technology giant becomes entrenched, or political power.'' (European antitrust laws are more expansive than those in the United States, resulting in continuing actions against Google and other big tech companies.)</p><p>Along with network effects, another hallmark of today's tech monopolies is that, perhaps fearing obsolescence, they diversify. While Microsoft still makes its Windows and Office software, it also owns Skype and has a big video gaming business. Google is now a subsidiary of Alphabet, a new parent company that is also home to a health care company, a self-driving-cars division and a venture capital firm. Amazon is expanding its cloud computing and streaming-media businesses. And Facebook has diversified into messaging with WhatsApp, photos with Instagram, and virtual reality with Oculus Rift.</p><p>This, too, creates challenges for regulators. When mergers and acquisitions are part of the natural life cycle of start-ups and venture capital, it isn't easy to block deals that might hypothetically reduce competition down the road. As a result, regulators have blessed many acquisitions that, to critics, appear to be deeply anticompetitive.</p><p>Gary Reback, a lawyer who helped prompt a landmark antitrust investigation into Microsoft and is now pursuing Google in Europe, makes the case that Google bought its way to dominance in online advertising through the acquisition of DoubleClick, bought its leadership in mobile by purchasing Android and bought its strong mapping franchise in the deal for Waze. Similarly, Facebook bought two of its nearest rivals, WhatsApp and Instagram. If any of those deals had been blocked, Mr. Reback argues, behemoths like Google and Facebook might today be facing more concerted competition.</p><p>''Once one of these companies gets a monopoly, it's easy to spread the monopoly to adjacent markets by acquisition,'' Mr. Reback said. ''You would think antitrust enforcers would know this by now.''</p><p>While monopolies in the tech industry are perhaps easier than ever to achieve, industry experts contend they are also more vulnerable than ever before. The advent of the smartphone and widespread access to broadband Internet connectivity have democratized access to creative new technologies.</p><p>''Sun Microsystems. EMC. Cisco. All these were considered the dominant market players in their category at the time,'' said Rich Wong, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners. ''Then the vast majority of them got whacked by this thing called the cloud.''</p><p>And of course, billions of people browse the web without Google, use social apps other than Facebook, and shop on websites other than Amazon. Though no upstarts have replaced them yet, none are immune to disruption.</p><p>As for Uber, if it's not a monopoly already, it is the giant in the ride-hailing market, at least in the United States. One rival, Sidecar, shut down last month, and Lyft is its last meaningful competitor on a national scale. (Uber faces a tougher road abroad, where it is tangling with regulators in Europe, recently withdrew from Frankfurt and is fighting against entrenched rivals in China and other international markets.)</p><p>As the underdog, Lyft is trying to put more drivers on the road and acquire new users. Like Uber, the company is private, and neither shares much information about performance. But Mr. Zimmer said the company was quickly increasing market share in the United States. He also sees the on-demand ride business as different from search or social media and more like telecommunications companies, where several big competitors can compete on service.</p><p>''Just like AT&amp;T and Verizon need three bars of coverage,'' he said, ''we get down to two to three minutes of wait time for a vehicle to arrive. Once it gets to that point, there's no difference in behavior between services. That's when you compete on experience.''</p><p>Still, Lyft will be hard pressed to unseat Uber.</p><p>''The network effects hold competition at stiff arm's length,'' said Steve Cheney, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Estimote, a micro-location platform for mobile developers.</p><p>Or perhaps the ride-hailing market is big enough for both Uber and Lyft. Monopolies don't necessarily mean there is no competition whatsoever.  Even Google has not managed to squash every other search engine.</p><p>''Microsoft has a decent search business. A lot of Yahoo's profits still come from searches on Yahoo properties,'' said Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital. ''It's more of a 'winner takes most' than a 'winner takes all' phenomenon.''</p><p>Should that be the case in the ride-hailing industry, Uber and Lyft may become something truly competitive by Silicon Valley standards: a duopoly.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-2093354</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HTT-VMV1-JC85-N3VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1614\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International New York Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 11, 2016 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That turbulent period saw sweeping social movements and reforms, including women's suffrage, the rise of labor unions, a crackdown child labor \u2014 and the regulation of monopolies, known as trust busting.Palihapitiya believes the 21st century version will target big tech names like Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) with more government regulation. All have been the subject of rising political and societal pressures.  The billionaire investor believes the world is in \u201ca massive move towards a more socialist definition of how society should work.\u201d  What that means is \u201cessentially, the pendulum swinging away from trickle-down, top-down economics and effectively swinging towards a bottoms-up reallocation of social services and the quality they deliver and the prices in which they should deliver them at,\" Palihapitiya told Yahoo Finance in a recent wide-ranging interview.  This pendulum has also swung between \"aggregated, mega, monolithic companies and highly fragmented disaggregated services,\" he added.  Accordingly, Palihapitiya expects the shift will benefit people by giving them what they want at \u201ca lower and lower cost. And those things will be consumed by many companies who can give that to consumers versus the few companies doing it.\u201d  He added: \u201cSo what it means for tech is probably that it gets regulated. It gets taxed. It basically gets broken up.\u201d  The billionaire\u2019s investor letter suggested that the disaggregation effect could result in \"some of iPhone, Azure, AWS, Amazon Retail, Google Search, Youtube, Gmail, GCP, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram\" becoming \"distinct companies who are explicitly not allowed to share data amongst each other.\"  He also sees governments aiming to tax revenues generated within their borders as the trend toward nationalism continues.  All told, targeting big tech in this way, is \"more a reflection of the moral temperature of society than it is on anything necessarily nefarious that these tech businesses are going to do or have done. It's just that I think people are tired of a few companies owning and controlling too much of the real estate and surface area,\" Palihapitiya told Yahoo Finance.No \u2018Swiss Army knife\u2019 approachA former Facebook executive who joined the social network in 2007 before starting Social Capital in 2011, the investor expects what happened to traditional broadcast television in the last century will eventually overtake social platforms.  In the first half of the 20th century, the media landscape was dominated by three media giants \u2014 NBC, CBS and ABC.  \u201cAnd then, over the course of the next 60 or 70 years, through a combination of deregulation and legislation and government incentives as well as economic incentives by different capital market participants, what we saw was an explosion of content, Palihapitiya stated.  Technology and shifting consumer demand eventually led to an explosion of content providers. \u201cAnd I think that's exactly what's happening online because we started in a place where there were really, you know, two or three major outlets. And those two or three major outlets had to serve everybody,\" he said.  He added that with social media today, it's \"basically impossible to serve everybody with the same product\" and that there \"is no Swiss Army knife approach that works.\"Meanwhile, a polarized electorate has made social media platforms cater to specific political demographics. According to the investor, (TWTR) is \u201cpivoting more towards the liberal left. Facebook tends to be pivoting more towards the right and the libertarian, at least in America,\" he said.  But the reality is that there is this really interesting disaggregation that's happening in media. And you know, these companies are media companies. And I think that governments will regulate them as such,\" he added.  While this disaggregation happens, more products and services will emerge \"that fit niche audiences that meet the narratives that, frankly, they want to hear.\u201d That is likely to lead to more polarization, according to Palihapitiya.  \"[I] think that's just the unfortunate reality of where we as a society, which is that it's hard to find a way, in a de-escalated manner, to question your assumptions without feeling attacked,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance.  \u201cAnd until we fix that problem, which is more sort of a, you know, a moral decision by society, these products will get more and more fragmented and serve more and more niche audiences with specific kinds of content,\" he added.Julia La Roche is a Correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

Palihapitiya, founder and CEO of investment firm Social Capital, said in a series of tweets that there are a handful of negative catalysts to drive these shares down over the next few years, including increased regulatory scrutiny, taxes and new product experiences.   \"Big Tech's long term success is no longer about better products,\" Palihapitiya said in a Friday tweet. \"They are incumbents and their success is now a multi-variate/multi-dimensional problem of competition, anti-trust, tax and regulatory multiplied by EVERY city, state, country and jurisdiction in which the operate.\"   Facebook and Alphabet have been relatively been a bright spot in a market that experienced unprecedented disruptions by the coronavirus pandemic.

A senior female aide approaches him, and the editor sits down next to her on a ledge around a planter and, with pens in hand, they go through printouts of seating plans, analog people in a digital era.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many of the conference's featured speakers have been caricatured by a cartoonist on a scrim out front.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They're all members of the coastal elite that Vanity Fair likes to feature in its glossy pages. Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos fraternizes with artist Jeff Koons and CBS head Les Moonves, while Facebook founder <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and his pediatrician wife, Priscilla Chan, rub shoulders with late-night host Conan O'Brien and wit Fran Lebowitz.</p><p>There's another, less recognizable face on the scrim: that of venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, who's been invited to speak at the conference for the first time. The Canadian expat is known in Silicon Valley primarily for three things: helping <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to grow Facebook from big to supersized; buying a share in the then-hapless Golden State WarriorsNBA team; and his willingness, from time to time, to break ranks with his adopted community. Indeed, he's been so ready to criticize his peers that The Wall Street Journal recently called him, in a headline, \"the venture capitalist whom venture capitalists love to hate.\"</p><p>Before heading into the theatre, Palihapitiya does a brief TV interview with a Bloomberg reporter. He sits easily in a tall director's chair, his lanky form clad in the requisite tech-exec mufti of black blazer, blue button-down and jeans. He tends to favour clothes in muted colours cut to fit his slender form-casual but not sloppy, and never the fleecies and gadget-lumpy khakis worn by some of his fellow tech travellers.</p><p>His caricature on the scrim accentuates his prominent nose, but in person, it's the eyes that have it, darting about, scrutinizing. In his leisure time, Palihapitiya plays high-stakes poker, and he's someone who looks, always, for the tell.</p><p>He talks fluently to the Bloomberg reporter about global warming and, more specifically, about a company that is building ocean-going sailboat drones to measure the effects of climate change. It's one of many projects funded by his venture capital firm, Social Capital, to which the Waterloo Universitytrained engineer has directed much of the wealth he acquired as one of Facebook's earliest employees. His net worth is reputed to be around $1 billion (all currency in U.S. dollars).</p><p>The seating plans annotated, Carter smooths his silver hair back into place and rushes, like the White Rabbit, through the theatre's back door. Soon, Palihapitiya follows-he's part of the day's first panel, on the state of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Tech writer Nick Bilton starts by pitching a softball to Palihapitiya and two fellow panelists. What would he need to know to do their jobs, to earn the keys, he jokes, to their private jets?</p><p>Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers VC Mary Meeker says she looks to see if start-up heads are willing to surround themselves with people better than they are. Aaron Levie, CEO of the fastgrowing cloud-storage company Box, says he is constantly thinking about the consequences of the industrial world going digital.</p><p>These are safe, woolly answers, swimming in the tech community's mainstream.</p><p>As is his custom, Palihapitiya goes his own way. \"The most important thing in my job is to write down what you believe in,\" he tells Bilton, \"and to use money to amplify your moral and ethical perspective.\"</p><p>From this standpoint, the Vanity Fair conference looks like the last gasp of a more heedless time.</p><p>Palihapitiya has been something of a naysayer for a few years now, sober when so many in the Valley have giddily watched the tech market, with a few blips, rise and rise again. He has declined to invest in many of the projects that have made those around him say yes, absolutely.</p><p>Instead, he and Social Capital have invested heavily in startups trying to make headway in the risky health and education spheres, where the payoffs come later, if at all, and aren't purely financial. \"If life were a race, it's fair to say that the starting lines at birth are unevenly distributed,\" Social Capital's vision statement reads. \"And when people are deprived of an opportunity to excel and contribute, we all lose.\"</p><p>Palihapitiya himself started well behind many of his Valley peers. Certainly, he's a singular creature in the boardrooms he frequents: the Sri Lankan-born, Canadian-bred son of refugees whose socialist father instilled in him a strong belief in the social safety net. But, a contrarian by nature, he also has a strong libertarian streak and has expressed disdain for the problem-solving capacities of government. He's a bro's bro, to be sure-a fast-cardriving, poker-playing lad-but he has also called out the Valley's sexism so hard that a female tech CEO has labelled him the best feminist she knows.</p><p>As Silicon Valley struggles to position itself in the Trump era, Palihapitiya finds himself with well-placed friends on both sides of the nation's great, gaping divide. With his long-standing willingness to speak his often complicated truth, this means Palihapitiya is about to hit his moment of peak influence-and he is determined to use that influence. Not to make billions backing the next Uber, but to build a legacy based on his own version of what's right. \"Do you know who was the richest person 100 years ago? No. If you want to be remembered, it's because you created a religion, you figured out gravity, you came up with a unified theory.\" Given the long odds and setbacks Palihapitiya has already overcome, why shouldn't he think big?</p><p>Palihapitiya wasn't born rich. His father, Gamage Palihapitiya, was originally a civil servant in Sri Lanka's health ministry. He brought his wife, Srima, and his young family, including six-year-old Chamath, to Ottawa so he could take an entry-level job at the High Commission in the 1980s. When insurgents unseated the government back home, he sought asylum.</p><p>Chamath's father eventually found a job as a data entry clerk; the mother worked as a housekeeper and nurse's aide. But the Palihapitiyas often relied on public assistance, with the five of them (Chamath has two younger sisters) sharing a one-bedroom apartment over a laundromat.</p><p>For all its privations, Palihapitiya remembers his upbringing, and his father, with fondness. \"I absorbed a lot of his world view,\" he says, \"though I didn't end up anywhere near as leftist as he is.\" His interest in business began early: He remembers reading a business magazine's rich list, fantasizing that, one day, he'd be on it.</p><p>Palihapitiya is unusually tight-lipped about his school days. \"I was a bit closed in. I didn't have many friends.\" But that changed when he got to the University of Waterloo to study electrical engineering in 1994. In the hurly-burly of frosh week, he made a close friend, only to lose him later that year to a rare form of cancer. Palihapitiya is still reluctant to speak of the loss, giving up his friend's first name-Amit-only when pressed.</p><p>It was during Amit's illness that he grew close to Brigette Lau, a Waterloo computer engineering student who is now his wife. \"Chamath was a character,\" recalls Lau, \"someone who gave people a hard time.\"</p><p>Through the process of losing their mutual friend, Lau got behind his formidable wall. \"Under the hard exterior, there was this big heart.\"</p><p>Looking back on his time at Waterloo, Palihapitiya is particularly glad the co-op program allowed him to alternate study and work terms. \"I was only a marginal-to-decent student, but I realized in the work terms that I was a good practical problem-solver.\" (In a payback to his alma mater, he arranges for some 20 Waterloo students a year to do lucrative work terms in the Valley.)</p><p>After graduation in 1999, Lau joined a big accounting firm's San Francisco office, and Palihapitiya landed a job trading derivatives at BMO Nesbitt Burns in Toronto. \"My boss gave me a zero bonus at Christmas, which hurt my ego but woke me up, because I was losing myself in that job. I might still be there otherwise.\"</p><p>Palihapitiya followed Lau to California. The millennium was turning, and the Internet boom was speeding toward a bust. Though the Valley was in a shaky state, Palihapitiya soon found his footing with two early digital music sites. One of them had fewer than 10 employees-all, like Palihapitiya, in their early 20s.</p><p>That's when he met (and impressed) Sean Parker, the piratical founder of Napster, who would go on to become president of Facebook.</p><p>In 2000, AOL swallowed both the music sites Palihapitiya was working for. He soon found himself running AOL's music division, and then its rudimentary instant-messaging platform. Palihapitiya credits his mentor at AOL, Kevin Conroy-now a top executive at MGM-for plucking him out of the crowd. \"He basically was like, 'This kid is really smart, and we pay him next to nothing, and everybody else around him is a bozo.'\" At 26, he became AOL's youngest VP, with 200 employees under him.</p><p>He has vivid memories of his first meeting with <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>in the fall of 2005. \"Parker set up some meetings with me and Zuck,\" Palihapitiya says.</p><p>The social network was young-maybe 15 employees, and open only to university students, even though <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>had dropped out of Harvard and moved to Palo Alto. \"Zuck didn't say much,\" recalls Palihapitiya.</p><p>\"It was very cold, it was raining, and he had the famous North Face fleece on, Adidas flip-flops.\"</p><p>Palihapitiya recommended to his superiors that AOL buy the social network. He couldn't get the goahead to make an offer, so instead, he proposed a deal to integrate AOL's chat function into the product. \"We did a lopsided deal, in favour of AOL,\" he says. Within a few months, they decided to unwind the partnership, and <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and Palihapitiya became friends in the process.</p><p>In 2006, with AOL treading water, Palihapitiya joined the venerable Mayfield venture fund, under Silicon Valley legend Yogen Dalal, who'd helped his Stanford professor Vint Cerf come up with the Internet's lingua franca, the TCP/IP protocol.</p><p>It was during this time that Palihapitiya started hosting what has since become Palo Alto's top high-stakes poker game, with 14-time World Series of Poker champion Phil Hellmuth. A who's who of founders and VCs became regulars. (Poker wasn't his first card obsession: \"I started out with bridge, but these old ladies you think are so respectable, they cheat!\") When told that Wikipedia pegs his poker winnings at $175,000, Palihapitiya scoffs, \"That's just tournaments.\"</p><p>Dalal laughs when I repeat a story from the AOL period, published in The New York Times, of Palihapitiya, after an all-night poker game, taking his $50,000 in winnings to a BMW dealership, where the salesman refused even to let the unkempt young man test-drive a vehicle. Palihapitiya crossed the street to a Mercedes dealer, bought a sedan, and drove it back to show the Bimmer salesman.</p><p>Wasn't this kid a bit hard to handle? If so, the courtly Dalal isn't saying: \"Chamath was everything a young man should be.\"</p><p>He was also an able pupil. But when <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>came calling in 2006, \"I said it was too good for him to resist,\" says Dalal. \"You can always be a VC. I told him, 'Go, make great things happen.' And that's what he did.\" A fter the Vanity Fair panel, Palihapitiya climbs into a black SUV and heads across town for another speaking engagement. In a room in an old Spanish Missionstyle army building with views of Alcatraz, he addresses a gathering hosted by the C100, a group of top Canadian tech execs based in the Valley. He is asked-of course he is-about Facebook, and he gives a fairly jokey thumbnail sketch of his time there.</p><p>He joined in 2007, as vice-president of growth, mobile and international. As such, he led one of the teams charged with generating revenue-which it did, he says, without reinventing the wheel. \"Google copied Yahoo, and we copied Google. I'd go see the team and check in. 'Are we still copying Google? Good. Keep doing that.'\" But in our interviews, he talks seriously about what it was like being part of one of the greatest growth stories of all time.</p><p>At first, he had difficulty adjusting to <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>valourization of coding, as reflected in the now-massive campus's address, 1 Hacker Way. \"I had a chip on my shoulder. I was, I am, an engineer. I felt superior to the people who were just, as I thought then, coders. I had earned this big ring.\"</p><p>He says this is part of what <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>had to teach him: the insignificance of status. \"He doesn't care about labels,\" says Palihapitiya, a vestige of awe in his voice. \"It must be hard to drop out of any university, but to drop out of Harvard? What matters to him is not what car you drive. What matters is, are you a good person, a smart person, an ambitious person? It's hard, but you should want to do the things you want to do, independent of how society judges you.\"</p><p>Now, he says, \"I work with people, and I don't even know where they went to school, or if they did.\" He also says that by placing a high value on coding-for a long time considered the gruntwork of tech-<person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>kept Facebook nimble, a place with the organizational intelligence to readily implement new ideas.</p><p>Palihapitiya duly adjusted his attitude on this front and took charge of getting the social network from 50 million users to over the 100-million hump.</p><p>One of his early hires, Stanford-trained engineer Ray Ko, is still with him, as a partner and head of growth at Social Capital. \"We worked together to figure out how to use data to help the growth team make better decisions,\" Ko says. \"What product should we build, what features should we embed? A team with this focus had never existed in the Valley before. The idea before that was that if you build a great product, they will come.\"</p><p>Ko says, for instance, that they learned how critical it was for a new Facebook user to land a certain number of friends within the first week, and so a function that suggested friends for new users, and nudged existing users to befriend new arrivals, was added.</p><p>Retention increased dramatically.</p><p>Within a couple of years, Facebook had blown past 100 million and was on its way to achieving the impossible-seeming dream of topping a billion users. Facebook's growth seems inevitable in hindsight, but Palihapitiya points to MySpace and Friendster, two early social networks that drew millions of users, then hit walls, declined and ultimately fell.</p><p>Facebook's growth was a big win for Palihapitiya. Another was his push for <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to hire Sheryl Sandberg from Google, where she was head of global online sales. Palihapitiya knew her in part because he played poker with Sandberg's husband, Dave Goldberg, best known for his stint as CEO of SurveyMonkey, and thought she'd make a good chief operating officer. She is now one of the Valley's most respected executives, having managed Facebook's exponential growth and still found time to write Lean In, the influential book of career advice for women.</p><p>At the same time, Palihapitiya suffered a loss of face. As the person in charge of Facebook's mobile division, he'd helped pioneer apps for the first iPhone and its competitors. In 2009, he proposed that Facebook launch its own smartphone, and worked with Swiss industrial designer Yves B\u00e9har, Intel and AT&amp;T to devise a prototype. The phone, he says, was beautiful. But <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>nixed the project, which would have cost an estimated $1 billion-money the pre-IPO company didn't have.</p><p>\"I made it hard for Zuck to say yes,\" Palihapitiya says now. \"I wasn't wrong to push for the phone, but I let my ego get in the way.\"</p><p>You're no one in Silicon Valley until you've had an exit e-mail go viral, and, when Palihapitiya left Facebook in 2011, his duly made the rounds. It is remembered now mainly for its most abrasive piece of advice: \"Don't be a douchebag.\" But it also has gentler, more nuanced points to make. \"Speak the truth,\" he wrote.</p><p>\"It's too easy to 'manage'-upwards, sideways, downwards-and be rewarded for it. This is death.Respect the person, but don't let bad ideas go unchallenged.\"</p><p>The phone setback notwithstanding, he left Facebook on good terms. \"I had done most of what I came there to do. The team I built, they've all gone on to great things. They run a lot of Facebook, and are top people at Uber, Pinterest, Airbnb.\"</p><p>He and Lau-who married in 2005 and now have three children-remain friends with <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and his wife. And though Palihapitiya has not confirmed (or, for that matter, denied) the estimates of his post-Facebook net worth, he is not beholden to anyone. Which means he can afford to cultivate the same independence he so admired in <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>-to take his commitment to truth-telling to the next level.</p><p>Social Capital is as one-off as Palihapitiya himself. He and Lau wanted to find market solutions for problems traditionally addressed by charities. \"We felt the discipline of the market was important,\" Lau says. Their firm would invest primarily in three sectors in particular need, Palihapitiya felt, of reform: financial services, health care and education. Most of his peers, meanwhile, were investing in social media-an area that no longer holds any interest for him. \"After I left Facebook, I had people pitch me social networks of all kinds, for people who love fish, people who are more than six feet tall, people who have only travelled within a certain area of the world.\"</p><p>Instead, he's going after much larger problems-how education fails smart kids who grow up poor, the long-term management of chronic diseases. \"There are other VCs in the Valley who go at these things sporadically,\" says Yogen Dalal, \"but not in such a systematic way. The risks are big. These are highly regulated areas, with many existing players.\"</p><p>To help him in his quest, Palihapitiya has lined up what Bloomberg has called a \"League of Extraordinarily Rich Gentlemen\" as backers, among them billionaires like Hong Kong's Li Ka-shing, Germany's Nicolas Berggruen, Brazil's Jorge Paulo Lemann and America's Eli Broad. Palihapitiya also put a chunk of his own money-\"hundreds of millions,\" he says-into Social Capital, as did early partners Mamoon Hamid and Ted Maidenberg. (Lau is co-founder and a partner specializing in education.) And he worked his Valley network to get top technologists and thinkers to provide not just money but advice to young entrepreneurs. Why not sit a newbie with a good idea down with Sean Parker or LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, and see what happens?</p><p>Although the Valley has been good to him, Palihapitiya set up Social Capital because he felt the tech community was losing its way. He agreed with PayPal founder and Facebook backer Peter Thiel that Silicon Valley has too often preferred trivial pursuits to tough ones, giving us 140 characters instead of flying cars.</p><p>This differing vision has sometimes set him at loggerheads with those around him. He's become, deliberately or not, the Valley's conscience.</p><p>His public set-to with home-stay network Airbnb is just one example of Palihapitiya publicly breaking ranks, at the cost of what might have been a hugely lucrative deal.</p><p>In 2011, he e-mailed Airbnb's CEO and some of its backers, criticizing its founders for taking $21 million from an early investment in the company for themselves. Their decision, he said, made him reluctant to invest. \"My basic principle on this stuff is that if you want liquidity, that's fine,\" he wrote, \"but you should make it available to everyone.\"</p><p>To the annoyance of Airbnb's investors, the e-mail went public. Palihapitiya justifies his criticism, contrasting the way the Airbnb founders handled money with the way <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>did.</p><p>\"Zuck shared with his employees and, at the time, I was a young father, working hard, and we didn't have that much,\" he tells the C100 crowd. The stock and compensation packages were \"all the money in the world to us. It was right, but it also seeds something important in the business, a competitive advantage, when you do that.\"</p><p>Airbnb is now valued at $30 billion, but Palihapitiya appears not to regret the e-mail. Instead, he backed the officecommunication app Slack Technologies, run by fellow Canadian Stewart Butterfield. Slack is one of the Valley's so-called unicorns, start-ups whose market valuation reaches $1 billion, and its employment practices and benefits have earned raves from employees. \"Butterfield's is a beautiful, fair and inclusive worldview,\" says Palihapitiya. \"I would fucking murder people to make his way of doing things successful.\"</p><p>As his first answer at the Vanity Fair event suggests, Palihapitiya believes businesses become more competitive, not less, when ethics play a role in decision-making at the top. On similar grounds, he has criticized the tech industry's lack of diversity.</p><p>He and his firm collaborated with a respected tech publication, The Information, to quantify the extent of the problem on the investment side. The findings of the 2015 study: More than 92% of senior investors at top venture firms were male, and 78% of them were white.</p><p>His own Palo Alto-based firm is the United Nations in comparison to most of his competitors. \"I want to be surrounded by people who have a shared set of values, but who manifest those values differently, and so it helps when there are men, women, people who are gay, straight, Jewish, Muslim, Catholic, Buddhist, tall, short, underweight, overweight.\"</p><p>He takes the argument one step further. \"Women invest differently than men. Your investment decisions are stronger if you have different people at the table.\"</p><p>He has also pushed for big tech to help mitigate the effects of skyrocketing housing costs in the Bay Area, where a one-bedroom will set you back $3,500 a month. He's proposed that San Francisco take a per-cent share in start-ups-to which the city gives significant tax breaks-and use the revenue to build affordable housing.</p><p>This position landed him in hot water with Ron Conway, an early backer of Google and PayPal. A video of the senior VC publicly berating Palihapitiya, a resident of Palo Alto, for daring to criticize San Francisco mayor Ed Lee, went viral in 2014. Palihapitiya, in a pink V-neck sweater, remained calm. \"Ron, all I was saying is that there's all these people in the city who feel frustrated.</p><p>There's a ton of people who feel like they're getting pushed out.\"</p><p>The to-and-fro went on, with Conway screaming at the end: \"You don't know what you're talking about.\"</p><p>Palihapitiya doesn't back away from his position. \"I tend to be, generally, mostly right,\" he says. \"When I said that, nobody wanted to hear it. 'Why are you being a downer? Why are you raining on our parade?' \" F rank discussions of tech's social responsibilities were rarer then. But in the wake of Donald Trump's election, that's all most Valley-dwellers can talk about. Can social media minimize the circulation of false news? Is there some way of encouraging engagement across divides, rather than accentuating the bubble effect? What can be done about unemployed and underemployed Americans in the heartland and elsewhere?</p><p>Palihapitiya is likely to play a central role in the tech community's engagement with the incoming administration. He has known Peter Thiel, Trump's tech consigliere, for years and backed his digital security firm, Palantir. Thiel, in turn, is a limited partner in one of Social Capital's funds.</p><p>Like Thiel, Palihapitiya has been known to voice Ayn Randian ideals. He once reportedly dismissed the U.S. federal government as \"completely useless,\" and he tends to put more stock in the ability of business, especially the tech business, to solve difficult problems. This way of thinking, of course, animated the Trump campaign, which promoted his lack of government experience as an asset, not a shortcoming.</p><p>That said, Palihapitiya is no fan of Trump. At the Vanity Fair event, the moderator asked the panel members whether Facebook should remove Thiel from its board, after reports that he'd contributed $1.25 million to the Trump campaign. Remember, this was several weeks before the election, and few of those present could contemplate a Trump presidency.</p><p>Of the three panelists, only Palihapitiya endorsed a purge.</p><p>\"Absolutely, I would [remove him]...Trump is repudiating all the things that make America awesome.\" (<person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>kept Thiel on the board.)</p><p>After the election, Palihapitiya spoke at a panel organized by Wired and berated himself for not foreseeing a Trump victory.</p><p>\"My job as an investor is to see these things coming,\" he said.</p><p>\"You can't look at data any more. Polls are worthless, pundits are worthless, the unemployment rate that we use is probably worthless.\"</p><p>He goes one step further, chastising himself and his community for failing to ease the problems that led so many to vote for Trump. \"We were complacent,\" he said. \"We're all complicit in this. There was an underappreciation of the economic malaise that exists in this country. As a person who grew up in a really difficult economic situation, I look at a lot of these people as my people. I feel like I completely let those people down.\"</p><p>And so, while he doesn't propose collaborating with Trump, he does suggest that Silicon Valley try to solve the problems that got him elected.</p><p>That is just one of the legacy projects Palihapitiya has set for himself.</p><p>Having recently lost his father to complications from diabetes, Palihapitiya has joined a consortium that backs cutting-edge software to help manage the chronic condition, which afflicts an estimated 420 million people worldwide and is particularly pervasive among South Asians. (Dalal, who was diagnosed with diabetes himself, is another backer and sits on the board.)</p><p>Glooko, as the company is called, has worked with the major makers of insulin monitors to develop software to collect patient data. Its system enables any blood-sugar monitor on the market to communicate the patient's levels directly to the doctor. \"That data, when aggregated, can give the company all kinds of information about how best to manage this condition,\" says Palihapitiya. In a remarkably short time, it has become a global force in diabetes management.</p><p>The grail for Palihapitiya is the development of a smart, artificial pancreas to help regulate the digestion of sugar. He is not involved in the day-to-day management of Glooko. But still, inventing the smart pancreas-now that's the sort of contribution that tends to get remembered.</p><p>On the education side, he has poured money into an app that identifies geniuses-an investment made based on Lau's advice.</p><p>Brilliant is an online game that rewards mathematical aptitude and aims to help universities identify superbright students. It brought a young woman of prodigious intellect in Juarez, Mexico, to Palihapitiya's attention, and the couple has enrolled her, at their own expense, at Waterloo. \"There are lots of Steve Jobses out there who aren't getting their shot,\" he says.</p><p>These investments aren't likely to generate quick returns. Still, Social Capital is certainly not averse to making money. Besides backing Slack and Box, it made an early $25-million investment in Yammer, an enterprise communication tool run by Palihapitiya's poker buddy David Sacks. When Microsoft bought the start-up in 2012 for $1.2 billion, Social Capital made a profit of $80 million.</p><p>These days, Palihapitiya seems driven to make more long-shot bets, if the ultimate aim is a good one.</p><p>With Ray Ko's help, he has developed an approach to managing and encouraging growth that he thinks is likely to increase the odds of success-applying the lessons they learned at Facebook to other companies.</p><p>In the industry, it's become known as growth-hacking, a term Palihapitiya hates, since it suggests there is a set of facile rules that guarantee success.</p><p>After the election, Palihapitiya contributed a stateof-the-Valley op-ed piece to The Information. \"The last decade,\" he wrote, \"could be summarized as follows: easy money, easy decisions, easy growth, and easy markups resulting in more easy money, more easy decisions...and so on. The problem is that the cost of these decisions now outweighs the benefits.\"</p><p>Palihapitiya says a lot of surprising things for someone who's done as well as he has. He talks about the corrupting influence of money-\"our kids are basically screwed\"-and gives a nod to his father's socialist views. \"Capitalism, as it's been practised, is not working.\"</p><p>But this boy who once obsessed over rich lists isn't proposing a radical departure from a market system.</p><p>All he's asking is that those who've done well address the ways in which the system fails many. \"I'm good at what I do,\" he says. \"I've worked hard, but I've been lucky, in the right place at the right time.\"</p><p>Although Social Capital's approach has been market-driven so far, Palihapitiya has floated the idea of working, in the future, with non-profits. And recently, he returned to his native Sri Lanka to suggest ways in which the government might improve the nation's spotty Internet access and make it free, to boot.</p><p>His father would surely have approved. After his dad died in 2014, the son reportedly went into counselling to help manage his grief. When asked now what his father thought of his pretty fabulous success, he says: \"He was proud, for sure. But I don't think he ever really understood it. He'd have been happy enough if I became a professional and got a nice house in an Ottawa subdivision. With Zuck, I saw his father visit, and take in and appreciate what he had built. My dad and I, we never got that moment.\"</p><p>The star-studded universe of Chamath Palihapitiya</p><p>Just a few of the moguls, sports stars and former presidents the venture capitalist pals around with</p><p>SEAN PARKER Napster founder who introduced him to Zuck</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG </nameText></person>friend and former boss at Facebook</p><p>PETER THIEL investor in Social Capital</p><p>KEVIN DURANT plays for the NBA's Golden State Warriors</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG COO of Facebook</p><p>PHIL HELLMUTH Buddy and 14-time poker champ</p><p>ELON MUSK sat on an immigration reform board together</p><p>BILL CLINTON friend he calls a \"f--ing stud\"</p><p>GUY LALIBERT\u00c9 close friend</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20170224rbchamathpalihapitiya</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MY9-26K1-JCRP-C552-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5067\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

The comment was written on March 16, 2020, and posted on March 20, 2020:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform (ILR) is pleased to submit this response to the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) public notice seeking comments in furtherance of the policy on Promoting the Rule of Law Through Transparency and Fairness in Civil Administrative Enforcement and Adjudication, Docket No. OMB-2019-0006. These comments reflected the views of ILR, which is an affiliate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and input from various policy divisions of the U.S. Chamber.</p><p>ILR applauds OMB's interest in advancing a fair, speedy, accurate, and transparent administrative enforcement and adjudication system that is respectful of the rights of Americans. In response to OMB's request for information, ILR offers the following comments to ensure that every American enjoys adequate protections in regulatory enforcements and adjudications. ILR provides its comments in the order OMB's queries appeared in its request.</p><p>1. Prior to the initiation of an adjudication, what would ensure a speedy and/or fair investigation? What reforms would avoid a prolonged investigation? Should investigated parties have an opportunity to require an agency to \"show cause\" to continue an investigation?</p><p>Requests by government agency staff for businesses to enter \"tolling agreements\" may needlessly prolong an investigation and coerce businesses to give up their rights.</p><p>This has occurred in the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and may occur in other contexts. SEC staff often request that targets of an FCPA investigation enter a tolling agreement. This is not really a request. If a business enters a tolling agreement, it will remain under a prolonged shadow of an investigation. On the other hand, when a business declines to enter an agreement, the implicit threat is that the government will bring a potentially unnecessary action without having conducted an adequate investigation. In addition, rejecting a request to enter a tolling agreement may jeopardize settlement negotiations between a business and the government./1</p><p>Statutes of limitations exist for good reason. In the regulatory context, they ensure that the government brings enforcement actions promptly when the party accused of violating a regulation has records, witnesses, and institutional memory available to defend itself. They also prevent lengthy investigations during which the targeted company operates under a cloud of suspicion that may damage its reputation. For those reasons, agencies should not seek tolling agreements at the outset of an investigation. Nor should the government deem a business's refusal to sacrifice its statutory right to a prompt investigation and adjudication as a factor when determining whether a party is cooperating with the government.</p><p>In addition to avoiding unfair tolling agreements, agencies should consider developing programs to resolve disputes through mediation or other alternative dispute resolution before moving into an adjudication. Taking this approach may foster early settlements, which should be the desired outcome of many enforcement actions./2</p><p>2. When do multiple agencies investigate the same (or related) conduct and then force Americans to contest liability in different proceedings across multiple agencies? What reforms would encourage agencies to adjudicate related conduct in a single proceeding before a single adjudication?</p><p>When companies respond to allegations of improper activities, the focus of management is diverted from the day-today running of the business. Responding to multiple regulators with respect to the same conduct or transaction should not become a regular attribute to doing business. It is counterproductive from a regulatory standpoint and it is damaging to businesses and to the economy.</p><p>The Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) has observed that there are areas of \"shared regulatory space\" that produce \"redundancy, inefficiency, and gaps\" in regulation and enforcement./3</p><p>To address this concern, the ACUS has recommended that the Executive Office of the President and agencies use tools such as Memoranda of Understand (MOU) to coordinate enforcement. The 2012 study underlying this recommendation found that \"there appears to be no generally applicable statutory or executive branch policy regarding the use of MOUs, leaving their content largely to the discretion of the agencies.\"/4</p><p>That continues to be the case today.</p><p>ILR recommends that the Administration require agencies to identify areas of overlapping jurisdiction and develop MOUs to reduce the potential for duplicative enforcement. For example, a positive example of the use of MOUs to avoid duplicative enforcement is in the areas of food, drug, medical devices, and cosmetic advertising. Since 1954, the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have followed an MOU directing that only one of the agencies, not both, will initiate enforcement actions where there is shared jurisdiction unless the public interest otherwise dictates./5</p><p>Another example is a longstanding MOU between the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that requires the \"fullest possible cooperation and coordination\" between the agencies in their compliance and enforcement activities related to protection of workers, the public, and the environment at facilities subject to OSHA and EPA jurisdiction./6</p><p>To their credit, some agencies have worked hard to avoid overlapping probes, such as the FTC and DOJ's antitrust division, even when there is tension over overlapping jurisdiction./7</p><p>There are other opportunities for agencies to work together to avoid duplicative enforcement. For example, the SEC can enter MOUs with additional agencies (such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau), stand down where another enforcement authority has already taken action, and undertake efforts to reduce or eliminate the extensive duplication of efforts that occurs on the part of state and local enforcement authorities, among other actions./8</p><p>3. Would applying the principle of res judicata in the regulatory context reduce duplicative proceedings? How would agencies effectively apply res judicata?</p><p>Yes, agencies should apply principles of res judicata (claim preclusion) and collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) in adjudications. These doctrines protect parties from the unfairness of having to re-litigate the same claims or issues already decided by an adjudicatory body. Applying these principles also prevents inconsistent decisions and encourages reliance on an adjudication. These principles should apply to a decision made earlier by the same agency or another agency where there is overlapping jurisdiction, so long as the agency acted within its statutory authority.</p><p>The Supreme Court's \"longstanding view\" is that \"[w]hen an administrative agency is acting in a judicial capacity and resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate, the courts have not hesitated to apply res judicata to enforce repose.\"/9</p><p>Agencies should apply these principles based on well-established common law tests./10</p><p>4. In the regulatory/civil context, when does an American have to prove the absence of legal liability? Put differently, need an American prove innocence in regulatory proceeding(s)? What reform(s) would ensure an American never has to prove the absence of liability? To the extent permissible, should the Administration address burdens of persuasion and/or production in regulatory proceedings? Or should the scope of this reform focus strictly on an initial presumption of innocence?</p><p>Under no circumstances, should an American or an American company have to prove a negative, especially when defending against the government, be it an enforcement action or a prosecution. That is a basic principle of due process. While the evidentiary thresholds will differ from the criminal context, companies involved in an enforcement action should not have the burden to prove compliance with a regulatory obligation any more than a criminal defendant should have the burden to prove their innocence.</p><p>One example of where proving innocence is a standard part of the regulatory process is in the application of federal civil asset forfeiture laws./11</p><p>Under these laws, agencies can confiscate an individual's or business's cash, property, or other materials that they suspect are associated with an illegal activity. If challenged, an agency needs only to present evidence that the property is more likely than not (a preponderance of the evidence standard) related to an illegal activity and can keep the property, sell, or destroy it even if the government never charges the person with a crime. To obtain the return of their property, the burden of proof falls on what may be an innocent individual or business to show that it did not violate the law. In some cases, agencies have enforced forfeitures laws to seize legitimately earned money from small businesses, such as farmers, restaurant owners, and food distributors./12</p><p>While statutory reform may be helpful, federal agencies can also adopt policies that safeguard due process and avoid disproportionate penalties in civil forfeiture cases.</p><p>5. What evidentiary rules apply in regulatory proceedings to guard against hearsay and/or weight reliability and relevance? Would the application of some of the Federal Rules of Evidence create a fairer evidentiary framework, and if so which Rules?</p><p>Yes, application of Rules of Evidence to regulatory proceedings, particularly the rule against hearsay, would create a fairer evidentiary framework. The Administrative Procedures Act (APA) incorporated some limits on the admission of evidence in administrative proceedings, such as relevance and materiality, but did not require following the Rules of Evidence.</p><p>Administrative adjudications today are often functionally equivalent to civil nonjury trials, where the rules of evidence apply. In administrative proceedings, however, administrative law judges can rely on hearsay when reaching decisions. Hearsay is defined as an out-of-court statement, made in court, to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The purpose of the rule that generally prohibits admission of hearsay in court is to prevent the use of second-hand statements or documents from being used as evidence at trial given their potential unreliability and the inability to question the speaker or author.</p><p>Hearsay evidence should not be per se admissible in administrative adjudications regardless of the circumstances of the statement or document. Rather, adjudicators should require proponents of hearsay evidence to show that the evidence falls within a common law or statutory exception to hearsay inadmissibility or offer an independent foundation of the accuracy of the evidence.</p><p>Taking this approach would result in decision-making based on more reliable evidence, greater efficiency in adjudication by limiting questionable evidence, and promote the truth-finding function of adjudication. In addition, applying the hearsay rule would help address concerns regarding the independence of adjudicators within an agency and preserve the integrity of the administrative process./13</p><p>6. Should agencies be required to produce all evidence favorable to the respondent? What rules and/or procedures would ensure the expedient production of all exculpatory evidence?</p><p>Yes, agencies should be required to produce all evidence favorable to the respondent. Unlike court proceedings, the generous discovery rules of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply in agency adjudications. Regulators can compel parties to produce documents and submit to inspections. Agencies are not required to provide parties with any information, unless otherwise provided in their rules of procedure. This asymmetry of information poses a problem of fundamental fairness to regulated entities.</p><p>At minimum, agencies should disclose evidence that is \"material to the guilt or punishment\" of the regulated party, including exculpatory evidence, in any formal adjudicatory proceedings with the potential for fines or penalties./14</p><p>This standard (known as the Brady rule) is applied in Article III criminal proceedings and is an essential element of due process. Agencies should incorporate the Brady rule into their procedures for formal adjudication. To their credit, several agencies have done so. Other agencies, however, have refused to disclose exculpatory evidence to individuals and businesses defending themselves in adjudications./15</p><p>Sharing evidence gathered in an investigation before bringing an enforcement action against a party, both supporting the government's case and exculpatory in nature, is not only a matter of due process, it is sound public policy. Disclosure of the evidence helps defense counsel make a reasonable assessment of a matter so that he or she can advise a client on whether to seek a proposed settlement. For example, though not universally followed, staff within the SEC Enforcement Division provides a \"reverse proffer,\" in which it lays out the evidence supporting the charges. This has proven to be a constructive and useful means of expediting resolution of the matter./16</p><p>Formalizing and uniformly applying this process in the SEC and other agencies should be considered.</p><p>7. Do adjudicators sometimes lack independence from the enforcement arm of the agency? What reform(s) would adequately separate functions and guarantee an adjudicator's independence?</p><p>Yes, adjudicators sometimes lack independence from the enforcement arm of the agency. Even with statutory protections in place intended to provide independence to administrative law judges (ALJs), there is sometimes an inherent bias favoring the agency. For example, ALJ decisions are appealed to agency heads.</p><p>Some former ALJs have candidly revealed that they felt pressured to rule in favor of the agency. For example, former SEC Judge Lillian McEwen came under fire from the SEC's Chief Judge for finding too often in favor of defendants. Ms. McEwen also said SEC judges were expected to work on the assumption that \"the burden was on the people who were accused to show that they didn't do what the agency said they did.\"/17</p><p>A Wall Street Journal analysis found that the SEC won against 90% of defendants in contested cases in its own courts from October 2010 through March 2015--significantly higher than the agency's 69% win rate in federal court./18</p><p>One SEC ALJ, over the course of four years and 28 cases, found defendants liable in every case./19</p><p>Not coincidentally, as the law provides the choice to the SEC as to whether to decide cases inside the agency or in federal court, the SEC has increasingly opted to decide cases in house./20</p><p>Ronald J. Riccio, former dean of the Seton Hall Law School and a professor of constitutional law, has recognized the inherent conflict in internal agency adjudication. \"If you get caught up in the web of an agency investigation, you're investigated, prosecuted and judged by agency personnel,\" he observed./21</p><p>\"Even if it doesn't create actual bias, it doesn't look good.\"/22</p><p>The potential for bias is even greater when an administrative judge (AJ), rather than an ALJ, presides over an adjudication. While these adjudicatory officers have a similar title, there are key distinctions between an AJ and an ALJ. AJs do not have the same statutory protections as ALJs. Unlike ALJs, AJs are appointed directly by the agency, can be rewarded with bonuses based on their performance, and lack protection against being arbitrary discipline or removal,/23 raising additional concern that they are influenced by the agency. AJs can even communicate ex parte with agency officials during and about their hearings./24</p><p>Unsurprisingly, agencies, which have significant discretion over whether to use AJs or ALJs outside of formal adjudications, often choose AJs./25</p><p>In addition to the Administration considering developing and supporting statutory reforms,/26 the President should consider use of an executive order to encourage agencies to rely on ALJs, rather than AJs, for adjudication or afford AJs some of the same protections that statutes afford ALJs./27</p><p>The Administration might also consider measures to enhance the independence of ALJs.</p><p>8. Do agencies provide enough transparency regarding penalties and fines? Are penalties proportionate to the infractions for which they are assessed? What reform(s) would ensure consistency and transparency regarding regulatory penalties for a particular agency or the federal government as a whole?</p><p>Generally, no, agencies do not provide enough transparency regarding penalties and fines, which can be unpredictable and disproportionate to the infractions for which they are assessed.</p><p>Congress has authorized agencies to impose civil penalties at multimillion-dollar levels, sometimes in response to violations of vague standards. These fines may be imposed \"per violation.\" Agencies' broad discretion in defining a \"violation\" for purposes of computing a penalty may allow them to choose a method where the potential liability reaches extraordinary levels. For example, an agency may compute fines per product made or sold, prescription filled, television commercial aired, or sales letter mailed when assessing a penalty for a single statement viewed as misleading or a failure to file a required report. Computing fines in this fashion can result in excessive, duplicative penalties that are disproportionate to the alleged wrongdoing.</p><p>For example, statutory penalties for violation of the False Claims Act (FCA) are imposed in addition to treble damages./28</p><p>Penalties range from about $11,000 to $22,000 in 2020, when adjusted for inflation./29</p><p>Because these statutory penalties apply per claim, a single allegedly false statement may result in thousands or even millions of separate \"claims\" that multiply the mandatory minimum penalties to levels that are literally absurd in many cases. The potential for ruinous mandatory penalties may compel settlement of any claim that can survive a motion to dismiss, however unfounded./30</p><p>This problem is exacerbated by the ability of private relators to bring FCA actions that entitle them to a significant portion of the fines imposed.</p><p>In addition, administrative agencies may provide little or no guidance on the method used to calculate civil penalties. In some cases, agencies may merely make generic references to statutory considerations but provide no further guidance./31</p><p>This leads to unpredictability and inconsistency in punishment.</p><p>Agencies should adopt civil penalty factors to guide and place rational bounds on their discretion to impose civil penalties and fines. This would help avoid arbitrary punishment, facilitate consistent and fair treatment, and advance agency legitimacy. These factors should be developed through notice-and-comment rulemaking in advance of applying them to particular facts./32</p><p>When imposing civil penalties, agencies should also share information about the facts and factors that entered into its evaluation, which would allow the regulated community to better understand the agency's rationale.</p><p>There are constructive examples of programs that are creating fairness in the imposition of fines and penalties that other agencies should consider adopting. Policies--such as at DOJ-- that reduce penalties for effective compliance programs, voluntary disclosure, cooperation, and remediation should be encouraged across the federal government./33</p><p>Similarly, the DOJ's policy of not \"piling on\" with duplicative fines should be looked to as a model./34</p><p>These policies are working. For example, last year, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation settled action with the SEC by promptly self-reporting an FCPA violation related to a construction project in India, identifying employees connected to bribery payments, and paying $16.4 million in disgorgement, $2.8 million in interest, and $6 million in civil penalties. As a result, the DOJ declined to prosecute the company and, after independently investigating the allegations, instead charged the individuals involved./35</p><p>In addition, ILR commends the DOJ for reminding its attorneys that settlement agreements are intended to compensate victims, redress harm, and deter unlawful conduct./36</p><p>Individuals or businesses should not be pressured to donate money to third-party organizations as a condition of the federal government ending an enforcement action, lawsuit, or prosecution.</p><p>This sound policy prevents the potential for government officials to give away public funds and avoids the potential for them to direct settlement money to organizations based on personal or political favoritism./37</p><p>It should remain in place.</p><p>9. When do regulatory investigations and/or adjudications coerce Americans into resolutions/settlements? What safeguards would systemically prevent unfair and/or coercive settlements?</p><p>Due process should, at the very minimum, require an agency to provide every person accused of violating the law with an opportunity to request a hearing before the government can command a person to act or impose a penalty. In some contexts, however, agencies impose legal obligations without a hearing. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency adjudicates issues under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) through issuing \"unilateral administrative orders.\" The agency can simply order individuals or businesses to clean up their land regardless of fault./38</p><p>The Administration should ensure that regulated parties are entitled to a hearing before an agency can demand action, prohibit conduct, or impose fines.</p><p>In addition, agencies can pressure businesses into settlements through issuing adverse publicity. An informal statement from an agency can cause a company's stock price to dramatically fall. Yet, despite a recommendation from the ACUS nearly half a century ago, most agencies have not adopted standards for issuing adverse publicity./39</p><p>The internet and social media have raised the importance of this issue. Adverse publicity no longer is limited to an agency press release but can take the form of Twitter post announcing an investigation. Informal warning letters may be posted on an agency's website. In the previous Administration, for example, OSHA engaged in a practice of \"regulation by shaming.\"/40</p><p>At minimum, agencies should articulate written standards for issuing different forms of adverse publicity, including the content of announcements, internal procedures for issuing publicity, and a means for private parties to request corrections or retractions./41</p><p>Inflammatory pre-adjudication press releases and statements should be disallowed.</p><p>10. Are agencies and agency staff accountable to the public in the context of enforcement and adjudications? If not, how can agencies create greater accountability?</p><p>No, agencies and staff are not sufficiently accountable to the public in the context of enforcement and adjudications, however, the Administration is making progress to address this concern. For example, President Trump signed two Executive Orders (EOs) on October 9, 2019 that bar agencies from using guidance documents to impose new duties on private parties and required transparency in the issuance and maintenance of guidance documents./42</p><p>Among its directives, EO 13891 requires agencies to \"establish or maintain on its website a single, searchable, indexed database that contains or links to all guidance documents in effect from such agency or component\" within 120 days of OMB's issuance of an implementing memorandum, which occurred on October 31, 2019./43</p><p>By February 28, 2020, all agencies should have had this information online. Agency compliance with these EOs should be closely monitored and enforced.</p><p>Some agencies continue to irrationally interpret or enforce laws. For example, the DOL's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) enforces its Compensation Directives by using broad classifications to compare the pay of all employees with the same job title--classifications that were not established through a formal rulemaking process. For example, under the OFCCP's standards, an \"engineer\" could include people who do highly technical work and people who do less technical work. According to the OFCCP, those distinctions do not matter. As long as the job title is the same, the pay should be the same./44</p><p>This can result in government demands to pay heavy fines for pay inequities when there are legitimate educational and training reasons justifying why some employees are compensated more than others. The OFCCP is among agencies that should follow the recent EO directives to reform its practices and improve its credibility with the companies that are subject to its authority.</p><p>In addition, the Administration should encourage agencies to adopt a \"see something, say something\" approach modeled on Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division Administrator Cheryl Stanton's call for attorneys to report investigators who are not properly applying the law./45</p><p>* * *</p><p>ILR respectfully offers these thoughts and recommendations on how OMB can advance reforms that will better safeguard due process in regulation and adjudication. ILR welcomes the opportunity to engage with OMB and other interested parties on these topics.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Harold Kim</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1/ See Mike Koehler, Statute of Limitations Tolling in SEC Enforcement Actions Post-Kokesh - An Offer You Can Refuse, FCPA Professor (blog), Dec. 21, 2017.</p><p>2/ See Philip J.

The Children\u2019s Hospital Association \u2014 which spent more than $2.2 million on Washington lobbying in the first half of the year, according to disclosure filings \u2014 will press lawmakers on Medicaid funding and other issues this week. The conversations will include child patients and their families. They\u2019re expected to meet with Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.),  Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) and  Colin Allred (D-Texas), among others.   ANOTHER COALITION, ANOTHER ASK: Even as negotiations between Democrats and the Trump administration have broken down, the asks have kept coming. A coalition of trade groups sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , House Minority Leader  Kevin McCarthy , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer late last week urging them \u201cto include a \u2018healthy workplace\u2019 tax credit in the next federal stimulus package to protect the safety of workers, customers, and the public.\u201d Businesses and nonprofits could claim such a credit for shelling out on workplace cleaning, employee training and personal protective equipment, among other expenses.   \u2014 Among the trade groups that signed the letter: the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association , the Household &amp; Commercial Products Association , the International Council of Shopping Centers , the International Franchise Association , the National Association of Theatre Owners , the National Council of Nonprofits , the National Restaurant Association , the National Retail Federation , the North American Meat Institute and the U.S. Travel Association .   Good afternoon, and welcome to PI. Tips: [email protected] . Twitter: @theodoricmeyer .     A message from Facebook:     It\u2019s time for updated internet regulations to prevent election interference. We\u2019ve more than tripled our security and safety teams to 35,000 people, added 5-step political ad verification and partnered with security researchers, other tech companies and law enforcement to combat foreign election interference. What\u2019s next? We support updated internet regulations.       INSIDE THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN\u2019S TIES TO BIG TECH: The New York Times \u2019 David McCabe and Ken Vogel report that a volunteer group with nearly 700 members that\u2019s advising Joe Biden \u2019s \u201ccampaign, the Innovation Policy Committee, includes at least eight people who work for Facebook , Amazon , Google and Apple , according to documents reviewed by The New York Times. Other committee members have close ties to the companies, including economists and lawyers who have advised them, and officials at think tanks funded by them.\u201d And Cynthia Hogan , a former Biden aide who went on to work as an Apple lobbyist, has been helping to lead Biden\u2019s vice presidential search.   OLD GOOGLE FOE IS CONSULTING FOR STATES\u2019 INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANY: \u201c Jim Hood antagonized Google for nine years as Mississippi\u2019s attorney general, going after the internet giant for enabling the sale of illegal drugs, allowing pirated content to flourish online and serving up targeted ads to children,\u201d POLITICO \u2019s Leah Nylen reports. \u201cAnd Google fought back: Hood holds the title of the only U.S. public official the company has ever sued.\u201d   \u2014 \u201cNow Hood has returned for more. Earlier this year, he signed on as a consultant to the massive, multistate investigation into the company\u2019s dominance online. Forty-eight states, D.C. and Puerto Rico are investigating the company and some are expected to file an antitrust suit against the company this fall, though not all have decided yet whether they will sign on to a complaint. \u2026 The states\u2019 decision to bring on Hood, who stepped down in January following an unsuccessful bid for governor, suggests they are expecting a drawn-out legal battle that will require persistence, and maybe a bit of an attack dog.\u201d   \u2014 \u201c\u2018Dealing with Google is like dealing with a teenager,\u2019 the 58-year-old Democrat said in an interview. \u2018They don\u2019t follow the norms that other businesses do. Google will tell you one thing and do something different.\u2019 \u2026 Unfailingly polite in his soft Southern drawl, Hood compares Google to the robber barons of old and leans into hyperbole to argue his points against the company. \u2018Because they are innovative and we love what their technology has done for us, we give them a break versus other areas of business,\u2019 he said. \u2018They have more power than any company in the history of the world.\u2019\u201d   TOUGH DAY FOR KODAK: \u201c Eastman Kodak Co. shares lost more than a quarter of their value Monday after news that a planned $765 million loan to the company was put on hold as the deal has come under congressional and regulatory scrutiny,\u201d The Wall Street Journal \u2019s Rachael Levy reports. \u201cThe U.S. International Development Finance Corp. announced plans last month to loan Kodak the funds to produce drug ingredients at its factories. But in a tweet late Friday, the agency said that \u2018recent allegations of wrongdoing raise serious concerns. We will not proceed any further unless these allegations are cleared.\u2019\u201d   IF YOU MISSED IT ON FRIDAY: \u201cMidsize companies that need to use the Federal Reserve\u2019s so-called Main Street Lending Program to weather the coronavirus crisis are having trouble getting banks interested , business representatives warned a panel overseeing the Fed\u2019s efforts,\u201d POLITICO \u2019s Victoria Guida reports. \u201cThe Association for Corporate Growth , a lobbying group for middle-market businesses, surveyed its members and found that 81 percent of them that tried to get a loan through the program weren\u2019t able to\u201d do so.   \u2014 \u201cTo answer the question of who the Main Street Lending Program is helping? I have no answer to offer you,\u201d said Tom Bohn , the group\u2019s CEO, at a hearing Friday of the congressional commission overseeing the use of $500 billion in emergency funds by the Fed and Treasury Department.     Jobs Report    \u2014 UPS has promoted Mike Kiely and Penny Naas to lead the company\u2019s global public affairs operations from UPS\u2019 Washington office. Kiely will be president of U.S. government affairs and Naas will be president of international government affairs and sustainability.   \u2014 Sanofi has hired Morgan Jones as a senior director on its federal government relations team.

At its best, capitalism should embody a spirit of creative destruction, with stockpicking the art of identifying winners. Inevitably some companies fall by the wayside, but - just as species evolve physical advantages to survive in nature - businesses adept at change thrive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Transmorphism has always been a feature of the stock market. Essentially, buying shares demonstrates faith in change - that companies will generate returns on capital by creating innovative products and cracking new markets. Even in ex-growth industries, holding stock implies optimism that businesses will adapt to a world in flux and keep throwing off cash to reward believers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chameleon companies might find a catalyst for rapid sales growth, or position themselves at the vanguard of new technology and secular trends. Sometimes they alter corporate structure to expose hitherto unnoticed value or facilitate the pursuit of new growth ventures. Those that get it right have proved to be exceptional investments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon: the great exemplar of change                   </p><p>Amazon (US:AMZN) is unsurpassed as a specimen of corporate Darwinism. Having gone from online bookstore to dominant global player in e-retail, evolution remains a hallmark of the business. Its prominence in cloud technology, through Amazon Web Services (AWS), is now a major strand of the investment case. Whereas five or six years ago, nobody was talking about AWS, this revenue line now makes it possible to look beyond quarterly retail sales expectations when assessing the stock.</p><p>Fund managers, like Charles Plowden of Monks Investment Trust (<url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=MNKS:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">MNKS</url>), believe in Amazon and maintain trust in its management to deliver. Mr Plowden says: \"Flexibility and ambition don't fit into a DCF [discounted cash flow] spreadsheet.\" These qualities, which have rewarded investors handsomely, are the reason he isn't concerned about granularity and focuses on \"direction, not the detail\" of the business.  </p><p>Further growth opportunities go beyond ownership of Whole Foods and mooted takeovers to expand into the online grocery business. Successful roll-out of the Alexa system, voice-recognition technology and huge data banks from more than 100m devices open new avenues to disrupt computing platforms as clicking and swiping takes a back seat to simply asking for information.</p><p>Smart innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) and the success of AWS are reasons why Mike Seidenberg, a portfolio manager and analyst at the Allianz Technology Trust (<url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=MNKS:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">ATT</url>) admires Amazon. Explaining that many young developers have grown up using AWS, Mr Seidenberg says it's \"a really powerful sticky revenue generator\" for the business.</p><p>\"Investing,\" says Mr Plowden, \"is about harnessing the future at a rapid rate. In Amazon's case that's the three-to-four next big things.\" Although he doesn't believe going head to head with Netflix (US:NFLX) is a core focus, Amazon has still spent $5bn on original content. Going further into food and applications of voice recognition and AI technology, particularly in healthcare, are areas to exploit.</p><p>                     Restructuring, simple as ABC...                   </p><p>Leadership in next-generation healthcare is a huge prize and Amazon will be going head to head with Alphabet (US:GOOG) for the spoils. The restructuring in October 2015 that saw online search giant Google spawn its own parent was a highly visible example of change as a statement of intent. Advertising revenue from the search business was to continue generating profits to justify the company's valuation, while other subsidiaries, effectively funded by Google, focus on revolutionary products.</p><p>At this stage, some professional investors seem cautious. Even though ATT reduced its position earlier this year, Alphabet is a very good company in Mr Seidenberg's view. His reservation, however, is that search makes other parts of the group difficult to value: \"Great companies find incremental products and services that customers like. [The thing is] Google's first product [search] is so good, [what is] the chance the second will be so great?\"</p><p>Google's innovations have been fantastic for individuals and advertisers, but are baked into the Alphabet share price (although Mr Seidenberg thinks there is scope to further monetise the incredibly useful Google Maps). What's hard for analysts to estimate is the upside Alphabet's earnings will eventually see from other subsidiaries, even those that seem exciting.</p><p>Ben Rogoff, the manager of Polar Capital Technology Trust (<url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=MNKS:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">PCT</url>), describes Alphabet as having \"innovator's dilemma\", where it's \"hard to reinvent yourself and hard to replicate market share in a new market\". Yet, in some of those markets Alphabet is targeting, the rewards will be significant. PCT was, at the time of speaking with Mr Rogoff, slightly underweight to its benchmark on Alphabet, but he explained his feelings towards investing in the group: \"[Alphabet's] value [is a] bit like a conglomerate of founder businesses - [you] want to be involved with brilliant people worrying already about where the pack is headed.\"  Potentially, that direction is very lucrative. Alphabet's DeepMind Technologies reported a breakthrough in using AI to predict patients' risk of kidney damage on 31 July 2019 - exactly the sort of news that will start analysts thinking about valuing the group beyond Google.</p><p>Driverless vehicles could be another AI jackpot for Alphabet through its Waymo division. As of March 2019, Waymo had 600 driverless cars on the road and had ordered 62,000 Chrysler Pacificas and 20,000 I-Pace vehicles from Jaguar to expand its fleet. That puts it a long way behind Tesla (US:TSLA) in terms of volumes (Tesla delivered 95,200 vehicles in the second quarter of 2019, source: Statista.com), but over the long run, being underwritten by the cash flows of a large tech conglomerate - that also has strategic investments in cab hailing app Uber (US:UBER) and ride-sharing app Lyft (US:LYFT) - is a source of considerable advantage for Waymo.</p><p>                     Ubiquity encourages scrutiny                   </p><p>Gathering, holding and controlling petabytes of sensitive information has naturally seen tech companies draw attention from regulators. The European Union's general data protection regulations (GDPR) were designed to give consumers more control over what was being harvested, although companies have been crafty in using additional functionality of services as bait for consent. Of most concern to the tech giants is US antitrust threats to break them up. In the case of Alphabet, Mr Rogoff thinks this has been overplayed: \"[The] business won't get broken up, [it] drives utility to billions of people.\" He also believes the risks to privacy that do exist are manageable.</p><p>For Facebook (US:FB.), which was already in hot water over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there might be more cause to be nervous, especially if chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's intention to move into the sphere of money creation with his Libra project upsets governments, central banks and regulators. From a competition perspective, the acquisitions of chat app Whatsapp and photo-sharing app Instagram have prevented the Facebook platform from being disrupted by apps that are more popular with a younger demographic.</p><p>Instagram has truly become a phenomenon thanks to its chat and photo sharing experience and the ability to follow celebrities. Famous users such as the Kardashian/Jenner sisters and Cristiano Ronaldo can command fees of up to $1m per post to push brands. The business is now one of the main bull points for Facebook in Mr Seidenberg's opinion: \"Instagram is incredibly good at satisfying advertisers' needs. From a branding perspective, it's a beautiful product, whimsical and visual, [the] series of photos [are] totally engaging.\"</p><p>                     Changing nature of competition adds uncertainty for Big Tech                   </p><p>One of the major issues for the tech giants is that they are trying to out-do one another in new industries, not just disrupting lumbering incumbents as they have done in media, retail and telecommunication sectors since the late 1990s. Google Cloud Platform is lagging Amazon Web Services and Microsoft (US:MSFT) in one fast-growing market, and competition is heating up in healthcare.  </p><p>Microsoft's experience in revamping its business after some disappointing years provides a useful case study in resilient features to watch out for in a maturing company facing growth challenges. The business has never come close to denting Google's pre-eminence in search with Bing, and Microsoft failed badly in mobile with Nokia and the Windows phone operating systems.</p><p>What Microsoft has, however, is an outstanding core product in its Office software, which keeps generating cash. The useful life of its software allowed it leeway to endure some false dawns before finding another growth product. Now the cloud services business is another good reason to hold the stock in the view of Mr Seidenberg, who credits Microsoft with having \"done an amazing job for customers on [their] journey onto the cloud\".</p><p>                     Do expectations of growth-challenged Apple need to change?                      </p><p>Apple (US:AAPL) is a company that was long held up as a true innovator. It went from occupying a quality niche in desktop computer hardware to disrupting portable music, and creating the smartphone and tablet markets. Now, as consumers have switched from owning to renting music and media content, iTunes is no more and the quality end of the smartphone market is saturated. The challenge is finding new products and services that can take the iPhone's crown as Apple's sales growth driver.</p><p>Polar Capital's Mr Rogoff has been a long-time admirer of Apple, but the fund is more underweight in its holding than it has been for some time, although Apple still dominates the quality end of the smartphone market. In North America, while in volume terms it faces serious competition from cheaper phones, in dollar terms it still has 40 per cent market share. Based on some simple short-cut calculations (dividing annual sales by active users) Mr Rogoff estimates that the replacement cycle for the iPhone is three to four years, with a trend towards lengthening.</p><p>With the unit market shrinking as it matures, innovation needs to switch to software and services, which is a challenging pivot for a business that built its position based on dominance in design. The departure of Jony Ive, the head of design in a period when Apple set the standard in tech aesthetics, could be interpreted as symbolic of the crossroads the company finds itself at.</p><p>Fund managers who have followed the Apple story for many years aren't, unlike journalists, prone to hyperbole when interpreting every stage of its evolution. Mr Rogoff is clear that Apple continues to deserve credit for being able to throw off enormous amounts of cash and that \"it's not an incumbent in trouble, but is growth challenged\".</p><p>Efforts to diversify revenues from the iPhone haven't been without success, Mr Rogoff says: \"Apple music and Air pods [the company's wireless headphone music system] make sense, [Apple is] now the 2nd biggest watch company in the world by revenue. Trouble is, it's the price.\" This assessment reflects the balancing act between quality and premium price positioning and growth.</p><p>Already, cheap-to-manufacture alternatives to hardware innovations such as the Airpod are emerging. New wireless headphones by brands such as House of Marley (which are eco-friendly and received positive reviews from tech blog Engadget) compete even on Apple's premium design patch. Increasingly, a pivot to software and services looks to be the best bet for longer-term growth. In the meantime, maybe investors should be assessing Apple's attractiveness against the book value of its assets (including a $37bn cash pile), rather than on a price-to-forward-earnings-growth basis. Of course, ultimately how that cash is used will interest investors most.</p><p>                     Altering corporate structure can aid strategy                   </p><p>Apple's cash war chest is the stuff of dreams for most companies. Businesses not in that rare position can sometimes split out and spin off indebted divisions to create a leaner structure. Not only does this offer operational efficiencies, but it can precipitate a rerating for shares as analysts appreciate value that was hitherto hidden.</p><p>GlaxoSmithKline (<url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=MNKS:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">GSK</url>) hopes separating its pharmaceutical and healthcare businesses will galvanise its strategy to grow through investment in the pharma drug pipeline. The new healthcare division, a joint venture with Pfizer (US:PFE), moves a large chunk of debt from GSK, freeing up cash from interest payments for research and development. This renewed focus on future growth could still place the dividend at risk as more cash may be needed for the strategy. Shifting the emphasis to long-term growth is not exactly changing what the business does, but it does affect what investors should expect from the shares.  </p><p>Changes in corporate structure can be a way of defending against takeover bids, even if there is no change in the operational or investment focus of a business. Prudential's (<url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=MNKS:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">PRU</url>) de-merger of its European M&amp;G Prudential arm was done to reflect its true value. Charles Plowden of Monks Investment Trust describes the move as \"an attempt to reduce discount to underlying asset values\", which is brought about by the perception of the Pru as a UK insurance company when 60 per cent of its business is now in Asia.</p><p>                     It's not what a company does any more, it's about what it owns                   </p><p>Geographical focus can gradually shift over time due to market penetration and development or thanks to the cumulative effect of mergers and acquisitions. A company's essence in terms of its culture and the products it makes and sells can alter too. This change can be driven by acquisitions, trends or the external environment.</p><p>South African company Naspers (JSE:NPN) is, like its ancestral homeland, a poster child of change. The company started life as a newspaper publishing company in 1912 and had a very dark history as the mouthpiece for the Apartheid regime, until South Africa's rebirth as the 'Rainbow Nation' with Nelson Mandela's election as president in 1994. Nowadays, Naspers is more than a media company, with much value in its portfolio in emerging market assets and businesses that private investors have difficulty accessing. Concentration is skewed by a large holding in Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent (HKG:0700),but it has other emerging market exposure too, which Mr Plowden reasons gives something different: \"Naspers is in all the other bits [of the global economy] that Google, Amazon and Chinese [companies] are not.\"</p><p>                     Karma Chameleon - green concerns drive change                   </p><p>Some businesses are caught up in serious issues facing humanity. As existential crises go, they don't come much bigger than global warming and companies that have a pivotal role in meeting the world's 21st century energy challenges are facing demands to change. The London Stock Exchange (LSE) creating a category called non-renewable energy seems odd on one level - why make pariahs of Royal Dutch Shell (<url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=MNKS:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">RDSB</url>) and BP (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=MNKS:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">BP.</url>), two of the biggest companies in the UK? But it does demonstrate the seriousness with which capital markets are beginning to take environmental issues.</p><p>It should be remembered, however, that these companies have had to be experts at change. Fluctuation in energy prices, geopolitical tensions and currency movements have all had to be managed. Yet these businesses have been remarkably consistent in delivering earnings growth, maintaining cash flow and paying dividends. Arguably, the UK oil majors are better placed than global rivals to meet the clean energy challenges - compared with say Exxon Mobil (US:MOB), which is perennially on environmental, social and governance (ESG) naughty lists - which could even provide a future source of competitive advantage.</p><p>                     Being changed by the external competitive or technological landscape                    </p><p>The threat of Armageddon isn't the only change issue that can affect the investment case for businesses that have long been staples of defensive portfolio allocations. One of the most difficult things for any type of change management is that little incremental adjustments aren't noticeable, but the cumulative and compound effect of lots of little butterfly wings can eventually become a hurricane.   </p><p>Consumer staples businesses such as Unilever (<url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=MNKS:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">ULVR</url>) and Reckitt Benckiser (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=MNKS:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">RB.</url>) have long been prized for their dividends and low volatility, all underpinned by exceptional returns on capital employed (ROCE). Yet the change that has slowly occurred in the background makes these businesses far less defensive than in the past.</p><p>For starters, the rise of web retail - Amazon again - has removed the physical barrier to entry that branded consumer staples once had, namely that supermarket shelf space crowded out the competition. Online, unlimited shelf space and the ability to sort results on price mean brands win relatively less prominence.</p><p>Secondly, as Phil Oakley has argued in Investors Chronicle, the quality of own-brand goods has improved greatly and distributors such as Amazon are starting to push theirs aggressively. Thirdly, the power of advertising is owned by influencers on new channels such as Instagram and YouTube, where before brands would purchase blanket TV advertising. In the case of Amazon, its status as a huge conglomerate means it can dominate advertising in its own TV and web distribution channels and, going even further, its AI and voice recognition technology can even prompt purchases and steer consumers to its own goods.</p><p>These aren't changes that were all easy to spot, but the sales outlook for companies such as Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever is now not as certain as their safe defensive nature would suggest. In the long term this could mean risk to dividends, especially if money is thrown at brand-building unsuccessfully. The cash return on capital invested (CROCI) at Reckitt Benckiser has been in a downward trend, which could be taken as a sign of the difficulties it faces in generating future shareholder value. </p><p>Other defensives that have changed include utilities. This is a classic case of complacency. The threats are not only regulatory and legal - with the UK's precarious politics, a nationalising Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn can't be ruled out - but they are social, environmental and technological. The falling cost and rising demand for green energy, the impact of less reliable rainfall and population density, mean there are growing capital expenditure demands on utility businesses. Coupled with the overhang of years of borrowing against future cash flows - which creates an interest expense - then the free cash flow positions needed to support maintaining, never mind progressing, dividends looks far from assured.</p><p>Worryingly, as the economic situation deteriorates around the world, there are fewer sources of safe defensive income for investors to ride out bad times. Low bond yields forced investors into defensive income-paying stocks counter-cyclically, so these businesses are already expensive and pricey stocks aren't where you want to be if the market falls.  Counter-intuitively some of the better income bets are to be found by sifting through the rubble of the last crisis.</p><p>Banks can never be compared to utilities or consumer staples in the 1990s, they are too vulnerable to so many outside factors, but this does mean they aren't as expensive as other income stocks, and banks once again offer some of the most generous payouts in the FTSE 100. Banks aren't chameleons in terms of what they do - although there is an inner identity struggle between focusing on retail or investment banking - but their role in a portfolio is markedly different now than pre-2008.</p><p>In the mid-2000s banks were all about total returns - using unsafe leverage to grow the value of their loan books underpinned capital growth, along with delivering substantial net interest margin which helped ramp up forward expectations and support a generous dividend. The growth aspect of holding bank shares is, even for companies such as HSBC (<url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=MNKS:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">HSBA</url>) and Standard Chartered (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=MNKS:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">STAN</url>) which focus more on emerging Asia, far less assured than in the past. Repaired balance sheets, however, have enabled the banks to redistribute more of the profits they do make as dividends.</p><p>The thing about change, however, is sometimes that there are just new risks that replace the old. In the case of banks, the core equity tier one capital ratios used to judge solvency and the robustness of balance sheets depend largely on the safety rating assigned to various assets, ie loans. Once again, mortgage lending is potentially an issue. So, while banks may look like the best value dividend payers out there - making them chameleons in the sense of the role played in a portfolio - they haven't morphed into low-risk bond proxies. In recent results, it is notable that net interest margins (effectively banks' profits from loans) have been coming down amid competition for UK mortgages, so investors should be prepared that recent generosity in dividend payments might not continue.</p><p>                     Keeping an eye on change                   </p><p>So how do investors keep an eye on the companies that are successfully effecting change? Which businesses are either value or quality traps and which have potential to positively rerate or continue to deliver growth, respectively? There is also something to be said for the school of thought that managers and investors can be blinded by the narrative around change when it is delivering very little true value for the business.</p><p>At the company level, there needs to be a rigorous assessment of change. Firstly, the year-on-year trends revealed by the financial statements. True, there are years when the cash flow statement can look to have deteriorated, but this may be due to investment, a buyback or special dividend. Likewise the income statement could be hit by cyclical weakness.</p><p>Management decisions and the responses businesses make to external challenges must build resilience and seize opportunities change presents. To this end, one of the best approaches is to drill into the success of business investment. This doesn't have to mean line-by-line minutia, but measurements such as the cash return on capital invested (CROCI) is a good indicator of whether the business is getting its change strategy right for the most part. The trend in cash profits generated as a proportion of capital employed give an idea whether a business is going in the right direction. For companies where the trend is downward, it may be a sign that they are more dinosaur than chameleon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-55261914</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WTP-F301-JCJY-G4FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3846\"/><timeReceived>GENERAL_EDIT_CORRECTION ERROR Document ID 17 Has error Validate old format failed - Input Date Invalid - 0001: Unparseable date: \"0001\"GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 16, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002PWJ</classCode><className>ALLIANZ SE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

At its best, capitalism should embody a spirit of creative destruction, with stockpicking the art of identifying winners. Some companies fall by the wayside, but - just as species evolve physical advantages to survive in nature - businesses adept at change thrive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Transmorphism has always been a feature of the stock market. Essentially, buying shares demonstrates faith in change - that companies will generate returns on capital by creating innovative products and cracking new markets. Even in ex-growth industries, holding stock implies optimism that businesses will adapt to a world in flux and keep throwing offcash to reward believers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chameleon companies might find a catalyst for rapid sales growth, or position themselves at the vanguard of new technology and secular trends. Sometimes they alter corporate structure to expose hitherto unnoticed value or facilitate the pursuit of new growth ventures. Those that get it right have proved to be exceptional investments.</p><p>Amazon: the great exemplar of change Amazon (US:AMZN) is unsurpassed as a specimen of corporate Darwinism. Having gone from online bookstore to the dominant global player in e-retail, evolution remains a hallmark of the business. Its prominence in cloud technology, through Amazon Web Services (AWS), is now a major strand of the investment case. Whereas five or six years ago, nobody was talking about AWS, this revenue line now makes it possible to look beyond quarterly retail sales expectations when assessing the stock.</p><p>Fund managers, such as Charles Plowden of Monks Investment Trust (MNKS), maintain trust in Amazon's management to deliver. He says: \"Flexibility and ambition don't fit into a DCF [discounted cash flow] spreadsheet.\" These qualities, which have rewarded investors handsomely, are why he isn't concerned about granularity. He focuses on \"direction, not the detail\" of the business.</p><p>Further growth opportunities go beyond ownership of Whole Foods and mooted takeovers, with expansion into online grocery. Successful roll-out of the Alexa system, voice-recognition technology and huge data banks from more than 100m devices open new avenues to disrupt computing platforms as clicking and swiping takes a back seat to simply asking for information.</p><p>Smart innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) and the success of AWS are reasons why Mike Seidenberg, a portfolio manager and analyst at the Allianz Technology Trust (ATT) admires Amazon. Explaining that many young developers have grown up using AWS, Mr Seidenberg says it's \"a really powerful sticky revenue generator\" for the business.</p><p>\"Investing,\" says Mr Plowden, \"is about harnessing the future at a rapid rate. In Amazon's case that's the three-to-four next big things.\" Although he doesn't believe going head to head with Netflix (US:NFLX) is a core focus, Amazon has still spent $5bn on original content. Going further into food and applications of voice recognition and AI technology, particularly in healthcare, are areas to exploit.</p><p>Restructuring, simple as ABC\u2026 Leadership in next-generation healthcare is a huge prize and Amazon will be going head to head with Alphabet (US:GOOG) for the spoils. The restructuring in October 2015 that saw online search giant Google spawn its own parent was a highly visible example of change as a statement of intent. Advertising revenue from the search business was to continue generating profits to justify the company's valuation, while other subsidiaries, effectively funded by Google, focus on revolutionary products.</p><p>At this stage, some professional investors seem cautious. Even though ATT reduced its position earlier this year, Alphabet is a very good company in Mr Seidenberg's view. His reservation, however, is that search makes other parts of the group difficult to value: \"Great companies find incremental products and services that customers like. [The thing is] Google's first product [search] is so good, [what is] the chance the second will be so great?\" Google's innovations have been fantastic for individuals and advertisers, but are baked into the Alphabet share price (although Mr Seidenberg thinks there is scope to further monetise the incredibly useful Google Maps). What's hard for analysts to estimate is the upside Alphabet's earnings will eventually see from other subsidiaries, even those that seem exciting.</p><p>Ben Rogoff, the manager of Polar Capital Technology Trust (PCT), describes Alphabet as having \"innovator's dilemma\", where it's \"hard to reinvent yourself and hard to replicate market share in a new market\". Yet, in some of those markets Alphabet is targeting, the rewards will be significant. PCT was, at the time of speaking with Mr Rogoff, slightly underweight to its benchmark on Alphabet, but he explained his feelings towards investing in the group: \"[Alphabet's] value [is a] bit like a conglomerate of founder businesses - [you] want to be involved with brilliant people worrying already about where the pack is headed.\" Potentially, that direction is very lucrative. Alphabet's DeepMind Technologies reported a breakthrough in using AI to predict patients' risk of kidney damage on 31 July 2019 - exactly the sort of news that will start analysts thinking about valuing the group beyond Google.</p><p>Driverless vehicles could be another AI jackpot for Alphabet through its Waymo division. As of March 2019, Waymo had 600 driverless cars on the road and had ordered 62,000 Chrysler Pacificas and 20,000 I-Pace vehicles from Jaguar to expand its fleet. That puts it a long way behind Tesla (US:TSLA) in terms of volumes (Tesla delivered 95,200 vehicles in the second quarter of 2019, source: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Statista.com\">www.Statista.com</url>), but over the long run, being underwritten by the cash flows of a large tech conglomerate - that also has strategic investments in cab hailing app Uber (US:UBER) and ride-sharing app Lyft (US:LYFT) - is a source of considerable advantage for Waymo.</p><p>Ubiquity encourages scrutiny Gathering, holding and controlling petabytes of sensitive information has naturally seen tech companies draw attention from regulators. The European Union's general data protection regulations (GDPR) were designed to give consumers more control over what was being harvested, although companies have been crafty in using additional functionality of services as bait for consent. Of most concern to the tech giants is US antitrust threats to break them up. In the case of Alphabet, Mr Rogoffthinks this has been overplayed: \"[The] business won't get broken up, [it] drives utility to billions of people.\" He also believes the risks to privacy that do exist are manageable.</p><p>For Facebook (US:FB.), which was already in hot water over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there might be more cause to be nervous, especially if chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's intention to move into the sphere of money creation with his Libra project upsets governments, central banks and regulators. From a competition perspective, the acquisitions of chat app Whatsapp and photo-sharing app Instagram have prevented the Facebook platform from being disrupted by apps that are more popular with a younger demographic.</p><p>Instagram has truly become a phenomenon thanks to its chat and photo-sharing experience and the ability to follow celebrities. Famous users such as the Kardashian/Jenner sisters and Cristiano Ronaldo can command fees of up to $1m per post to push brands. The business is now one of the main bull points for Facebook in Mr Seidenberg's opinion: \"Instagram is incredibly good at satisfying advertisers' needs. From a branding perspective, it's a beautiful product, whimsical and visual, [the] series of photos [are] totally engaging.\"</p><p>Changing nature of competition adds uncertainty for Big Tech One of the major issues for the tech giants is that they are trying to out-do one another in new industries, not just disrupting lumbering incumbents as they have done in media, retail and telecommunication sectors since the late 1990s. Google Cloud Platform is lagging Amazon Web Services and Microsoft (US:MSFT) in one fast-growing market, and competition is heating up in healthcare.</p><p>Microsoft's experience in revamping its business after some disappointing years provides a useful case study in resilient features to watch out for in a maturing company facing growth challenges. The business has never come close to denting Google's pre-eminence in search with Bing, and Microsoft failed badly in mobile with Nokia and the Windows phone operating systems.</p><p>What Microsoft has, however, is an outstanding core product in its Office software, which keeps generating cash. The useful life of its software allowed it leeway to endure some false dawns before finding another growth product. Now the cloud services business is another good reason to hold the stock in the view of Mr Seidenberg, who credits Microsoft with having \"done an amazing job for customers on [their] journey onto the cloud\".</p><p>Do expectations of growth-challenged Apple need to change? Apple (US:AAPL) was long held up as a true innovator. It went from occupying a quality niche in desktop computer hardware to disrupting portable music, and creating the smartphone and tablet markets. Now, as consumers have switched from owning to renting music and media content, iTunes is no more and the quality end of the smartphone market is saturated. The challenge is finding new products and services that can take the iPhone's crown as Apple's sales growth driver.</p><p>Polar Capital's Mr Rogoffhas been a long-time admirer of Apple, but the fund is more underweight in its holding than it has been for some time, although Apple still dominates the quality end of the smartphone market. In North America, while in volume terms it faces serious competition from cheaper phones, in dollar terms it still has 40 per cent market share. Based on some simple short-cut calculations (dividing annual sales by active users) Mr Rogoffestimates that the replacement cycle for the iPhone is three to four years, with a trend towards lengthening.</p><p>With the unit market shrinking as it matures, innovation needs to switch to software and services, which is a challenging pivot for a business that built its position on dominance in design. The departure of Jony Ive, the head of design who set the standard in tech aesthetics, could be seen as symbolic of the crossroads the company is at.</p><p>Fund managers who have followed the Apple story for many years aren't, unlike journalists, prone to hyperbole when interpreting every stage of its evolution. Mr Rogoffis clear that Apple continues to deserve credit for being able to throw offenormous amounts of cash and that \"it's not an incumbent in trouble, but is growth challenged\".</p><p>Efforts to diversify revenues from the iPhone haven't been without success, Mr Rogoffsays: \"Apple music and AirPods [the company's wireless headphone music system] make sense, [Apple is] now the 2nd biggest watch company in the world by revenue. Trouble is, it's the price.\" This assessment reflects the balancing act between quality, premium price positioning and growth.</p><p>Already, cheap-to-manufacture alternatives to hardware innovations such as AirPods are emerging. New wireless headphones by brands such as House of Marley (which are eco-friendly and received positive reviews from tech blog Engadget) compete even on Apple's premium design patch. Increasingly, a pivot to software and services looks to be the best bet for longer-term growth. In the meantime, maybe investors should be assessing Apple's attractiveness against the book value of its assets (including a $37bn cash pile), rather than on a price-toforward-earnings-growth basis. Of course, ultimately how that cash is used will interest investors most.</p><p>Altering corporate structure can aid strategy Apple's cash war chest is the stuffof dreams for most companies. Businesses not in that rare position can split out and spin offindebted divisions to create a leaner structure. Not only does this offer operational efficiencies, but it can precipitate a rerating for shares as analysts appreciate value that was hitherto hidden.</p><p>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) hopes separating its pharmaceutical and healthcare businesses will galvanise its strategy to grow through investment in the pharma drug pipeline. The new healthcare division, a joint venture with Pfizer (US:PFE), moves a large chunk of debt from GSK, freeing up cash from interest payments for research and development. This renewed focus on future growth could still place the dividend at risk as more cash may be needed for the strategy. Shifting the emphasis to long-term growth is not exactly changing what the business does, but it does affect what investors should expect from the shares.</p><p>Changes in corporate structure can be a way of defending against takeover bids, even if there is no change in the operational or investment focus of a business. Prudential's (PRU) de-merger of its European M&amp;G Prudential arm was done to reflect its true value. Mr Plowden describes the move as \"an attempt to reduce discount to underlying asset values\", which is brought about by the perception of the Pru as a UK insurance company when 60 per cent of its business is now in Asia.</p><p>It's not what a company does any more, it's about what it owns Geographical focus can gradually shift over time due to market penetration and development or thanks to the cumulative effect of mergers and acquisitions. A company's essence in terms of its culture and the products it makes and sells can alter too. This change can be driven by acquisitions, trends or the external environment.</p><p>South African company Naspers (JSE:NPN) is a poster child of change. The company started life as a newspaper publishing company in 1912 and had a very dark history as the mouthpiece for the Apartheid regime, until South Africa's rebirth with Nelson Mandela's election as president in 1994. Nowadays, Naspers is more than a media company, with much value in its portfolio in emerging market assets and businesses that private investors have difficulty accessing. Concentration is skewed by a large holding in Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent (HKG:0700), but it has other emerging market exposure too: \"Naspers is in all the other bits [of the global economy] that Google, Amazon and Chinese [companies] are not,\" Mr Plowden says.</p><p>Karma chameleon - green concerns drive change Some businesses are caught up in serious issues facing humanity. As existential crises go, they don't come much bigger than global warming and companies that have a pivotal role in meeting the world's 21st century energy challenges are facing demands to change. The London Stock Exchange creating a category called nonrenewable energy seems odd on one level - why make pariahs of Royal Dutch Shell (RDSB) and BP (BP.), two of the biggest companies in the UK? But it does demonstrate the seriousness with which capital markets are beginning to take environmental issues.</p><p>It should be remembered, however, that these companies have had to be experts at change. Fluctuation in energy prices, geopolitical tensions and currency movements have all had to be managed. Yet these businesses have been remarkably consistent in delivering earnings growth, maintaining cash flow and paying dividends. Arguably, the UK oil majors are better placed than global rivals to meet the clean energy challenges - compared with say Exxon Mobil (US:MOB), which is perennially on environmental, social and governance (ESG) naughty lists - which could even provide a future source of competitive advantage.</p><p>Being changed by the external competitive or technological landscape The threat of Armageddon isn't the only change issue that can affect the investment case for businesses that have long been staples of defensive portfolio allocations. One of the most difficult things for any type of change management is that incremental adjustments aren't noticeable, but the cumulative and compound effect of lots of little butterfly wings can eventually become a hurricane.</p><p>Consumer staples companies such as Unilever (ULVR) and Reckitt Benckiser (RB.) have long been prized for their dividends and low volatility, underpinned by exceptional returns on capital employed (ROCE).</p><p>Yet the change that has slowly occurred in the background makes these businesses far less defensive than in the past. For starters, the rise of web retail - Amazon again - has removed the physical barrier to entry that branded consumer staples once had, namely that supermarket shelf space crowded out the competition. Online, unlimited shelf space and the ability to sort results on price mean brands win relatively less prominence.</p><p>Secondly, as our investment columnist Phil Oakley has argued, the quality of own-brand goods has improved greatly and distributors such as Amazon are starting to push theirs aggressively. Thirdly, the power of advertising is owned by influencers on new channels such as Instagram and YouTube. In the case of Amazon, its status as a huge conglomerate means it can dominate advertising in its own TV and web distribution channels and, going even further, its AI and voice recognition technology can even prompt purchases and steer consumers to its own goods.</p><p>These changes weren't all easy to spot, but the sales outlook for companies such as Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever is now not as certain as their defensive nature would suggest. In the long term this could mean risk to dividends, especially if money is thrown at brand-building unsuccessfully. The cash return on capital invested (CROCI) at Reckitt Benckiser has been in a downward trend, which could be taken as a sign of the difficulties it faces in generating future shareholder value.</p><p>Other defensives that have changed include utilities. This is a classic case of complacency. The threats are not only regulatory and legal - a nationalising Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn can't be ruled out - but they are social, environmental and technological. The falling cost and rising demand for green energy, the impact of less reliable rainfall and population density, mean there are growing capital expenditure demands on utility companies. Coupled with the overhang of years of borrowing against future cash flows - which creates an interest expense - the free cash flow positions needed to support maintaining, never mind progressing, dividends looks far from assured.</p><p>Worryingly, as the economic situation deteriorates around the world, there are fewer sources of safe defensive income for investors to ride out bad times. Low bond yields forced investors into defensive income-paying stocks counter-cyclically, so these businesses are already expensive and pricey stocks aren't where you want to be if the market falls. Counter-intuitively some of the better income bets are to be found by sifting through the rubble of the last crisis.</p><p>Banks can never be compared to utilities or consumer staples in the 1990s, they are too vulnerable to so many outside factors, but this does mean they aren't as expensive as other income stocks, and banks once again offer some of the most generous payouts in the FTSE 100. Banks aren't chameleons in terms of what they do - although there is an inner identity struggle between focusing on retail or investment banking - but their role in a portfolio is markedly different now than pre-2008.</p><p>In the mid-2000s banks were all about total returns - using unsafe leverage to grow the value of their loan books underpinned capital growth, along with delivering substantial net interest margin which helped ramp up forward expectations and support a generous dividend. The growth aspect of holding bank shares is, even for companies such as HSBC (HSBA) and Standard Chartered (STAN) which focus more on emerging Asia, far less assured than in the past. Repaired balance sheets, however, have enabled the banks to redistribute more of the profits they do make as dividends.</p><p>The thing about change, though, is that sometimes new risks replace the old. In the case of banks, the core equity tier one capital ratios used to judge solvency and the robustness of balance sheets depend largely on the safety rating assigned to various assets, ie loans. Once again, mortgage lending is potentially an issue. So, while banks may look like the best value dividend payers out there - making them chameleons in the sense of the role played in a portfolio - they haven't morphed into low-risk bond proxies. In recent results, it is notable that net interest margins (effectively banks' profits from loans) have been coming down amid competition for UK mortgages, so recent generosity in dividend payments might not continue.</p><p>Keeping an eye on change So how do investors keep an eye on the companies that are successfully effecting change? Which businesses are either value or quality traps and which have potential to positively rerate or continue to deliver growth? There is also something to be said for the school of thought that managers and investors can be blinded by the narrative around change when it is delivering very little true value.</p><p>At the company level, there needs to be a rigorous assessment of change. Firstly, the year-on-year trends revealed by the financial statements. There are years when the cash flow statement can look to have deteriorated, but this may be due to investment, a buyback or special dividend. Likewise the income statement could be hit by cyclical weakness. Management decisions and the responses made to external challenges must build resilience and seize the opportunities change presents. One of the best approaches is to drill into the success of business investment. This doesn't have to mean lineby-line minutia, but measurements such as the cash return on capital invested (CROCI) are a good indicator of whether the business is getting its change strategy right. The trend in cash profits generated as a proportion of capital employed give an idea whether a business is going in the right direction.

An independent report, commissioned by the chancellor into digital competition across the UK, has just been published ahead of the Spring Statement, which is set to be delivered before Parliament today. In the 150-page report, a competition expert panel led by Harvard professor Jason Furman has called for a comprehensive upgrade to competition policy and the formation of a pro-competition digital markets unit.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), meanwhile, must take more frequent and firmer action against mergers and acquisitions between tech firms, with a set of refreshed and tougher enforcement powers. </p><p>The current landscape, the report also argues, is detrimental to digital startups who are being motivated primarily by the aim of being bought out by a major tech firm, rather than seeking to disrupt the field. \"Competition is fundamental to ensuring the market works in the interest of consumers, but we know some tech giants are still accumulating too much power, preventing smaller businesses from entering the market,\" Hammond said. \"The work of Jason Furman and the expert panel is invaluable in ensuring we're at the forefront of delivering a competitive digital marketplace. \"I will carefully examine the proposals put forward by the panel before responding later this year, setting out how the government will implement the changes needed to ensure our digital markets are competitive and consumers get the level of choice they deserve.\" The government has responded positively to the findings, with Hammond set to make an initial response in his Spring Statement speech this afternoon, with a concrete set of responses due this summer. This is in addition to an online harms white paper jointly-devised by the Home Office and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which due to be released before the end of the winter. The 20 recommendations issued by the independent panel is headlined by the formation of the digital markets unit, which the group says should be filled with sufficient expertise in technology, economics and behavioural science to effectively regulate the market. The new unit should also give consumers more control over their data by allowing people to switch between platforms more easily. The CMA should also formally launch a market study into the digital advertising market which is dominated by two players, namely Google and Facebook, and is said to also suffer from a lack of transparency. \"The digital sector has created substantial benefits but these have come at the cost of increasing dominance of a few companies which is limiting competition and consumer choice and innovation,\" chair of the independent review Jason Furman said. \"The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, was right to recognise there is a better way than just continuing with the status quo. My panel is outlining a balanced proposal to give people more control over their data, give small businesses more of a chance to enter and thrive, and create more predictability for the large digital companies. \"These recommendations will deliver an economic boost driven by UK tech start-ups and innovation that will give consumers greater choice and protection.\" The report follows a host of similar findings from a variety of voices, including a House of Commons select committee[1] and the Labour Party[2]. Both organisations have independently called for a new regulatory regime to govern the growing power of big tech firms, including the formation of an independent regulator for the digital industry. The findings of the report also largely correlate with a diagnosis set out by presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, who over the weekend echoed Labour's calls major tech companies to be \"broken up\"[3]. However, the chancellor is not expected to introduce a remedy as extreme when he sets out the governments position later today.

Voters can access the guide online at azcentral.com to read candidates' full answers.</p><p>Here's a look at some of their responses.</p><p>COVID-19 response</p><p>Chandler was one of the last Phoenix-area cities to close library and park amenities as COVID-19 case were confirmed in Arizona in early March and among the first to reopen amenities as a statewide stay-home order was eased in early May.</p><p>Council candidates weighed in on whether the city was as responsive as it should have been in addressing the health crisis.</p><p>Brizel: The former school board member in the Kyrene Unified School District said the city should have been more proactive in mandating masks in public rather than waiting for a countywide mandate. \"Until the trend line goes down, mask wearing needs to be mandatory. I do not want to see Chandler, Maricopa County or the state of Arizona shut down again. I believe Chandler had the chance to be a leader but let that opportunity pass.\"</p><p>Ellis: The longtime Chandler resident who owns several assisted living homes in the East Valley said health officials still are learning about the virus and it's easy to pass judgement. \"It is too easy to point fingers, be judgmental and pull the politics card out when we should be directing our energies and knowledge to fighting COVID-19. As a medical professional, I watch in awe as my colleagues learn and expound more and more about this disease every day. Ironically, some of what we learn is contradictory, making many of yesterday's answers today's mistakes.\"</p><p>Harris: The owner of a small media company and founder and CEO of the Ready Set Go Foundation, a nonprofit that helps entrepreneurs in underserved communities, Harris said, \"Our current council did nothing to protect Chandler, and that inaction put people in danger.\" He said the slow response will have lasting effects as the city recovers from the pandemic. \"Addressing it is simply to look at the data and listen to the experts. I would depoliticize my decisions and make the politically unpopular decision, or mandate, if I felt it was in the best interest of the community. I would not punt the political football to curry favor with higher offices.\"</p><p>Heumann: A vice president of sales at California Marketing Associates, Heumann said a city council's top priority is public safety and that he didn't feel that Chandler \"was a leader\" in ensuring residents' safety at first. \"We need to make cautious decisions based on the advice of health and science experts. We need to make our citizens feel safe, so that they will continue to keep our economy moving forward. If people don't feel safe, they will not venture out. This can be done in a responsible manner with city leadership. This isn't about politics but using the data to make informed policy.\"</p><p>McClymonds: The financial adviser and small-business owner said the city was responsive to the pandemic. \"We followed the data closely and made each decision based on facts and data. With the implementation of various safety and cleaning protocols, we were able to continue, without interruption, to provide our citizens the essential first-class services that they deserve.\"</p><p>Stewart: The owner of a marketing and brand company said he is \"proud\" of how city staff and residents have responded, but more can be done. \"Mayor, staff, police, and fire were meeting and planning months before coronavirus hit Arizona hard. That said, there is always more that can be done, and I encourage all Chandler residents to take every reasonable precaution to keep your neighbors and our community safe.\"</p><p>Maintaining position as a tech hub</p><p>The candidates weighed in on what Chandler must do to maintain its position as a Valley tech hub amid growing tech sectors in neighboring cities and in the West Valley.</p><p>Brizel: The city needs to preserve available land in employment corridors for future growth and aggressively recruit companies. \"We need to reach out to the leaders of our current global high tech corporations like Intel, Microchip and PayPal, and work with them to recruit the next generation of companies. We need to work with state economic entities on an aggressive global marketing plan to find new tenants for the buildings along the corridor.\"</p><p>Ellis: \"Infrastructure, a business friendly environment, quality education and housing are the magnets that will keep and attract technology based industry to Chandler.\" She said the long-term vision and planning by previous councils that helped turn the Price Corridor into a major jobs hub must be updated for \"2020 and beyond.\"</p><p>Harris: Being attuned to businesses' needs and having a qualified workforce are some of the ways Chandler can remain competitive. \"Adaptable infrastructure and the ability for city codes and our government to keep pace with the change in technology is imperative. Providing a pipeline of qualified workers and ensuring these workers can afford to live in Chandler. Providing the types of incentives and programs that keep Chandler competitive while attracting businesses. Finally, ensuring our City Council and our community provide an environment that welcomes the diverse array of people who generally work in these tech jobs so they feel comfortable and represented in our city, schools and community at large.\"</p><p>Heumann: The city must maintain its infrastructure and ensure it has sufficient water supplies for future business needs. The city also should work with school leaders to push for adequate school funding to ensure a skilled workforce. \"Without a first-class education system, businesses will not have the talent pool to ensure that they have enough fully skilled workers, to help their companies expand and prosper.\"</p><p>McClymonds: \"To continue driving the local economy, we need to recruit future innovators to set-up shop in our City. This not only gives our citizens the opportunity for well-paying, fulfilling jobs, but it allows Chandler to stay at the forefront of community innovation.\"</p><p>Stewart: The city must maintain a good quality of life that is attractive to potential employers. \"Tech companies that provide high-quality jobs want to locate in a city that has excellent schools, safe streets, parks, and good overall quality of life. We must innovate, build on our success, and remain fiscally prudent to stay competitive, not just in Arizona, but nationally.\"</p><p>Affordable housing</p><p>Rising costs have put a squeeze on renters and buyers around metro Phoenix. Residents in Chandler pegged housing as a top priority last year.</p><p>Here's what candidates said the city can do to encourage more affordable housing.</p><p>Brizel: The city must maximize land use as it approaches buildout and preserve existing neighborhoods. \"There are few remaining parcels of land available for large affordable, master planned communities. Much of the housing development is on smaller in-fill parcels that are scattered throughout Chandler. Providing affordable housing options - especially for first time homeowners and empty-nesters - is one of my priorities. I will work with the city planners, developers, and builders to create innovative affordable housing designs. Finally, we need smarter growth initiative to preserve and revitalize traditional neighborhoods.\"</p><p>Ellis: Changes to existing zoning and incentives could help increase affordable options. \"Longtime residents of Chandler tell me that for the past 50 years differing housing demands challenged Chandler. Currently the demand for housing in Chandler keeps driving the prices up. We must encourage and persuade developers to build quality affordable housing using incentives and zoning regulations if needed.\"</p><p>Harris: The city needs to take steps to incentivize affordable developments and revitalize existing neighborhoods. \"Incentives and tax breaks for rehabilitation, relaxed or innovative zoning to help financially vulnerable communities, engaging our big tech and big business communities to look for new creative solutions to facilitate rehab &amp; development in these traditional neighborhoods. ... The City Council also needs to look at redlining practices and do everything in our power to revitalize our neighborhoods, not gentrify them.\"</p><p>Heumann: He is chair of the city's Planning and Zoning Commission and said partnering with private developers is one way to develop affordable housing. \"Using public private partnerships, we can have the development sector build out quality affordable housing options that will enable our teachers, retail workers, and other middle-class members of our community to live, work, and play in our city. This can be a winning formula for both our developers and our city.\"</p><p>McClymonds: He said one way to ensure homes remain affordable is to assist lower-income earners with emergency or minor home repairs \"to maintain decent, safe and sanitary living conditions.\" The city also recently approved its five-year housing budget, which called for adding 100 affordable units to the city's public housing, he said.</p><p>Stewart: \"The City Council makes important decisions about planning and zoning that affect the landscape of Chandler. We look at what the effect will be on the larger community, especially current residents. This includes balancing the needs of the business, retail and housing sectors to keep Chandler an affordable and dynamic city.\"</p><p>Reach reporter Paulina Pineda at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:paulina.pineda@azcentral.com\">paulina.pineda@azcentral.com</email> or 480-389-9637.

The new consumer privacy platform helps companies comply and offers an easy way for consumers to look up the data companies have on them, said IntraEdge President Dan Clarke.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We knew GDPR was on the horizon, and we also knew people weren't prepared,\" Clarke said. \"This is one of the few high-volume applications for blockchain outside of cryptocurrency. ... This is like a credit report for your personal data.\"</p><p>Early adopters, like fitness company CrossFit Inc., shoe maker Rocket Dog and vegan makeup maker Lime Crime, allow their customers to see their buying preferences, shoe size, clothing size and other personal information the companies have gathered on them. The platform allows their customers to use the service for free and correct their data if they wish, Clarke said.</p><p>The GDPR is a European regulation involving data protection and privacy for subjects/residents within the European Union. The regulation also includes exporting personal data outside of the European area, and many multinational companies are giving privacy rights to all its customers worldwide to comply.</p><p>\"European subjects now have a human right to get this data, a right to see and correct the data and transfer data,\" Clarke said. \"We think something like this is coming to the U.S. soon.\"</p><p>IntraEdge spent millions of dollars within the company to partner with the big tech firms to build this, using blockchain technology that originated from Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC).</p><p>IntraEdge is an 1,100-employee company that primarily does staffing and outsource software development for enterprise companies, such as Intel, American Airlines and American Express.</p><p>Clarke joined the company two years ago after serving as executives at two companies that were IntraEdge customers. Clarke worked at Intel for 10 years as a general manager and was the CEO of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/blog/techflash/2016/05/chandler-energy-management-tech-startup-raises-4.html\">Chandler-based Small Box Energy</url>, among many other CEO and co-founder roles of other tech companies, including companies bought by Google Inc. and Infineon.</p><p>Since Clarke has known IntraEdge CEO and founder Kal Somani for about 10 years, the two talked for years about building projects together, Clarke said.</p><p>\"I told him we should be able to come up with our own projects,\" said Clarke. \"Our idea was to pick bigger companies with problems to solve that they couldn't solve for whatever reason.\"</p><p>Not surprisingly, Intel was the first partner, and that's how the platform for consumer privacy was born about a year ago, Clarke said.</p><p>BDO USA LLP is the first organization to integrate GDPR Edge into its governance, risk and compliance advisory services. Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) also joined in promoting the technology partnership and product launch.</p><p>IntraEdge is hiring about 180 people, with about half of those open positions in the Valley. Open positions include software developers, data scientists and programmers. These high-wage jobs include salaries from $60,000 to $150,000.</p><p>\"We work on cool stuff like blockchain, big data and security,\" Clarke said. \"People hire us because of our leading-edge expertise.\"</p><p>IntraEdge started 12 years ago and has its headquarters next to Intel's Chandler campus.</p><p>Other notable new hires at IntraEdge include: Christie Kerner, an entrepreneur in residence in charge of head of operations for GDPR Edge, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/potmsearch/detail/submission/5314052/Christie_Kerner\">formerly with Arizona State University</url> and Startup Grind; Jerrod Bailey, chief strategy officer, co-founder and former       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://cms.bizjournals.com/stories/edit/6257423\">president and COO of ClickIPO Holdings</url>; and Jonathan Cottrell, in charge of user experience, originator of Phoenix Startup Week and #yesphx       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2017/08/25/20-people-to-know-startups-jonathan-cottrell.html\">and a local entrepreneur</url>.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

This is the explanation of some analysts for why there hasn't been a boycott against the big internet companies. If people cared, surely scandals like when Facebook leaked the personal data of 50 million Americans to Cambridge Analytica, or reports that Google secretly purchased financial data to track users' purchases would've led to some sort of departure from these platforms by now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem: It seems people do care. The Pew Research Center found that 80 percent of users were concerned about businesses and advertisers accessing the data they share on social media platforms. Furthermore, 61 percent of users said they would like to do more to protect their privacy.</p><p>So why haven't people stopped using Google or Facebook?</p><p>Because there aren't viable alternatives. Sure, there are a number of companies that aim to provide privacy as part of their product - Duck Duck Go for your search engine, Signal for messaging, FastMail for email. However, the costs of switching make it unrealistic for most people.</p><p>For example, if you want to use Signal for messaging, you would have to convince each person you message with on Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, etc., to switch over to Signal in order to message them. To use FastMail for email, it costs $30 per year minimum. Additionally, there is the hassle of transferring contacts, photos and prior data to these new services.</p><p>Why aren't there real alternatives? The nature of many tech companies means the value of their products increase as more people use them. This makes challenging the big tech firms a herculean task, as not only do you need a competitive product, you also need to be able to overcome a massive user base disadvantage (almost a third of the world's population uses Facebook). Further exacerbating this situation is one from the the wide array of anti-competitive actions that tech companies employ.</p><p>For instance, tech companies often use acquisitions to snuff out potential competition and expand into new industries. Many of Google's central products such as YouTube, Android and DoubleClick (Google's ad service) were acquired as start-ups. Forays into new technologies such as the internet of things and artificial intelligence were jump-started by purchases as well - Nest and DeepMind respectively. Furthermore, companies that compete with Google's products face challenges including Google wielding its product arsenal to place them at a disadvantage, like when Google manipulated search results to promote its own services and demote competitors offering similar services.</p><p>This pattern of anti-competitive actions can be found across the tech giants. Whether it's Amazon purposefully hemorrhaging hundreds of millions of dollars to force an acquisition, or Facebook purchasing potential competitors like WhatsApp and Instagram, anti-competitiveness is a core feature of the big internet companies' business models. These practices make it difficult for consumers to influence the marketplace, reducing their ability to hold companies accountable by taking their business elsewhere.</p><p>There are signs that tech companies' bigness is starting to be noticed. In the European Union, Google faces two fines due to anti-trust violations - each with a price tag over $2 billion. U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a presidential candidate for 2020, has introduced antitrust legislation that includes a ban on acquisitions for companies with a market capitalization above $100 billion (Facebook, Google and Amazon all have market capitalizations well above $100 billion). Lina Khan, an academic fellow at Columbia University and a former legal fellow at the Federal Trade Commission, has proposed a new legal theory, which contends that even when monopolies appear to benefit consumers by offering free services or low prices, they can still be deeply harmful. She argues that these monopolies can distort not just markets, but American life, through things like enormous tax cuts, commissioned studies and aggressive lobbying (Amazon's HQ2 debacle illustrates this perfectly).</p><p>To put power back in consumers' hands, the tech giants should be treated as the behemoths that they are. Unrestrained expansion has made consumers powerless to influence the market with their choices, and now government must step in on their behalf with oversight and regulations that hold companies accountable. The scale of the largest tech companies has given us free services and revolutionary products, but that scale has externalities that must be dealt with.</p><p>It's a mistake to interpret consumers' inaction in the tech industry as apathy. People truly care about their privacy on the internet, but the current situation makes action unrealistic for many. Until the tech industry becomes a properly functioning market - or is regulated like a public utility - consumers will be stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>Chand Rajendra-Nicolucci can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:chandrn@umich.edu\">chandrn@umich.edu</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4071077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHK-BH21-JBSN-3469-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Michigan Daily: University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Amid the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression, Big Tech is roaring ahead. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  While tech's largest grow larger, it has been a brutal quarter for start-ups and smaller companies, which have laid off or furloughed thousands of people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Where does Silicon Valley go from here? Even if the technology giants grow more powerful, change is coming for them, too. The regulatory and antitrust standards developed for the industrial age are not enough to protect competition and consumer rights in the digital age, and this crisis is forcing policymakers to confront that. The rules under which Big Tech has been playing may finally get an update.</p><p>  History tells us this has happened before. Detroit's automobile industry began the 20th century as a cluster of venture-backed start-ups -- another group of young tinkerers in garages, securing financing from wealthy investors who were willing to take a risk on a new product that changed the way people lived and worked. By the 1930s, they were immensely innovative, lightly regulated companies, and they resisted unionization as ferociously as some tech giants do today.</p><p>  The Great Depression devastated Detroit. Sales of new cars fell by over 70 percent between 1929 and 1932. There were 40 U.S. companies making passenger cars in the late 1920s; a decade later, only 11 remained. By 1937, three giants -- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- controlled 85 percent of the market.</p><p>  The automakers that survived the Depression grew bigger and more powerful, but something changed.</p><p>  It started with the economic recovery programs proposed by President Franklin Roosevelt. Detroit executives rallied at first to help Roosevelt execute his New Deal agenda. But as wage and production controls rolled out of Washington in 1933 and 1934, big-business leaders began to express what the journalist Walter Lippmann described as ''a revulsion of feeling against bureaucratic control of American economic life.''</p><p>  Then, the unions that they had fought so successfully for decades also gained ground. As the Depression deepened, workers' demands for better pay and working conditions escalated, and autoworkers were at the vanguard. Waves of labor action in Detroit and elsewhere helped precipitate passage of the landmark National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which protected the right of workers to organize into unions, to collectively bargain and to go on strike.</p><p>  Roosevelt's support for labor increased automakers' frustration. In the winter of 1937, tension between General Motors and the White House peaked, when workers began a 44-day strike for higher wages and recognition of the United Auto Workers as a bargaining unit. The government sided with the strikers, and Roosevelt delivered a public rebuke to Alfred P. Sloan, the head of G.M., when he refused to come to Washington to negotiate.</p><p>  Within three years, however, the industry's relationship to big government and big labor had changed. Roosevelt persuaded G.M.'s president, William Knudsen, to step away from his day job for a dollar-a-year position mobilizing American industry for World War II, and he had to share authority over the war production effort with a labor leader. Although wartime regulations tightly constrained workers' ability to strike, union membership soared. By 1945, more than one-third of the nation's nonagricultural workers were unionized.</p><p>  The war effort certainly didn't hurt American automakers; they came out of the war bigger than ever and even more tightly connected to the centers of power. Charles Wilson of G.M. served as secretary of defense under President Dwight Eisenhower; Robert McNamara of Ford held the job under Presidents John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. George Romney, head of American Motors, was governor of Michigan and Richard Nixon's secretary of housing and urban development.</p><p>  But that political influence did not prevent the industry from becoming more regulated. Carmakers began voluntarily adding seatbelts to vehicles in the 1950s; in the 1960s, the government made the feature mandatory. Additional federal safety and emissions standards made cars safer for people and the environment.</p><p>  It may be too early to tell what a post-coronavirus Silicon Valley will look like, but there are some early signs of a similar transformation.</p><p>  Tech companies that long disdained big government have been urging federal leaders to do more and working with governors and mayors to address the pandemic. In Washington State, Microsoft is teaming up with public health officials to collect data about the virus and procure protective equipment. In California and New York, an effort led by Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, has delivered truckloads of masks, gowns and swabs to hospitals. Facebook, Apple and Google have been ''incredible partners,'' Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said this month.</p><p>  At the same time, the public's dependence on digital technology during the lockdown and the growing market share of some platforms has increased calls for regulation. This week, Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri called for the Justice Department to open a criminal antitrust investigation of Amazon, citing the pandemic's devastation of the retail sector. ''Amazon's reported data practices are an existential threat that may prevent these businesses from ever recovering,'' he said. Amid the shutdown, House and Senate committees have continued to consider tech privacy, which now includes concerns about how to protect personal data in the design of contact-tracing apps.</p><p>  The worker activism already rumbling through tech has also accelerated. The blue-collar workers who power the digital economy -- including fulfillment center workers and app-based couriers -- are pushing for higher pay and better protection, just as Detroit autoworkers did 90 years ago.</p><p>  The realm of political possibility is getting larger, just as it did in the 1930s. Roosevelt's New Deal consisted of ideas that had been knocking around among activists for decades, but they lacked broad-based political support -- until a crisis delivered it. Similar things are happening now, as Democrats and Republicans embrace trillions of dollars in government spending and mainstream Democratic politics tilt toward the left.</p><p>  The Great Depression threw millions of people out of work and made the economic fragility and inequalities of the 1920s painfully clear. America responded by rewriting the rules of work and business, and we could do so again.</p><p>  Margaret O'Mara (@margaretomara) is a professor of history at the University of Washington and the author of ''The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.''</p><p>  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Recent structural health care delivery plans are instilling more confidence in a market and industry that in the past have been regarded with suspicion. Much of the change is down to the new climate for business being overseen by PRC president Xi Jinping. Global law firm CMS' China expert Nick Beckett explained what is changing and why western companies should monitor developments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of the four Chinese companies that feature in In Vivo's Top 100 medical device companies by revenues for 2018 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/200800304\">Lepu Medical Technology (Beijing) Co. Ltd.</url>, cardiovascular products and services, Beijing;       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/200800299\">MicroPort Scientific Corp.</url>, orthopedic and cardiac products, Shanghai; Jiangsu Yuyue Medical Equipment &amp; Supply, Zhenjiang; and Shinva Medical Instrument Co., Shandong), only Shinva, a sterilization and disinfection equipment manufacturer, is in the top 50 of global medtech companies by US dollar-ranked revenues.</p><p>Chinese manufacturers are under-represented at this level, and so are foreign companies and their medtech innovations in China. But China is changing as demand is growing for the technologies that western patients already have access to. Changing attitudes about the value of health care will help transform China's health care industry and market in the decade ahead. Mindful of the need for quality health care for the vast local population, Chinese decision makers, from Jinping down, are overseeing an ongoing process of support and investment in the sector.</p><p>The overall framework is set out in the 13th Five-Year Plan for economic and social development of the People's Republic of China 2016-2020, listing China's strategic intentions and major objectives, tasks, and measures for economic and social development. By the end of the plan, for a national population anticipated to reach 1.42 billion in 2020, the major aims are for: China's GDP and per capita personal income to have doubled from 2010 levels; industrial production to have moved towards the medium-high end; and for visible outcomes of the support being given to foster innovation-driven development, business start-ups and internationally-competitive enterprises.</p><p>In a section dedicated to promoting a healthy China, the Plan promises deepened reform of the health care system, an emphasis on prevention, and strategies to control of chronic diseases\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 cardiovascular, brain, and vascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, respiratory disease, and mental illness. It speaks of a tiered medical diagnosis and treatment system and general practitioner capacity improvements, with the number of active physicians targeted to reach 2.5 per 1,000 people. </p><p>Enlarging the scale of the national health industry, and perfecting the health care services systems, are two of the five specific goals of Healthy China 2030: A Vision for Health Care, released in October 2016 by Jinping as a blueprint for the changes China should make in the coming decade. With innovation at its center, it advocates a role for market mechanisms, and recommends, in 29 chapters, 13 indicators and four core principles, how China must factor in reform in key areas, including in the areas of public health services, food and drug safety and the Chinese medical industry.</p><p>The ground is increasingly fertile and the population ready for the health care reforms and delivery improvements of the kinds detailed in these two reports. That is the view of CMS' Nick Beckett, the law firm's co-head of life sciences and health care, and head of Asia-Pacific IP, who spends much of his time in Beijing and greater China. Speaking to In Vivo, he observed that, in health care, China is indeed at a turning point. The markets may have heard that before, but the sense now is of real change to come.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>One reason for increased optimism that China is more ready now to turn the corner is that the youth of the country, more connected through social media, international travel and foreign education and experiences, have a greater awareness of what goes on beyond China. Other parts of the world have access to innovative devices and drugs, and China's millennials are now demanding them too. Overseas companies are monitoring this, factoring in the impact it will have. Beckett observed that these companies will need to be more patient - and consumer - focused, and ready to bring their technologies, new or yet-to-be-developed, into China to provide information and support local patients.</p><p>This comes at the same time that AI, machine learning and the advantages offered by big data - a major focus in the Five-Year Plan 2016-2020 \u0336\u00a0 are being brought to bear. For health care, AI is seen as a transformational step, and the next few years will be truly fascinating in terms of who will drive developments in the digital health care ecosystem. China is a global leader in AI, alongside the UK and US. Its homegrown major tech groups, Tencent and Alibaba especially, continue to make huge strides in digital health care delivery. In some ways, the traditional big pharma companies, especially, seem to be relatively unprepared\u00a0 \u0336 a surprise, given the accelerated pace of developments over the past four to five years.</p><p>The uptake of AI in China is one of the focus areas of a CMS \"legal perspectives\" document, \"AI in Life Sciences,\" which quotes a government prediction of the value of the Chinese AI industry in 2025: RMB400bn, according to the national \"Plan for the Development of a New Generation of AI.\" The slight puzzle, still, is that pharma and to an extent medtech too, while talking up the prospects of AI, are still grappling with the hows and whys in terms of monetizing it and bringing it into business models. They more often talk about specific bolt-ons only, but by contrast, China's Tencent, for one, is not waiting around (see below).</p><p>Awareness Of Health Care On The Up</p><p>The sense that China is ready to open up for health care entrants is boosted by the knowledge that while the population has traditionally had a low fundamental awareness of health, greater awareness of that very fact means that remedial action is unavoidable. The millennial generation's attitudes will be a contributory factor to the speed of change ahead. </p><p>Historically, as a very poor country, China has lacked a health care infrastructure. No or low primary care availability and no local GP interface have forced patients to head off to usually crowded hospitals to seek an appointment. With no yardstick about their ailment, patients have been prone to overreact to very simple issues, and so there remain big challenges around educational issues, and about patients being able to seek appropriate health care attention for perhaps minor health issues. Here is an area where awareness, from an albeit low base, is set to rise markedly. </p><p>Coupled with that, China's new vision of itself as a \"strong and growing country\" in turn fosters notions that it should rightfully have good health care. That is still not the case in the large rural areas, but there, too, a better basic understanding of health is developing. The advent of technology, and personal health care information apps that give basic information about conditions, are facilitating and driving that. </p><p>In view of this, medtech companies should be providing support to those patients who are more receptive to it and maybe even more demanding of it. This will lead to demands for better basic health care provision. Healthy China 2030 and its recommendations are central tenets of the administration, which now finds it must provide in the large rural communities the standard of health care enjoyed by the slightly more affluent people in Shanghai or Beijing, say. \"The government had to up its game in terms of quality of health care services, and, tied to the opening up of the market to private investment, it's apparent that it is all coming together,\" said Beckett.</p><p>One China</p><p>China's policies are built around a \"one country\" approach for health care, and good provision across the provinces and into the remote rural zones. The use of remote monitoring technology, such as telecare/telemedicine systems, is seen as increasingly critical in rural China. Allowing private investment is one of the strategies to develop health care provision in China's the second and third-tier cites.</p><p>While China can \"move at the speed of light\" for building projects, etc., in policy, law and regulation it sometimes moves much more slowly</p><p>The Five-Year Plan underlines the \"one country, two systems,\" approaches for Hong Kong and Macao. Hong Kong's current protests against its government over China's drive for more influence there are being watched closely for potential effects on business. China also seeks to build cross-Straits cooperation with Taiwan, under the One China approach. </p><p>Private health care, although still very small-scale, has been making inroads in China in the past three to five years, manifesting itself in the establishment of specialist clinics for respiratory disease, for example. \"The ground work has been done to allow greater investment now in both private and public private hospitals,\" said Beckett, adding however, that while China can \"move at the speed of light\" for building projects, etc, in policy, law and regulation it sometimes moves much more slowly. </p><p>Pilot Zones</p><p>Using pilot zones is a common approach of the Chinese authorities. A prime example in summer 2019 was the way it tested the new marketing authorization holder (MAA) tool for medtech. The MAH is a very significant concept that until recently did not exist in China. Medtech product license owners were typically the manufacturers, and only they could own the MA, and could only transfer it to another manufacturer. </p><p>This led to difficulties, with so much economic activity tied to manufacturing capability. The MAH system, first used in three zones, then in a further 21 this year, makes matters much easier and will lead to contracts being set up in manufacturing development. CROs and CSOs etc are expected to flourish in what will become a wider outsourcing environment. </p><p>But such processes often take several years, as the Chinese need to be totally comfortable before rolling out their scheme nationwide. </p><p>The medtech MAH rule is also seen as a boost for local innovation. \"It will be a move from basic and mid-level devices, to higher-end and probably higher-price devices, and thereby will help Chinese commercial operators be better able to compete globally,\" said Beckett. </p><p>Jinping's \"One belt one road\" trade outreach project focuses on improving connectivity and cooperation across Asia, Africa and Europe. Though not primarily a tool for medtech projects, if China were to develop large medtech champions, they too could use the OBOR to develop trading routes and find trading partners, eventually helping their global health care trading plans.</p><p>Slow China\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Critics would argue that \"eventually\" has too often been a signature word for Chinese policy initiatives. The long-awaited amendment to the PRC Drug Administration Law came into effect on 1 December 2019. It is a second major systematic and structural amendment to China's drug-administration framework since the implementation of the last significant amendment in 2001. But the amendment has been in the works since 2015. </p><p>The catalyst was the China's State Council's issuance in October 2017 of the Opinions on Deepening Regulatory Reforms to Encourage Drug and Medical Device Innovation. This proposed fundamental changes to regulatory systems, including the simplification of clinical trials, implementing the Drug Marketing Administration Holder (MAH) system, establishing a patent-linkage regime and perfecting the drug-registration process. The MAH system for medtech is slowly and carefully coming into place now.</p><p>\"Politically, China tries to do things in such a way to get everyone on side with it; not to do anything suddenly,\" Beckett observed. A frustration is that several of China's regulatory authorities are often involved in looking at the same issues at the same time (three were studying China's anti-trust and competition law), which does not make for swift passage of regulatory instruments. </p><p>In the medtech domain, the NMPA (National Medical Products Administration), the Chinese agency for regulating drugs and medical devices, has been mulling the dropping of the country of origin (COO) certification requirement for \"priority\" devices that qualify for its \"Green Channel,\" fast-track innovation approval pathway. But nervousness of making big decisions among individual regulatory executives has led to a situation where no decision has yet been taken. The culture is such that regulatory officers would rather not make a decision than make a wrong decision. In terms of the COO, the nervousness is at individual level, not at a state level. \"Looking at it through the lens of the Chinese state, it's clear China's not in a hurry, I feel,\" said Beckett. </p><p>The Green channel, the fast-track system for both innovative and priority devices, has not so far been called into action as much as had been anticipated. It was set up in 2014, but five years on, use of this route to expedite devices remains underused by manufacturers. The consensus is that the initiative has value, however. And on the regulator's side, it is a sign of preparedness to expedite the right products, Beckett noted. From a western company's perspective, as an initiative, it ties in with foreign clinical trials exemptions, quicker regulatory reviews, and products getting to market much faster, and indeed, coming to market first.</p><p>The regulations and infrastructure being put in place now in China are more internationally aligned and are more acceptable to companies in the west</p><p>Reaching Out</p><p>The regulations and infrastructure being put in place now in China are more internationally aligned, and so are more acceptable to companies in the west, which are no longer worried quite so much about each and every step they take. In the area of IP, China has formalized dialog with US judges, the UK and Japan, which is also making China more internationally accepted. \"The lens is slowly changing, and we may soon have data exclusivity and a patent linkage system. \"We already have patent recognition and special courts protecting companies' rights,\" said Beckett. </p><p>The standards are changing, and the infrastructure is being put in place that allows investors in China to have more confidence. From China's perspective, there is a drive to elevate domestic life sciences companies to \"national champion level,\" so that they can eventually compete globally. However, although there is a long way to go in the life sciences and health care spaces, where there are outstanding learning requirements, and the ongoing need for talent and know how. This makes China receptive to foreign investment and assistance in ways which, other industries, for example telecoms, simply do not need.</p><p>The recent development in the Drug Administration Law (see above) also answers in some ways the need in China to align more with international standards. The authorities are looking at bringing in a pharmacovigilance standard, and are changing the emphasis from pre-approval to more post-approval. The pre-approval stage in pharma is much faster now, enabling companies to bring products to market more swiftly, but at the same time, with increasing liabilities on them. China is on the same basic path in devices, making strides in exemptions from local clinical trials. \"It all fits,\" said Beckett.</p><p>Clearly, China is more prepared to use a mix of international and Chinese standards in its regulatory infrastructure. It is developing its own UDI system for medical devices, but using ISO-based, China-specific standards, GB (the code for national standards, issued by the Standards Administration) and YY (the\u00a0 code for medical devices, issued by the NMPA). The medtech industry follows both sets of standards, says Chao Xu, co-founder of Chinese consultancy J-Medtec (Berlin, Germany).</p><p>Imitation To Achieve Greater Goals</p><p>\"China is not afraid to copy - historically seen as a high form of flattery in China,\" said Beckett. The law, for example, is very heavily based on European law, and the patent linkage system is partially derived from the US system.</p><p>The same principle applies in the case of WeChat, the multi-purpose messaging, social media and mobile payment app, owned by Tencent Holdings. Tencent specializes in internet-related services and products, has become bigger than the concept it imitated, Facebook, and is increasingly important in digital health care. It was the first Chinese firm to have a market valuation of over $500bn. Of the three big tech players in China, including Alibaba and Baidu, Tencent is the fastest growing in health care.</p><p>Tencent Trusted Doctor now claims to connect 440,000 certified doctors with more than 10 million patients online. It collaborates with Germany's Merck KGaA, and it also operates WeDoctor, a web-appointments, education, diagnosis, and consultation tool. Alibaba is developing services to support China's primary care system through online doctor consultations.</p><p>Primary Care Issue To Be Solved</p><p>Such tools are gaining a lot of ground in the relative absence of primary care in China, where there are some very early-stage plans to install primary care services in hospitals and a push to establish smaller clinics that integrate technology. </p><p>At the same time, China sees the need to increase the standing and social status of general practitioners, who believe they are perceived as inferior to specialists. A 2017 survey by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and others revealed that Chinese physicians bear heavy physical, mental, and financial stress. Low confidence, trust and respect in them from wider society are some of their other complaints. Soberingly, over 70% would not encourage their children to follow their career path. </p><p>Talent Being Brought In</p><p>China is encouraging foreign talent into the country, including in Nanjing, the heart of the Chinese pharma industry, to leverage the knowledge to innovate and help advance the local industry. Nanjing University is a leading university in the pharmaceutical field in China. The country is welcoming new, innovative products in the life sciences domain, but it will ensure that it retains the firm hand of control over any decisions. </p><p>Another tool for developing health care and local health care business is the special zones, such as Hainan province, where the aim is to create a free trade zone and medical tourist pilot zone. It would be able to take advantage of its position to maximize the huge trading potential with Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand, among others. </p><p>The changing environment under Jinping has also seen a big push to rid the country of corruption at all levels over the past five or six years. The historical problem with corruption partly lies in the multiple layers of distributors, and the power of money. The GSK kickbacks episode and 2014 judgement scared companies and individuals alike, and everyone redoubled compliance and auditing activities, set up proper local training, and reviewed their procedures. </p><p>But the involvement of third parties still presents challenges, as it means manufacturers losing sight of what happens and possibly losing control. The government has tightened up this whole area by reducing distributor numbers, slimming down brands, introducing invoice controls, and generally tidying up the system. \"It was built in, and changing it has been a big challenge, but Xi Jinping has taken strong action and it's now a lot better than it was,\" said Beckett.</p><p>The tariff issues between the US and China have done nothing to help China's global trade ambitions, but the effects are being seen in the US too, where providers are having to consider finding alternative sources for Chinese imported devices. VC funding has been impacted recently by the US trade tensions, after a big VC funding uptake in 2018.</p><p>Strategic Signposts Point To More Health care</p><p>The Five-Year Plan and Healthy China 2030 initiative are strategic signposts for massive change, and a strong indication of where China is focusing. </p><p>They acknowledge that Chinese role model names in medtech and pharma are not there as yet, and at present, aspiring innovators in China are looking at companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson as models to emulate. </p><p>They underline the critical nature of partnerships to success in China.\u00a0 And they encourage companies to \"be the first in China,\" under the package of measures being developed for the health care products industries. China has not yet featured in the launch strategies of global companies at an early stage: it used to be at the very end of such plans. Now, it's getting to a point where companies might consider to launch in China first. \"But it's very early days there, and that notion needs more time,\" said Beckett. </p><p>Locally, investment is being improved, as seen, for example, in the new health care incubator fund in Shenzen, in the Greater Bay Area. It is a government-funded initiative, and does not yet involve huge figures, but it is an attempt to encourage start-ups from all over the world to come to China. </p><p>Conservative China's plans make it one to watch in health care in the next five years. Its plans are centrally-government led. This is a critical initiative for the Chinese government, targeting an area of great need, and providing opportunities for western and Chinese companies alike. The market is there, the infrastructure is being put in place, and there is a move towards a more consumer-led, innovative economy. China may play the long game, but western minds can probably see there is growing confidence - and a little less nervousness - about future medtech and pharma business with China. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>By <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:ashley.yeo@informa.com\">Ashley Yeo</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVIVO-IV124379</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVIVO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNS-8F01-F0JS-Y2NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436900</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3661\"/><timeReceived>6:48 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Informa All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>In Vivo</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48259\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 6, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000C9XA</classCode><className>LEPU MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY (BEIJING) CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC000A7YY</classCode><className>JIANGSU YUYUE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT &amp;

Reports that have at times prevented people from going to hospitals even when they have been very unwell. The committee also looked into the future harm is this problem could cause, for example they think people who might have read a lot of information that is wrong online could then refuse a Covid-19 vaccine when one is eventually offered. Given all of this, the findings of this report, the committee has been very critical of the government and have said they have raised the issue with them many times in many different context and they simply haven't acted quickly enough to tackle it. </p><p>Has the government been dragging its feet on this issue? Yes, I think it has. They said they were minded to make off, an online regulator as well, so just make them the regulator.

They have also levelled a lot of criticism at social media firms and the big tech companies themselves, saying not only have they allowed a lot of this stuff to spread but they have also at times profited from its proliferation. We have approached some of those big companies, Twitter and Facebook, to come on the programme to talk about this issue and explain what they have been doing to tackle it and instead they sent statements saying they have invested heavily in addressing misinformation online and say they have worked with government sent that every day they remove huge amounts of misinformation from their websites. Liz Bates. The US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in London today with Chinese rather than Russian interference at the top of his agenda. He congratulated Boris Johnson on banning the Chinese firm Huawei from the UK's future 5G phone network. Mr Pompeo accused China of covering up the coronavirus outbreak, of bullying India in the Himalayas, of making illegal territorial claims at sea. And he called for a global coalition against the Communist state. Our foreign affairs correspondent Jonathan Rugman reports. If you believe the polls, then Mike Pompeo, the great survivor of the Trump administration, could soon be out of a job. But before he goes, the task of building arguably his only significant diplomatic alliance - not against Russia, the old enemy, but China instead. The Secretary of State works for a president who hopes to meet Vladimir Putin at the UN in September, so isolating Russia is not his priority. Containing China is. And what better venue to meet parliamentary backbenchers than the In and Out Club, given that the UK last week jumped out of its relationship with Huawei, having jumped in only six months earlier. What would you like the UK to do next on China? Last week the President took credit for the UK's U-turn. We convinced many countries, I did this myself for the most part, not to use Huawei. And today MPs who helped make the case against the Chinese firm got to meet Mike Pompeo before the Prime Minister did, a mark of his thanks that the UK had finally made the choice between China and the UK's most powerful ally. He wants to create an alliance of the free world to put pressure on China to change its ways, and that was refreshing. Not just America, but now talking about others like the UK, France, Germany, India and Japan. Whether you like Donald Trump or not, they are doing ethical things by trying to get American companies to disinvest in places like Xinjiang in contrast to what we were doing a few years ago, which was going there and effectively allowing ourselves to be part of China's propaganda front. The Americans are hoping that damning pictures like these of ethnic Uighur prisoners allegedly being taken to so-called education camps will persuade the British and others to impose sanctions on Chinese Communist party officials, as the US already has. But Downing Street, while busily pursuing a trade deal with the Americans, is also waiting the Trump administration out, divided from it on Iran, climate change, Israel's plan to annex the West Bank, along with Pompeo's refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the American who fled justice after the death of Harry Dunn in a crash last August. They allowed her to leave last September. Dunn's mother Charlotte had pleaded for her son's death</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UKCHLN-5991585d88b644a8bd0115b17a8ccdb1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UKCHLN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DD-8RM1-DY08-33T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"798\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

Politicians on both sides of the House do believe, as the chairman put it at the start of the hearing today, that the companies, the big tech giants, use their dominance, he said, to shake down small businesses and enrich themselves while closing off the market. Facebook for example is accused of using its aggressive acquisition strategy, including of companies like Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon, by running the world's biggest online marketplace in which it is accused of favouring its own products rather than those of its competitors, Google, whose technology runs about 90% of online search, it was accused by the Chairman of stealing technology from its competitors, and Apple, that only allows users to download apps to its iPhone from its own App Store, for which it then takes a substantial cut of the sales. Well, we will hear from them, from the tech giants themselves, in a moment, but first, let's hear from our reporter Inigo Gilmore. </p><p>The big beasts of big tech, taking the oath remotely as they came under fire today from a Congress asking if they are now just too big and too powerful. The platforms have wielded their power in destructive, harmful ways in order to expand. So why does this matter? Many of the practices used by these companies have harmful economic effects. He said the industry's four leading chief executives have far too much power. And this inquiry is asking if their dominance is harming competition. Back in 1994, when America's largest tobacco companies testified before Congress... I don't believe that nicotine products are addictive... Their obstinate and scale real momentum to efforts to regulate that industry. Today, the tech giants are facing sustained criticism of a different kind, from politicians on both sides of the House. But critics can't agree on whether breaking up the companies is a practical way of constraining them. Some members of Congress want to regulate the four big tech companies and what they see as anti-competitive practices. Take Amazon - it's all about e-commerce and whether its products have an unfair advantage. For Facebook, questions about its hold on consumer data, with the tech giant ever more dominant, having acquired Instagram and WhatsApp. And for Google, accusations that its dominant search and advertising platform harms competitors, including news publishers. Finally, Apple - criticised by lawmakers over its gatekeeping control of the iPhone's App Store. The tech giant will make robust defences. -- giants. The Amazon CEO, owner of the Washington Post and the focus of numerous attacks by President Trump, was today invoking the humble beginnings of his company. From the outset today, Facebook was also in the firing line. Despite a litany of privacy scandals and record-breaking fines, Facebook continues to enjoy booming profits. $18 billion last year alone. In an election year, there is a big focus on platforms like Facebook and how information is disseminated, with President Trump accusing Facebook of censoring Conservative views. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg today, pushing back against criticism of its data gathering and dominance. Two years ago, revelations about Cambridge Analytica, including the undercover investigation by this programme, opened the way for Mark Zuckerberg to appear before Congress. Where he gave an indifferent performance, even though his inquisitors were poorly prepared. We didn't do enough to prevent these tools form being used for Hamas well. This time, there is asking the questions will presumably have done their homework. But many wonder what regulation if any will emerge from this one tech inquiry be operated remotely. Well, the tech giants obviously all deny using their dominance to stifle competition. Amazon's Jeff Bezos telling the committee that he was operating in a large and competitive market and that there was plenty of room for competitors. He said Amazon only comprised less than 4% of the US retail market. Apple's CEO Tim Cook said their goal was to achieve the best, he said, not the most, in any market, and that it doesn't have a dominant share, he said, in any product category or market in which it does business. If Apple is a gatekeeper, he said, then all we have done is make the gate wider. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook said the tech industry was part of what he called America's success story.

I think the true nature of competition is much broader. When Google bought YouTube, they could compete against the dominant player in video, which was the cable industry. When Amazon bought Whole Foods, they could compete against Walmart. </p><p>When Facebook bought what's up, we could compete against telcos who used to charge 10 cents a text message, but not anymore. -- WhatsApp. Now people can watch a video, get groceries delivered and send private messages for free. Interesting so far throughout the hearings, most of the questioning targeted at Mark Zuckerberg and the boss of Google. Little so far at Jeff Bezos, the Amazon CEO, the world's richest man. It is the first time ever that he has been hauled in front of Congress. I think we can expect some testy exchanges between them later. Ahead of the hearing earlier, President Donald Trump couldn't resist taking a swipe at the tech companies. He said in a tweet, if Congress doesn't bring fairness to big tech, which they should have done years ago, then I will do it myself. To be fair, he has a point, we have been here before with tech companies, there is very little if any regulation of these tech giants, without whose technology it is impossible almost to use the internet. The committee promises yet another report sometime later on this summer, early fall, let's see what they have to say. Well, we did ask representatives from all four companies to speak to us, but to no avail. Matt Perault, who's a former public policy director for Facebook, testified before the same House committee last year. He's now left Facebook to work at Duke University, and joins me now from North Carolina. Matt Perault, the committee chair began by saying that our founders would not bow before a king, nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy. From what you've seen so far, do you think these hearings will change anything? Well, I think that that is the question, you see two very different narratives in play today. The first is that these tech companies are an American success story and that they sort started off in garages and have grown to be successful, empowering businesses and people to speak more, to sell their products, to grow. On the other hand you have heard that they are a threat to America, a threat to democracy, to free speech, a threat from a surveillance perspective, and so those two narratives are in competition and you saw that on display today. Which narrative do you buy into, having once worked for Facebook but now on the outside? Well, so, I think the last time that Mark Zuckerberg testified on the Hill he was asked if Facebook was a monopoly and what he said was, it sure doesn't feel that way. That is how it felt to me when I was at Facebook. We were engaged in aggressive competition with many others in our industry and when things happened that people thought were problematic about our business like the Cambridge Analytica scandal, I did not think the company responded as if it was a monopoly, it did not feel like it was complacent, we had to respond aggressively and we were scared of advertisers and users going to use other services. Well, Amazon has been trumpeting its jobcreating credentials, Google has been talking about how it has brought technology to billions at an affordable price, is there the political will to take on these big tech companies, do you think? I think there is certainly the political will, there are a lot of representatives with political incentives right now to tactics companies, but that is not the only incentive they have and I think that has led to incoherence in US policy. You see aggressive questioning today on a variety of topics, with the Conservatives asking about issues related to bias on tech platforms, liberals asking questions about concentration of power, and on the other hand there are dynamics in American politics right now where there are very serious questions being raised about companies like TikTok and whether they, too, are a threat to American democracy and should be banned. Those two stances are incoherent. On the one hand there is the concern about the power of tech companies, but if a company like TikTok were to be banned, it would actually protect American companies. Very briefly, we broke the Cambridge Analytica story, no one from Facebook would come on, and now the boss is being quizzed by Congress, why do you think no one would be accountable to that? So, I think Facebook would disagree about whether it was held accountable, it paid a large fine to the FTC as a result of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and I think the company has felt that it has tried to do its best to improve its privacy practices and critically the way it shares data. Matt Perault, I am sorry I have got to end it there, that is all we have got time for this evening. We are back at seven tomorrow night.

The government's promising proposals for legislation to shut down what it says are safe spaces where people can share sick views. When Brenton Tarrant announced his impending attack, it was advertised on 8Chan, an anonymous message board, which you might not have heard of. </p><p>But in his video, before he opened fire, Tarrant pointed people to the world's biggest video site, YouTube, and its richest star, PewDiePie. I am white. Can I make that comment? But I do think that's a problem. He's had to deny allegations he's a racist. Close to 90 million people subscribe to his channel. He's said he's \"absolutely sickened\" Brenton Tarrant mentioned his name. At the weekend, swastikas and the message \"subscribe to PewDiePie\" appeared at a school in Oxford. They were Brenton Tarrant's exact words. Police are investigating. Google, which owns YouTube, says it's removed tens of thousands of videos and terminated hundreds of accounts, but there is much more work to do. This expert on political violence says mainsteam media, not just the internet, is guilty of giving far right nationalists space, compared to other extremists. I don't think that this is something that is produced through social media space at all. This is leaking over from the mainstream. This is mainstream political discourse at this point. Islamophobic rhetoric, anti-immigrant sentiments, anti-women sentiments, these are not something that you are finding in the dark corners of the Internet, these are being normalised in the a bigger split campaigns in recent years. -- biggest political campaigns. In Stanwell in Surrey, a man's been arrested after a stabbing amd police have declared a terrorist incident. He was shouting out, \"All Muslims should be dead. I'll kill a Muslim. White supremacy rules. There have been references to the New Zealand attack online and on the streets. We can probably expect more. Joining me now is the Labour MP Jo Stevens, who's a member of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport parliamentary committee. The live streaming for 70 minutes, the uploading countless times of this horrific footage has shocked people. -- 17 minutes. How urgently do you think governments throughout the world should respond? This has been urgent for some time. The atrocities over the last few days have just shown a real light on this in a way it has not done before. We have been calling on Parliament here, on our digital, culture, media and sport select committee, for action from the government and there's been calls for action all around the world, and I'm afraid the age of self-regulation for big tech companies and social media companies has gone. They have had their chance and they have blown it. I have heard similar sentiments around the world, the US, the EU, the UK, I mean, the UK digital minister today said 15 voluntary codes of practice have been agreed with online platforms since 2008. Why do you think it has taken so long for governments to arguably protect citizens better? I think the approach has been, it is almost like whack a mole, the social media companies will never do anything proactively, so they will only ever take action and then they don't take very much action when something happens and they are full steam to a position to do it. We have been waiting for the government to publish its online harms white paper for some time. Our committee published its interim report last summer and we had a very poor response to our recommendations from government. We published another report just a few weeks ago, and now we need, you know, we really need some urgent action. These companies are quite happy to take the plaudits and the profits but they are never happy to accept the consequences of what their sprawling services are enabling. Facebook and YouTube would say they are doing quite a lot, removing quite a lot of videos. Is it unfair to blame online platforms for the filth that people want to put on them? Well, they argue they are not publishers, they refused to be regulated in the way that other publishers, like broadcast media or print media, are, because they say they are not responsible for the content which is uploaded onto their platforms. But they do perform editing functions, so they do take stuff down, not quickly enough, so this argument they are not publishers, I don't think, holds. We now need to force them into a position where the recommendations that we have made include a statutory power for an independent regulator, with a code of ethics, with sanctions, legal powers, if they are breached, and to make sure that where they do not follow those rules, that they suffer a heavy financial sanction, because I'm</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UKCHLN-d28091ac3d964d7b9fb7b1e5b32f53b9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UKCHLN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNP-S511-DY08-3238-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Thank you for joining today's Webinar, Connect Live with ChannelAdvisor's CEO. My name is Tamara Gibbs, Marketing Communications Manager at ChannelAdvisor, and I'll be your moderator for today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First off, we have a few housekeeping items we want to run through. (Operator Instructions) David will first present some slides, then we'll transition to a live Q&amp;A. (Operator Instructions) And yes, a recording of the webinar will be available within the next few days. We'll send out a link to the recording and a copy of the presentation, so please keep an eye out for that. So that covers our housekeeping items.</p><p>Now for the reason we are all here. Today's webinar features David Spitz, CEO of ChannelAdvisor. David is responsible for leading the company in its mission to provide brands and retailers with the software and services needed to connect to the empowered consumer through marketing, selling and fulfillment capabilities. ChannelAdvisor has over 2,700 customers globally, connects to over 140 marketplaces and generated over $10 billion in GMV in 2018. David is here to share his industry insight and thoughts on the state of e-commerce today and beyond as well as answer your questions live.</p><p>David, we are so excited to hear from you, happy that you're here joining us today. First, we want to help the audience get to know you a little bit better. We know everything about you in terms of a CEO, running a great company. But folks may not know that you're a father of 6 children, ranging in age from college all the way to middle school.</p><p>DAVID J. SPITZ, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, CHANNELADVISOR CORPORATION: Tamara, that's correct. So we are busy both on the work front and on the home front. You know, and in fact, this week, we're sending 3 of them off to college at various years. So it's also a busy week in terms of getting all the logistics work out.</p><p>So hi, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. We're super excited to try out this live Q&amp;A format. We'll see how it goes, and hopefully give you some insights and some thoughts as you think about what's next for your businesses. So as Tamara said, I'm David Spitz, I'm CEO here at ChannelAdvisor. I've been here for 13 years. And in any kind of Internet space, including e-commerce, 13 years is a long time. You get to see a lot of different things and a lot of changes. You know the things like smartphones weren't around when I started at ChannelAdvisor, which is kind of hard to imagine. So it's just been a whole lot of change. And I think over those many years, it's been possible to kind of see what are the trends that have happened, and what are the trends that are coming, and we'll talk about that in a little bit. But -- so definitely have some perspective on the industry. And I definitely want to respect everybody's time. I know people are busy, and so I want to get to Q&amp;A as quickly as possible. So let's go ahead and jump right in.</p><p>So for those of you who have attended our annual customer show, and I know many of you have, you know that I -- one of the things I'd like to kind of anchor on is this notion of what are the key forces that are shaping the landscape? Sometimes I call these the tectonic forces. And they're basically the things that are happening around us that most of us don't have control over, but they're really important and they have the potential to really impact everybody's business, both for good and for bad. And so having an awareness of these trends, I think, is really (technical difficulty) China. And China has been in the news a lot lately as it relates to some of the geopolitical and trade tensions that are going on. But it's worth remembering that China has been now, for a number of years, the largest e-commerce market in the world. It's growing really, really quickly. There's a lot of interesting things, I think, we can learn in the West from things -- how things have developed in China, like mobile payments, chat apps that end up becoming whole ecosystems themselves and of course, currently, there is some turbulence going on in terms of cross-border trade and some of the tariffs and all of that. But China is a force to be reckoned with, depending on who you read, anywhere from maybe 30% to 40% of China -- of sales, for example, on Amazon in western countries, in Europe and in the U.S. actually come from Chinese sellers. So you can't -- even if you're just a seller, for example, in the U.S. or in Europe, you can't ignore China. It's an important facet of e-commerce.</p><p>Next, of course, is Amazon. I'm sure you've all heard of Amazon, continues to gain share and really drive a lot of innovation in the space, whether it's around logistics and getting products now in 1 day to most of the population. Amazon continues to set the bar as far as what consumers expect when it comes to e-commerce. And I've spent quite a lot of years, not only working pretty closely with Amazon as a strategic partner, but also just kind of observing how they operate. And I think that most of the time, they're really not that complicated of a company when you think about the things that are important to them. And it's not always that hard to predict what we think Amazon might do next. So that's potentially an interesting area for Q&amp;A.</p><p>Next is logistics. One of the things that's really driven the growth of e-commerce is the increasing speed at which consumers can get their packages. When I started at ChannelAdvisor, the average delivery time for a package was probably 5 or 6 days, right? So it wasn't the kind of thing where you'd go and purchase something you needed tomorrow or the -- or a couple of days from now. It's really the expectation now is for most consumers is that they're going to order something, and for sure, within a couple of days, if not 1 day or even same day, they're going to get those orders. And so that's created a real battlefield in the space of logistics that, if you look at some of the stories around like FedEx kind of ending its partnership with Amazon and some of the things that other companies are doing, you can tell that this is a real battle ground. And we predicted this a few years ago. And I would say, I've even been surprised that how quickly it's become kind of a primary battlefield in e-commerce.</p><p>Next is brands. So this was another hypothesis we developed a number of years ago, where we felt that digital would continue to not only disrupt overall retail, but compress the distance between brands and consumers. So if you think about the metaphor I use is e-commerce is causing a shift from Blockbuster to Netflix, if I use the metaphor of how people consume movies and I apply that to retail, it's the same thing, right? The path to the consumer is different. And if you're a brand, you may still generate 80% or 90% of your revenues from your traditional retail partners, but probably the growth area is e-commerce. And so how do you think about channel conflict? How do you think about direct-to-consumer? How do you think about things like fulfillment, things that maybe you haven't had in your wheelhouse previously? But we continue to believe that brands will get closer to the consumer as digital and e-commerce continues to grow.</p><p>Then we have mobile. It seems almost quite now to talk about it. We've been talking about this for a number of years. Although it still surprises me how frequently I speak to customers, and they don't think mobile first. So for most of our customers now, the majority of traffic is from a mobile device. And for many customers, the majority of transactions are actually from a mobile device. So if you're not spending your day primarily thinking about the mobile experience for your customers and you come to work every day and you're working on a desktop and kind of starting with that, that's probably a backwards way of thinking. So just remember that the consumer now is mobile-first. And in a number of countries, that's the only way that they interact with the Internet.</p><p>So -- and then lastly, is data, right? So we've long believed that data and the strategic use of data is really the thing that drives success in e-commerce, right? So if you are kind of running your business blind or shooting from the hip or guessing on pricing or guessing on inventory levels, we think, eventually, you end up losing out to folks that are really adroit in using data and using data and machine learning and things like that to really make intelligent decisions. That's why we've invested in things like our Algorithmic Repricer and our machine learning-based demand forecaster. We just think that data is a real asset. And for a lot of companies data is kind of -- they have mountains of it, but they don't know what to do with it, and so we spend a lot of time thinking about and deploying solutions to take that data and make it actionable for you in the day-to-day.</p><p>And then one of the forces that I added this year that is new for the industry is regulatory pressure. So there's been a lot of news headlines this year about Facebook testifying in front of Congress or antitrust issues being raised, both in Europe and in the U.S. against, what I would call, just sort of big tech, right? So folks like Amazon and Google and Facebook and others. And so there's this kind of rapidly rising temperature, I guess, I would say, where it used to be that if you're a big tech, you are seen as innovators and driving society forward. And I think in many cases, that's still very much the case. But in the last couple of years, I think it's also become more and more difficult for big tech to be -- to kind of stay out of those crosshairs. And we talked about this at our conference, and as I look at history, if I look at IBM in the 1960s and '70s and Microsoft in the 1990s, and we try to draw lessons from what happens when companies get in the crosshairs from a regulatory and antitrust perspective, the thing we typically see is it's really, really distracting for the company or the companies that are getting targeted. And so very often that creates -- and it's a long process, it takes years for that kind of stuff to work through, and we see that the companies that are targeted get distracted and sometimes that creates opportunities for new entrants to come in. So this is going to be like a multiyear thing to see play out, and it's really hard to predict exactly what's going to happen. But it could lead to a period of a little bit of instability in the market as some of the bigger companies have to contend with some of these pressures and maybe it'll create opportunities for smaller entrants to come in.</p><p>So when you think about all of this complexity, I think a key thing is to remember that at ChannelAdvisor, our mission is to connect and optimize the word commerce. And at our core, we really got connecting and making it easier for you to manage all of this complexity, right? So whether you're struggling with the myriad ways to do digital marketing or selling and listing and optimizing performance across multiple channels or how to do fulfillment and logistics in a way that satisfies your consumers, but keep your costs under control, all of that is what we think about every day here at ChannelAdvisor to make it easy to connect to hundreds of channels and systems and endpoints. And we think every day about new ways to help you more successful and more competitive. So whether you're an entrepreneur with a new brand that's ready to take over the world or the largest CPG or consumer electronics company in the world, we have the scale at ChannelAdvisor and the breadth to be your strategic e-commerce partner.</p><p>So enough about us, I think it's time to jump into Q&amp;A. And what I'll do is maybe ask Tamara to say a couple of words about if you have a question, how we would like you to submit that question so that we can answer it.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>TAMARA GIBBS: Yes, David, we're so excited for this part of it, right, how fun is this? (Operator Instructions) David, just listening to you talk about all this evolution that's occurring so rapidly, brands becoming retailers, vice versa, logistics becomes a major issue, there's talk of regulation. If you can look into the future, your crystal ball, 10 years out from now in terms of e-commerce, what do you see?</p><p>DAVID J. SPITZ: Yes. I think e-commerce, like we said earlier, is a rapidly evolving space, but it kind of comes in ways, right? So there's periods where, maybe for a few years, not a whole lot changes. And then there's periods where maybe a new entrant comes in or something changes, like, for example, Amazon introducing Prime in 2005, and it kind of shakes up the world. And so as a consequence, that's why those trends are really so important, right? We have to -- I know that everybody is running their business, and every day they're looking at dashboards and KPIs and trying to figure out why were sales up yesterday or down yesterday, and how much -- and so it's super, super easy to get caught up in that day-to-day of just running a business or running an e-commerce operation. But if you're not paying attention to some of those longer-term trends, they have a tendency to kind of sneak up on you, and then one day, boom, they hit you, and you're not necessarily prepared for it.</p><p>So when I think out 10 years, gosh, that's like -- in any other industry, that would be like trying to forecast 100 years out, right? So it's pretty hard. And I don't even know if 10 years out, you can even do it. But I think a few assumptions are probably say, like, number one, I think there is going to be more e-commerce. So I think share of wallet continues to shift towards e-commerce. It's just more convenient, right? And as fulfillment and logistics gets faster and more instantaneous and more products, like earlier this year, I was talking about the rise of online mattress companies, right? Like who'd have guessed 5 years ago that, that was a thing, right? That people are actually willing to buy something that you would have thought would be like the pinnacle of something you'd want to touch and see and try out in a showroom. But then you have these business model innovations, like Casper, saying, \"Hey, you can get the mattress and use it for a 100 days, and if you don't like it, return it.\" So it's not just technical innovation, it's business model innovation. And that's why it's so important to keep an eye on these trends, right? Because if you're a traditional mattress company and you kind of had this assumption that the world couldn't necessarily change or you just didn't believe it was possible, some well-funded entrepreneur somewhere that's got a lot of venture capital sloshing around all of a sudden can eat your lunch.</p><p>So I think probably China continues to grow. I think e-commerce continues to gain share of wallet. I think fulfillment and delivery speeds continue to rapidly increase, right? So we've gone -- Prime has gone from 2 days to 1 day. We live in the middle of nowhere, my family and I, and we have Prime now. And so to my kids, it's like second nature that they can order something and get it within an hour. To me, it still blows my mind, right? So I thought for a long time that at some point, Amazon gets smart enough about your purchase patterns that they might start delivering stuff to your house before you actually order it because they know you're probably going to need it, maybe they know you're likely to be out of paper towel or toilet paper or whatever. And if they're starting to do all those last-mile logistics, and they're driving around in vans anyway and are passing by your house and maybe picking up a return, well, why not leave that product that they think you're going to order, and maybe they just pick it up a little bit later if it's not a product that you want. So I think we'll continue to see a lot of innovation there.</p><p>TAMARA GIBBS: Right. Yes. So we do have our first question from Shane Doyle, a question regarding customer acquisition for D2C brands so as in primarily via social platforms, like Instagram. David, at what point could a growing D2C brand leverage ChannelAdvisor to expand their reach?</p><p>DAVID J. SPITZ: Yes. That's a great question, Shane. Thank you for that. So I think a couple of things. Number one, we think social is important, and it's an area that we continue to invest in. For example, we've partnered with Instagram, on Instagram Checkout, and there's a lot of interesting stuff there that -- I think for a number of years, social was kind of, what I would call, experimental when it comes to e-commerce. I mean, obviously, it's great more kind of top-of-funnel if you're trying to build brand awareness and trying to build a story and get consumer attention, but it was more top-of-funnel. But I think all of these channels, right, whether you're talking about traditional ones like Facebook and Instagram, and of course, folks like Pinterest, more and more, I think, what they're realizing is, there's no reason why they can't kind of move down that funnel and close the loop a little bit more, right? Because it's not a great consumer experience if you just see, like, if you follow somebody on Instagram, let's say, and you really want the products, and you have to go somewhere else to purchase it, and it's not closing the loop. And of course, if you're Instagram, like, why wouldn't you want to close the loop and make it super easy for your customers to act on those kinds of things.</p><p>So the first thing I would say is that ChannelAdvisor is focused pretty intently on what this means and what's the best way to bring it to our customers. But then beyond that, I think you have to acknowledge and be realistic about where consumers shop, right? So close to half of U.S. e-commerce is on Amazon. So -- and I know not everybody wants to sell on Amazon because you have to think about do you own the consumer? Does -- is there a risk that Amazon might see your success and try to replicate the product or maybe other sellers will try to replicate the product? So there's pros and cons to it. But at the end of the day, half the population prefers to shop on Amazon as their primary way, then you really have to think about it, right? And then once you think about Amazon, there are so many other channels that you can start to go through, right? So it could be like an Etsy, Google Shopping Actions really taken off for us, and I think it's kind of a sort of the sleeper hit that people may not be ready for if they're not using it this Q4. We launched this year Target+, which is their online marketplace. Of course, you've got sites like eBay and Walmart, but we support over 140 marketplaces today. And one of the things we try to do is make it super easy that once you're on the platform, so just basically go out to as many as are relevant to you by geography or by product category.</p><p>So I think what you have sort of -- if you're a direct-to-consumer brand and you've got sort of the basics in place in terms of fulfillment and customer service, and you've got kind of the e-commerce wheels starting to turn a little bit, then it's about scale, right? And as long as you're prepared for that scale plugging into these channels and really becoming -- having e-commerce become a mainstream part of your go-to-market strategy, I think, is really important.</p><p>TAMARA GIBBS: Yes. Another question here, David, from a major player, eBay. eBay launched a managed fulfillment program. So how will that work for eBay sellers?</p><p>DAVID J. SPITZ: Yes. So I think eBay fulfillment is a great step in the right direction. I mean, obviously, Amazon has, gosh, almost a 20-year head start in the industry, not specifically with eBay, but in the industry of seeing logistics and fulfillment as a key differentiator because I think it's clear to everyone that, at the end of the day, if you get your products faster as a consumer, that's great, right? So -- and I think the rest of the industry has been a little bit slow to react to that because let's face it, building hundreds of fulfillment centers and starting to think about logistics is a capital-intensive, multi-billion dollar, frankly, multi-decade thing, right? And so I think it's not surprising that Amazon kind of has this mindset that thinks on those time frames and so they're willing to deploy billions of dollars and build lots of facilities and et cetera, et cetera, to deliver on that consumer promise. And so I'm really happy to see eBay do this. I think that one of my views is the vast majority of people in e-commerce actually do their own fulfillment. And you have to be thinking to yourself, can you really afford to keep up with that changing consumer expectation, right? So maybe you're a midsized brand or a midsized retailer, and you have 2 or 3 fulfillment centers and yes, you can ship to the whole country in a matter of a few days, but like how are you really going to keep up with 2-day, 1-day, same-day shipping? And I think very, very few people can actually afford the capital requirements to build out that capability. So I've always viewed partnering in logistics and fulfillment as being really, really key. And I think it's great that the channels are starting to offer this kind of capability. Shopify launched their fulfillment network, eBay is launching theirs. And in most of these alternatives to fulfillment by Amazon what you're seeing is kind of more of an asset-light model, where some combination of maybe your warehouses or third-party logistics providers or other fulfillment providers are kind of getting assembled and organized under a software layer that basically says, \"Hey, this is where you need to ship your products, and this is how the products are going to get shipped out when they're ordered.\" So I think, fundamentally, it's great that eBay is doing it. Obviously, execution is key, and when it comes to fulfillment, you have to have kind of like a five nines' reliability, right, to make sure the right product is getting to the right person at the right time. And I think the next challenge for everybody that's competing with Amazon at some level is what is Amazon doing around logistics and last-mile delivery, right? So some of their Flex drivers and the things that they're doing in ultimately owning last-mile delivery is going to create, I think, yet another competitive advantage. But I think it's great that eBay is doing it. I think it's a step in the right direction.</p><p>And I frankly think that almost every major channel or every major e-commerce player out there is going to have to have some kind of answer to fulfillment. We created ChannelAdvisor fulfillment network, the launch of, well, I guess, about 1 year, 1.5 years ago after the acquisition of a company called HubLogix, and that's been phenomenally successful. I mean, our customers love that they can come to ChannelAdvisor and say, \"Hey, I've got 2 owned and operated warehouses, but I don't have great coverage of the West Coast, and I'd like to partner with a 3PL, and therefore, I'd like to be able to route orders based on -- in real time, see cost, et cetera, et cetera.\" So I'm a big proponent of partnering in this space and encourage people to think about that.</p><p>TAMARA GIBBS: So let's talk about the biggest challenge for retailers. What do you think they're dealing with right now?</p><p>DAVID J. SPITZ: Yes. So like I said earlier, digital causes compression of time and space, right? So what I mean by that is, let's just go back, like, 50 years ago, right? So 50 years ago, you didn't have a choice. I mean, yes, you could get on the phone and maybe you had a Sears catalog and you could order something from somewhere distant, and eventually it would be delivered to you. But realistically, almost all of your commerce was local, right? You had to walk or drive to the store. You purchase something, it was probably a mom-and-pop kind of operated thing. And when you think about what digital does, digital gives you the ability to search and seek and find and purchase products from anywhere in the world, like as easily, and frankly, in some cases, more easily than walking down the street and going to a store. So when I say it compresses time and distance, that's what I mean.</p><p>And so it's not hard to imagine that if you're a 1950's mom and pop, like, how do you compete with that, right? You probably don't have the wherewithal to address the global audience or to source product from a global supply chain. And so digital also tends to drive kind of winner-take-most outcomes, right? So that's why I think we're seeing more and more transaction volume and power get concentrated in companies like Amazon or companies like Walmart, who have the scale and the breadth to get there. So I think the general trend is, if you're a retailer and shopping online becomes more and more convenient, obviously, that's an important growth area for you as a retailer, but at the end of the day, what is your differentiated value proposition for the consumer? If you want them to come into a physical store, why would they, right? They've got to fight traffic, they've got to park, they've got to kind of -- do you provide them an experience that actually draws them in, right? I think some companies do that well. Others, I think, don't do it so well, right? And even online, if you're a retailer, what's the reason that somebody's going to come to you versus going to someone else? We've been working, for example, with REI for many, many years, and I'm sure most of you know REI, a great retailer/brand of incredible products geared towards the outdoor enthusiasts, and they do a lot in their stores with employees who are super knowledgeable about products, right? So if you're going rock climbing or camping or whatever, if you want to ask about a particular, like, -- in a lot of retail experience, as you -- first of all, you have to go find somebody to help you and good luck with that, and second of all, when you find them, they have no idea what the products do, right? So REI does a great job of giving that great in-store experience.</p><p>And then online, same kind of thing, right? It's more about the experience and the story and how these things work together, and they dovetail it nicely with their stores. And so I think retailers really have to think that way, right? How to make e-commerce, not only a central part of their story, but how to make their whole retail operations something that gives consumers a reason to want to come in or want to work with them.</p><p>TAMARA GIBBS: Great insight, David. We have a question from a ChannelAdvisor customer. How do you see marketplaces competing with Amazon to gain market share?</p><p>DAVID J. SPITZ: Yes. Great question. I think that -- let's start -- let's step back with what has created success for Amazon? So the first thing I would say is, you have to go back to first principles. Amazon has long believed that the key things that consumers are looking for are 3 things: value, selection and convenience, right? In other words, if -- and this goes back 20 years, right? When they talk about being Earth's biggest store, right? So they knew -- Amazon knew that if they were a place that a consumer can come and find almost any product for sale on Earth and the products were going to be priced well and not only were they priced well, but there's a convenience factor where you knew you can order that product and it wouldn't take 3 weeks to get to you, but it might get there in 2 days or whatever. But that would be a pretty compelling thing. So they would attract more sellers to the platform, which would attract more consumers to the platform and you get this kind of virtuous famous napkin diagram that Jeff Bezos drew, right?</p><p>And so from my perspective, you have to remember those things. And I think investments in marketplace and fulfillment, especially I've heard from ex executives at Amazon that they view their key competitive advantages actually being a logistics company, right? So like anybody can build a website, right? Like those -- there's not the barrier to entry necessarily that's high in that area, but boy, having a couple of hundred of fulfillment centers and delivery vans and all of that, like that starts to become a pretty high hurdle for a competitor. And that goes back to the question earlier about eBay, eBay's fulfillment network and others that are doing similar things in the space, I'm really glad to see people moving. Amazon has a heck of a head start, but I'm really glad to see people moving in the direction of trying to address this notion of, I don't necessarily have to shop on Amazon to get fast delivery. Like, that's the key thing that I think people are addressing. So the other thing I think that is a good competitive angle is being really good in a particular vertical. So look at Etsy, right? So Etsy is known for handcrafted types of goods and can build an experience around that, right? Where as a shopper, you're connecting with sort of the artisanal seller and really building up an experience there. We work, for example, with automotive marketplace or marketplace of automotive part marketplaces. If you think about buying car parts, there's a lot of information you didn't know about like does this brakepad fit my make model year? And how do I install it? Is there a video? Is there a community to help me when I get stuck on a project? Well, it's very hard for someone like Amazon to have a really deep, great experience that goes super deep in a category like that. Whereas if you're in auto parts, automotive marketplace, like that's all you do, right? And you can really build community around that.</p><p>So I think that, that's a key area for some of the emerging marketplaces we see is that they're really focused on a particular category or niche, and they go deep on content and experience that's specific to that category or niche. I think it's going to be pretty hard to try to attack Amazon head-on though, and try to be the general merchandise provider that like has -- what advantage are you ultimately going to have. I think Walmart has a chance because Walmart has a differentiated asset of something like 5,000 stores, right, that they can leverage for not only things like logistics and delivery, but just tying together that experience. But for most retailers, I'm not sure that that's realistic.</p><p>TAMARA GIBBS: And here's a great question we just got in, David, that kind of segues into your comments about building community via marketplaces. (Operator Instructions) But again, David, this question from Akron Fell asking what is the future of e-commerce? Is it own marketplaces or e-commerce?</p><p>DAVID J. SPITZ: So -- oh, I think, okay. So if I understand the question, it's really kind of like should I focus on my own storefront predominantly or should I sell just through marketplaces? That's a great question. And I think my answer is, I don't know that it's a binary question. I think you should do -- it depends on the product. So I don't know what product category you sell or if you're a brand or a reseller. But in general, what I would say is, you should leverage both. Obviously, the benefits of having your store platform is you own the customer relationship, you have 100% control over how you merchandise and a story that you tell. So there's a lot of benefits to having your owned and operated website. But then the trick there is, how are you going to attract people to it, right? So there are millions of websites out there that sell some sort of product, and you have to rise above the noise, right? So advertising on Google is not cheap, right? And again, this depends, like if you have a proprietary product with a well-known brand, like, let's say, you're YETI, right? So it's easier if you're YETI because everybody knows the name, and they go to Google and they type YETI, and YETI probably has to spend a lot on the money on the brand terms, but at the end of the day, they're going to get, obviously, some amount of traffic, both organic and inorganic to that site. If you haven't yet established your brand, then that's harder, right? You might just be getting a trickle of traffic, you might not be really driving a whole lot and that's where marketplaces come in, right? Because if more than 50%, if we take Amazon and we take eBay and we take some of the emerging marketplaces like Walmart and Target and Google Shopping Actions, that's really the majority of e-commerce, right?</p><p>And the other point I want to make that I think is important when it relates to marketplaces, if you look in the East, if you look at China, Southeast Asia, India, some of the countries where people kind of skip the entire desktop realm and went straight to mobile, on a mobile device, a website is not the ideal thing, right? Because people are not going to download 50 different retailer or brand apps in their phone, they're probably going to download like a Flipkart or an Amazon or a Tmall, Alibaba, whatever is appropriate in their country. They're going to have a couple of apps on their phone, and we think that mobile devices, think about that 10 square inch real estate that is your phone screen. That's the most precious real estate that there is in retail. And increasingly, we -- when I said earlier, that digital creates from winner-take-all models, that's kind of what I mean. I think that if we fast forward 5 or 10 years, almost all consumers will go through a small number of apps to get to product purchases, right? So we think marketplaces continue to take share of wallet. And so I think if you decide not to sell on marketplaces, you end up on this kind of shrinking island of demand.</p><p>But I would do both, right, because you're going to get some traffic to your web store, you're going to have that consumer relationship, you're going to have an opportunity to control a little bit more and get more direct feedback. But I don't see it as a binary strategy. I think you can do both, in general.</p><p>TAMARA GIBBS: Yes. Great advice, David. We've seen a number of DNVBs pop up in our space, any advice on how to compete against them?</p><p>DAVID J. SPITZ: Yes. So for those of you don't know, DNVB is digitally native vertical brands. So think of some of the more popular examples like Allbirds, Warby Parker, some of these companies that had a great product idea, and were sort of born online, and in many cases were online-only for a long time. Now what's interesting is a lot of them have actually started to go retail, right? So some of these have opened stores or started selling through other stores. So it's a hot topic. But I think it's a little bit -- it's easy to get a little bit drawn in by all the press that they get. If you actually look at the data, it's actually pretty tough sledding for a lot of digitally native vertical brands or DNVBs. There's a guy named Web Smith, who runs a news letter in a site called 2PM, and it's at 2pml.com. If you don't subscribe to his newsletter, you should. He has had a really good rift going over the last probably, I don't know, 4 or 6 months where he's really done a deep dive into the space of digitally native vertical brands, and what he finds is that the hit rate is actually pretty low, right? So for every Allbirds that you hear about, there's 50 that probably had a good idea and really didn't gain traction or get the kind of following that they wanted. But even the successful ones, right? I mean, go and read the news articles about, like, honesty over the last couple of years, right? Even the more successful ones don't actually scale up to huge amounts of revenue. So Harry's was -- a lot of these brands get acquired by the more traditional, like CPG, companies, who say, \"Wow, here's an up encumber, and we really need to have this digital DNA, let's go acquire them.\" And by most accounts, even the most successful ones have $50 million, $100 million, $150 million in revenue. I mean that's great, and that's for sure a success, but that -- compare that to the revenue of a Unilever or P&amp;G or other brands.</p><p>So I think some of the DNVB stuff gets a little played up a little bit. But it is an interesting trend. But I think it's also really interesting that the most successful ones, you end up seeing having a retail strategy, right? So like that we talked earlier about the mattress companies. I'm pretty sure it was Casper that had a deal with Target, right? So some of their mattresses are now being sold in Target stores, and I assume online on target.com as well. So it kind of indicates that maybe the reach to consumers shouldn't be purely digital for most players. Like if you really want to reach all the -- maximize your reach to consumers, being purely digital may not actually be the right answer.</p><p>TAMARA GIBBS: Yes. A dynamic approach to it as well. We want to remind folks that we have time for 1 last question. We do have this question coming in. As a small brand, what are the top things you think we should focus on to help grow our business?</p><p>DAVID J. SPITZ: Yes. Well, I could speak for probably an hour on that topic. I guess what I would say, first and foremost, you got to have first principles, right? So what does your brand stand for, and how do you focus on an incredible consumer experience throughout the process? And I don't just mean the product, right? I mean the ordering process, the delivery process, like we actually ordered ourselves a Casper mattress for a guestroom, probably a couple of months ago, I guess. And of course, I've read about this process where it comes in a box and you open the box and it inflates itself. And even though I knew that, I was pretty impressed when we got it, right? So we get this thing, it's delivered when it's expected to be -- it's not like buying from a traditional mattress company where they give you like an 8-hour window, where you have to stay home and then they miss the window anyway and they're late and they break something while they're carrying the matters. I mean this box, my wife and I could lift it. We brought it in, we brought it up to the guestroom and my wife was like totally shocked, like we literally opened it, and it didn't take like a day to inflate, like that thing like took on its original shape in minutes, right? So it was pretty cool.</p><p>And so it's not just the purchasing and the delivery experience, but also the unboxing experience and then things like the return experience, right? We talked earlier about business model innovation, where just to stay on the Casper theme, right, if you're not happy with that mattress, you have 100 days to decide if it's the thing that you want, and if you don't like it somebody will come, package it up and take it away, which I think is great. So you have to think about the customer experience. But I think a lot of people, they think that just means product. And product is one element of customer experience, right? So you have to think about that fully closed loop. And then I think once you've got that dialed in, then I think it's really important to get your products to show up everywhere where consumers are shopping for that product, like make it easier for them to find it. I think that's really, really important.</p><p>And the last thing I'd add is that I'm entrepreneur myself, right? I started several companies, and I know what it's like to start with nothing. And you have to be willing to quickly adapt to feedback. So when I look at most of the success stories out there, it's easy to look at the success stories once they're successful. But if you really go back and you look at their history, there's almost always at least a couple of existential crises that come along where they didn't know if they were going to make it, and they had a pivot or adapt or take feedback or make something really different about their business. And that's not always the thing that gets the press. What gets the press is like the phenomenal success, but if you really dig in and you see what they had to go through to get there, so I think as -- if you're a small brand, whether you're an entrepreneur or maybe you're entrepreneur within a larger company and your job is to launch a small brand, you -- boy, you have to be really adaptive, right? You have to be willing to listen and make changes and do it really quickly, right? You can't -- you don't have the luxury of doing months-long consumer studies because if you go out there and you screw something up and your review is tanked, like it's pretty hard to recover, right? So the minute you get some kind of indication or feedback that something needs to change, you have to be willing to jump on that really quickly.</p><p>TAMARA GIBBS: Wow, David, this has been wonderful hearing from you getting your insights on the industry, and we're certainly very appreciative of everyone who submitted questions. We want to be mindful of everyone's time. If we didn't get to your question, don't worry about it. We're going to follow up with you after the webinar. And David, thank you, again.

At least 40 people trampled to death in a stampede yesterday during the Iranian General Qasem Soleimani's funeral.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rick Leventhal is live in Jerusalem this morning with more -- Rick.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: And Maria -- it's not clear what sparked this stampede but we know that the crowds have been massive in Iran, both yesterday for the funeral procession, and today for the actual burial. And at some point this stampede did break out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Iranian TV is now reporting at least 40 dead and well over 200 people injured, trampled by this crowd that gathered for the funeral of that Iranian general who was taken out in the drone strike in Iraq late last week.</p><p>The crowd again in the millions yesterday and today, and a grieving accompanied by angry rhetoric. Threats to set U.S. facilities on fire, chants of \"death to Israel\" in the crowd. And a vote by Iran's parliament to officially designate the U.S. military, a terrorist force for taking out the leader of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, a man blamed by the U.S. killing and maiming hundreds of U.S. troops and thousands others.</p><p>Of course, President Trump has promised a swift and overwhelming response if Iran tries to retaliate and he has got the tools to do it including the F-35 A2 Lightning Fighter jet. 52 of them rocketing into the sky one after another, a so-called elephant walk takeoff from the Hill Air Force Base in Utah, fully armed and ready for battle.</p><p>A squadron of F-35s from Utah is now deployed here in the region. And Fox News has confirmed that the Air Force is also sending six B-52 bombers to Diego Garcia, an island base in the Indian Ocean. So they're definitely gearing up for the possibility of having to strike back if Iran tries to make retaliatory strikes against U.S. interests.</p><p>And by the way, Maria -- there is now a warning from the U.S. to ships in the Middle East to watch out for possibly retaliatory attacks in the waterways and straits around this region. So ships on alert -- anyone with any connection to the U.S. is being warned to look out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Rick -- we'll be watching. This is a dangerous situation. Rick Leventhal joining us there --</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- with the very latest. Thank you -- Rick.</p><p>Meanwhile, markets scaling back a sell-off after the airstrike last week. Futures right now showing a gain at the start of trading this morning. Investors largely shrugging off this conflict.</p><p>Yesterday markets turned around completely and then some, finishing in the green, up 68 points on the Dow Industrials when all is said and done. Gold, as you can see, it was a complete reversal by the close yesterday. Nasdaq was up 50 points but still in record territory.</p><p>Gold, meanwhile, is -- has been rising. It is certainly looking like a safe haven. The precious metal jumping to nearly $1,600 an ounce, the highest level since 2013. Gold is up about 7 percent just in the last month.</p><p>Bank of America Private Bank and Merrill chief investment officer, Chris Hyzy is with us to weigh on this. And Chris -- it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>CHRIS HYZY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BANK OF AMERICA PRIVATE BANK: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Why do you think markets are shrugging this off?</p><p>HYZY: I think it's partly the just sheer momentum that we saw in December. You can look at flows, you look at a number of different things, not just the performance of global equity markets, spreads, or what have you. I think there's a lot of liquidity out there, number one. Central banks plus the fact that dollars in investment accounts are rising. So cash allocations are going up, largely speaking because the dividends and interests and other things.</p><p>But also there's money in the system. Personal income is going up as a percentage of -- within the household. So it's not a perfect positive storm as it relates to the economy but it certainly has based out. And the next 12 months it should be the positive improvement factor.</p><p>So let me get those big momentum in risk assets even though it's a very dangerous situation, a very important and serious situation that until there is a retaliation that is economically harmful, investors will tend to shrug it off.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Until we actually see something that shakes the very strong backdrop that we've had -- solid consumer, 50-year low in unemployment --</p><p>HYZY: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- investors are not going to worry about it.</p><p>HYZY: That's correct. At least that's our deal.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": What's your expectation for U.S. economic growth this year? And also for the rest of the world? There was so much talk in 2019 about a global slowdown then that narrative changed in 2020.</p><p>HYZY: No question about it. We have been on this narrative probable a little early. Six months ago we were talking about a fourth minimum mini- wave. The business cycle today is very different than what we knew. The business cycle's less boom-bust (ph). It's slower growing, less inflation, more liquidity higher debt over all, lower stock of interest rates, debt service ratios are manageable.</p><p>All of that puts together a much longer business cycle until the Fed makes a mistake. And they don't want to make a mistake but they tend to go too far. They almost did in 2018, some would argue they did. And then '19, they'd back that off.</p><p>Now remember, going into '19, which was really interesting here was they were going to hike four more times. They cut three -- that's a seven- change move offer the course of 12 months. That's very powerful.</p><p>Now we're heading into 2020 when liquidity is going up. So from our standpoint you can think about growth, our baseline forecast is 1.7 and that's probably too low.</p><p>When you think about what's going on in the first quarter, you should see a bottoming in global growth. In the back half of the year, the non-U.S. economies help support a little bit better growth.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And Let's not forget that federal spending, government spending is going through the roof right now. We're going to have a stronger dollar --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Peter Navarro said that's another leg to the stool. That that is actually driving our --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>HILSENRATH: Washington is pumping money into this economy. And we are also seeing it coming out of China too.</p><p>HYZY: No question. C plus I plus G and in the export market you put all of it together the 1.7 percent goes a lot --</p><p>HILSENRATH: There's a lot of G -- that is the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So you got the jobs number out this Friday. And we're on the doorstep of fourth quarter earnings. So the fourth-quarter earnings season begins next week with the major banks. Would you be buying stock ahead of these two major events.</p><p>HYZY: Yes, we'll be buying stocks on weakness. Through the year we see a few patterns developing through the year. After earnings a little bit of a pullback heading into primary season, et cetera.</p><p>And then into the summer months when the election risk starts to take up or get elevated at that point. Over the summer months, we see another pullback. Typical years have two or three pullbacks of 5 percent. We expect the classic pullbacks again this year notwithstanding what's going on in the Middle East, I would be buyer (ph) for that.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: But how are individual investors positioned for this, because last year nearly half a trillion dollars net flowed into bond funds when money, by billions and billions, was flowing out of equity funds both U.S. domestic focus and international. They're not just mutual but also exchange traded funds.</p><p>That doesn't seems -- it seems like someone is making a mistake. Are investors positioned for something bad this year? Or were they just -- making an error last year?</p><p>HYZY: You know, mathematics will tell you a lot of things and sometimes they tell you nothing because the flows out of mutual funds are almost being recycled back into ETF. So collectively when you look at it, you might argue it's net neutral in equity flows in general.</p><p>But to your point, it's a really good point, demographics are driving more fund flows into fixed income, simply because of the aging that is going on and the need to retool your asset allocations the other way. Plus the advent of new solutions and new products out there, that automatically rebalance portfolios into fixed incomes the older you get.</p><p>So put all of that together, the individual investor collectively looks like they're making mistakes but actually, what we are seeing is more money coming in at younger ages in some of the consumer accounts that we see, and consumer allocation at the lower levels, they're actually adding more to equities.</p><p>It's a very interesting dynamic. It's going to take years to play out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they're buying technology, right. You're looking at big tech in 2020 you say technology is not limited to just one industry anymore.</p><p>HYZY: That's a great point. We bucket traders too much in our industry but one of the greatest buckets is technology. Just the technology sector itself.</p><p>But if you look at all sectors, it's fraught with a lot of innovation across the board. So we would look at who is dominating tech across the sectors not just in that one sector.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- the United States or the rest -- are there any opportunities out there in the rest of the world right now?</p><p>HYZY: The emerging markets are another category that you envelope together. Parts of emerging markets that have the ability to withstand this movement from globalization to localization over the next few years are the areas you want to be.</p><p>If you think about Poland and Mexico that are targeted areas that are not going to be hurt as much as other emerging markets when you shift the supply chain. But yes, we are looking at upgrade opportunities in emerging markets --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>still slightly underweight and we're underweight non-U.S. in general but looking for upgrade --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>HILSENRATH: That's an interesting -- I'm sorry, I don't want to interrupt but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Go ahead.</p><p>HYZY: Oh no.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean I just had a question in terms of is there any rhetoric from either side that is going on right now because this is a transitional year with politics. Is there any rhetoric from either side that kind of gives you pause in terms of how it would negatively affect the market?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Like how about if Elizabeth Warren gets up in the polls. Or Bernie Sanders looking like he's going to win. What happens to the markets then?</p><p>HYZY: At this particular time, it is so early in the process that there isn't anything right now that we can foresee that dents the economic picture at this point. We will obviously, reassess the further we get into the policy front, but as of right now we're our core base case is still very plain vanilla which we discussed before 1.7 say to 2 percent growth, 1.8 to 2 percent on the 10-year yield, 8 percent returns overall driven by real profits.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Do you get at all worried about corporate debt. Households are in good shape but there's a lot of corporate debt out there. And we're seeing some movement in some lower rated debt tat suggests there might be some cracks.</p><p>HYZY: If interest rates rise to a level driven primarily by inflation and not just flows out of fixed income pushing yours up. but if it's driven by inflation and it prompts a response by the fed that we are not prepared for, it would worry me because of the size of the absolute debt.</p><p>What doesn't worry me right now is the fact that the number one thing companies said they are going to do and the number one thing investors say they want companies to do is pay down debt.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So real quick before you go. Is there an index in ETF -- anything that you think our viewers might want to look at to invest alongside what you are saying right now? Give me one idea.</p><p>HYZY: Ok. So in terms of just -- just think about sectors for a second. The one sector that has tended to lead early stage recoveries and middle stage recoveries that we haven't seen up until the tail end of last year is financials. I would watch the financials very closely to give you a better feel for the overall market.</p><p>We like financials, we think the yield curve actually surprises people. stiffens a little bit, not greatly. But provides a little bit of tonic and the consumer is really leveraged so, the financial sector's very leveraged --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: But is this early stage -- this is late stage. I feel we were late stage.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is but he is saying that the financials didn't not perform as they have historically.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So they're in an early stage.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now that yield curve steepened after it inverted in the spring and then the middle of the year, so now you're finally getting some wind behind the backs of these financials.</p><p>HYZY: Great point absolutely. And I would argue because of what the Fed has done, we are potentially backing the early stage.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. We will hear from the banks next week --</p><p>HYZY: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- when we get the major banks reporting earnings. Chris -- it's always great to get your insights.</p><p>HYZY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Chris Hyzy joining us there from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.</p><p>We've got a lot to talk about this.</p><p>Google is surging to another record high this morning.

It's great to see you -- sir. Thanks so much for being here -- John Paul.</p><p>JOHN PAUL DEJORIA, CO-FOUNDER, PATRON SPIRITS: Good morning -- Maria. Always a pleasure. Love from Austin, Texas.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So I want to kick it off with your sense of how things are going from a business standpoint, in terms of the economy, in terms of consumer demand out there -- how are you seeing things?</p><p>DEJORIA: We are very, very bullish. We see this economy continuing to grow this year. We know this in all areas that I'm involved in -- whether it's the spirits industry, whether it is hair care, cosmetics. All areas are growing and people are happy.</p><p>It seems also people are more satisfied with their opportunities in this world. There's more positive talk going on than there is negative talk. So I consider that all contributing to a good economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: yes. I want to ask about the Spirits business in a minute because this is trend of less sugar, people are turning to vodka instead of wine. But then they go dry in January. So we'll talk about that in a second.</p><p>But let me he focus on the spiraling homelessness crisis because I know this is important to you.</p><p>DEJORIA: You bet. Very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Business wants to help. WE had the CEO of Cisco in recently, saying he's going to try to do what he can in San Francisco. But you look at some of these pictures, whether it is New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, L.A. -- the homelessness problem has gotten worse. What are businesses doing?</p><p>DEJORIA: Well to give an example of what we're he doing here in Austin, I think we've got the answer to it. We build a community called Community First through Mobile Loaves and Fishes. And what we did was we built 250 little houses.</p><p>And if you have been in a shelter -- I mean out of a shelter for at least one year where you're sleeping under a bridge on the street, you're the first people to come in. We only have three rules and we give you a little house. Those rules are: no drinking, no fighting, and no alcohol -- period.</p><p>You get the house. You pay $90 a month. Well, people say but some homeless have zero money, how can they forward $90 dollars a month.</p><p>If we give you something, just give it to you -- we give you a handout, you don't feel special. If you contribute, we gave you a hand up.</p><p>So what we do is this. We have wood shop, auto shop, metal shop. We have crafts going on. We have gardens going on, organic -- make organically better than the wealthy people eat in most cases.</p><p>So they have an income. Now they are able to pay that $90 a month rent, feel they're part of the community because we help them work and have extra money left over for other things.</p><p>It's working so well that we are now putting together phase two, which is another 400 homes. At the same time we are working with the city on a new program, to build a large unit for about 300 people. and those 300 homeless men, women, no matter what -- they come in there for shelter.</p><p>There'll be bathrooms. There'll be places to stay, and counselors to help them go to places like Mobile Loaves and Fishes or the next place to go to get out of the rut. In other words when people just throw money at it and feed it, it is not the thing to do. It's not the answer.</p><p>When we involve them in our community and this is all, by the way, done by volunteers, volunteers, volunteer money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's terrific.</p><p>DEJORIA: but it's working. Yes. And we have other states coming here to look at it and say my God it is working. So here we now take 250 people that wanted something, needed a handout and now they're contributing to society and paying taxes and cleaning their act up. and it is working.</p><p>And you go online, your wonderful listeners, and look it up under Mobile Loaves and Fishes -- Community or Community First. It is working and working well.</p><p>HILSENRATH: John Paul -- how do you explain what is going on here. On the one hand the economy is doing really well, it's growing really fast.</p><p>DEJORIA: Sure.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And yet, even in places like Austin, we're showing pictures, we have a homelessness problem that seems to be getting worse. How do you put that two and two together? How do you have an economy so strong that is also leaving so many people behind right now?</p><p>DEJORIA: what is taking place right now is it's not the haves have and the have-nots don't have. It's just that a lot of people because of rent, I am going to throw this back at rents, are going so high from the major cities. For $100 or $200 a month end up on the street there's now in between or how do you get back again.</p><p>So instead of here is a soup line how many facilities do we have -- how do we get you back again? How do we build proper housing?</p><p>I understand that for example Los Angeles, or even here in Austin. They want to spend millions of dollars to build hotels to house maybe 50 people. Well, one they are spending too much. And number two, you're housing somebody, you're putting band-aids on, you're not putting in something that gets them back to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DEJORIA: There are so many jobs available right now, that take minimal training. That minimal training isn't available. In schools there was auto shop, wood shop, metal shop. That's where I went to school. I built a go-kart in, junior high school. It doesn't exist anymore.</p><p>When I graduate from high school many, many years ago you can immediately go into great paying job, a great paying job if you were trained in school. It is not there anymore. As the trades leave the school and those physical arts leave the school it means a lot of people that were trained before to do something don't have those jobs.</p><p>So big companies are right now, this is the truth, hiring people from outside the United States to fill the jobs, because the jobs are here but there are not enough qualified people in many cases --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about some of the liberal policies in some of these cities. I'm just wondering if that is part of it because you are seeing, you know, cities like San Francisco, a sanctuary city. Cities like Los Angeles -- I mean that are really seeing the big brunt of this.</p><p>And then you've got this tax flight to Florida, Sunshine State has been gaining population, some extremely wealthy residents over the past years have gone to Florida. Major business leaders are seeking lower taxes.</p><p>So talk to us about policy, and its impact -- John.</p><p>DEJORIA: I would love -- I'd love to; and I'm going to give you Austin as an example. 25 years ago in Austin I moved here about 20 years ago. But 20 -- 25 years ago here in Austin you didn't have a bunch of panhandlers on the street, a bunch of homeless people. But you did have a lot of people they called hippy like that were selling flowers, selling trinkets on the street. Nice, clean people. All of a sudden we get rushed in the last 20, 25 years with homeless more and more and more and more. What are some of the things that contributed -- overregulation and over-licensing.</p><p>In Austin, Texas, you have to have several hundred dollars to buy a permit to sell something on the street -- a trinket, a lemonade. People that don't have any money can't come up with hundreds of dollars and the regulations and what you have to pay the city's board. So with all due respect regulations are great scenarios but the United States of America has become over-regulated.</p><p>I read an article recently about California. How it takes over a year to get a permit to build a house there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>DEJORIA: So of course, home builders have that extra expense on their hand. So I think what's happening is taxes and regulations are getting so high right now, it's taking middle class people out of a middle class life in many, many cases.</p><p>And talking a lot of homelessness so I think the city should take a look at their taxation. When it talks about California we have more people coming to Texas, and of course Florida and other states.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>DEJORIA: From New York and corporations because they are being over taxed. When you are overtaxed, they have to realize this -- no disrespect extreme liberals, ok. You have to understand this. When you overtax people, they are going to move. When you pay too much money away they're going to put it someplace else. It's not the answer.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Like we say all the time, right -- like we say all the time Dagen McDowell.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Money is mobile.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I knew it, yes. I knew you were going to know exactly what I was talking about.</p><p>DEJORIA: That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I love that. I never heard that before.</p><p>DEJORIA: But it's true.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I love that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you've got to be watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA more often. We say it all the time. Money is mobile.</p><p>DEJORIA: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: JP -- it's good to see you sir.</p><p>DEJORIA: That's so true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.</p><p>DEJORIA: Always my pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon.</p><p>DEJORIA: Peace, love and happiness.</p><p>BARTIROMO: John Paul DeJoria. JP -- joining us.</p><p>Coming up shares of Apple jumping to a new high this morning.

We'll go behind it.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Less than an hour away from the opening bell on Wall Street. We are looking at fractional moves this morning. Dow Industrials now up eight points, NASDAQ up 22.</p><p>Meanwhile, this American Airlines reaching a settlement with Boeing over the 737 Max crisis. Boeing is the stock to watch. Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with details. Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Maria. Yes. That Dow and S&amp;P just turning flat line there at the very last second as you came to me. Meanwhile, Boeing has reached a settlement with American Airlines. That company American had said that the losses from the 737 Max jet would reduce profits by 540 million. We don't know the details of the settlement but we do know American is saying that they will give $30 million of the payment to employees.</p><p>American Airlines had 24 Max jets in its fleet at the time of the grounding of that plane. Meanwhile, Google shares are hitting an all-time high yesterday and poised to open higher today. Pivotal research raising their rating on the stock to -- by raising the price target, get this to 1650. They like the management changes at the company as you know, Google CEO, Sundar Pichai is now going to run the parent company as well.</p><p>They like that. And cable and maybe losing eyeballs but streaming is losing money big time. No major subscription provider generates reliable profits from streaming. Disney as is Hulu which it took over last year won't turn a profit to 2023. HBO Max which launched this year unprofitable until 2024. Look at this, Netflix has borrowed $13 billion for content. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri. Thank you. Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at a flat opening this morning.</p><p>Meanwhile this, USMCA is in focus. The markup is scheduled today in the finance committee in the Senate that puts the trade deal on the fast track for passage. You heard it here first. I spoke with White House Trade Advisor Peter Navarro on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" Sunday, he predicted USMCA would be put up for a vote this week. He also spoke about the effect on GDP.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISER: The bigger picture here for me is an economy in 2020 which is really hitting on all cylinders. USMCA and China are just two of five deals basically that are going into effect. So I'm looking at growth closer to three percent and two percent that continuing rising wages, particularly for the people that I try to help every day, who work with their hands</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Harvard University Economics Professor, former IMF Chief Economist, Kenneth Rogoff. And Kenneth, it's always great to see you. Thanks for weighing in this morning.</p><p>KENNETH ROGOFF, ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we are expecting USMCA to get the mark up today possibly passed the Senate this week or next week? What's the impact to the economy and what do you think about the trade worries that we were all talking about last year? We now are expecting the phase one of the China deal to get signed January 15th and USMCA to pass?</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, first of all, the trade deal is much more important to Mexico than it is to the United States. I think the United States the big news is they passed something, they got something done. That really, you know, probably positively affects the psychology that when something really important is going on, it will happen. I think the effects on the U.S. economy are going to be pretty marginal.</p><p>There are some good things in it. Environmental standards protected a bit. The restrictions on manufacturing imports, I think are counterproductive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROGOFF: And certainly it's not going to have a big effect on our growth at all.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's not a big effect on our growth. And so, would you expect three percent in 2020?</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, you know, it's possible. As you know, Maria, I've been optimistic about U.S. growth for quite some time. And I think the risks that it is quite a bit higher than people are expecting, or at least equal to the odds of having a recession. But, you know, it seems like the most likely is the low twos at the moment,</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Hey, Ken, it's Jon Hilsenrath. You know, as we speak, we have data scrolling on the screen here, that the trade deficit contracted in November for another month, which is kind of interesting. You know, there's been so much talk about trade uncertainty and slowing global trade and we see our trade picture improving a little bit.</p><p>Can you explain what was going on there at the end of 2019 that would have been improving the trade picture for the United States?</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, we would have had a cycle and imports from China because I think a lot got front loaded, fearing the tariffs would be even higher. It's also sensitive to oil prices. I can't really read too much in it beyond that.</p><p>ROB SMITH, SPOKESPERSON, TURNING POINT USA: Now, I want to ask there are some people that think that both the Democrats and President Trump are winners with this USMCA getting best in going about that, what do you think?</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, they obviously both think so. But I think, you know, it's just a relief that in this crazy atmosphere, I don't know what else to call it. They can get something constructive done, when there's an emergency. And hopefully it means that there's another one, maybe they could pull something out of their hat again.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Ken, it's Dagen McDowell, with the killing of Soleimani and certainly the heightened tensions with Iran in the Middle East, what are you watching for in terms of what event would have real impact on not just the U.S. economy but the global economy?</p><p>ROGOFF: You know, it's so hard to know the effects of these -- this geopolitical uncertainty, usually, unless something really dramatic happens. It's actually not that great. But obviously, if Iran, you know, does something to block oil shipments from the Middle East, that would have a striking effect, if the U.S. were suddenly to be, you know, thrown into a war where it had to vastly raise expenditures, that would have an effect.</p><p>But I think at the moment, you know, they're hot spots all over the world. It's not entirely clear whether in the long run this cools it off or heats it up, because of course the Iranians were stepping up provocation against the U.S. And maybe that's all cool it off in the end, who knows.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Ken, we're 11 years into an economic expansion. What could end this thing and when?</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, you know, it's hard to know, it's very hard to predict the timing of these things. It -- I don't think our chances of having a recession right now are any more than slightly elevated, I'd say in a normal year, 15 to 20 percent. Maybe they're 20 to 25 percent now. You know, certainly I think the election coming up is going to start speaking to investors as the Democratic candidate becomes apparent as the policies take shape.</p><p>And maybe by April, May, certainly by the middle of next year, a lot of the discussion will be about what is likely to be a 5050 presidential race. 50 percent chance he could go either way, with tremendous uncertainty about policy. It's surprising that hasn't hit the markets more at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And depending on who wins the election is obviously going to impact markets as well. So, I mean, we finished 19 in record territory for the markets. And of course, we've got a pretty good backdrop in terms of growth right now with unemployment, where it is and the consumer where it is. Where do you see the growth in 2020? What sectors and what about the unknown of the election? Would an Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders policy send market spiraling?</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, I think the answer your latter question is for sure, at least initially, I don't know that growth would necessarily go down. Some of what's going on now that I think it's very good is that wages for the bottom 25 percent are moving up faster than for the top 25 percent. And they spend it, that certainly helping boost consumption, that seems likely to continue. I think, if the jobs numbers continue to be good, consumer optimism will be good and it will probably boost expenditure.</p><p>But of course, you know, the question is what's sustainable? And that -- that's I think the big issue if we shifted to a completely different regime. I think a lot of the policies that Warren and Sanders have said in the short run might well boost the economy but I'm not sure how good they'd be for long run productivity that would be much less clear.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wait, well, hold on, what policy that Bernie Sanders is pushing is going to boost the economy, Ken? You got explain that one.</p><p>ROGOFF: Basically, ship -- there's a very high rate of saving at the very top and at the very bottom, people spend the money. So you'd get some Keynesian consumption booze from redistributing income but it is not necessarily sustainable. I'm not trying to weigh in on the details. And of course, if you actually stop fracking on day one or you know, you pass Medicare for All and it goes through on day one, that's pretty chaotic transition. But I don't think that kind of thing is going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ken, it's great to get your insights. Thanks so much.</p><p>ROGOFF: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kenneth Rogoff joining us there. Coming up. New developments emerging in Carlos Ghosn's case. We will have live coverage tomorrow. The former Nissan Chairman will break his silence for the first time since escaping Japan. Stuart Varney weighs in on that. We've got a press conference scheduled. Carlos Ghosn has that scheduled tomorrow and we will of course take it for you live.</p><p>Then the world's most admired woman takes on yet another role. Details behind former First Lady Michelle Obama's brand new job coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: New developments this morning in the case of former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn. Joining us right now the host of Varney company, Stuart Varney to weigh in here. Just an extraordinary story, Stuart.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Oh, yes, it is. OK. Item number one. The Japanese prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant for Carole Ghosn. That's Carlos Ghosn's wife. Now she happens to be an American passport holder which means if she ever goes back to America, there is an extradition treaty between Japan and America. And she could have some extradition problems if she ever came back to America.</p><p>Item number two, and it's in the Financial Times this morning. It appears that former British military officers helped Ghosn get out of Japan. They partly paid for the private jet that took him from Osaka to Istanbul. There were two of these British security guys with him on the plane. And the Financial Times says the total cost of his escape including forgone bail and expenses, $20 million, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>VARNEY: Story. Good story, huh?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's -- yes, it sure is. And then there are new headlines this morning that we were talking about during the break that the Japanese ambassador to Lebanon says that he's discussed with the president, Japan's great concern over the Ghosn case and that the Japanese ambassador to Lebanon is requesting greater cooperation on the Ghosn case to avoid any negative consequences to Lebanon. So Japan --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VARNEY: -- negative consequences (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. So, Japan is trying to squeeze loving on now. We'll of course be watching this ahead of the press conference tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. As I reported, I spoke with Carlos Ghosn this week and he's ready to name names. He says he's not going to save face. He's continues to point to the Japanese government as being behind his imprisonment and this entire ordeal. We'll be watching.</p><p>And you'll have more in 10 minutes, Stu, I know that.</p><p>VARNEY: I don't know how you did it but that was a great interview get as we said.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: Congratulations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Varney and Company begins top of the hour. Stu, we'll see in 10 minutes. 9:00 a.m. Eastern, don't miss Stuart coming up right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. But first, the world's most admired woman taking on yet another role. Details behind former First Lady Michelle Obama's brand new job coming up.</p><p>And then fantasy turned fraud. How one couple from ABC Network hit show, Bachelor in Paradise maybe in hot water over a fantasy football cheating scheme. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Michelle Obama causing a buzz this morning. Launching a new show. Her initiative, Reach Higher kicks off a year of firsts, her Instagram's IGTV. The series follows recent high school grads as they begin their first year of college. Each episode will also feature Obama talking about barriers students face. It will debut later this month. What do you guys think?</p><p>SMITH: I think it's so interesting. The thing that struck to me the most about this is that the left is so much better than conservatives are at fitting the agenda into entertainment. And so that's the thing that really struck me the most when I -- when I looked at this. You know, love Michelle Obama is great. It's -- I think, love for Michelle Obama is nonpartisan, but it's really good at inserting that agenda. And that's something that's supposed to be entertainment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You get strategic.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You get to see how popular it is instantaneously on Instagram TV. You see the number of views, so we'll see if people watch it.</p><p>SMITH: But I think --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm all for like dog -- like dog rescue videos on IGTV, that's what I want.</p><p>SMITH: But what do you think one of these students is going to be like an undocumented immigrant or one of these students is going to be grappling with student loan debt or one of these pet issues that the left tries to push. So I think it's just very essential.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, I mean, I think the student loan debt issue is an issue for everybody. That's not just -- that's not just a left issue.</p><p>SMITH: Yes. But the left wants to completely forgive it.</p><p>MCOWELL: Yes. That's not really entertainment though talking about debt. Is it?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: But I think your point is a good one. The way they market it. The way they put it in certain conversations.</p><p>SMITH: Of course.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So that it's, you know, it doesn't look it's necessarily partisan but --</p><p>SMITH: Yes. The left owns pop culture. And conservatives always left behind.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ketchup and mustard included. Oscar Mayer is searching for drivers to get them behind the wheel of its iconic Wienermobile. The job offers full-time pay for a year, benefits and radio and T.V. appearances, but you must pass hotdog high before hitting the road. Oh, the Wienermobile. What do you think?</p><p>HILSENRATH: You know, I've got a son is graduating college this year, I might have to suggest he put an application in for the Wienermobile.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: -- we read this, Maria, are you sad that you're already gainfully employed? She (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>HILSENRATH: I wonder what you have to do to pass hotdog hi.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I did worse. I worked at a cafeteria running a register on Aspen mountain after I graduated. So I had a bachelor's degree and I was working as a gardener pulling weeds.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's not worse than the Wienermobile, I don't think.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's a highfalutin job compared to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: If you want to talk about food jobs to choose story, I fried chicken at KFC on the weekends when I was serving.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>SMITH: When I -- when I wasn't deployed.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've all done it.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes. I was a busboy in an Indian restaurant. My first job.</p><p>SMITH: Indian restaurant.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I was the co-checker. All right. The new season of The Bachelor premiered last night. It is a former contestant that's making news now. Jade Roper Tolbert had a million-dollar fantasy football payday over the weekend. But her DraftKings winnings are under investigation today. It's alleged that she colluded with her husband according to ESPN. Contestants were allowed to enter up to the 150 lineups for the millionaire maker contest.</p><p>The rules say you cannot collude with anybody. ESPN reports that the couple combined to submit 300 entries at $25.00 a piece with no duplications. Tolbert denies any wrongdoing. Not good.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Are you watching The Bachelor?</p><p>SMITH: No, no. I only watched -- I watched The Bachelor ads because they are more likely to stay with the person they win. The Bachelor is actually never had a successful relationship. That's true. What was interesting --</p><p>MCDOWELL: So you're watching for true love?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: I'm watching it for true love. Look, I'm a romantic. I believe in true love.</p><p>MCDOWELL: God bless you.</p><p>SMITH: The interesting thing about this is that the woman, Jade, she said that there wouldn't be this much scrutiny on her if it was a man that won this. So she -- so she, you know, she put that out there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Something to watch. Quick break and then final thoughts from this all-star panel. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's been a great show, everybody. What are you thinking about?</p><p>HILSENRATH: The Iran issue is not deterring investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the idea that President Trump took out Soleimani to distract from impeachment is ridiculous.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020010703cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXM-5591-DXH2-600W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7302\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 7, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Middle East</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Protests</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>American Airlines</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>737 Max</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sundar Pichai</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>HBO Max</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Netflix</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>USMCA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Medicare for All</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Carlos Ghosn</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Financial Times</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bachelor in Paradise</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Reach Higher</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Oscar Mayer</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wienermobile</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DraftKings</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>The Bachelor</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Military</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Housing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

So, we will see you right back here tomorrow night at seven o'clock. Thanks for joining us, everybody. Have a good night. Tucker is up next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Anarchy grips parts of Minnesota at this hour, riders are burning cars and looting stores in neighborhoods across the Twin Cities, Minneapolis and St. Paul.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, lawmakers there seem too afraid to do anything to protect the public. We've got a lot more detail on what's going on there. We'll have it for you in just a minute.</p><p>But first tonight, we're joined by Fox Minneapolis's Karen Scullin for an update at the scene -- Karen.</p><p>KAREN SCULLIN, REPORTER, FOX MINNEAPOLIS: Well, we are outside the Third Precinct, where I'm happy to report at the moment, it is peaceful.</p><p>And if you notice, all the attention is turned away from the Third Precinct and actually on that van with there's a microphone set up. That's Mad Dads. They are a community peace group. They have a microphone. A lot of people stepping up right now offering messages of peace and unity and not violence.</p><p>So, kind of a change here. It was a little volatile earlier on. Right now though, although you can see the barricades in front of the Third Precinct leftover from last night put up today, we have a lot of windows that were smashed out last night.</p><p>But again, right now, the crowd is growing that it is peaceful at the moment. I can tell you a short while ago, maybe about an hour ago, just down the street, there was some sort of an incident or an assault it appeared and we were told that there was a stabbing and a couple of people were assaulted.</p><p>They called police for help. When police arrived at that time, the crowd started moving that way. They threw eggs. They threw water bottles. Police in that case responded with flashbangs and a round of teargas.</p><p>They did manage to get those victims off into the back of squad cars and left apparently or presumably to go to the hospital. That then dispersed.</p><p>There hasn't really been any kind of a situation between police and the crowd since then.</p><p>Behind me now you, can see the AutoZone. I'm sure you saw pictures last night of it up in flames. This is what's left. Obviously, burned to the ground along with a couple of apartment buildings.</p><p>There was a Wendy's that burned to the ground last night just behind there. I was told 16 structures in all did burn last night. Firefighters responded to 16 structure fires.</p><p>Over here real quick, we had some looting in the area, a lot of looting, actually. And you can see that the windows are boarded up all around this area here in the precinct. Obviously, these stores are closed.</p><p>But again, what we have right now is a peaceful moment, a big crowd, but a peaceful moment as speakers step up to the mic and say, hey, let's not have a repeat of last night. We'll send it back to you.</p><p>CARLSON: Karen Scullin for us in Minneapolis. Thanks so much.</p><p>If you were watching any of the coverage from Minneapolis today about what happened last night, you know perfectly well that what's happening on the streets there, no matter what it may look like, is actually a quest for justice.</p><p>It's long overdue search for answers by legitimately frustrated protesters who, if we are going to be honest about it, have been oppressed for so long they can no longer stand idle.</p><p>What you're seeing in Minneapolis is democracy in its purest form, effectively, it's a political rally. Here's was a representative scene last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is literally the craziest stuff I've ever seen right now. This is Target right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Now, wait a second, you may be thinking. That didn't look like a political rally. Those people look like looters. They were smashing cash registers with hammers to steal other people's money.</p><p>Well, yes, technically they were doing that. And yes, as a factual matter, they were smashing the cash registers because they had already stolen everything else in the store.</p><p>So no, it doesn't look like conventional political activism. But before you judge them, keep in mind, it could have been far worse. It's not like they were doing something immoral, like protesting Gretchen Whitmer's coronavirus lockdowns in Michigan. That would have been a different story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: Black people's right to protest is secondary to white people's right to be an armed protest with long guns, terrifying looking war weapons.</p><p>CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: This is how the protest of Floyd's death ended up. Police in riot gear, flooding the streets with teargas and shooting rubber bullets into the crowd.</p><p>Another example of how this pandemic has been a kind of black light, exposing all the inequalities in American life.</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: That's the meme that's going around right now with the cops, with the black kid on the ground saying hello to the white guy in camo with the AK-47 and the mask who was protesting in Michigan.</p><p>That when it's white people with guns and they're out and they're angry and their faces with cops --</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: I didn't see any of that.</p><p>CUOMO: Everybody is civil.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It says if some people are accorded the rights of citizenship and other folks are just expected to be obedient.</p><p>Peaceful -- ended up in the state capitol, Craig, with automatic weapons and they were treated with kid gloves.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, you see, it's not at all like those fascists in Michigan. In Minneapolis, there is a reason people are doing it. Legitimate reason, even the cash register smashers, they were simply smashing the cash register. So relax.</p><p>By the way, the cash registers deserved it anyway, as Joy Reid suggests on MSNBC, they're probably European cash registers and therefore complicit in oppression.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REID: Europeans came to this country to get away from being subjects of the kings in Europe. But what they did was they created for themselves sort of a kingdom, every man a king, but the subjects are black people.</p><p>These armed white men who can get armed up and walk into a state capitol and that's okay and the police are benign. They don't even act afraid.</p><p>But let black people show up and protest the death of an innocent black man, and suddenly, you know what, we need teargas. We've got to go full force.</p><p>Charlottesville, the same thing. The police were there to protect the people who were marching as Neo-Nazis not to protect the black people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So who watches Joy Reid, you may be wondering? Well, it turns out the people who run Minneapolis apparently watch Joy Reid.</p><p>As their city crumbled around them, local leaders huddled in deliberation. They emerged with a plan. They declared that racism is quote, \"a national emergency.\"</p><p>CNN immediately trumpeted the development as if it were breaking news. Meanwhile, mobs in Downtown Minneapolis kept looting stores, kept burning. Normal people of all colors huddled indoors -- terrified.</p><p>No one bothered to explain how any of this was connected. How exactly does racism have anything to do with looting ATM machines or stealing PlayStations from Target? It's confusing.</p><p>What we do know is that riots are now acceptable because racism is a national emergency. That's the new standard. Okay. So now that we're in a state of national emergency, the question is, what is not acceptable? What's not okay? Anything?</p><p>Here's what some of the quote \"protesters\" were chanting last night in Minneapolis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Shoot the white folk. Shoot the white folk.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So, you're not going to see that clip on CNN. How come? It is simple. Facts like this and there are a lot of them challenge the carefully constructed storyline that our leaders richly profit from.</p><p>Therefore those facts must be suppressed. For example, practically every day, we're told that white cops are a mortal threat to black men and some are obviously, it's what started this whole thing, a black man was killed by the police. It's awful.</p><p>But what are the national numbers on this? Well, actually, we know the answer. A study from last year found that white police officers were less likely to shoot and kill nonwhite suspects than nonwhite police officers were.</p><p>In any given year, police kill more white suspects armed and unarmed than black suspects. And that's a fact, by the way. It's not political propaganda. It's provably true.</p><p>Yet no one on television will ever say that because that fact threatens the scams they're working.</p><p>Eddie Glaude, Jr. might be the living embodiment of this phenomenon. If you've ever wondered whether yelling racist at the people you want things from it's an effective business plan, Eddie Glaude is living proof that indeed it is.</p><p>By regularly screaming racist, Glaude has been able to ride a mediocre academic career all the way to an endowed professorship at Princeton.</p><p>It's a job with such high pay, and so few actual requirements that Glaude can dress like a British Lord, and spend much of his day shuttling by limo between cable news hits.</p><p>Talk about a sweet gig.</p><p>As long as Eddie Glaude continues to denounce people as racist, the right people, he can probably keep that job forever. So naturally, Eddie Glaude has no interest in explaining how exactly racism makes people loot Target. It just does, okay, and if you disagree with that premise, you're a racist yourself. So shut up.</p><p>As Glaude told viewers in MSNBC, it's all about the quote, \"context.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDDIE S. GLAUDE, JR., CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: Most human beings natural inclination when they feel wrong, when they feel put upon, when they're living under oppressed conditions is to lash out. And this is the history of the modern West, the history of the world, and actually, in some ways.</p><p>And so part of what we have to do is try to understand the context of what led to what happened --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, the context and squint your eyes as you say \"the context.\" Of course, there's a context to setting fire to McDonald's says Professor Glaude. It's interesting.</p><p>So, you've got to wonder how would Eddie Glaude, Jr. respond if something like this happened to him? If looters descended on his house, would Glaude gently described them as protesters, as they made off with his Hermes necktie collection?</p><p>If thugs with bandanas on their faces smashed the windshield of his BMW with rocks, would Eddie Glaude call the police? Or would calling the police be racist?</p><p>Just how long, in other words, could Edie Glaude maintain his fraudulent racial justice shtick in the face of the kind of violence that he routinely excuses on television? We're thinking not very long. It's just a guess.</p><p>Let's hope Eddie Glaude is never tested on that, certainly, anytime soon. Let's hope none of us are tested.</p><p>The problem with outbreaks of mob violence is you really have no idea where they're going next. You can't know. Sometimes they subside, often, they metastasize. They're unpredictable, and they are mortally dangerous, and that's why you don't encourage them.</p><p>In St. Paul, signs have appeared in store windows announcing this is a black-owned business. In other words, we're the right skin color. Spare us. What does that tell you?</p><p>Imagine if you saw a sign saying white owned business in windows. You would be horrified and you should be, you know, it was a race riot.</p><p>We've had a lot of those in this country through the years and there is nothing worse than that.</p><p>But Minneapolis has decided to just let their riot happen and damn the consequences.</p><p>Watch the city's Police Chief explain why he doesn't plan to do anything at all to stop rioters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION: So, what you're saying is it's too dangerous for police to directly confront the looters, so you've made the decision to maybe let that site go for now and focus on keeping the rest of the neighborhood as safe as possible?</p><p>CHIEF MEDARIA ARRADONDO, MINNEAPOLIS POLICE DEPARTMENT: Absolutely, our officers are being -- have been through several hours here, Molotov cocktails thrown at them, rocks and other projectiles. And so obviously their safety is paramount, and so I don't want them going into an area where they're at risk of harm themselves.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Obviously, the safety of officers is paramount announces the chief. The interviewer says nothing.</p><p>But in fact, it's not at all obvious. In fact, it's perfectly backward. Society's first concern is the safety of citizens, especially the weakest citizens. That's why we have police in the first place, to protect people who cannot protect themselves -- the public.</p><p>Not everyone wants to do that job and that's fine. Do something else. But we can't allow this.</p><p>Imagine if the Secret Service adopted the same attitude. Sorry, I can't protect the President today, too risky. How about the military? We'd love to repel the invasion, but unfortunately, we might get hurt, our apologies.</p><p>Things would fall apart. Things are falling apart in Minneapolis. And as they collapse, our leadership class seems thrilled. They're doing nothing to calm racial division. In fact, they're eagerly stoking it.</p><p>\"The New York Times\" wrote a piece just this morning with the title, \"How White Women Use Themselves as Instruments of Terror.\" The subhead read this way, quote, \"There are too many noosed necks, charred bodies and drown souls for them to deny knowing precisely what they are doing.\"</p><p>Wait a second. Them? What they are doing? Keep in mind, this didn't run in Louis Farrakhan's free weekly. This was \"The New York Times\" this country's most important newspaper, the high tempo of American liberalism.</p><p>\"The New York Times\" is telling you that every single person of a certain color and sex has a hand in genocide. They are stained by blood guilt. They are murderers, every one of them. What do you do to murderers? You know the answer.</p><p>It's hard to believe our leaders are actually talking like this, but they are, a lot and loudly and if they keep it up, things will not end well, and yet, they show no signs of slowing down.</p><p>Watch as two of CNN's leading lights get to the bottom of the national emergency we're living through. They've discovered who is responsible for it, one hundred percent responsible. They know who is guilty. Here's a hint, it's an entire racial group.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEMON: It is not incumbent upon black people to stop racism, to stop this. It is incumbent upon people who hold the power in this society to help to do that, to do the heavy lifting, and guess who that is? Who is that, Chris?</p><p>CUOMO: White people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: The funny thing is, as we often point out, these are the very same people who claim they're fighting your racism. Okay.</p><p>But the problem is much bigger this time than mere hypocrisy. We're very used to that. This problem is far more ominous. Here it is in three sentences.</p><p>There are 320 million of us in this country. A lot of us are very different from one another, yet we all have to live together. In fact, most of us want to live together. But suddenly our leaders are making that dangerously difficult.</p><p>David Webb hosts \"Reality Check\" with David Webb, and he joins us tonight. David, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>I don't think anybody could watch the tape of the guy dying underneath that cop in Minneapolis and not feel sick and I'm in that category.</p><p>But I don't understand why at a volatile moment like this, the people to whom we look for guidance and wisdom are making the problem worse and intentionally making people hate each other. Why are they doing that?</p><p>DAVID WEBB, FOX NATION AND RADIO SHOW HOST: Tucker, you know, I watch you religiously. We work together and for the first time, I actually really felt a little bit down as you were going through your monologue and the points in the various positions.</p><p>But it goes right to your question. These are people who are not interested in dealing with the real issues in our society. This is a tragedy that should never have happened. We both know that, Americans know that. But they are using it.</p><p>They are race and poverty pimps who are using it to foster violence, the tearing down of society. And in fact, if they were successful, the tearing down of what we've done in this country, which is to evolve and advance as a culture that has overturned colonial racism and has rejected segregation and has opened up the doors to freedom for men, women, all ethnicities.</p><p>And here we are discussing it again as people burn their own communities. And it is a sad testament to many out there that are doing this.</p><p>You're talking about the cash register. How does that advance -- how does breaking and looting, burning advance your righteous cause and your righteous call for actual justice for George Floyd? How does it do that?</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>WEBB: It doesn't. And around the nation, we have people, major figures, many of whom you've mentioned, others that are jumping on board, whether it's rappers, public figures of some sort, who are calling from rioting, who are calling for more of this.</p><p>This is where society reaches a crux of a real challenge to itself, and I'm going to implore the people in Minneapolis, St. Paul, everywhere, please, think about what you're doing to your communities. Think about the examples in Ferguson on West Florissant and South Florissant Streets.</p><p>Think about what happened in Baltimore with Freddie Gray. Think about what has happened to those neighborhoods and what you've done to destroy your community while not achieving the level of justice you seek.</p><p>CARLSON: Some fraudulent Princeton Professor eggs them on. They're not coming to his house. In 1967, Detroit had one of the lowest black unemployment rates in the country, then they had riots -- race riots -- and then it became Detroit.</p><p>For these people to encourage that is really wrong, I would say. David Webb, thank you for your perspective. I appreciate it.</p><p>WEBB: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Those pictures by the way we showed you of the burning car, we just had up on the screen, that's happening right now.</p><p>We'll be watching the chaos in the Twin Cities throughout the hour, but back in Washington, the President has signed a new Executive Order that seeks to break Big Tech's control of speech online. Will it work? We will speak with a Member of Congress about that, next?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the City of Los Angeles now requires all citizens to wear masks even when they go outside. There's no scientific evidence whatsoever that forcing people to wear masks outside prevents the spread of disease. None. No evidence. But whatever, the mayor commands it, he's God now. You have to.</p><p>But listen to the details on this order from so-called health authorities as reported in \"The LA Times,\" we're quoting here, \"If you must re-wear your cloth facemask covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face.\" Think about that. What are they telling you?</p><p>They're telling you that your facemask is so dangerous you must wash your hands thoroughly after touching. It's like a bio weapon.</p><p>But then you're required to put that same terrifyingly dangerous facemask over your nose and mouth, and you're required to do this by law. Good luck, Los Angeles. You don't deserve this.</p><p>Back in Washington today, the President signed an Executive Order designed to stop censorship by the Big Tech companies online. The order comes two days after Twitter placed a fact check on two of the President's tweets that criticized universal mail-in voting as conducive to voter fraud. It is conducive to voter fraud, by the way, provably so, people have been convicted.</p><p>But Twitter called it a lie anyway. So, what does the President order do? Well, it redefines U.S. policy. It says explicitly, the government's position is to protect free speech on major social media platforms, good for them.</p><p>Toward that end, the White House will create a tool to let American citizens report cases of Big Tech bias to the D.O.J. and the F.T.C., the Federal Trade Commission for possible investigation.</p><p>Additionally, the Secretary of Commerce is ordered to petition the F.C.C. to propose new regulations that would expose tech companies to legal action if they remove content or ban users based on deceptive or dishonest grounds, or if they don't give users an adequate ability to contest the censorship they've suffered.</p><p>All of this is good. The question is, is it enough? If it comes to fruition, if the order does what it says it will, it will take some time. And of course, it could be instantly reversed and likely will be the second, a Democrat takes power and runs the administration.</p><p>So, what we need to fix this isn't an Executive Order, again, those are reversible, but laws which are passed by the Congress traditionally, and it should be.</p><p>The Communications Decency Act of 1996 is at the center of this. It's the reason that Big Tech is as powerful as it now is. Section 230 of that Act holds that -- we're quoting now -- \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" What does that mean?</p><p>It means that the Big Tech companies, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube are not considered responsible for the content that appears on them. Because they're just platforms. They're not publishers. They can't be sued for libel if somebody posts something libelous on their services. They're considered neutral.</p><p>And that actually makes sense. We're in favor of that, if they remain neutral platforms, but they are not neutral platforms. They are publishers, the most powerful publishers in the world.</p><p>They fact check, as you've heard recently. Twitter routinely purges users simply for having the wrong political views.</p><p>Facebook has created an oversight board to decide what users are allowed to say. YouTube takes down videos if they question the decrees of local politicians.</p><p>This is political censorship, and it is taking place with the approval of the United States Congress. So, these are monopolies and they're conducting censorship. They're not neutral platforms putting out all information in the public's best interest.</p><p>Again, they're publishers curating content in the same way CNN does, MSNBC does, \"The New York Times\" does and Fox News does. But unlike any of those news organizations, these companies are immune from lawsuits, thanks to Section 230. That is corrupt.</p><p>It's an unfair business advantage. It empowers a handful of tech monopolies to the detriment of everyone else. It puts a small group of people in control of all human information in English, and it guts our constitutional liberties.</p><p>So at this point, after years of this Congress taking payoffs from these people and ignoring it, now is the time to stop it.</p><p>If these businesses want to be treated as neutral platforms, they must be neutral platforms, otherwise, they should get their carve-out yanked from them immediately.</p><p>Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida is a lawmaker pushing to do that, to change Section 230, we're grateful for that. He joins us tonight.</p><p>Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. So why hasn't this happened already? They're violating the intent of the law.</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Well, Big Tech buys off Congress so as to maintain special privileges that local newspapers and television stations don't enjoy. That's why the President's Executive Order today is one very important next step because if we just wait around, Big Tech will steal this election from Donald Trump and from the American people.</p><p>In 2016, we won three Rust Belt states by a point each, and that was when nobody thought Donald Trump could win in 2020. We've lost the element of surprise, and so we have to be as aggressive as they are.</p><p>That means bills like Senator Hawley and I have filed have filed to change Section 230, so as to out these entities as publishers and not the unbiased platforms they are, it means an Executive Order like the President has issued, but it also means getting the other elements of government to enforce existing law.</p><p>The Federal Election Commission needs to get off their duff. Twitter is interfering with an election. I heard Democrats say for three years that Russia was interfering with an election. That was a hoax.</p><p>We have domestic election interference going on right now. I'll be filing a complaint with the Federal Election Commission tomorrow because of what they have done to President Trump and as a voter, I have the standing to do it.</p><p>And President Trump should call for a decision on the Federal Election Commission questions that are before them so that these tech companies get flushed out of the bushes.</p><p>CARLSON: But Mark Zuckerberg argues and in this, I agree with him, that you don't want to see Section 230 revoked. You want people to have liability from libel suits, because then you can have much more information, a free flow of information.</p><p>So, what do you do -- so you probably don't want to change that, but you have to make these companies live up to the promise they made to be neutral platforms. How do you force them to do that? How should Congress do that? And again, why haven't they?</p><p>GAETZ: Well, again, Big Tech companies have a tremendous amount of influence over Congress. It's one reason why I don't take their PAC money or anyone else's Federal PAC money, but on the question of what has to be done, I agree with you.</p><p>But if someone is going to assert that they are a non-biased, neutral platform, we should not just take that as an article of faith. We actually have to have investigative work done, transparency, disclosures.</p><p>If we're going to give these folks the privileges that you would give a public utility company, maybe we need to start regulating tech like the public utilities as they are.</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly -- that's it. You know, you hate to think it's going to come down to this, I think it's going to have to. They have too much power.</p><p>Congressman, thanks so much for that. Good to see you.</p><p>GAETZ: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the press, of course, has covered every death from coronavirus, which they should do. They've given almost no attention to the explosion of suicides and overdoses caused by the lockdowns in response to the coronavirus.</p><p>It's a huge problem. It's real.</p><p>We have an important story from someone who has been touched by it personally after the break.</p><p>Then we'll head back to Minneapolis live where rioters are continuing to destroy one of this country's great cities, unimpeded. That's just ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: The savage beating of a 75-year-old service veteran at Detroit's Westwood Nursing Center was horrifying to watch. We played the tape for you. But the story becomes even worse when you know the details.</p><p>According to his father, 20-year-old Jaden Hayden was transferred by the state to that facility after he tested positive for the coronavirus -- to a nursing home. How could that have happened?</p><p>The Great Dr. Marc Siegel of NYU Langone hospital joins us tonight. Doctor, thanks so much for coming on. Simple question. How could this happen?</p><p>DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, let me tell you something. I'll tell you how this can happen.</p><p>Governor Whitmer, who we've talked about on the show here of Michigan has one of the most supreme lockdowns, serious lockdowns in the entire country. The Upper Peninsula of Michigan has only 110 COVID-19 cases, 110, and it's a beautiful recreational area, yet it's under extreme lockdown. And the congressman in the state has been complaining and writing op-eds about this, and that's how severe the lockdown is.</p><p>But not nursing homes. Nursing homes are not locked down at all. In fact, Bob Gordon, who is the Head of Health and Human Services in Michigan announced just this week, we just heard this breaking news that there's over 1,200 deaths in in nursing homes at facilities like it in Michigan.</p><p>Over 25 percent of the deaths in Michigan from COVID-19 have occurred in nursing homes, and this is being underreported. It's actually a lot more than that.</p><p>How can this happen? Well, we've talked on the show here about Governor Cuomo of New York having this rigid order that forced nursing homes to take back people who are COVID-19 positive, to admit people who are COVID-19 positive, and that's since been partly withdrawn.</p><p>Here in Michigan, well, guess what? Governor Whitmer actually issued an Executive Order on May 20th, Tucker, May 20th, saying that nursing homes can't prohibit people from being admitted who are COVID-19 positive and they have to just put them in a unit for COVID-19 positive patients.</p><p>This is a disgrace, and it's going to cause COVID-19 to spread through these nursing homes and we're going to see way more deaths.</p><p>One final thing about this, Tucker, that I want to say to Governor Whitmer directly. I put my boat in the water right before Memorial Day and I went out on the sea and I had an incredible thoughtful revealing experience and something came to me, and I want to say to her, when your husband's boat goes in the water, go out on the sea and rethink this nursing home policy and rescind this Executive Order, please, before we see thousands of more unnecessary deaths -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I think that's wise advice. Being outside does help you think clearer. There's no doubt about that. Doctor, thank you so much.</p><p>SIEGEL: She needs it. Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, deaths from this virus have been heavily covered over the past few months. We've covered them in some detail on this show. We should.</p><p>But far less attention, virtually none really has been given to the hidden agony resulting from months of lockdown. As of tonight, one-third of all Americans show signs of depression or anxiety or both according to the Census Bureau.</p><p>Americans fired from their jobs are isolated from friends and family are dying in unprecedented numbers. They're dying from suicides, overdose, and other deaths of despair.</p><p>Unfortunately, nobody understands that as well as Brad Hunstable does. He's a business owner, a graduate of West Point. It's hard even to say this, but he just lost his son, Hayden, who was locked down as well.</p><p>Brad Hunstable joins us tonight. Mr. Hunstable, thanks so much for coming on and it is very hard to have this conversation. But you wanted to come because you thought it was important for the public to hear this and I agree with you. So, tell us the effect you think these policies had on your family.</p><p>BRAD HUNSTABLE, BUSINESS OWNER AND WEST POINT GRADUATE: Well, Tucker 41 days ago, right above my head, my young 12-year-old boy, three days before his 13th birthday, took his life.</p><p>Hayden was a normal kid. He wasn't depressed. He loved athletics. And I created a video that since has gone viral, and I said the COVID virus, he died of the COVID virus. He didn't die of the coronavirus, but he died certainly because of the COVID virus.</p><p>The isolation has created what I believe and what I worried and what I am warning every parent in America tonight. An emotional tsunami is sweeping this nation and I'm very concerned about it.</p><p>CARLSON: Flesh it out a little bit if you would, the isolation, which I mean, that's how we punish prisoners, by isolating them. Tell us the effects, you think, that it is having on children.</p><p>HUNSTABLE: Let me start by giving you some stats that I bet most people in America don't even know, and I certainly didn't know this prior to my son passing away.</p><p>The second leading cause of death in the United States for 10 to 14-year- olds is suicide. The second leading cause of death of 15 to 24-year-olds is suicide, 25 to 34-year-olds is suicide.</p><p>Eighty percent, some studies have shown, up to 80 percent of all suicides were impulsive suicides and that means they made the decision very, very, very quickly. Seventy percent of those made the decision within the last hour, 40 percent within the last five minutes.</p><p>And so when you combine that with social isolation, which is not the human condition, we set up a perfect storm in a scenario where we have what is taking place all across the country and Tucker, I've got the numbers to support it.</p><p>CARLSON: You and I have been talking, you said that you've seen, it hasn't just touched your family, hurt your family so much, but people around you in your community, people you know have also gone through moments likes this.</p><p>HUNSTABLE: We've lost another one in my small town, almost lost a third one in my small town. We lost four in the town of Jay, four teens. One kid hung himself from the goalpost of the football stadium.</p><p>And so there's probably a total of six around my town. My West Point, buddy, unfortunately, passed away through that through self-harm method just last week.</p><p>This is a tragedy and the stigma around suicide, I know it can be taboo. I know people don't want to talk about it because they don't know what to say.</p><p>But I've been screaming for them as loud as I can because conversations matter. We have to talk about it.</p><p>What we've done in the past hasn't worked. It's time to try something different. And I implore every American, every parent out there, if you're working on your patio outside, grab your son, your daughter, take them to Home Depot. Take your kid on a walk.</p><p>Conversations matter and we're in a heightened state of anxiety.</p><p>CARLSON: Amen. People are not meant to be alone and the bloodless technocrats don't get that, but it's true. It's always true. Always. Brad Hunstable, thank you for telling that story.</p><p>HUNSTABLE: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Pretty brazen. Well, the Russia collusion story has been essentially debunked for more than a year. But even now, the basis for that investigation, which was the so-called hacking of the D.N.C. remains intact. The Russians did it. But did the Russians do it? That's the core question. We'll assess that after the break.</p><p>Plus the Minneapolis riots are ongoing. We'll tell you what's happening when we return.</p><p>CARLSON: So, where did the Russia collusion story come from? The beginning? Well, it was rooted as a story in the publication of thousands of leaked e- mails from the D.N.C., a lot of which embarrassed the Hillary campaign.</p><p>That set of e-mails and e-mails from John Podesta's personal Gmail account were stolen by Russia and given to WikiLeaks in London. That was the story. Anyone who questioned it was attacked.</p><p>When we asked a question about it, Adam Schiff himself suggested we must be Russian agents.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Look right into the camera and say I know for a fact that the government of Vladimir Putin was behind the hacks of John Podesta's e-mail.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Absolutely. The government of Vladimir Putin was behind the hacks of our institution and the dumping of information --</p><p>CARLSON: Of John Podesta's e-mail.</p><p>SCHIFF: Not only in the United States but also in Europe.</p><p>CARLSON: Of John Podesta's e-mail. Okay, you're not -- you know what you're dodging the question.</p><p>SCHIFF: And Tucker --</p><p>CARLSON: Look and say, I know they did John Podesta's e-mails. They hacked those.</p><p>SCHIFF: And I think that Ronald Reagan will be rolling around in this grave --</p><p>CARLSON: You can't -- Ronald Reagan, finally, Ronald Reagan.</p><p>SCHIFF: You're carrying water for the Kremlin.</p><p>CARLSON: I am not carrying water for -- you're making --</p><p>SCHIFF: It's you and the President-elect --</p><p>CARLSON: Look, you're a sitting Member of Congress on the Intel Committee and you can't say they hackers --</p><p>SCHIFF: You're going to have to move your show to RT -- Russian Television.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So he wouldn't say it because you knew it wasn't true, and now there's accumulating evidence that in fact, it wasn't true. The Russia didn't do that. That's not a defense of Russia. It's a fact.</p><p>The F.B.I. never directly inspected the D.N.C. servers for evidence of Russian hackers. They took the word of a private company called CrowdStrike. You know the story.</p><p>But in recently declassified house testimony, CrowdStrike's CEO admitted there was no proof that Russia did that. Julian Assange, by the way, who runs WikiLeaks has always denied that Russian hackers got him the e-mails.</p><p>And yet, here's something very odd. The Mueller team never interviewed Julian Assange. He wanted to be interviewed. They didn't. Why not? Well, you know why? Because the truth was never the point.</p><p>Glenn Greenwald co-founded \"The Intercept.\" We disagree, probably on a lot politically, but from day one, he has taken an enormous amount of abuse for being skeptical of the Russia story, and we're happy to have him on tonight.</p><p>So Glenn, I can't get past this one question, and I think you probably know more about this than anybody I know personally.</p><p>The question of how did these e-mails get from the D.N.C. server to WikiLeaks? And it's starting to look like maybe they were leaked by a D.N.C. staffer who was mad that the Hillary campaign was taking -- was siding with the D.N.C. Do you think that's how they got there? How did they get to WikiLeaks?</p><p>GLEN GREENWALD, CO-FOUNDER, THE INTERCEPT: I don't think we know and that was the point all along. The original heresy in Russiagate that got many of us expelled from the halls of decent liberal company was questioning the declaration from security state agencies who have a history of lying, declaring definitively that Russia was behind the hacks.</p><p>And all you had to do in order to be declared a heretic in journalism was to say, you know what, I'd actually like to see some evidence for that. I'm not saying it couldn't have happened or that it is beyond the realm of possibility, Russia does stuff like that, so does the U.S.</p><p>But before I believe that, I'd actually like to see some evidence from that and we got the kinds of responses that you just showed with Adam Schiff accusing you of being a Kremlin pawn or a Kremlin asset or disloyal or unpatriotic for having wanting to see the evidence.</p><p>And as it turns out, there is some relevant evidence to that question, but it was hidden for years until just recently, namely, that the head of CrowdStrike, the only entity that was actually able to examine the servers admitted in closed hearings before the House that there is no concrete evidence that Russia in his words, exfiltrated those e-mails.</p><p>He said, there's indicia of it. There's circumstantial evidence for it, but there's no hard concrete scientific evidence the way we were told for three years existed and that we all had to unquestioningly swallow.</p><p>And the amazing thing is, very few people have talked about that incredibly important aspect of that testimony that utterly erodes the core initial premise of the entire three years that dominated our political discourse, the media has just utterly ignored it.</p><p>CARLSON: Very quickly. By the way, if you hear dogs barking in the background, Glenn Greenwald runs a dog shelter out of his house.</p><p>GREENWALD: It's because Tucker has a lot of dogs who poorly behaves.</p><p>CARLSON: I love that. Very quickly, Julian Assange is at the very center of the story. His organization, WikiLeaks ran these e-mails which started the whole story. Why didn't Mueller or Andrew Weissmann or why didn't somebody from the investigation ever interview him?</p><p>GREENWALD: Well, I mean, I think it's reasonable to say that even if Julian Assange believes that the people who gave him those e-mails weren't part of the Russian government that isn't at all proof that it wasn't the Russians who did the hacking. They could have easily done the hacking and then given it to somebody else to give to Julian Assange.</p><p>But if you're investigating a crime in which e-mails end up illicitly with a group that publishes them. Obviously, you want to talk to that person about how they got them and who gave it to them.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. Exactly.</p><p>GREENWALD: And he was pleading to be interviewed and they just refused.</p><p>CARLSON: They interviewed a woman I know because she was at a party with someone else they were interested in. But they didn't interview Julian Assange. It tells you everything.</p><p>Glenn Greenwald, great to see you. And God bless you for helping those dogs.</p><p>GREENWALD: Great talking to you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks. Well, it's been two days but rioting and looting are still underway in the Twin Cities, Minneapolis and St. Paul. We have live reporting from that scene, next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, rioters or as CNN calls them, questions seekers, are continuing to devastate the Twin Cities tonight. Fox's Mike Tobin is there for us tonight live. Mike, how is it?</p><p>MICHAEL TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Well, we've already seen it going off just a little bit here. If you go behind me and look right behind me, you can move that.</p><p>Look right behind me, there is a car fire that's underway right now and something we ought to be careful about. Someone just took the fire extinguisher with all those compressed gases and threw it inside of that car fire. So, that guy clowning around to a gang signs has put himself at a bad position.</p><p>Earlier, right in this area, the teargas came out. And that's because someone was hurt and they were on the ground and the paramedics were trying to get some space to work and people were throwing things at the paramedics and the police tried to get them some space. That's when the teargas came out there.</p><p>So, not any big thing so far, just a little bit of skirmishes and a car fire. You saw the press conference from the Hennepin County Attorney, from the U.S. Attorney saying the investigation is underway with the backing of the President, with the backing of the U.S. Attorney General, and it's just not fast enough for these people.</p><p>They want to see arrests. They want to see convictions. They don't want to wait for a process -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Thanks, Mike. It's called mob justice, by the way. Just a car burning in the middle of a street in a major American city. No problem. It's America.</p><p>Kendall Qualls is a Republican running for Congress in the third District of Minnesota and he joins us tonight. Mr. Qualls, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>What do you make of the response to this? I'm sure like most people, you were upset by the video of a man dying, most people were, but the response from the leaders in your area to what's happening in Minnesota. What do you make of it?</p><p>KENDALL QUALLS (R), MINNESOTA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Sure, Tucker, first of all, thank you for having me on. I wish it was on better circumstances.</p><p>CARLSON: Me, too.</p><p>QUALLS: You know, I think all of us outraged by what we saw in the video. Our hearts are out for George Floyd and his family. But there's three things really that need to be, you know, clarified, if you will for what's happening on the ground.</p><p>Three different groups of people. One, we have the legitimate protesters that were outraged and want justice for George Floyd and his family. They were black and white from the community, equally outraged.</p><p>Then you have people you don't see in those videos. These are the most vulnerable citizens right now, senior citizens in those homes, a lot of single mothers that want to actually have a different direction for their children, want them to escape those kind of communities, much like I did, when -- I used to live in Harlem, New York.</p><p>And then lastly, you have the mob, if you will, taking advantage of the situation. They're not there to protest. They're being mislabeled as protesters and they are not. They're taking advantage of the situation for their own gain, and you know cause chaos and anarchy.</p><p>CARLSON: And their agenda. I think that's such a smart and important point. I think all of us are for a legitimate political protest. We defend it all the time, even when we disagree with it.</p><p>But this isn't for -- some of these people about the death of this specific man, it is about something different, isn't it?</p><p>QUALLS: Unfortunately so. You know, I've seen this and what the tragedy of this is. Now, the whole topic of discussion, the attention is driven toward these activities, and not justice for George Floyd, his memory, his family, and it's all about now law and order.</p><p>And that we've seen this consistently in this country. And if anything, for those people that we never hear about, we never get to hear their voice, those that are the most vulnerable. They're wishing something like taking control of the city or taking control of the situation would have happened much sooner.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, this won't make lives better for a lot of people, that's for sure. We have a long, long history of moments like this really hurting people who don't have a lot.</p><p>So Kendall Qualls, thank you so much for coming on tonight. Great to see you.</p><p>QUALLS: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: We are completely out of time, indeed about three seconds away. The Great Sean Hannity takes over for 9:00 p.m. from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2020052801cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6012-1M51-DXH2-62HM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002AP8</classCode><className>AUTOZONE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS441310 AUTOMOTIVE PARTS &amp;

He draws energy from an endless storm of difficulties and controversies that would send most presidents into the fetal position.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Critics and supporters alike compare his presidency to a reality television show, one that always ends with the leading man getting the last word. From Russia, Russia, Russia to Ukraine and impeachment, Trump's time in the White House has been a continuing roller-coaster ride between danger on one side and disaster on the other.   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  A political Houdini, he has always escaped and emerged stronger in victory, but now comes the biggest test. He is in the middle of his re-election campaign just as public disorder is expanding and accelerating, leaving many Americans extremely unsettled and fearful about the future.   </p><p>  For the president, the outcome could turn on the question of how much chaos is too much chaos. And whether independent voters will abandon him because of Trump fatigue.  </p><p>  Elections, of course, are referendums on the incumbent and, pre-pandemic, the president was in the driver's seat. The economy was roaring, unemployment was at record lows and he finally appeared to be comfortable with his White House team.   </p><p>  Democrats couldn't find either an issue to run on or a strong nominee. Socialism was a loser and one shooting star after another flamed out - remember the glory days of Pete Buttigieg? - until only a confused Joe Biden was left standing. His infirmities are so obvious that Barack Obama didn't endorse him until there were no other options.  </p><p>  Yet the nation's mood has shifted sharply in the last three months, with the pandemic roiling the political and economic landscape and giving Biden a fresh chance at victory. Dems and their media handmaidens are determined to hang every one of the 100,000 deaths around Trump's neck and use the enormous job losses as an indictment against the president's \u00adtenure.   </p><p>  If that weren't trouble enough for the incumbent, just as the pandemic begins to recede from the headlines, other disturbances already are beginning to eclipse it.   </p><p>  Start with the most sudden and sensational: the brutal death of a black man in Minneapolis at the hands of police officers, one of whom was charged with murder.   </p><p>  Protests quickly turned into \u00adriots, looting and arson, the National Guard is patrolling the streets and sporadic anti-police violence is spreading. The prospect looms of a long, hot summer of urban unrest.  </p><p>  Simultaneously, the president's simmering feud with Big Tech also erupted. Twitter dropped its pretense of political neutrality to fact check Trump tweets, effectively declaring that it has joined the resistance and has no intention of dropping its long-standing bias against the president and his supporters.   </p><p>  The double standards are glaring, but Big Tech is now too big to scare. Threats from Iranian mullahs and far-left nut jobs who talk of assassinating Trump are acceptable posts, but the president of the United States gets the bum's rush.   </p><p>  Trump, naturally, hit back hard, drafting an executive order calling on the Federal Communications Commission to end the social media giants' legal liability exemptions. The result could alter the handful of companies that dominate digital advertising and personal communications.   </p><p>  While many on the left have longed for tighter regulation of the tech firms, they also clamor for restricting Trump's access. His embrace of regulation will probably turn them into ardent defenders of the legal exemptions and give them an opportunity to claim, falsely, that he wants to abolish the First Amendment.   </p><p>  The final bombshell of last week may turn out to be the most consequential. Clearly exasperated by China and sensing he was being tested, the president moved to pull the US out of the World Health Organization as part of the confrontation over the coronavirus. Among other moves, he also condemned China's crackdown on Hong Kong and vowed to end favored treatment to the former British colony, saying the Communist Party had broken the treaty where it pledged to allow greater freedoms there.   </p><p>  Throughout his Rose Garden statement, the president's language was notably more harsh toward China than it has been. He offered no warm words of friendship for President Xi Jinping, nor did he express confidence that the first part of the renegotiated trade deal would remain intact.   </p><p>  China is not backing down, with a top general threatening to attack Taiwan, which would force America to defend its tiny ally or see it crushed. China also threatened Australia's economy, warning of a trade calamity if it sides with the United States.  </p><p>  Recall that China showed its willingness to meddle in our elections by commissioning anti-Trump articles and ads in the Midwest before the 2018 midterms, and we should expect more of the same as it tries to help defeat Trump and elect Biden. US officials also say Chinese hackers are engaged in cyber attacks against us and our allies.  </p><p>  It's possible that some or all of these developments will break in Trump's favor. The riots and looting, for example, are not likely to move independent voters to Biden, and becoming China's preferred candidate might hurt him more than it helps. At the least, it will bring new focus to Hunter Biden's business there.   </p><p>  Similarly, the opposition of Big Tech can be seen as another example of the media abandoning their standards to defeat Trump, and thus energize his supporters.   </p><p>  Still, the growing sense of chaos in the country is an unpredictable factor that could determine the November outcome. In about five months, we will know if President Houdini can pull off another great escape.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Donald Trump.

The FT 100 is up  a third of a percent.  That's 22 points higher.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board to report.  Take a look, Asian  markets finished like this.  Still a holiday in China.  Shanghai Composite  closed but the Nikkei average in japan down one in a quarter percent.  The  worst performer throughout the Asian markets.</p><p>One football fan scoring the ultimate ticket, Super Bowl seats for life.   The details coming up.</p><p>And then a great American tradition.  It's Groundhogs Day today.  Will  Punxsutawney still see his shadow?  We will take you to Pennsylvania later  this hour live where the crowd are lining up.  It is incredibly packed  right there this morning at this time.</p><p>All that coming up this morning.</p><p>And joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.   Former Goldman Sachs partner and New York Times best-selling author Peter  Kiernan is with us.  And Maverick PAC national co-chair, Morgan Ortagus.   Good to see you.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, CO-CHAIR, MAVERICK PAC:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Great to see you.  Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  I love being here every morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Groundhogs Day.  Every day is Groundhogs Day.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, we got Rex Tillerson confirmed.  We'll see who else is on  the docket.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Betsy DeVos having some problems with two republican senators  saying they're not going to vote for her.  And so now it looks -- it looks  split 50 votes for the republicans and so she's hanging on by a thread.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I didn't expect that coming to republicans.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did not either.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll talk about that this morning.  Big show ahead.   Forbes media chairman and former republican presidential candidate Steve  Forbes is in the house.  We got to talk to with him about tax reform.</p><p>Plus, the former republican presidential candidate and former Minnesota  governor Tim Pawlenty with us this morning.</p><p>The chief investment officer of CalPERS Ted Eliopoulos is with us this  morning.  We're going to find out how he's allocating capital.</p><p>And Ohio congressman who ran against Nancy Pelosi from minority leader.   Tim Ryan is with us.  Big show.</p><p>Plus, former NFL star, Jack Brewer as well.  Stick around.  Stay right  there.  We've got a big program ahead.</p><p>We kick it off right now with a wave of destruction blanketing the  University of California campus Berkeley campus last night.  Protesters  rallying against the planned speech by the school by Breitbart news editor  Milo Yiannopoulos.  Rioter's started fires, they broke windows.  They  confronted police.  Ultimately causing the talk to be canceled.</p><p>Fox News' Tucker Carlson spoke with Milo Yiannopoulos last night about the  chain of events and protesters spoke out as well.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MILO YIANNOPOULOS, NEWS EDITOR, BREITBART:  This evening we got into the  building, started preparing for the show and people started arriving in  black clothes then masks.  They were clearly carrying concealed shields  weapons and things.  And then stuff being thrown at the building.  There  were rocks being thrown.  Various other things being thrown out of the  building.  Eventually the ground floor was breached and I was evacuated.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have the right to defend ourselves.  And so this  shutting this down Milo Yiannopoulos and doing whatever is necessary to do  that is our right to self-defend.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's one thing to protest someone's right to come here  and speak, but it's another thing to create this much amount of destruction  and violence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  Peter Kiernan, what's your reaction here?  I mean,  UC Berkeley was -- I know -- regardless it is a left-leaning university.   But isn't this the place where typically students go and say we want free  speech and look what they do to somebody who's about to give a speech?</p><p>PETER KIERNAN, FORMER PARTNER, GOLDMAN SACHS:  Yes.  I have to say, this  man is on the campus tour from hell.  He got cancelled a couple of weeks  ago at UC Davis and the University of New Mexico.  They just find the group  that was hosting in $3,500.</p><p>He is somebody who is basically being rejected everywhere.  And I thought  universities were places of free and open exchange of ideas.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not in modern history they're not.  These left-wing individuals  -- and this is throughout the college system in this country and it's led  by professors quite frankly, that they preach tolerance, but breed  intolerance.  They're breeding intolerance in the name of tolerance.  That  is what is so both ironic and repugnant in what's going on here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  why is that do you think?  I just had this conversation last  night.  Why are the academics spewing this liberalism and they are just --  I mean, even when you look at the day after the election when Donald Trump  won.  They're telling students of different narrative than actually what  happened.  Why?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I think it's just another symptomatic case where you say they're  completely out of touch with the American people, right?  The university  job especially getting tenure.  It's a bunch of groupthink, I think in a  lot of occasions and these are not people that are out working some job  nine to five or trying to make ends meet.  They had pretty cushy jobs at  universities.  It's like being in the government, right, where you can get  fired.</p><p>What was really interesting to me though about the Berkeley situation,  Maria, is that Berkeley invited at the time President Ahmadinejad from Iran  when he was being incredibly provocative to the U.S.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Death to America.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  And death to America.  So you do not see the type of protests for  him that you saw last night.</p><p>Also, Milo is not without controversy.  So this is -- let's not pretend  that he doesn't -- he stoked the flames a bit so he does it as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It doesn't matter though because they said this on this program  when it comes to liberal protests, whether marches here to protest police  brutality for example.  Defending the first amendment means tolerating and  allowing for speech that even you find repugnant and offensive.  That's  what the first amendment is about.  It not about this.</p><p>And it shows liberal left wing distortion of what's really going on when  you hear the young woman saying, we have the right to defend ourselves.   Your right is to not listen to what Milo Yiannopoulos has to say</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, don't go.  Don't show up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But stop acting like this is a physical attack on you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are you defending yourself?</p><p>KIERNAN:  I think when it's all said and done, the safe space mentality,  we're going to protect the students from the real world or from the world  that's different from what they believe.  When those students get out into  the real world, they'll find that there are a plurality of points of view,  even though as they never heard on campus.</p><p>And if campuses are meant to create great leaders in the future, what are  they training them for if they don't have full exposure to the voices?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They shut down freedom of expression.  They're shutting down the  first amendment and at the same time, and you can't say this enough.  This  college campuses -- because of these professors, they've become a breeding  ground for anti-Semitism in this country.</p><p>And they're giving people cover to basically preach hatred of Jews and it's  disgusting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  it's disgusting.  And where is the president?  Where is the  president of the university to come out and stop this and show some  leadership?  Have we heard from anybody at the leadership?</p><p>KIERNAN:  Well, it's interesting, in UC Davis the chancellor did say  something that was not condoning of this, but that's a talk.  Where is the  action and he chose from the day-to-day activity?  Why aren't you opening  your doors to contrary points of view?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  Really a great points this morning on  this.</p><p>I want to turn to immigration because President Trump's administration is  considering an executive order that would take a closer look at visa  programs for foreign workers in the U.S.  This according to \"The Wall  Street Journal\" this morning.</p><p>Morgan, your take on this.  For Trump, it would be another promise  fulfilled in keeping jobs in America, frankly.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I would like -- first of all, clearly, our immigration system  needs reform.  I think people on both sides of the aisles are honest with  themselves.  What I would like prefer to see over an executive order is  that the president work with congress on comprehensive reform.  And the  reason is that President Obama have seen this firsthand.</p><p>When you issue all of these executive orders, they can easily be done.  And  so one of the problems over the past eight years, one of the reason  President Obama was not effective is because he didn't work with congress  to push this legislation through.</p><p>So I like the idea of this.  I think we need reform.  I would like them to  see him go to congress, get a comprehensive play.  Get something codified  and delude that can't be undone the minute the next president comes in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The tech industry particularly is upset about this, about the  going after the H-1B visas for highly skilled workers.</p><p>And I would argue on the other hand of that.  In fact, the CEO of GoDaddy  was writing that there are currently 500,000 unfilled high skilled I.T. in  computer science jobs.</p><p>If you want American companies to create more jobs, then you want the best  and brightest minds from around the world living here and creating ideas  and products that are then American-owned.  So I would argue that this is  critical importance.</p><p>We need to reform the education system quite frankly if you want Americans  to fill this jobs.  In the interim, you want to support great American  businesses.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why those CEOs of those technology companies are  putting together a letter to send to President Trump to obviously review  everything you just said, having the crux of the issue.</p><p>KIERNAN:  I think they want it so bad.  About a million people immigrate  here every year.  I think we should take 50,000 or 60,000 of those H-1B  visas and sell them for $50,000.  And if the high-tech companies want those  people so bad to fill those slots, sell them.  We could raise a billion  dollars a year, do that for five years.  That's how you find your fixing of  the education system.  I think there's an opportunity -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How are you going to sell them though?  Are you getting best  students in that way?</p><p>KIERNAN:  I think what you do as I say, we're going to give you a slot.   We'll sell to you for $50,000.  If you want one of those H-1 visas, you  pay.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  OK.</p><p>KIERNAN:  For 50,000.  We still have a million people coming in here with  free of charge, no issue.  But if we're going to turn this into a  commercial partnership, let's really do it.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  This is certainly be a discussion tomorrow with the president  because he has CEOs that he's put on in his Business Roundtable that are  meeting with him tomorrow.  It's reported, I think that Elon Musk and the  Uber CEO among others will be at the meeting.  So I know that this will be  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sadly not the Americans living here to fill these highly skilled  jobs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that goes back to education because they don't have the  skillsets required.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Trump tweeted this last night about his predecessor's  decision to take in refugees from Australia.  He writes this.  Do you  believe it?  The Obama administration agreed to take thousands of illegal  immigrants from Australia.  Why?  I will study this dumb deal.\"</p><p>This coming after Trump reportedly clashed with the Prime Minister of  Australia.  Malcom Turnbull last night during a phone call about this  matter, calling it, \"the worst deal ever.\"</p><p>He accused Turnbull of looking to export the next Boston bombers.  Now,  there's a lot of media reporting about this morning, Peter, that they had a  tense call.  Do you predict this change in the U.S. relationship with  Australia?  And how important was this call?  And how impacts -- </p><p>KIERNAN:  Well I think it was cable setting.  We're basically getting  started, but have you been to Australia?  I mean, there's plenty of rooms  to take a few thousand -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They won't take them, by the way.</p><p>KIERNAN: And the problem is why are they dishing their problem to us?  I  think it was very right and appropriate for the president to say, we're  going to level set.  The relationship now has changed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or do it as a dumb deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  The call happened on Saturday too and that was after the rollout  of the executive order would bungled.  I think even the administration has  acknowledged that.</p><p>So he's probably on edge given the fact that it's been a rough weekend.</p><p>But the one thing that we have to say is the Australian prime minister  reiterated the special relationship.  We work incredibly closely with the  Australians.  Anytime we go to war and in intelligence matters.  It's an  important relationship.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  These refugees are in offshore detention centers right now in  Australia.  And if it's a deal that President Obama inked with Australia,  it's up to the new president to decide whether it's in our best interest.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do we know when that deal was inked?  Remember, President Obama  was doing so much in the final twilight days of his administration?  We'll  get the answer for you.</p><p>We'll take a short break.  When we come back, rumors in retail.  The long  time CEO of Macy's is stepping down.  Now there's talk the struggling  retailer may put itself up for sale.  Macy's on sale.</p><p>And then this little piggy had none.  Bacon lovers fearing a shortage of  their favorite pork product.  Why a price hike might be in store.  Back in  a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Two staffers are being held hostage at a  Delaware maximum-security prison this morning.  Lauren Simonetti on  headlines now.  Lauren, good morning to you.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi.  Good morning, Maria.  Two  Delaware department of correction employees have been held hostage since  last night, as inmates remained in an hour's long standoff with police.</p><p>This incident began when four employees at the correctional center were  taken hostage yesterday morning.  One DOC staff member was released four  hours later, another shortly before 8:00 P. M.</p><p>In a call to the News Journal in Wilmington, one inmate reportedly cited  President Donald Trump as the reason for the hostage situation saying  because of Trump, he quote, \"knows the institution is going to change for  the worse.\"</p><p>Well, an attorney representing state inmates says complaints have increased  in the past year from inmates about substandard medical care in poor  record-keeping.</p><p>Big news in business world.  A reported sale from Macy's is on the table.   Longtime CEO Terry Lundgren stepping down as the head of the largest U. S.  department store within the next few months.  That's the report.</p><p>In an attempt to avoid more shakeup, Lundgren is reportedly considering a  sale of Macy's.  Macy's share in the past year are down about 30 percent.   But this morning if you check out this board, they're up about four percent  on the news.</p><p>And Nielsen mobile insights ranks T-Mobile number one in customer service  satisfaction.  The company beating up Verizon and AT&amp;T as the company to  most likely be recommended as well.  This comes after T-Mobile offers to  covers sales tax on new smartphones.</p><p>The deal will give customers more than 11 percent off of a phone's price if  they're using a prepaid MasterCard.</p><p>All right.  I love this story because I love to look at the video.  For  bacon lovers out there.  Reports of frozen pork belly inventories reaching  their lowest level in 50 years.  Rest assured.  </p><p>Earlier this week, we had a story that that was going to happen.  But  claims of these bacon shortages are unsupported.  Meat processors are  however paying 30 percent more than they did just a few months ago and that  increase might show up shortly at supermarkets.</p><p>But for now, bacon prices are holding steady.  And the USDA reports a pound  of bacon averages actually 11 percent less than they did just back in 2015,  Maria.  So there you have it.  Good morning and that's hogwash.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  I'm glad you got dead end.</p><p>Breaking news right now, Lauren.  We want to show everybody what Donald  Trump has been tweeting.  The president just tweeted this moments ago.  If  UC Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent  people with a different point of view, no federal funds?\"</p><p>Wow, the president is pretty aggressive in terms of coming out and saying,  look, there are consequences for what you're doing.  No federal funding?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that President Trump was watching Fox and Friends first  this morning because Todd Starnes was on and had like a one-minute, two- minute commentary.  That's exactly what Todd Starnes said on Fox and  Friends first roughly an hour ago.</p><p>So I'm not saying that the president is getting his ideas from Mr. Starnes,  but it's exactly what Todd was talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a big issue though.  How much money are we talking  about in terms of what the federal government could hold back for  university?  We don't have those numbers.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  When you at the pictures that you're showing of the protest, it  looks pretty violent.  So I think that Berkeley would argue.  We cancel  that to keep the students safe.  Because it's incredibly violent.  You saw  fires and just watch it for yourself.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How does he get that out of control?  Where is the leadership  to stop it from getting out of control and putting things on fire at a  university?</p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes.  I think it could become a lot calmer.  If you look at how  UC Davis handle it, they just canceled it.  That's a better way to go</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When we come back, what is in a name?  How Elon Musk is  rebranding Tesla motors after closing a new deal.</p><p>And then we've got an eye on earnings this morning.  Facebook beating  expectations last night.  Wall Street's looking for Amazon to deliver next.   We've got the growth story on Amazon coming up.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets looking lower this morning.  But  Facebook certainly one to watch.  Take a look at the shares this morning.   The company reporting a strong fourth quarter last night, easily topping  analysts' expectations.</p><p>Company's revenue up a staggering 51 percent year-over-year in the quarter.   It was not all good news for the company though.  Jury sided against his  Oculus brand in a lawsuit ordering it to pay $500 million to game maker  ZeniMax.</p><p>Joining us \"Wall Street Journal\" chief economic correspondent, Jon  Hilsenrath on that.  Jon, good morning to you.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, CHIEF ECONOMIC CORRESPONDENT, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Good  morning, Maria.  It's all about tech yesterday and today.  We've got Amazon  coming up later.  And it looks like they're going to pump out blowout  numbers too.</p><p>It's amazing to me that you have companies like Facebook and Amazon which  are such a huge scale already.  Amazon with almost 1.9 billion users around  the world and it's pumping out 51 percent revenue growth numbers.  To be  that big and growing that fast is just really transformative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  And we're talking about Amazon a lot because it  is incredibly successful.  Look at the stock today and look at the business  getting into all different industries.  What do you think, Peter?</p><p>KIERNAN:  Well, it's interesting, isn't it?  That the very month that  Amazon takes over from Macy's as the number one seller of apparel, there's  a changing in the guard there.</p><p>And the thing that strikes me is Amazon went public exactly 20 years ago  and that stock is up 42,000 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Since the IPO?</p><p>KIERNAN:  So if you put $1,000 in, it would be $420,000 today.  It's been  an extraordinary company way beyond e-tailing.  And the thing I saw in a  research report recently that I like is, somebody said it's a great company  and by the way, it does not compete with Amazon.</p><p>So it's becoming a benefit not to be in a competitive view of Amazon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It reminds me a lot of Wal-Mart in the night 1990s and that  Wal-Mart wasn't just a retailer.  It became a logistics powerhouse.  The  way it dealt its warehousing networks and technology to move products.   That's what Amazon is really leading the show right now.  They're investing  so much in robotics, in warehousing and getting products to people  overnight.</p><p>They're more than just a retailer.  They're really at the vanguard of  logistics information</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to point out that Wal-Mart actually just rolled out a  free shipping program for every single order and you don't have to like pay  a subscription fee.  Minimum $35 purchase but free two-day shipping to  anybody in the United States.</p><p>So Wal-Mart has enough at least on the retail side to try and compete with  Amazon.  Maybe not the apparel selection, but they're even focused on that.   You saw that over the holidays.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've got to come up with things like free shipping.  They're  on their heels because Amazon is -- and we didn't even talk about original  content.  Those are competing but with movie company.</p><p>KIERNAN:  They're behind Manchester by the Sea and some of the Academy  award nominations.  And so they are really looking at this world in a very  broad gauge.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  Jon Hilsenrath, let me ask you.  Any thoughts from  the fed meeting and what you heard from Janet Yellen yesterday?  And I want  to ask you about this meeting with the president on Friday.  Several CEOs  headed to the White House tomorrow.  JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon among them.   Bob Iger, Walt Disney, Dr. Toby Cosgrove, as well CEO of IBM Ginni Rometty  and Larry Fink from BlackRock.  What do you expecting?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, on the fed meeting, they're in a wait-and-see mode.  And  what I find most interesting and what I've been debating with colleagues  about for the last few days is whether the fed is on a collision course  with Donald Trump.</p><p>Janet Yellen thinks that we're going to have around two percent growth over  the next few years.  Donald Trump wants four percent growth.</p><p>Now, if we get this faster growth is the fed get accommodated?  As far as  what the fed does next, I think really a lot depends on the jobs numbers.   We're going to get pretty good wage growth numbers on jobs on Friday and  that could keep the -- move the fed towards its next rate increase.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we got a great number, that's for sure.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The CEO meeting, this president has made a lot of promises  that he's going cut back regulation and that he's going to achieve tax  reform.</p><p>And I think the market has been very excited about that.  At some point  this year we have to see whether he delivers.  One of the things you have  to think about what this whole visa debate and immigration that's going on  right now, that's more regulation, it's not less regulation.  I wonder what  kind of pushback he's going to get from the CEO meeting on that point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's probably the ones taking points for sure.  Real quick,  Peter.</p><p>KIERNAN:  The one thing that I think is you predicted accurately.  I think  there's going to be a war.  It's coming between Yellen and Trump.  She sees  growth at one-way, he sees another, inflation is coming.  It's going to be  over the dollars that they fight and it's right around the corner.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Jon Hilsenrath, good to see you, sir.  Thank you.   We will see you soon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, former chief executive of ExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson  sworn in as secretary of state yesterday.  But education secretary nominee  Betsy DeVos still facing roadblocks.  We'll get into it next.</p><p>And then striking gold.  How a man from Kansas won Super Bowl tickets for  life.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Welcome back.  We're happy  you're with us.  </p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, February 2.  Your top stories  right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>President Trump's cabinet finally gaining another member -- Rex Tillerson  sworn in as the next secretary of state yesterday after he was approved by  the Senate in a 56 to 43 vote.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is where you were meant  to be, right here today, at this crossroads in history.  It's time to bring  a clear-eyed focus to foreign affairs, to take a fresh look at the world  around us and to seek new solutions grounded in very ancient truths.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The very latest on the continuing confirmations coming up this  morning.  President Trump honors a hero yesterday making an unannounced  trip to receive the remains of the first service member lost during his  presidency.  </p><p>He went with his daughter, Ivanka Trump.  The president just tweeting  moments ago, \"Attending Chief Ryan Owens' dignified transfer with my  daughter, Ivanka, was my great honor.  To a great and brave man, thank  you.\"  </p><p>What is in a name -- why a deal (ph) has decided to take out the motors  coming up?  We will tell you about it.   </p><p>And then the broader market looking like this, futures indicating a lower  opening for the broader averages today.  We're once again on earnings watch  today.  </p><p>And we are one day ahead of the job's numbers out tomorrow.  Dow  Industrials expected down about 50 points, NASDAQ under some selling  pressure as well, down 17 points, although Facebook is trading up, Amazon  expected to report earnings after the close tonight.  </p><p>Take a look at the Eurozone indices right now.  Markets are mixed this  morning in Europe.  The FTSE 100 is up, the DAX index in Germany is down,  all fractional there, FTSE up a third of a percent.  </p><p>In Asia, declines across the board -- take a look -- Nikkei average in  Japan, worst performer, down one and a quarter percent.  Well, this price  is anything but light -- how one canvas (ph) man won Super Bowl tickets for  life -- why we are showing you the Bud Light can when we tell you this,  though, we will explain.  </p><p>And will he or won't he -- we will take you to Pennsylvania later this hour  to see if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow.  Will we get a sooner spring?  </p><p>We will tell you.  Coming up, though, first, Rex Tillerson was sworn in as  secretary of state last night.  President Trump took to Twitter just a few  minutes ago to congratulate him.  </p><p>Here is what President Trump writes, \"Congratulations to Rex Tillerson on  being sworn in as our new secretary of state.  He will be a star.\"  </p><p>This, as Trump's nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos is facing  trouble -- two GOP members saying that they will vote against her.  Joining  us right now is the Forbes Media Chairman and former Republican  presidential candidate himself, Steve Forbes.  </p><p>Steve, good to see you.  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  First, let's -- we've got a  lot to talk to you about.  We want to talk about tax reform as well.  </p><p>But let's talk Betsy DeVos for a moment.  What do you make of these  challenges -- two GOP senators? </p><p>FORBES:  Well, on the case, in the case from the senator of Alaska, Lisa  Murkowski, she owes the National Education Association big time when she  lost the primary in 2010.  She had a successful write-in (ph) campaign to  win the general election.  </p><p>The NEA was critical for that.  They called her that cheat (ph).  And Susan  Collins of Maine, she goes her own way.  </p><p>I think they'll get her through.  If they don't, there's going to be  repercussions in the Republican Party because Betsy is seen as a real  reformer, school reformer. </p><p>If they can't get her through, boy, it's going to be hard to drain the  swamp of our education system.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So why, though?  What are the challenge?  Why are they pushing  back on Betsy DeVos?  </p><p>FORBES:  Because of the fierce opposition of teachers unions.  This will be  the first education secretary since Bill Bennett.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  She didn't realize (ph).</p><p>FORBES:  .back in the Reagan administration.  She knows these fights.   She's very effective in Michigan and Detroit in getting charter schools and  getting real choice.  </p><p>And she exposes the real hypocrisy.  How many members of Congress send  their kids or grandkids to Washington public schools?  Barack Obama didn't  do it.  </p><p>Yet, they're forcing kids to go on failing schools.  It's got to stop.  And  she will do every (AUDIO GAP) to stop.  </p><p>And (ph) she's been through these fights.  That's why they fear.  She's had  experience.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is there anybody -- not to jump the gun, but is there anybody  who would be as much of a reformer as Betsy DeVos if she doesn't get  confirmed, Steve?  Is it a sign -- if she doesn't get confirmed, is it a  sign that the stranglehold and the kind of cartel that the unions have put  together in Washington will never be broken? </p><p>FORBES:  Yes, there are.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that is the ward, cartel.  </p><p>FORBES:  And it is a cartel -- bad cartel.  And there are good people out  there who have made some reforms in states like Arizona and elsewhere.  </p><p>But if she -- if Betsy DeVos goes down, it says the union is predominant.   And you've got elections coming up next year.  </p><p>Watch out Democrats because we will primary you if you even think of  supporting a real reformer.  So they -- and Republicans fear the NEA,  National Education Association as well.  </p><p>So the Trump administration has got to use (ph) political capital, get this  thing through because she also -- Betsy DeVos is a major figure in the  Republican Party.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.  </p><p>FORBES:  If you can't take care of your own big supporters who have done a  lot of work for the party, who've been pushing reforms that you like, what  does that say about other fights that are coming up? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But even more than that, she's got the goods.  I mean, she's a  school reformer.  </p><p>FORBES:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>FORBES:  A record of reform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead, Morgan. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Do you think this has anything to do with her somewhat shaky  performance when she went for her confirmation hearing?  Because we have  seen people like Rex Tillerson and Mnuchin who have not had to go through  the confirmation process before, who gave really excellent testimony before  the Hill, were incredibly well-prepared.  </p><p>I think even her, you know, fiercest allies would say it was a shaky  performance.  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes, but what -- what that does is simply give a cover for what  was going to happen anyway.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right (ph).  </p><p>FORBES:  The NEA knows this is a big, big battle.  And they are going to  find any excuse for their husband or her -- anything they could latch onto  to find an excuse to say, kill this nomination.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Do you see this as the existential threat to the teachers union?   And do you think Mike Pence is going to have to step in and save the day  here? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we've got these two, you get 50-50 and then Mike Pence  would -- would -- would lead.  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes, well, Pence will be glad to do it.  He -- he's been fighting  these battles.  </p><p>He was governor of Indiana.  He was in Congress before that.  So he  absolutely knows what these stakes are.  </p><p>And with high technology coming along, reformers now have more weapons to  break this monopoly.  And so I think the -- the unions know they've got to  try to stop this.  </p><p>And that's why they've -- even on the state level, they fight fiercely any  kind of reform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on judge Gorsuch?  Yesterday's meeting about  the Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump encouraged  Senate Republicans to go nuclear to get the nominee approved.  Listen to  this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  If we end up with a Senate gridlock that they've had in Washington  for the last -- longer than eight years, in all fairness to President  Obama, a lot longer than eight years, but if we end up with that gridlock,  I would say, if you can, Mitch, go nuclear, because that would be an  absolute shame if a man of this quality was caught up in the web (ph).  So  I would say it is up to Mitch.  </p><p>But I would say go for it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Trump also saying he would support the approval of Gorsuch with  51 votes instead of the traditional 60 that are required.  That's the  nuclear option.  </p><p>Steve, what do -- what do you think? </p><p>FORBES:  This is a case where that might not be necessary because in the  case of Gorsuch, one, he is so well-qualified.  What I like about him, for  example, is his understanding of the threat of what they call the  administrative regulatory state, where agencies make laws instead of  Congress.  </p><p>And -- but the Democrats are going to have a hard time really getting real  traction against him.  And it doesn't change the real composition of the  Supreme Court.  </p><p>So I think they -- they could peel off enough Democrats because the  Democrats are going to want to preserve the filibuster if the (ph)  nomination comes up that could -- could change the complex of the Supreme  Court, the ideological complexion.  They want to save it for that, to break  that nominee who is so well-qualified, who doesn't change the composition  of the court, they are probably going to save their power (ph) for another  day.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before we move on, could we talk about tax reform for a moment?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes (ph).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, we were all in on tax reform.  And we thought that this  was happening sooner rather than later.  </p><p>Now, we're talking about a tax package, reform package, second half of the  year.  And we're talking about a border adjustment tax.  </p><p>Steve Forbes, where are we on this? </p><p>FORBES:  This is where President Trump is going to have to step in and say,  enough of this other stuff.  We've got to get these nominees through and  all that good stuff.  </p><p>But we're here as a tax package.  Move on it.  And this so-called border  adjustment tax, which is a national sales tax in imports -- hugely  destructive to this economy.  </p><p>Leave it out.  Go for a pure tax cut package, cut tax rates, do some  simplification, ram it through and make it retroactive through January 1.   Politically.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what he promised us.  </p><p>FORBES:  And he's got to move on it because politically, if people don't  feel right away that this new president is delivering on a better economy,  better paychecks, new investments coming, they're going to have a much  harder time as opposition gains ground against this administration.  He's  got to understand that his opponents are out -- talk about nuclear, to  destroy him in an impeachment.  </p><p>And he'd better get as much political capital, a good economy as Bill  Clinton discovered does wonders when you get in trouble.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's -- that's the whole -- that's the whole game plan from  the Democrats, is to bog this president down.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  .at -- at every turn and bait him rather than focusing on making  people's lives better.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" put it so brilliantly in  its editorial page about a week ago that every decision out of that White  House has to be scrubbed with does it help grow the economy, does it  improve people's lives, does it grow their wages, period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was his priority the whole campaign.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Growth, growth, growth.  But my worry is it's not just the  Democrats.  It's Paul Ryan.  </p><p>He's in the border adjustment tax in the GOP plan.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, it is.  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  From last year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  From last year.  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  And then this is what's so strong.  You know, the EPA was  doing its job but find out why it is that people like Paul Ryan go to  Washington and then come up with this kind of cool aid (ph) tax increase.  </p><p>And you know, what are they drinking down there, breathing (ph) down there?   It's a destructive tax.  Leave it out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will they, though, do?  I mean, I know what you're.</p><p>FORBES:  FORBES:  They -- they -- they.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  recommending.  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes, they.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that's where this is going? </p><p>FORBES:  You know, this is where the president has to step in and say, cut  it out, leave it out.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  I think the cooler (ph) heads, when he meets with the CEOs today,  are going to say, this thing is destructive to what you're trying to do.   Cut the corporate tax rate.  </p><p>Go with the pure basis he came up.  And that will drive the economy.  </p><p>FORBES:  This is so bizarre.  They say, well, other countries hurt their  consumers with the sales taxes.  We should do the same thing.  No.  </p><p>It doesn't (ph) make this difference.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said that yesterday about -- Steve, I was like, here is Steve  Forbes on the border adjustment tax.  It's horrible.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Of course, you don't speak that way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just no.  Great stuff.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>FORBES:  Thank you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve Forbes there.  We want to bring you this tweet -- the  president just tweeting again.  Here is what he said this morning.  </p><p>\"Iran has been formally put on notice for firing a ballistic missile.   Should have been thankful for the terrible deal with the U.S. made with  them.  </p><p>Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along  and gave it a lifeline in the form of the Iran deal, a hundred and $50  billion,\" yes, in cash.  We will have more on this at the top of the hour.  </p><p>President Trump tweeting about Iran and -- and this most recent upset --  we'll get into it next.  Coming up, reaching new speeds -- AT&amp;T announcing  its ultra-fast wireless network is coming to U.S. cities later this year.  </p><p>We will tell you where.  And then Beyonce breaking the internet -- the  pregnancy announcement that everybody is talking about this morning, back  in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Want to show you markets this morning.  We're  looking at a lower opening for the broader averages.  </p><p>Take a look -- Dow Industrials down about 50 points.  We do have the jobs  number out tomorrow for the month of January.  </p><p>A couple of names we're watching -- AT&amp;T, announcing plans to launch its 5G  wireless services in two cities this year.  These rollouts will take place  in Austin and Indianapolis and will offer speeds nearly 40 times faster  than standard cellular service.  </p><p>AT&amp;T stock up nearly 70 percent year-over-year.  We're watching Abercrombie  &amp; Fitch.  The company has named Fran Horowitz as its new CEO.  </p><p>Horowitz will be Abercrombie's first CEO since Michael Jeffries stepped  down.  That was in 2014.  Abercrombie's stock down 56 percent over the last  year, as you can see from that one-year chart.  President Trump and  daughter, Ivanka, made an unannounced trip to Dover Air Force Base  yesterday to honor the returning remains of a U.S. Navy SEAL killed in a  weekend raid in Yemen.  </p><p>Lauren Simonetti with details now.  </p><p>Lauren?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Hi, Maria.  William \"Ryan\" Owens from Peoria, Illinois, died in  the raid.  And Trump met with the Owens family during his two-hour visit to  the base.  </p><p>Owens was the first known U.S. combat casualty in a mission ordered by the  new president.  Three other service members were wounded. </p><p>And more than a half a dozen militant suspects were also killed in that  raid in al-Qaeda compound.  The dead included the eight-year-old daughter  of a radical clerk and U.S. citizen who was killed by a drone strike six  years ago.  </p><p>Well, Tesla Motors is dropping the motors.  The name changed to Tesla Inc.,  shows the company's ambitions to move beyond just selling high-end electric  cars and shifting into energy products like solar panels and home  batteries.  </p><p>Tesla agreed to buy Solar City, if you remember, for over two and a half  billion dollars back in November.  Well, here is one beer run that won't be  forgotten ever.  </p><p>Over the holidays, this guy, Lyle Randa, of Wichita, Kansas, he ran out to  buy some Bud Light during a family party.  And as he was restocking cans  from the pack into the refrigerator, he noticed that one was gold, meaning  that he was eligible for Bud Light's Super Bowl tickets for life  sweepstakes.  </p><p>Well, as luck would have it, Randa was actually chosen from 37,000 people  to win the grand prize -- Super Bowl tickets for the rest of his life.  And  he is now on his way to Houston for Super Bowl 51 on Sunday right here on  Fox.  </p><p>And finally, check this out, Beyonce shattering even more records with this  photo on Instagram, revealing the news that she is expecting twins.  This  picture is now the most liked post of all time, receiving over seven and a  half million likes since yesterday.  </p><p>Selena Gomez previously held that title.  She had over six million likes  for that photo with the lyrics of her song on the Coke bottle.  </p><p>But back to Beyonce's picture, I don't get the getup.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I don't get it (ph).</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Veil, the flowers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  And the -- and the veil. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Can anybody help me out? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's -- that's her pregnant with twins.  That's me after  lunch.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I don't think so, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm not wearing that.  I'm taking (ph) the photo of it.   But.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The immaculate conception. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, wow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations, Beyonce.  Coming up, it is Groundhog day.   Those who plan to celebrate in Punxsutawney may want to crawl in a hole  when they see their hotel bill -- how prices rival those in Houston for the  Super Bowl.  </p><p>Yes, back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is Groundhog day today.  That means it is  that time of the year when the country watches to find out whether we will  have an early spring or six more miserable weeks of cold and snow.  </p><p>Fox News meteorologist, Janice Dean, is live this morning in Punxsutawney,  Pennsylvania.  </p><p>Hey, Janice.  </p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria.  We are live in  Punxsutawney.  This is my first Groundhog Day here.  </p><p>And it is exciting.  Phil is going to come out at 7:25 Eastern time.  Will  it be an early spring?  </p><p>We don't know.  But John Griffiths (ph) is here with me.  He is an official  Punxsutawney Phil handler.  </p><p>John, what do you think -- early spring today?  Can you give me any  indication? </p><p>JOHN GRIFFITHS, HANDLER, GROUNDHOG CLUB:  I -- we have no way of knowing  until he comes out of the stump.  He -- we -- we do not have a preconceived  notion on what it's going to be.  </p><p>DEAN:  Now, here is what I hear.  Phil is always right.  He is always  right.  But what happens -- sometimes, the media gets it wrong.  </p><p>And they say he's wrong.  </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  Well, mostly, it's our president.  He may misinterpret every  now and again.  </p><p>He's -- he's not quite fluent in groundhog ease (ph).  </p><p>DEAN:  Groundhog ease (ph) that he speaks. </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  Groundhog ease, absolutely.  </p><p>DEAN:  A lot of people don't speak that.  So it gets lost in translation.  </p><p>GRIFFITH:  First (ph), one person, our president, yes.  </p><p>DEAN:  OK, so tell me what your job is to handle.  </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  Basically, it's -- for this morning, it's to pull him out of  the stump and hold him up for the adoring fans.  </p><p>DEAN:  Yes.  </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  And then my partner will take him onto the stub (ph) and we'll  get his prediction.  Other than that, it's 365 days of feeding him and  cleaning his cage or zoo and.</p><p>DEAN:  And what about Mrs. Punxsutawney? </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  He does have a wife, Phyllis.  And she stays with them at -- at  the burrow, which is their zoo downtown.  </p><p>DEAN:  You know what I heard?  I heard that if he sees his shadow, it's six  more weeks of winter.  If he sees his wife, it's six more groundhogs.  </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  Could be.  </p><p>DEAN:  So 7:25.  This is a huge crowd here.  And I wanted to point out that  the -- the hotels here at Punxsutawney are more expensive than they are at  the Super Bowl.  </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  Yes, they are.  So that report myself, it kind of shocked me.   But you have to remember, we only have two in town so.</p><p>DEAN:  How many people are you expecting here today? </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.  </p><p>DEAN:  How many people are you expecting here today? </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  Really, we never know because a lot of people come in from out  of the area.  They stay in surrounding towns.  </p><p>So we never know what's going to be here.  But I'll tell you what, it's a  great Thursday crowd here this morning, a lot bigger than what we  anticipated.  </p><p>DEAN:  More (ph) awesome.  </p><p>And the weather here, Maria, we're -- we're getting big fat snowflakes  right now.  So I don't know, maybe another six more weeks of winter.  We'll  have to find out.  </p><p>But of course, we'll give you the details when Phil comes out at 7:25  Eastern time.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look at -- look at those gloves you're sporting.  You are  having the best time.  </p><p>It's amazing how many people are coming out for this, Janice.  And you just  said a minute ago that the hotel tickets are even more expensive than the  Super Bowl.  </p><p>But you're also being honored, right, into the Weather Discovery Center  Hall of Fame.  Wow, what an honor.  </p><p>Congratulations, Janice.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Yey, Janice.  </p><p>DEAN:  Thank you.  Oh, thanks, Maria.  Thank you.  What an -- what an honor  to be here today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching you, Janice.  Thanks so much.  We want to  know, Fox News (ph) meteorologist and author of the children's book,  \"Freddie the Frogcaster,\" and the \"Terrible Tornado.\"  </p><p>Thank you, Janice.  We will get back to you to see Punxsutawney Phil and  whether or not he sees the shadow.  He has not seen the shadow 18 times in  decades.  </p><p>All right, coming up, we are shaking things up with cocktails you can put  in your pocket, next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  You'll want to check it  out.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Welcome back.  Thanks so  much for joining us this morning.  </p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, February 2.

Later this hour, he  is headed to the National Prayer Breakfast.  </p><p>We will bring it to you live.  There he is, going this -- yesterday, with  his daughter.  We will bring you that story, coming up.  </p><p>This, as key policy issues come into play -- new details on how long it  will take to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, as the president  calls out bad hombres.  Meanwhile, the president tweeting on Iran this  morning.  </p><p>Here is what he says, \"Iran has been formally put on notice for firing a  ballistic missile.  Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the  U.S. made with them.\"  </p><p>He is echoing sentiments from national security adviser, General Michael  Flynn.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MICHAEL FLYNN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  Iran continues to threaten U.S.  friends and allies in the region.  The Obama administration failed to  respond adequately to Tehran's maligned actions, including weapons  transfer, support for terrorism and other violations of international  norms.  </p><p>The Trump administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine  security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East  and place -- which places American lives at risk.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are taking a closer look.

Thank you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Always so much to talk about -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Donald Trump, President of the United States -- tweeting,  tweeting, tweeting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tweeting, tweeting this morning on Iran, on -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The UC Berkeley protest.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- UC Berkeley protest.  That's what I was thinking of.   Well that was a horrible story, wasn't it?  We're going to get into it this  morning.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, the director of Center -- for the  Center for Politics at the University of Virginia Larry Sabato is with us.   The chief investment officer of CalPERS Ted Eliopoulos is here.  And Ohio  Congressman Tim Ryan, who of course, tried to go up against Nancy Pelosi  and lost that fight.  Former NFL star Jack Brewer also with us.  </p><p>Big hour ahead so stay right there with us ahead this morning.</p><p>We kick it off right now with the Trump administration, intensifying its  efforts to secure the southern border in spite of challenges.  President  Trump warned the Mexican president in a phone call that he was ready to  send U.S. troops to stop quote, \"bad hombres\" unless the Mexican military  takes action to control them, according to excerpts of a transcript  obtained by the Associated Press.</p><p>This is coming as Department of Homeland Security Secretary General John  Kelly sat down in an exclusive interview with Fox News' Catherine Herridge  to spell out a time line for that border wall.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEN. JOHN KELLY, U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  I think it'll be  built where it's needed most first and then fill it in.  </p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  Ok.</p><p>KELLY:  That's how I'm looking at it.  I really hope to have it done within  the next two years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is former Minnesota governor, Tim  Pawlenty.  Governor -- good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  </p><p>TIM PAWLENTY (R), FORMER MINNESOTA GOVERNOR:  Good morning.  Good to be  with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's your take of the efforts to secure the border and  what a time line might look like?  How do you see it?</p><p>PAWLENTY:  Well, if you're going to have a country you've got to have  border integrity.  We don't on the southern border.  And I think enforcing  the border through a variety of means including enhancing with a wall is  appropriate.  And it's also good negotiating leverage, by the way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In terms of paying for it obviously, Governor, that's the  issue.  How do you see that working out?  I mean is this going to turn into  and escalate into a fight between the U.S. and Mexico since Donald Trump  has been pretty adamant in terms of Mexico paying for that wall.  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  It may turn into a fight or have a relationship tension but  think of the size and magnitude of it and the unilateral authority that  Donald Trump possesses.  The estimates for the wall range from $10 billion  to maybe as much $20 billion but spread over a number of years.  That's a  large number but in the context of federal spending it really isn't.</p><p>And by the way, Donald Trump can unilaterally impose surcharges, tariffs or  other potential taxes at the border that would allow him to claim Mexico is  either directly or indirectly paying for the wall.  So he's got a lot of  leverage to implement this as he's suggested or threatened.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but that's the thing.  I mean this whole idea of an import  tax -- we have been talking a lot about it.  Do you agree with that because  we are trying to -- to see how he's going to implement his campaign promise  which is lower taxes?  You know, border adjustment tax flies right in the  face of that.</p><p>And I don't know.  How does that jive with what you're talking about in  terms of tax on Mexico products?  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  Well, I think you have to look at it this way -- in terms of the  revenues and the cost and the advantages.  The border adjustment tax or so- called BAT tax has been estimated depending on how you do it and how large  it is to raise as much as a trillion dollars over ten years.  There's a lot  of potential concern about the BAT tax but it is unquestionably a very  large revenue raiser.  </p><p>Grover Norquist has said if you then cut other taxes by at least that much  or more. so the net effect of the tax reform is neutral or positive in  terms of cutting taxes, that at least he would find it acceptable as a net  tax cut.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  You know, Governor, I have a question.  Just -- </p><p>PAWLENTY:  Yes.</p><p>KIERNAN:  -- when you look at it, it's 1,900-miles, some of it forbidden  landscape, very tricky.  How are we going to build that out over any kind  of reasonable time period?  Or will there be walls in some part and then  virtual walls, if you will, or heavily guarded?  How do you see that  unfolding?  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  As you know much of the border does have a wall on it already;  much of it does not.  Some of the remaining terrain as you mentioned is  very difficult including semi-mountainous regions and other problems.  And  by the way there's some land ownership rights in Texas as well along the  border so you're going to have to deal with some eminent domain issues as a  practical matter if they are really going to complete the effort in a  couple of years.</p><p>some of it is probably going to have to be physical structure, some of it  maybe drones, some of it may be electronics, some of it maybe more human  resources.  But obviously he's going to make a big piece of progress here  in the next 24 months.  And I think he's going to do it.  He's got the  ability to pay for it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is -- Governor, it's is Dagen McDowell -- this is one of  myriad issues that the Trump administration has tackled just in his first  little more than a week in the White House.  Do you worry given -- because  some things have gone well, some things not like the executive order on  some immigration, it wasn't rolled out with care, if you will.</p><p>Do you worry that this White House is getting bogged down with too many  things and that kind of central promise of tax reform and growing the  economy might be on the back burner?  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  I think you wouldn't describe his first week as bogged down.   You might describe it as hyper-energetic.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I just was talking about bogged down with tax reform --  that's it.  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  I understand.  I think that is a potential concern because that  is one of the main things and as has been said, you want to keep the main  things the main things.  I think the proof will be in the pudding if you  fast forward nine or 12 months if tax reform gets done, nobody is going to  remember that they were a little off message or a little off focus in week  number one or week number two.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe not but the whole border tax -- border adjustment tax,  rather -- has that muddied the waters?  I mean has this become more  complicated than was promised?</p><p>PAWLENTY:  Keep in mind, it's the House Republicans that came up -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>PAWLENTY:  -- primarily with the border adjustment tax.  Donald Trump  actually was somewhat concerned about it a few weeks ago.  He has since  maybe has warmed up or his team has warmed up to it a little bit.  And  again Maria -- the trick is how do you do it?  The border adjustment tax  has got a lot of critics including people who think it's a camel's nose  under the tent to a VAT tax or a value-added tax.  </p><p>But again, until you see the other side of the ledger, the tax cut that  people are going to get, especially everyday Americans who are middle  income, in exchange for having to bear the burden of the BAT tax, let's  just see the other side of the ledger on the relief.  You really can't say  whether the package overall is a good idea or not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So do you think we will get tax reform this year  then -- Governor?  I mean that's what we are all wondering.  Because now we  are expecting that we know what it looks like in the first 200 days but  we're going to see implementation second half of the year.  Is that what  you think?  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  I think so.  Look, the Republican Congress and the leaders have  been salivating over tax reform for a decade.  This is their brief --  hopefully not brief but their shining moment to get it done.  And if they  don't, that's going to be a very big, you know, F on the report card.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're absolutely right.  I mean, you know, Kevin McCarthy and  Paul Ryan continue to say, look, we know what this window of opportunity  is, we are not going the waste it.</p><p>Let me switch gears -- Governor.  We want to ask you about Iran.  The White  House taking a strong stance against Iran after it tested ballistic  missiles in a show of aggression.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEN. MIKE FLYNN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  President Trump has severely  criticized the various agreements reached between Iran and the Obama  administration as well as the United Nations as being weak and ineffective.   Instead of being thankful to the United States in these agreements, Iran is  now feeling emboldened.  As of today, we are officially putting Iran on  notice.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"On notice\" -- Governor.  And then President Trump tweeted out  this morning, here is what he said in his tweet today.  \"Iran has been  formally put on notice for firing a ballistic missile.  Should have been  thankful for the terrible deal that the U.S. made with them.  Iran was on  its last leg and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a  lifeline in the form of the Iran deal, $150 billion in cash.\"</p><p>The administration's next step against the country obviously still to be  determined, Governor, what does that mean to you, \"put on notice\"?  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  I think putting on notice that we are not going to tolerate  their menacing behavior and their violations of U.N. resolutions and  treaties is a good thing.  And frankly it's long overdue.</p><p>Iran has been engaged in menacing behavior with respect to U.S. military  assets in the region, our allies' assets in the region.  They've been  flirting with violating the nuclear treaty.  They've been thumbing their  nose at U.N. resolutions including the ballistic missile resolution.  And  they've been coddled.</p><p>And bullies respect strength and not weakness and I think a declared  statement from President Trump and General Flynn is long overdue and  exactly on point.  And they only will respect strength.  And they didn't  see that unfortunately in the Obama administration.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Governor -- I couldn't agree with you more on the importance of  setting a new tone with Iran and what this new administration will do.   When you look at the JCPOA, the Iran deal, it's a multiparty agreement.   It's not a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and Iran.</p><p>So what are the practical steps that you think that the President and his  team can take to either can they amend this deal or what can they do going  forward to have it more than just putting them on notice?  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  Well, they can do a number of things.  First of all, if they are  trying to warm up our relationships with Russia, Russia has very important  relationships with Iran.  So exploring how Russia could be helpful in this  dynamic maybe of some value, although I'm skeptical of Russia as well.</p><p>Number two, when Iran does things like take runs at our ships in the  region, you have to tell them, you do that again, we are going to light you  up.  We're going to fire back.  Or we're going to fire at you.</p><p>And next when you violate the ballistic missile treaty, we are going to put  sanctions on.  And if the world community won't do it, we will do it  ourselves as the U.S.  But I think you've got to work with the allies and  try to get everybody to do it.</p><p>And then lastly, you have to look them in the eye and say if you violate  that nuclear treat, there are going to be more consequences. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PAWLENTY:  But this idea that -- we have agreements that nobody enforces  means the agreements themselves don't mean anything and that becomes a very  dangerous world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is President Trump doing so far in your view -- Governor?  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  Well, I was a Trump supporter.  I became a skeptic after some of  the revelations during his campaign.  But I have to say he's off to a  strong start.  And I'm hopeful for how he does from here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Governor -- good to see you.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>PAWLENTY:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor Tim Pawlenty there.</p><p>Coming up next, IBM super computer Watson using its smarts to file your  taxes -- how it can help you find deductions that you may have missed.  </p><p>And then one secret McDonald item coming out of hiding -- the fan favorite  sweet treat that is now officially on the menu.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>A mysterious military vehicle that carried a large Trump flag in Kentucky  belongs to the Navy.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti has the story now with other headlines -- Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey Maria.  </p><p>So a Navy official reportedly saying this vehicle spotted on Sunday flying  a blue Trump flag near Louisville was from a Navy Seal unit.

Your child is happy to see you.  Are you not  happy to see your child?\"</p><p>It goes on from there.  The woman told Fox News that she completely agrees  with the message.

Well, it went viral and has now been shared on Facebook more than 1.2  million times.</p><p>St. Patrick's day right around the corner which means it's McDonalds  shamrock shake season.  And this year there's something new.  The shamrock  shake has been a seasonal favorite at Mickey D for 40 years now but this  year you can get a chocolate shamrock shake.  Up to now you have to ask a  McDonald's staffer to add chocolate if they would do it.  It was at their  discretion, but now it's regular menu item during the season.  McCafe  Shamrock Chocolate Shake is the original Shamrock shake mixed with  chocolate syrup and topped off with mint sprinkles, whipped cream and a  cherry.  McDonalds is also adding a Shamrock chocolate chip Frappe and a  shamrock hot chocolate and shamrock mocha.  That's a lot of shamrocks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.  Too much chocolate.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.  Too much chocolate -- that's a sugar rush for me.  But  you can only get it for a limited time, so if you're interested, go soon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  Have you tried it -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've had a shamrock shake years ago but like -- I generally try  to stay away from things that if you drink one glass of it, it's basically  your daily caloric intake.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Not to mention green teeth all day.  That's a set back.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you mean?  It's like 3,000 calories or something?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, it's not 3,000.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  2,000.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Generally it's just -- I'm not a milk shake kind of gal.  I  would rather eat like a piece of cake.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  With green dye in there.</p><p>We are taking a look at the markets next; IPO market in particular.  What  to expect from Snap upcoming.</p><p>Public debut -- we are seeing a couple more IPO's after a long stretch of  weakness there.</p><p>And then we are just minutes away from Punxsutawney Phil's Groundhog Day  prediction.  How long do you expect winter to last?  We will tell you next  in Pennsylvania, live. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Listen to this.  Punxsutawney Phil is about to make his  prediction.  Let's take a look.</p><p>[LIVE COVERAGE OF PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL] </p><p>KIERNAN:  They're done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  As expected -- we are live in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania and we  just saw the program take place where the groundhog saw his shadow.  That  means six more weeks of winter is expected.  And we thought we were going  to get an early spring.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  I was ready to sign up for it, yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Dagen, can I stay with you in Miami for a weekend?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Unfortunately we work here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Signs of life meanwhile in the IPO market.  Invitation Homes  started trading yesterday.  That was the largest offering in over a year.   But the IPO Wall Street is waiting for the IPO is Snapchat -- that filing  expected any day now.</p><p>Joining us right now is Deven Parekh.  He's managing director at Insight  Venture Partners.  Good to see you -- Deven.  Thank you so much for joining  us.</p><p>DEVEN PAREKH, INSIGHT VENTURE PARTNERS:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How would you characterize the IPO market right now?  You  invest in private companies?  </p><p>PAREKH:  Correct.</p><p>So the IPO market in 2016 was very weak.  It was the weakest since the  financial crisis.  But I think you saw signs of life at the end of 2016,  you're starting to see strength early in the year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think Snap sort of snaps everything out of it?  I mean  is that the kind of deal that could get the action moving again in the IPO  market?</p><p>PAREKH:  I think the answer is yes, if you look back two weeks.  You had  AppDynamics which was about to go public and got taken out by Cisco.  It  basically doubled the price of the projected IPO price.  That, I think gave  people a lot of confidence that investors and companies are still looking  for growth.</p><p>The real problem in the IPO market if you look back really is more of a  supply problem than a demand problem.  If you talk to public investors,  they are still very interested in investing in growth.  </p><p>If you take the Internet category, to use Snapchat as an example, there's  164 public Internet companies between a billion and $10 billion dollar  market cap, only nine of them have a growth rate of greater than 30  percent. So there's just not a lot of things to invest in at scale which you need if  you're a large investor.  And Snapchat clearly fulfills that requirement. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting because you would think that when you're  looking for growth it's in tech.</p><p>PAREKH:  It is in tech but if you look at scale, lots of smaller companies  but scale companies, again, between the market capital of a billion and $10  billion, only nine companies to invest in.  Software -- same metrics, only  eight companies to invest in.</p><p>KIERNAN:  So Deven, you talked about a kind of dull period in '15 and '16.   After 2014 was $86 billion, $88 billion, is Snapchat which could be the  second largest U.S. tech IPO ever.  Is it going to be that kind of  triggering event that lights up the market again?  </p><p>PAREKH:  I think it's going to get credit for doing that but I think it was  happening anyway.  What I mean by that is if you look at the IPO backlog  for software and Internet companies, it's growing.  If you talk to any  investment banker you're going to hear that they are busier than they have  been in a very long time, getting companies ready.  We have a lot in our  portfolio really going right now.</p><p>Snapchat because they'll end up having been the first major one, I think  AppDynamics might have gotten a lot of the credit had they gone up and  traded up 100 percent.  Because Snapchat is the next major it'll likely get  the credit but the fundamentals going into 2017 were pretty strong for the  IPO market regardless.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  There's a report out on Re/Code that five of the major tech  companies among others -- Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Uber, Stripe -- are  writing a letter and they're going to give it to the President opposing the  immigration ban which I think this would be the first formal letter from  CEOs that are from the tech community to the President on this policy.   What's your take on that?  </p><p>PAREKH:  Well, I think if you look at the tech industry, we have a huge  demand for skilled workers particularly around, you know, coding and areas.   And I think if you talk to anybody in the tech industry they would tell you  that they want to solve a long-term structural problem that we have which  is we don't have enough domestic pipeline of that talent.</p><p>That, however, is not a problem we are going to solve in a month or two.   And so to put a -- to put a ban in place that potentially stops these  companies from hiring people that are in this country, often educated in  this country, and make it not possible for them to work here, I don't think  it's long-term good for the growth of those companies which I think is  frankly not long-term good for the growth of the overall economy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do these companies though realize because the leadership and a  lot of the executives in Silicon Valley were adamantly opposed to Donald  Trump as the presidential candidate.  They actively raised a lot of money  for Hillary Clinton, but now they're caught.</p><p>Do they realize -- are they in Washington trying to hire people who have  better relationships with the GOP and within the Trump administration?   I've heard that from people that these companies -- because they had an  easy ride in terms of policy with the Obama administration, now they're  worried.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  They are trying to hire conservatives.  </p><p>PAREKH:  Look -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Google was hiring like a conservative liaison before -- after  the election.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is media.  Look at NBC News and look at CNN.  </p><p>PAREKH:  I think all these companies understand that elections have  consequences -- right.  And the policy framework going into this  administration is not going to be the same.  They are going to try to no  doubt build relationships and hire people with more conservative  credentials to deal with the administration.  I don't think there's a  debate there.</p><p>I also don't think there's a debate that these companies have about  improving national security.  I think this is really the tech folks in  particular talking about an area where there's massive supply and demand  imbalance between the talent that we need and the talent that's available.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes.  And even if you exceed that, something in me tightens at  the notion of having a few less programmers from Yemen and Syria and some  of these countries.  I don't think this is a robust supply, so something  about their totality doesn't work for me that I don't think that's where  the real talent they're looking for is coming from.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  </p><p>PAREKH:  Right.  And I think if you think though -- I think the broader  concern is -- I mean the policies haven't come out yet but looks like  there's going to be reevaluation of how H1-Bs work as well.  And that's  probably where the real problem lies for most of these companies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How should it look?  </p><p>PAREKH:  Well look, the H1-B program was basically created to make sure  that if you had talent that was not readily available in the U.S., that  that talent could come here and be gainfully employed.  And I think the  concerns that some have had is that H1 visas have been gamed and that  people have been coming here that where there are people that are in this  country that could provide the same service.</p><p>I'm not saying that there's not some cases of that, I'm sure there is.  But  in total that's not the case.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are cases where companies, and we've heard about it on  this very program, where companies will bring in overseas workers on H1-B  visas and they will have the existing employees who are in the United  States train these people and then fire them.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are certainly instances -- </p><p>PAREKH:  Yes.  I'm not going -- I'm not going to say -- and I don't think I  or anybody in the tech industry is for that from a policy standpoint.  So  if we can solve that, I don't think anyone is going to dispute that.</p><p>But I think there's a broader -- there's a broader issue around  particularly in some of the highly-skilled areas, we just don't have enough  people graduating in those programs in this country.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  That's the problem, right.  I mean that's the fundamental  problem.  </p><p>PAREKH:  That's absolutely a problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Once again it goes back to education.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Half a million unfilled jobs according to the CEO of GoDaddy.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes.  And if we can fill up these and just sell 50,000 of those,  if the companies want them so much, why don't you ask the companies to pay  for it.  If you want that visa slot, by the way, that person can train the  young person from the United States.  You can put all kinds of hooks into  it to make sure that it makes sense for the American people.  </p><p>PAREKH:  Look, I think there's lots of different solutions.  I think the  concern right now is that we are going towards -- we're going towards a  policy framework which is trying to stop this type of immigration in total.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We will see what that meeting and the letter  looks like from these technology CEOs.</p><p>Deven, good to have you on the show today.</p><p>PAREKH:  Good to have me.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Deven Parekh joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, more immigration business on tap for the Trump administration --  the executive order that could be reexamining the visa programs.  We will  get more on that coming up next.</p><p>And then cocktails to go -- how you can shake up something, so exciting for  your flask.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy Thursday.

This is off of the lowest of the morning nonetheless firmly in the  red.  NASDAQ down about 13 points.  In Europe, markets are mixed right now,  take a look at the euro zone averages and you see that the FTSE and the  CAC40 are both positive.  FTSE100 gaining strength in the last half an  hour, up two-thirds of one percent now, that's 40 points higher.  The DAX  Index still negative, that's just down by a fraction.

We will have more on that coming up.  We  kick it off this half an hour though with the president and his stance on  religious issues.</p><p>The president is expected to speak at the National Prayer Breakfast today.   The Trump Administration released this statement earlier saying, \"The  president is proud to have been the first ever G.O.P. nominee to mention  the L.G.B.T.Q. community in his nomination acceptance speech.  Pledging  then to protect the community from violence and oppression.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is the Washington Times Columnists, Charles Hurt.   Charles, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>CHARLES HURT, WASHINGTON TIMES COLUMNIST:  Good to see you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well it's true.  I mean the president had the opportunity to  firm up his stance on L.G.B.T.Q. rights today and he was the first G.O.P.er  to come out and have Peter Thiel for example have such a big spotlight  during his campaign.  What are you expecting from this breakfast?</p><p>HURT:  Well this is always a sort of a bipartisan affair and I expect -- I  would hope that this year would be no different.</p><p>But I think that Donald Trump has done a very good job.  He's not  particularly known as a particularly overtly religious guy but he has done  a very good job of pinpointing the importance of religious liberty and I  think that that is why he was able to win over so many religious  conservatives in the election and he's done it largely by putting all these  social issues and just sort of putting them off the side and focusing on  things that people actually care about and no matter what your background  you end up supporting these things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean look, we'll take the audience there live when he  start speaking.  But even more of a headline this morning is the draft of  an executive order calling to reexamine a range of these programs, right?</p><p>And this new report is saying that they want to prioritize both jobs and  wages of the American workers, we do not have a specific industry that's  being pointed out here but it is rattling some firms, what's your take on  that particularly technology firms?</p><p>HURT:  Yes.  I was fascinated by your conversation earlier about this.  We  talk about -- these company executives talk about degree and workers from  overseas and all that's great, important but what about the untapped talent  in America in terms of -- of course, it would require education or it  requires looking at social policies, it require -- it's much more difficult  but wouldn't it be a lot better for America if we actually train people in  this country who are already Americans to do a lot of these jobs?</p><p>But, of course, politicians don't want to do that because they're always  looking for the easier path.  The second thing is on -- Donald Trump, he's  not -- not only is he not overtly religious, he's not a triply diplomatic  guy.  So he kind of rankles a lot of people around here with a lot of the  things that he says.  But for the first time, we're looking at a guy -- in  a long time, we're looking at a guy who looks at our immigration policy,  who looks at visa policies and he says, \"What's good for America?\"  Not  what's good for other countries.  He's not -- the big change between the  Obama Administration and this administration is that the Obama  Administration I think looked at immigration as a solution to other  people's problems.  And Donald Trump is looking at immigration as a  solution through America's problems.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of religious liberty, Charlie, It's Dagen McDowell, the  nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court really speaks volumes about  that and, of course, we talked about that with the expectation of many  people who voted for Donald Trump.</p><p>But Gorsuch's protection of religious liberty and particularly how the  decisions were over the Affordable Care Act, whether it was Hobby Lobby and  the Little Sisters of the Poor.  That really speaks to Trump at least  protecting religious freedom.</p><p>HURT:  Absolutely.  And if there are any never Trumpers left today who are  still suspicious of whether Donald Trump will make good on the promises  that he made to get the republican nomination, nothing will convince him.</p><p>Neil Gorsuch -- the pick of Neil Gorsuch is the entire game as far as I'm  concerned.  Obviously, it's -- you're the Scalia seat, so you're not  shifting the balance of the court but if there is another vacancy and  Donald Trump picks another Neil Gorsuch who simply believes that the  constitution says exactly what it means, then that will be a tremendous  victory that republicans and conservatives haven't seen certainly out of  any republican presidents since at least Ronald Reagan and even he gave us  Justice Kennedy.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  But a lot of people were critical to be fair the past eight years  that President Obama had done so much through executive order and was not  going through the congress.  Do you think putting another executive order  out on immigration is the right way to go or should the president and his  team do the tough job -- an incredibly tough job of trying to get congress  onboard for immigration reform for something that's codified in the law and  that can't be undone by the next president?</p><p>HURT:  I'm sympathetic to that and I agree with you.  I think that's a good  point.  I would far rather these things go to the legislature but there is  per view of the president to do certain things.</p><p>The knock on President Obama though was not just the executive orders, it  was that he was actually changing laws that he had no business changing.   He's actually bypassing congress and nothing that Donald Trump has done so  far approaches anything like what President Obama did in terms of ObamaCare  and a lot of other things that he had no business tinkering with.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Peter.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Charlie, isn't the key to the point we're making earlier about  unfilled jobs essentially a talent management problem that what we have is  thousands -- hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs and people who may or  may not be trained to do those jobs, aren't there ways we can connect those  dots using community colleges and other community resources to make that  happen and isn't that really what the job of this administration is going  forward?</p><p>HURT:  I certainly think so.  But that obviously is very hard to do and  that's why politicians have just sort of ignored it for decades and that  they don't want to address the underlying problems that lead to that  because it does, it's not just education, it's social programs, it's  incentivizing people to work, it's all the things that -- politicians would  rather just give free stuff away, it's much easier.  And so that's why they  just turned to, \"Well let's just open the gates and get cheap labor from  abroad.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well what's your take on the conversation the president had  with the Prime Minister of Australia in terms of saying, \"Look, we don't  want these refugees and that deal was made with President Obama, not me.\"</p><p>HURT:  Yes.  Well Americans did elect the guy who is not very politic,  that's for certain.  He's not very diplomatic and but, again, it's another  example of where this is a president who's looking at immigration, looking  at all of this in terms of what's best for America as supposed to what's  best for other countries.</p><p>I think it's most fascinating that all of the stuff is getting leaked and  it's getting leaked by bureaucrats in the administration, their heads are  exploding and I think that that's exactly what we probably saw over the  weekend as well with all the turmoil over the extreme vetting.  And that  turned out to be not that big of a dig but it was a huge deal all weekend I  think largely because you had bureaucrats all over the federal government  doing everything they could to throw wrenches into the works to make it  look like this huge disaster that it turned out it really wasn't. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was only laughing because you can hear Donald Trump on the  call saying, \"Come on, this is a dumb deal.\"</p><p>HURT:  Yes.  You felt you were watching an episode of The Apprentice.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It is funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- I mean -- but he say what he means.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why he's got the fan club that he does because he just  speaks very clearly, it was dumb.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  Say what you mean and walk the talk and he does  both.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Charles, thank you.</p><p>HURT:  And then if he goes over the line, he -- okay, so he goes over the  line, he doesn't apologize for it.  That's my favorite thing about him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nope.  Nope.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Charles, thank you.  Charles Hurt joining us there.</p><p>HURT:  You bet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, armed with political opinions, why Hillary Clinton's  election lost could be hurting ammunition sales.</p><p>And then one teenager finding herself in the deep end literally, take a  look at this picture of the icy situation she drove into, that's next.   Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tensions rising between police and protestors  over the Dakota Access Pipeline.  Lauren Simonetti with the details and  headlines now, Lauren?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Hi Maria.  Police say they arrested 76 protestors who refused  to leave the camp that was set up on private property.</p><p>Authorities want that protestors to move to a safer area because the spring  floods will arrive soon.  But official say there was this group of rogue  protestors and they tried to set up another camp nearby where they weren't  supposed to.  Police said that since August, they've made about 700  arrests, these protestors do not want to see the Dakota Access Pipeline  completed because they say the oil it would carry could contaminate their  drinking water.</p><p>Well, could President Donald Trump be hurting sales of ammunition?  The CEO  of Winchester maker, Olin Corporation says gun retailers have been  reporting slower than expected sales of bullets and ammunition after the  election.  He said, before it, gun owners increased buying ammo because  they felt that Hillary Clinton would win and would enforce stronger gun  control.</p><p>Two teenage girls, check out this picture, miraculously not hurt after  crashing their car into that icy swimming pool.  Police say they're on  their way to school when their Lexus veered off the road, crashed through a  fence, and then plunged into an in-ground pool.  Now fortunately, the car  actually landed in the shallow end and the homeowners were nice.  Then with  the police, they helped the girls wave their way out of the waters who took  crews three hours to pull their car out.  Pretty unbelievable.  I'm glad  everybody's okay.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  What a shot.  What an accident.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  And was the pool covered?  I didn't even see a cover on that  pool unless it went down with the car.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know what happens with teenagers though?  I don't know  about that particular accident but they always hit the accelerator instead  of hitting the brake.  It's just so common --  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Oh, because they're new to driving.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they're new to driving.  Yes.  Accelerator is not brake,  it happens all the time.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Big mistake there.</p><p>KIERNAN:  You need a bumper sign, \"I brake for pools.\"  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you remember the Toyota sudden acceleration problems?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The vast majority of that was related to people hitting the  accelerator, there was nothing wrong with the car.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  All right, coming up, spicy up your flasks, the  cocktails that could shake things up, we've got them, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are shaking things up this morning with  cocktails you can put in your pocket.</p><p>Joining us right now is Men's Journal Correspondent and Fort Defiance  Restaurant owner, St. John Frizell.  Good to see you St. John thank you so  much for joining us.</p><p>ST. JOHN FRIZELL, OWNER, FORT DEFIANCE RESTAURANT:  Good to see you, thanks  for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you brought some goodies here.  Your article in the March  issue of Men's Journal is giving tips on the best concoctions that you can  actually fit in a flask.</p><p>FRIZELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about that.</p><p>FRIZELL:  Well the idea is that flasks are fun to carry around and put  whiskey in but they're also fun to put like a cocktail in, it's a little  bit surprising when you're sharing it with somebody.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true because usually you don't do a mixed drink in a  flask.</p><p>FRIZELL:  Right.  But you can, there's no reason that you shouldn't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.  So what are your favorites?  </p><p>FRIZELL:  Well I brought a few here today.  This flask is filled with a  drink called the Ferrari.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Ferrari?</p><p>FRIZELL:  Which is a drink that is like a bartender shot, in New York, it's  equal parts Fernet-Branca and Campari.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>FRIZELL:  And those are both very strong, bitter liquors but together they  go really nice. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's the Ferrari, okay.</p><p>FRIZELL:  That's the Ferrari.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you'll mix it up and then you put it in a flask or you just  -- because you want to carry the mixed drink in a flask.</p><p>FRIZELL:  That's right.  Yes.  All mixed up and ready to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What -- I mean, why do people carry flasks around?  I mean what  are flasks used for?</p><p>FRIZELL:  Well to me, it's a way to -- it's like a secret handshake.  You  don't carry it just for yourself, you carry it to share it.  So you slip it  out your pocket, you look at someone, you give them a little smile, a  little wink, you offer them a drink and all of a sudden you're drinking out  of the same vessel as somebody else, you don't really do that that often.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Okay.  Because oftentimes you're using it when  you're going on a trip but are these becoming more prevalent or becoming --  does it resonate with people more?</p><p>FRIZELL:  I hope so.  I think it's a classy thing to do.  You show up at a  party or a camping trip or something like that with one of these in your  pockets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now I understand you have a special Mornings with Maria  cocktail that you created.</p><p>FRIZELL:  I do.  I do.  Yes, I'll show you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's see.  </p><p>FRIZELL:  So mornings are good, sparkly wine in the mornings is great.   This is a little Prosecco.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.</p><p>FRIZELL:  And then Mornings with Maria is in this one, this is equal parts  Aperol and Combier triple sec.  So it's got like an orange flavor, it's a  little bit bitter but I think it will be nice, let's see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.</p><p>FRIZELL:  And it's nice and orange.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So happy mornings.  Cheerful.  Cheerful color.</p><p>FRIZELL:  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's just Prosecco.  So it's Prosecco and the --  </p><p>FRIZELL:  And Aperol which is (inaudible) and the Combier which is an  orange liquor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.  Great.  And then this we'll put in a flask or --  </p><p>FRIZELL:  Yes.  Well you see --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did you choose that for Mornings with Maria?</p><p>FRIZELL:  Well I like the colors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  It is a good color.</p><p>FRIZELL:  And, yes, it's -- well, Aperol is a very popular morning drink.   There's a drink called the Aperol Spritz which is Aperol and Prosecco and a  little Seltzer and we sell a lot of those at Fort Defiance and this, we're  just upping the orange flavor a little bit to make it more like a Mimosa.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It looks good.  Well thank you for that.  Cheers.</p><p>FRIZELL:  I've got one more called the Diamond Back too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, the Diamond Back.</p><p>FRIZELL:  In this nice little (inaudible) flask.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.</p><p>FRIZELL:  This is rye whiskey, yellow chartreuse, and apple brandy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Apple brandy?</p><p>FRIZELL:  Right here.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay. </p><p>FRIZELL:  And that one is named after a turtle, the Diamond Back Terrapin  from Maryland that bites like a snake.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really good stuff, bites like a snake.  Wow.  Okay.  Good to  see you St. John.  Thank you so much.</p><p>FRIZELL:  My pleasure.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Appreciate it very much and cheers to you.  We'll be right  back.  Still to come, we're talking President Trump said to speak at the  National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C., we are bringing you his  remarks live when we come right back right here at Mornings with Maria,  stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning everybody, welcome back.

We will take you back  there live in Washington as soon as he takes the podium.</p><p>Meanwhile, chaos on campus, take a look at these pictures, violent protests  breaking at UC Berkley over a speech from the conservative editor of  Breitbart forcing the cancellation of the event, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I understand why people are upset for some reasons but  I mean for a campus that was originally a location to free speech movement,  it's kind of sad that we would resort to violent action.</p><p>MILO YIANNOPOULOS, BREITBART NEWS EDITOR:  Students who come to my talk  doesn't necessarily agree with me but just want to hear the other side.   They were prevented from doing so this evening by violent Trump elect,  elect that it's terrified at anyone who they think might be persuasive or  might be interesting or might take people with them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The outrage this morning on the hills of that breakout.   Meanwhile, another member added to President Trump's cabinet, Former Exxon  Mobile CEO, Rex Tillreson has been confirmed and Sworn In as Secretary of  State.  This happened late yesterday.

More  winter is on the way.  We heard from Punxsutawney Phil earlier and he did  see his shadow six more weeks of winter.  All that coming up this morning.   And joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell,  former Goldman Sachs partner and New York Times best-selling author Peter  Kiernan and Maverick PAC National Co-Chair Morgan Ortagus.  Good to see  you.  Were you laughing at me?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PETER KIERNAN, NEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING AUTHOR:  Glad to be with you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, you had your coat on at the break (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a little chilly, and I'm still getting over that flu I had,  like, two weeks ago.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is right.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Youth comes back fast.  Youth comes back fast, you've bounced  right back.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Youth?  Yes.  That's -- I  don't even -- I'm so beyond that.  I don't even know what that word means  anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.  We got -- we got a big show ahead.  Look, we've seen  the markets trade to the flat this year on the heels of the big rally after  election night.  We're going to talk with the chief investment officer  CalPERS coming up, how he's allocating hundreds of billions of dollars  right now, and you wonder if in fact he's expecting the strength in the  market to continue.  What we need to hear from President Trump and his  administration.</p><p>So, Ted Eliopoulos will weigh in.  He's the CIO of CalPERS.  Plus, Ohio  Congressman Tim Ryan is with us this morning.  Of course, he tried to go up  against Nancy Pelosi and lost that bid.  We'll talk with Tim Ryan about the  Democratically Party.  And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney  weighing in as always.  Along with former NFL Star Jack Brewer.  You don't  want to miss a moment of it.  We got a big hour ahead so stay with us this  morning.</p><p>And we kick it off with those violent protests last night erupting at the  University of California, Berkeley Campus, over a speech from conservative  editor, Milo Yiannopoulos.  Rioters started fires, they broke windows --  look at this, they confronted police, ultimately causing the event to be  canceled.  Joining us right now is the University of Virginia Center for  Politics Director Larry Sabato.  Larry, thanks very much for joining us.   And what do you have to say about this violence? </p><p>LARRY SABATO, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CENTER FOR POLITICS DIRECTOR:  Well,  as Peter Kiernan knows, I'm from the University of Virginia.  I've been  associated with university for 47 years, it is Thomas Jefferson's  University.  We believe in free speech, I've had literally a hundreds of  speakers that I've brought in to the university from right to left and  everything in between, I've never had a single problem.  So obviously, what  happened at Berkeley was wrong.</p><p>You've got lots of choices, you can boycott an event you don't like, you  can peacefully protester it, you can go and ask questions during the Q and  A period, you hold a counter event, what you should not do is to shut down  the actual event and deny someone the right to speak, if they've been  invited by a group and it's follow the rules of that university.  So, this  is not a good thing, but let's not overgeneralize, this is one university,  I'm sure it's happened elsewhere but there are plenty of universities, like  the University of Virginia not nearly as good but like they're like the  University of Virginia and that they welcome speakers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we don't -- we don't want to generalize about  universities across the board but there is a thread that goes through  universities across the board frankly, I mean, not cutting off free speech  but you said that so, I -- what I really wanted to say to you was who's  accountable, who do you guys think is accountable?  Should leadership from  University of Berkeley U.C.  have come and put an end to it?  What could  have been done to stop this?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  That it ultimately falls into the hands of the  leadership of the university, and quite frankly, it leads to anecdotally  there is this move -- this thread among universities particularly with a  lot of professors that there is -- there's no room in the classroom for a  differing opinion.  </p><p>SABATO:  Well, you know, I can't speak for every university or every  professor or every classroom.  I sure know my students don't fear me at all  and they constantly object to this, that, and the other, and raise contrary  opinions and I encourage it and that's what you should do in a classroom.   So, when you say there's a --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you said Peter Kiernan knows that.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes.  Well --</p><p>SABATO:  He knows that.  He knows that.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Larry has taught all four of my children and in the process he's  taught me a heck of a lot too.  And I think, you know, what we're talking  about here though is I think a shared community obligation.  It can't just  be that something that the president does alone or the faculty does alone  or the students.  There are many stakeholders here and I think what UVA  does uniquely well and could be a -- I think a magnet for other people to  watch is bring all these forces together in a way useful that it's useful.   And I think what you're seeing in going on in Berkeley and U.C.  Davis is  not useful in any way and the person ultimately harmed frankly is the  student.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's true.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC NATIONAL CO-CHAIR:  Well, why not hold the  student -- if you peacefully protest, that's fine.  You have every right to  peacefully previous as much as you do to have free speech.  But how about  holding the students who are violent and accountable in some many sort of  punishment so that other students know you can peacefully protest that you  can't -- you can't burn building and break windows, I mean, that's just  silly.  And you're responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KIERNAN:  No.  It's true.  Absolutely, you have to hold -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We all live free on this but unfortunately this bias  continues throughout the university.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had it at Wake Forest for a shoot, I had it down in Wake  Forest in the late 80s where it was like my speech was only was free if it  agreed with some of my professors and I was targeted because I was in a  sorority and some of my professors didn't like that.  And so, I think that  this has gotten away from itself because there's a lack of leadership, I'm  not talking about the University of Virginia but it's certainly a lack of  leadership or it's just a control of the liberal left.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Professor Sabato, I want to if I could ask you one question and  that is you've seen -- you've seen them come and go, you've seen  contentious elections, you've seen contentious campaigns but what is the --  what is the way for us to evaluate and think about Trump's start, he's done  some great things, he's had speed bumps.  Where do you see him in continuum  of things and what should we be taking from this is just starting out and  rough spots and what should be longer term concerns if there are any?  </p><p>SABATO:  Well, he's been in office for 14 days.  It is a four-year term.  I  told people, you know, suspend judgment, you give anybody a reasonable  trial period.  Whenever we start a new job, often we have a rough period,  so, you know, his supporters are pleased, they're  focusing on the things  they like, and his opponents, their disbeliefs, they're focusing on things  they don't like.  Let's see how this turns out as we move into, you know, a  six-month period or the first 100 days ends which ends at the end of April.   That seems like a much fair trial period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me switch gears and ask you about the president's  cabinet, I mean, obviously another member was added yesterday, former  ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Larry was confirmed and  sworn in as  secretary of state but there are other nominees that are facing real  roadblocks.  Two republican senators say they will vote against Trump's  pick for education secretary, that's Betsy DeVos, If these senators follow  through, republicans would only need one more no vote to block DeVos'  appointment, what do you think here?  That the White House administration  shared their confidence that Betsy DeVos would be confirmed and listen to  this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  I have one hundred percent  confidence she will be next secretary of education.  She is unbelievably  qualified educator, an advocate for students, teachers, parents.  It will  be, you know, I think that the games that are being played with Betsy DeVos  are sad.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you see it, Larry?  Do you think she will get confirmed? </p><p>SABATO:  Well, obviously it's a -- it's a close call.  Let's remember,  historically a president losses on one cabinet member, either the person is  forced to withdraw or doesn't pass the senate.  Something happens usually  to at least one some have two or three, I think DeVos might be the only  one, I don't know whether she will lose another republican or not or  whether she will gain one democratic vote, you know, there's always Senator  Joe Manchin from West Virginia, I haven't heard him speak yet on how he's  going to vote, maybe he issued a statement and I missed it.</p><p>But, you know, the broader picture is -- I think represented by someone  like Rex Tillerson.  I've had the opportunity to meet Mr. Tillerson talk  with him in his prior role over the years on a number of occasions.  I  think he will make a very good secretary, I think people will be surprised  that how well-trained he has become, thanks to being CEO of ExxonMobil  which is big and has its own foreign policy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Larry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Larry, in terms of how the democrats handle four years of the  Trump administration because there is so much outrage on social media about  the Hillary Clinton loss, about Donald Trump, and they're really pushing  the leadership whether it's Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer to fight the  Trump administration at every single step.  Is this what we're going to get  for four years and will it get worse? </p><p>SABATO:  I don't think you will and I certainly don't think it's wise to do  that simply because you can't fight everything, I mean, that's -- it's  absurd to even try to do that, you have to focus your attention on items or  individuals that really concern you.  And actually the Supreme Court  nominee is going to be a good test, do you -- do you really spend all of  your limited ammunition on somebody who's almost certain to be confirmed?</p><p>And it's a pretty impressive person when you listen to him, you read his  credentials, whether you agree with him or not, I mean, that's not --  that's beside the point.  Or do you wait for that critical change that's  coming when Ginsburg or Kennedy or Briar steps aside, that's when the court  will change.  That's when to use your ammunition.  Don't lose the  filibuster on Gorsuch.</p><p>So there are important distinctions here and it's up to the leadership, you  mentioned, leadership in universities, it's up to party leadership to make  that case to the rank and file.  If they're angry, they're angry but they  also have to -- have to use sense.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But I mean, what about all the other be pushback from  these -- from, you know, on these nominees?  I mean, do you think this is  obstruction by the democrats or is this just politics as usual? </p><p>SABATO:  Well, it's -- this is a continuum.  If you look back over, you  know, 30 years, you'll see that it's gotten worse and worse and worse just  as polarization has gotten worse.  So I would say with each do  administration we seem to go a step or two or three further along this line  of division which is not healthy for the country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  It isn't.  </p><p>SABATO:  I don't have much optimism that it's going to change any time  soon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Larry.  We'll leave it there.  Good to see you.   Thanks so much.  Larry Sabato.</p><p>SABATO:  Thanks a lot.  Take care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a short break.  When we come back we are awaiting  remarks from President Trump at the National Prayer Breakfast, you see that  on the bottom of your screen here.  And then coming up.  First Lady Melania  Trump getting ready for a big change as she's gearing up for move to the  White House, that's next.  And then investors hoping for a belated  Christmas gift on Amazon's 4th quarter earnings.  What to expect from the  Ecommerce retailer straight ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Market this morning expected to open lower, stocks soared after  the presidential election of course, but the Trump rally has been slowing  down, this year, leading investors to look into Trump policy before they  make their next move.  Joining me right now is CalPERS Chief Investment  Officer Ted Eliopoulos joining us right now.  And Ted, it's great to have  you on the show today..  </p><p>TED ELIOPOULOS, CALPERS CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER:  Maria, thank you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Thank you for having me.  It's so nice to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's important to check in with you because you are  overseeing such a massive amount of capital, $306 billion, is that right?   The AUM at CalPERS right now?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  That's exactly right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How are you allocating that and has it changed with the new  administration coming in?  </p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Well, we're allocating it according to our long-term strategic  asset allocation of course and we're heavily waited to equities in our  strategic allocation.  And really going into this U.S. election, we  position the portfolio to -- take into account both the hopes for equity  allocations in the future but also the risks of this election.  Post- election is really the same story.  There is much hope and optimism for  growth in the U.S. in positioning of portfolios to take advantage of that  growth.  CalPERS benefited immensely from the run-up in equity markets over  the last month and a half for sure.  Now the question really is as you  know, what happens in the future?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, I think this market was really rallying on the  idea that we would see corporate tax reform, obviously a 15 percent  corporate tax rate or a 20 percent corporate tax rate, would do a lot for  earnings, yes? </p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Yes, it would.  As well as regulatory reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Both would be very productive for growth in the U.S. and  translate to better earnings, better equity returns for the future.  But  there are also some risks to take into account.  One is what impact on  inflation, we have been on a -- in a very low inflation -- inflationary  environment and what impact could be on inflation is something to keep an  eye on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you prepare yourself as an asset manager for that?  I  mean when you look at inflation perhaps on the horizon, does that change  your assessment of what to do with bonds versus stocks?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Well, it's very difficult spot for investors right now because  you have to prepare for some  divergent outcomes is -- are we having  inflationary environment going forward or continue to have a deflationary  environment?  There is no one portfolio that's going to be maximized in  each of those environment.  So, for CalPERS, we have such a dominate equity  position in our portfolio, almost 48 percent of the portfolio today.  We  have bought some inflation protective securities and repositioned the  portfolio as well as commodities in the run-up to the election.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In terms of 48 percent in equities, is that through index  funds, ETFs or specific names?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  We're direct in the -- in that global index of stocks, so we  are predominantly an index investor with enhancements that we do mostly  internally with our internal global equity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the enhancements?  Tell us about that because today,  you can buy an index with whatever combination you want, right?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  That's right.  So, we have several factors we look at, it  could be momentum, value, quality, low volatility, maximum diversification,  there are risk factors that allow us to tilt the portfolio slightly in  directions that we see benefit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you look at overall areas that you have to allocate  capital, we talked in the past about hedge funds and you've been vocal  about -- look, the fees are something to watch, and it's not as, you know,  a profitable thing anymore as well as private equity.  You're developing  plans to shift somewhat, $30 billion in terms of private equity away from - - what are you doing in terms of shifting?  </p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Sure, yes  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to move in-house as pensions cut fees.  </p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Yes.  We're trying to bring as much in-house as we can, we  have over 70 percent of our portfolio we managed internally.  Most of that  is in a public asset classes.  We have added a new allocation to actually  opportunistic credit, to new credit strategy, structured credit, private,  we think that's an opportunity for the future.  And that bringing -- we  have that talent in-house, we have active fixed income managers within our  staff that are able to execute those strategies with confidence.</p><p>In the private market much is a much tougher assessment whether you can  bring in-house, those strategies, and we're not sure right now on the  private equity side that we could effectuate a strategy to compete with the  external managers that are our partners that have done extraordinarily well  for us overtime.  The fees are high but the returns and the performance net  of all those fees have been quite robust, and persistent for over 20 years  for now -- for us now.  So, it is a very important calculus to try and  adjust the external internal model internally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you have any concern that we're not going to see the tax  cuts and the rollback of regulations instituted this year and would that  dictate a change in the way you invest in all those equities?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Well,  we'll stay heavily invested in equities for the long  term, we are a long-term investor, we'll be watching quite closely over the  next six months to see how difficult and how swift these policy changes may  come.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because people are wondering if in fact, you know, there's  money for this.  I mean, yes, they want it revenue neutral and one of the  president's underlying Mick Mulvaney says, look, we got to take a chopping  block to the entitlements as the guy running who's running the largest  pension fund, CalPERS out there in the country, what's your take on cutting  entitlements?.  </p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Well, you know, these are -- these are promises that have been  made to -- ordinary pensioners, that's our -- that's our view.  For  CalPERS, our duty is to pensioners and we have hardworking policemen,  firemen firewomen --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Going to keep those promises.</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  You have to keep those promises, so the key to make sure you  price them and you save for them in order to keep those promises for the  long term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ted, it's great to have you on the show today.  </p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Ted Eliopoulos is the chief investment  officer of CalPERS.  We have breaking news right now, the hostage situation  at a Delaware Prison.

The correctional officers union president said,  \"It is a sad day for Delaware Correctional Officers,\" well, a sad day  indeed.  Inmates had told a local newspaper that concerns about their  treatment and the leadership of the U.S. prompted their actions.</p><p>All right.  Let's move to markets here.

That was back in 2015.  Chipotle has  already said that sales for the holiday quarter probably fell five percent.   And visa reporting after the close today as well, analysts expected the  company to post a profit 78 cents a share.  Well, it's  February 2nd,  groundhog day and Punxsutawney Phil says, \"I'm sorry, six more weeks of  winter.\"</p><p>A short time ago he happened to see his shadow and according to legend that  means spring's arrival is going to have wait a little bit longer, how  accurate is Phil?

And they want to make you look as bad as possible, I think there is  a certain dishonesty if they go against -- from not very long ago and he  did get a unanimous endorsement.  </p><p>REX TILLERSON, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  I'm not concerned about  that and I can tell you why, because I think that their record of  obstruction is going to wear same with the people.  We didn't obstruct and  so we think that our -- republican president ought to have the same  consideration. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST:  The very  latest on the tensions coming up this morning.

Blake Burman with the very latest right now  at the White House, Blake.  </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Maria.  Good morning to you.  Despite reservations really on both sides of  the aisle with past business dealings with Russia, the Senate yesterday did  indeed confirmed Rex Tillerson to become the next Secretary of State.  A  very narrow nomination but it passed, nonetheless.</p><p>He then came here to the White House, the Former ExxonMobil CEO did and  with the President and Vice President by his side, he was officially sworn  in.  The president also turned some heads yesterday at the White House  earlier in the day in which he appeared to give the OK for the Senate  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to change the Senate rules, should it get  to that point with another nomination.  That being the Supreme Court  nominee Neil Gorsuch. </p><p>(BEHIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If we end up with the same gridlock that they've had in Washington  for the last -- longer than eight years in all fairness to President Obama  -- a lot longer than eight years.  Then we end up with that gridlock, I  would say if you can Mitch, don't go near.  Because that would be an  absolute shame if a man of this quality was caught up in the web. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  You heard the president there say go nuclear.  That refers to the  so-called Nuclear Option, which would eliminate the 60 votes filibuster  threshold that Democrats are calling for and bring it down to 51.  I asked  the White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer about this yesterday Maria,  whether the White House would be comfortable going forward with that path,  Spicer told me that it's not the president's preference at this point, and  that essentially, it would Mitch McConnell's call.  We'll see if it gets to  that point, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake.  Thank you so much.  Blake Burman at the  White House.  Joining us right now is the man who ran against Nancy Pelosi  for Minority Leader.  Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan is with us.  And  congressman, it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>TIM RYAN, UNITED STATES CONGRESSMAN OF OHIO:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, your reaction to all of these stall tactics on the side of  Democrats, Sir, I mean, obviously, they are stopping and trying to do  whatever they can to stall President Trump from having his cabinet in  place. </p><p>RYAN:  Well, I mean, that's the process.  I mean, we're not messy  democracy, that's where we live.  You know, you saw it happen during  President Obama's tenure where the Republicans were literally blocking  every single thing he tried to do.  Jobs, bill of Supreme Court Nominee, so  now there is some real disagreement I think, whether it's with the Supreme  Court Justice or some of his nominees that violates some of the basic  values that, I think, Democrats have.</p><p>So, it's important for us to stand up, Republicans have the majority, they  are getting some of their nominees through, but this is all part of the  process, and I don't think it's anything unnecessary is happening but we  get - we have to stand up for what we believe in too. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What specific values are being violated? </p><p>RYAN:  Well, I think if you look at The Supreme Court Nominee, Trump, you  know, campaigned about draining the swamp.  The Supreme Court Nominee is  not for any kind of campaign finance reform at all.  I think if you look,  you know, at DeVos for example, the Secretary of Education absolutely no  experience in public education and also owes Ohio $5 million from fines  that she got a few years ago, when she was involved in another organization  that she hasn't paid.  I mean, these are legitimate things that - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well wait a second - </p><p>RYAN:  Obviously, we need to talk about. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you say Judge Gorsuch, I mean, this is the individual who  was confirmed unanimously just 10 years ago by Republicans and Democrats.   So, what changed other than him being Donald Trump's pick? </p><p>RYAN:  Well, I think the fact that Donald Trump campaigned on draining the  swamp, that he is not for draining the swamp, he is for, you know,  unfettered money coming into politics with many, many people are against.   President Trump campaigned -- </p><p>Maria:  Yes.  I want to ask you about draining the swamp. </p><p>RYAN:  Hold on.  Hold on, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Go ahead. </p><p>RYAN:  He also campaigned on helping working class people where the Supreme  Court Nominee is against right to work which would allow working class  people to organize.  So, I think these are legitimate things that we are  going to have fights over.  Let's not make too big a of a deal out of it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, all right.  Well, the problem is that the president needs a  team in place in order to execute some of the promises he's made.  I got to  get my team in here for you but I have one more question on draining the  swamp for you because there's an article right now, saying Nancy Pelosi is  leading her party into oblivion.  I mean, Nancy Pelosi said that the --  Judge Gorsuch is hostile to women's productive rights, hostility toward  children and school, children with autism, hostile appointments.  And as  far as President Trump, she says he's been wreck less and incompetent in  his recent Executive Order.  I mean, does she not understand what just  happened in terms of the election?  She is going against what the people  just voted for. </p><p>RYAN:  Well, I mean Democrats, not to be too frank, but we are in oblivion  as we speak now.  I mean, we are completely wiped out in the election so  we're trying to work our way back.  But I think Donald Trump also  campaigned, Maria, on stability and he's doing everything in his power to  make the globe more unstable at this point. </p><p>You see, the rally with the stock market has subsided a bit because he is  picking fights, he's doing things with -- the Muslim ban and immigration  that makes us look hostile to our allies in Muslim countries and Muslims  here in the United States when we know that these are very important things  that the kind of stability that we need. </p><p>He campaigned on bringing us that stability.  And he is making things  unstable, he campaigned on making us stronger and the Muslim ban makes it  harder for us to prosecute the war on terrorism. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Congressman, I have to push  back.  It's not a Muslim ban.  These are seven countries that were  identified by the Obama Administration.  And the restrictions are based on  country, not religion, first and foremost.  But I want to get back to Nancy  Pelosi and the loss of the Democrats in rebuilding the party and making a  comeback is -- but is the way to do that, this kind of fierce rhetoric and  opposition that you're getting from not only Nancy Pelosi, but also Chuck  Schumer.  Is that how you win over voters over the next two to four years? </p><p>RYAN:  Well, you know, you have to take a stand on things that you believe  in, and it may not always be popular in the moment.  I'm not into real  hostile rhetoric.  I'm not into inflaming the situation.  We have enough of  that in Washington.  We need to reach out to each other and see if we can  find some common ground.  But </p><p>I will tell you, that it is the Chief Executive's responsibility to do  that.  I mean, he hasn't even reached out to his own national security  people, for example, with the immigration issue that we were just talking  about.  He even didn't talk to his own people.  They're not talking to  Democrats, that's the responsibility of the President of The United States.   President Obama did a lot of reaching out to Republicans, early on, through  a lot of the affordable care stuff.  He was always reaching out. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on.  The Affordable Care Act?  Don't go there.  He  don't care and he pushed through and he had absolutely no support on the  Republican side at all. </p><p>RYAN:  Are you kidding me?  He had no support?  I'm saying he reached out  for months and months.  And including in the Stimulus Bill, incorporated  the tax cuts into the Stimulus Bill that many Democrats didn't want.  We  wanted straight infrastructure spending to juice up the economy. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did he have to do so many Executive Orders, then?  Then how  come he had to do so many Executive Orders?</p><p>RYAN:  OK.  Because the Republicans were blocking every single thing he  did.  He had no choice.  But if he wants to get anything done to do  Executive Orders, you know it and I know it - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  I don't know that.  I don't know that at all.  </p><p>RYAN:  Mitch McConnell said that his number one goal -- Mitch McConnell  said his number one goal was to make sure President Obama didn't have a  second term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I think -</p><p>RYAN:  They blocked his jobs bill, they didn't vote, not one vote for  health care, their whole M.O. was to destroy Obama and make him a one  termer.  So, don't turn around two weeks into Trump's presidency and say,  \"Boy, you guys are being really unfair.\"  Look, this is not the rotary  club.  This is politics.  It's a full contact support.  If you can't take  the heat, get out of the kitchen. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ryan, I think it's also important to know that part of the  reason Donald Trump won the election is because of those Executive Orders.   It was as much a repudiation against President Obama, as it was the fact  that there was no message from your candidate. </p><p>RYAN:  Well, look. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's not forget what the reality is.  Your team lost. </p><p>RYAN:  And I like some of his Executive Orders.  Small business  regulations, I agree with it.  Re-negotiating TPP, I agree with it.   Finding a way to make NAFTA work for places like Youngstown in Warren  Akron, Ohio sit?  Let's sit down and do that.  I'm not here to butt heads  with him at every turn.  I'm here to work with him if we can.  But as I  said, he's not even reaching out to his own people on policy decisions,  he's certainly not reaching out the Democrats.  But when we stand ready if  there is something we can work on. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, one final question.  Are the Democrats going to put  anybody under 70 years old in power?  In leadership? </p><p>RYAN:  Well -- I did my part I did my part to try to try.  You know, I  think we do need new faces in the democratic party and I think we need a  solid approach that reaches out to all corners of the country.  I think we  have a good agenda that we need to just push and get out.  We need to  rebuild the country, we need broadband in every corner of the country to  unlock certain communities that just can't compete in the new economy  because they don't have the new America 2.0 infrastructure like broadband.   And, you know, education reform and all the rest.  So we have an agenda but  we've got to be willing to sit down and try to get it through. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, part of that issue is the party is being hijacked by the  extreme left.  Is that a fair statement? </p><p>RYAN:  Well, we're in an era in the country of extreme partisanship and I  think President Trump needs to do a better job of figuring out how to do  things without inciting everybody in the country and in the world.  Now you  look at what is going on with refugees and people coming over here. </p><p>Look, no bureaucratic system is perfect.  If there's things we need to do  to sit down and some, fine.  But the reality is, if we're going to be real  concerned with refugees coming over here or people coming over here as  terrorists, they're probability not going to come from Yemen.  They're  probably not going to come from Syria. ]</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why not?  </p><p>RYAN:  They're probably going to be smart enough to come through a European  country into the United States.  And so let's sit down and figure out how  we can work with our European allies to tighten things up to make sure that  we are covering the entire ground.  We have a really strong vetting  process, of course it can be improved but he didn't need to do it in a way  that makes it hostile to where tech companies are freaking out because, you  know, they have Muslim workers to where a doctor at the Cleveland clinic is  getting stopped and not allowed back into the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>RYAN:  You don't need to do this.  It just - there's too much chaos with  Trump, too much drama.  Sit down, relax, breathe in through nose and let's  figure out how to work together and get the country going again. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick.  Peter Kiernan.</p><p>PETER KIERNAN, NEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING AUTHOR:  Well I have to say I  watched you closely when you were running your campaign for -- excuse me --  minority leader.  I think you would have made a great one.  I don't believe  you would have fought at every single step, at every single turn, the way  Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are.  Do you have a reaction to that?  </p><p>RYAN:  I think we do need to pick our spots.  I think we've got to find  points of agreement and -- but there are people are -- excited about a  couple of these nominees.  I think that the immigration issue, the Muslim  issue, insight a lot of people's sensibilities including mine that, you  know, you're going to put Muslims back in the line trying to get in the  country.  You're going to tell refugees who want to come into a safe haven,  sometimes United States, sometimes other countries that are coming from a  war that we started guys.  I mean, we started this war.  So we have some  responsibility.  So, no.  I don't think you fight on every turn, I think  you try to find some common ground. </p><p>But when there are basic issues that violate our values, you stand up and  you fight.  And we're giving him, I think, will give him a lot more  hearings for Supreme Court justice than the Republicans gave the President  Obama.  So, it's important for us to remember that as well. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to have you on the program this morning.   We'll be watching.  Thanks so much. </p><p>RYAN:  Thanks, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Tim Ryan, joining us there.  Coming up, we are  waiting remarks from President Trump at the National Breakfast.  The Prayer  Breakfast.  We'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  45 minutes away from the opening bell.  Markets  are looking lower this morning.  We are at the lows of the morning right  now.  And the DOW Industrials average now expecting a decline of about 60  points.  NASDAQ, down in 11.  Couple of names are watching Macy's.  The  stock is looking higher this morning reportedly considering a possible  sale.  The New York Post is reporting that longtime CEO Terry Lundgren is  set to be weighing the move before he steps down later this quarter.   Macy's shares and we're seeing a bit off.  Tesla Motors dropping the  motors.  The name change to Tesla Inc. chose the company's ambition to move  beyond just selling high end electric cars and shifting into energy  products like solar panels and home batteries.  Tesla agreed to acquire  Solar City, remember, for $2.6 billion.  That was back in November. </p><p>Blowout earnings from big technology names like Microsoft, Apple, Facebook.   Amazon is reporting tonight.  And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart  Varney joins me.  Taking a look at tech in the spotlight, Stu.  Good  morning.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY &amp; COMPANY HOST:  I continue my  astonishment at the financial performance of America's big tech companies.   As you point out, Apple, $246 billion in cash, Facebook last night, 1.8  billion monthly users and a ton of money coming over every year.  And  tonight, it's Amazon.  I don't know whether they're going to disappoint or  what.  But I do know that if you look at the numbers, it will be a shock. </p><p>Maria, you and I have covered financial news for a few years.  I have  covered it for decades longer than you have and I have never, ever seen  such a concentration of financial power among the four or five top American  big name technology companies.  Never seen this before.  And remember, they  are now in opposition to President Trump.  Both on ideologic grounds and on  trade grounds, on visa grounds, this is quite a confrontation that's coming  here. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.  Part of the issue, I think, is because  technology is seeped into so many other industries, Stu.  Right?  I mean,  tech has changed transportation, it's changed health care, it's changed  retailing.  So, one of the reasons for power base is that it's not just  traditional tech, it's technology changing so many other industries.</p><p>VARNEY:  That is very true.  I mean, it seeped into the automobile  industry. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That, too.</p><p>VARNEY:  I mean, I don't know what percentage of a car these days comes  from Silicon Valley or is computer oriented.  It's big and it's growing.  I  just -- I don't think I've ever seen that kind of concentration of  financial power.  The money these guys have, the influence that brings, is  really astonishing.  I love it, by the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know President Trump doesn't like monopolies.  So, we'll see  where that goes. </p><p>VARNEY:  Who wants a monopoly?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  See you in about 10 minutes, Stu.  </p><p>VARNEY:  You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" again at the top of the hour  right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart, 9:00 a.m. Eastern this  morning.  </p><p>Coming up, the NFL takes its Super Bowl patrons on the ride of their life.   Our own Cheryl Casone is on the ground in Houston with former NFL Star,  Jack Brewer.  Check it out.  We're going to join them momentarily. back in  a minute.</p><p>Then, they took an interstellar journey that made even jack brewer scream. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Houston, of course home to NASA's Johnson Space  Center so it should come as no surprise that the space travel agency will  play a part in the pre-Super Bowl festivities.  Our own Cheryl Casone and  Former NFL Star Jack Brewer took a ride on NASA's 90-foot virtual reality  simulated trip to mars and back.  And they lived to tell the tale.  Cheryl? </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Maria, good  morning.  Yes, it was a two-minute ride but it was full of thrills.  NASA  does, someday, want go to mars.  They're working with Boeing and race it on  to make it happen.  But as far as the ride itself, Jack, how would you  describe what we went through yesterday for Maria?  </p><p>JACK BREWER, FORMER NFL STAR:  I was freaked out. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREWER:  Whoa. </p><p>CASONE:  We're ready.  Let's do this.  </p><p>BREWER:  Let's do this. </p><p>CASONE:  We're about to go up 90 feet so we can drop 90 feet.  Jack, you  are afraid of heights.  Right?  </p><p>BREWER:  I can't believe you talked me into this. </p><p>CASONE:  We're standing in the middle of the field in NRG Stadium. </p><p>BREWER:  Maria, the only thing missing here is you. </p><p>CASONE:  Oh, boy.  We're above the Earth. </p><p>BREWER:  Oh, my God. </p><p>CASONE:  We're in space, Jack.  We're on the Orion Spacecraft. </p><p>BREWER:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  We're approaching Mars. </p><p>BREWER:  It's kind of beautiful, actually. </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BREWER:  Wow.</p><p>BREWER:  I did not say anything that was not on T.V.  It was amazing.</p><p>CASONE:  That was cool.  That was cool.  Jack, here we go.</p><p>BREWER:  Oh, man. </p><p>CASONE:  That was crazy.  Are you OK? </p><p>BREWER:  Yes.  I was just happy that I -</p><p>CASONE:  I'm a little dizzy.  Look, we just want to mars, Maria. you owe  us. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  What we do for you, Maria.  Right, Jack? </p><p>BREWER:  That is right.  We love you.  </p><p>CASONE:  We love you.  It was a lot of fun.  It was a bit crazy out there  but all the fans can come in and experience that today.  If they're in  Texas, come on down in the Super Bowl live.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You guys have real spunk.  Dagen and I were just talking about  when you went on that roller-coaster ride, Cheryl.  Wow.</p><p>Meanwhile, how about this, guys?  Former President George H.W. Bush and his  wife Barbara are flipping the coin before the 2017 Super Bowl according to  their spokesperson.  Jack, what do you think about that?  Who do you think  the former president is rooting for? </p><p>BREWER:  Well, I mean.  I am sure he's already a fan.  But down deeply in  his heart, he wishes he was watching the Dallas Cowboys.  But you know,  President Bush is a very, very admired person in Texas, you know.  I am a  Texan as well as Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  This is our home state, Maria.  But you know, the thing is,  this is his hometown and there's so much buzz because there's just so many  well wishes from him that are coming from all over just on a local  perspective.  But I can't imagine what that stadium is going to be like  when he comes out to do that coin toss on Sunday.  We are going to be there  so we will let you know. </p><p>BREWER:  No question. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, guys.  Thank you, Cheryl and jack.  We will see you  later, thanks for that.  And remember you can watch Super Bowl only on one  network live on the Fox Network.  This Sunday night, 6:30 pm Eastern.  We  will be watching.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, we will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.  Final thoughts from our  all-star panel when we come right back.  Stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're awaiting comments from President Trump at the National  Prayer Breakfast.  We want to get some final thoughts are we're all  scratching our heads trying to figure out what Congressman Tim Ryan just  said about we started this war.  Twitter's going nuts about it too.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just -- to push back on that, I don't know exactly what he's  talking about as if we asked for 9/11 going down that road, but in terms of  Syria and the refugee crisis, Trump -- President Trump is now trying to  deal with.  The situation in Syria erupted because of the vacuum by  President Obama.  There was a red line that wasn't honored.  And Assad and  Putin, essentially took over.  So, let's blame and put blame where it needs  to lie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's the bottom line.  Thank you Morgan Ortagus, Peter  Kiernan, Dagen McDowell.  It's a pleasure.  We'll see you tomorrow,  everybody.  Here's Stuart. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Happy Thursday.   Thanks for being with us this morning.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, February 2.  Here are your top  stories, 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Groundhog's Day.  Chaos on campus.  Violent protesters breaking out last  night at UC Berkeley over a speech from a conservative editor, forcing the  cancellation of the event.</p><p> Broken windows, as you see flames.  The university and local residents  frustrated as agitators got in the way of the first amendment.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I support free speech.  See what he had to say  (INAUDIBLE) ideas talked about and it just got shut down by a bunch of  people (INAUDIBLE) protester masks.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's not a proud day for this campus on the free speech  movement.  The violence is deplorable.  And there's really nothing to be  proud about because of what happened here tonight.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The outrage coming up this morning.</p><p> Meanwhile, President Trump's cabinet adding another member.  Former  ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson has been confirmed and sworn in as secretary  of state.  This happened late yesterday.</p><p> Even his other nominees are still facing roadblocks.  We've got all the  details on the confirmations coming up.</p><p> A strong earnings report from Facebook to tell you about.  The social media  giant posting better than expected fourth-quarter revenue.  Profit also was  above expectations.  We're breaking down those numbers.</p><p> Looking ahead to Amazon's results there out tonight after the close.   Facebook shares going to be up this morning.</p><p> Checking the broader markets.  Take a look at where we're looking at this  morning and it is a pullback.  Some selling underway.  The Dow Industrials  expected to be down about 50 points today.  NASDAQ down about 20 points  after a gain yesterday.</p><p> In Europe, muted action this morning.  Take a look at the major indices  throughout the Eurozone and you'll see mixed performance.  The FT 100 is up  a third of a percent.  That's 22 points higher.</p><p> In Asia overnight, declines across the board to report.  Take a look, Asian  markets finished like this.  Still a holiday in China.  Shanghai Composite  closed but the Nikkei average in japan down one in a quarter percent.  The  worst performer throughout the Asian markets.</p><p> One football fan scoring the ultimate ticket, Super Bowl seats for life.   The details coming up.</p><p> And then a great American tradition.  It's Groundhogs Day today.  Will  Punxsutawney still see his shadow?  We will take you to Pennsylvania later  this hour live where the crowd are lining up.  It is incredibly packed  right there this morning at this time.</p><p> All that coming up this morning.</p><p> And joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.   Former Goldman Sachs partner and New York Times best-selling author Peter  Kiernan is with us.  And Maverick PAC national co-chair, Morgan Ortagus.   Good to see you.</p><p> MORGAN ORTAGUS, CO-CHAIR, MAVERICK PAC:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Great to see you.  Good morning.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  I love being here every morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Groundhogs Day.  Every day is Groundhogs Day.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey, we got Rex Tillerson confirmed.  We'll see who else is on  the docket.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Betsy DeVos having some problems with two republican senators  saying they're not going to vote for her.  And so now it looks -- it looks  split 50 votes for the republicans and so she's hanging on by a thread.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I didn't expect that coming to republicans.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I did not either.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll talk about that this morning.  Big show ahead.   Forbes media chairman and former republican presidential candidate Steve  Forbes is in the house.  We got to talk to with him about tax reform.</p><p> Plus, the former republican presidential candidate and former Minnesota  governor Tim Pawlenty with us this morning.</p><p> The chief investment officer of CalPERS Ted Eliopoulos is with us this  morning.  We're going to find out how he's allocating capital.</p><p> And Ohio congressman who ran against Nancy Pelosi from minority leader.   Tim Ryan is with us.  Big show.</p><p> Plus, former NFL star, Jack Brewer as well.  Stick around.  Stay right  there.  We've got a big program ahead.</p><p> We kick it off right now with a wave of destruction blanketing the  University of California campus Berkeley campus last night.  Protesters  rallying against the planned speech by the school by Breitbart news editor  Milo Yiannopoulos.  Rioter's started fires, they broke windows.  They  confronted police.  Ultimately causing the talk to be canceled.</p><p>Fox News' Tucker Carlson spoke with Milo Yiannopoulos last night about the  chain of events and protesters spoke out as well.  Listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MILO YIANNOPOULOS, NEWS EDITOR, BREITBART:  This evening we got into the  building, started preparing for the show and people started arriving in  black clothes then masks.  They were clearly carrying concealed shields  weapons and things.  And then stuff being thrown at the building.  There  were rocks being thrown.  Various other things being thrown out of the  building.  Eventually the ground floor was breached and I was evacuated.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have the right to defend ourselves.  And so this  shutting this down Milo Yiannopoulos and doing whatever is necessary to do  that is our right to self-defend.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's one thing to protest someone's right to come here  and speak, but it's another thing to create this much amount of destruction  and violence.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  Peter Kiernan, what's your reaction here?  I mean,  UC Berkeley was -- I know -- regardless it is a left-leaning university.   But isn't this the place where typically students go and say we want free  speech and look what they do to somebody who's about to give a speech?</p><p> PETER KIERNAN, FORMER PARTNER, GOLDMAN SACHS:  Yes.  I have to say, this  man is on the campus tour from hell.  He got cancelled a couple of weeks  ago at UC Davis and the University of New Mexico.  They just find the group  that was hosting in $3,500.</p><p> He is somebody who is basically being rejected everywhere.  And I thought  universities were places of free and open exchange of ideas.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not in modern history they're not.  These left-wing individuals  -- and this is throughout the college system in this country and it's led  by professors quite frankly, that they preach tolerance, but breed  intolerance.  They're breeding intolerance in the name of tolerance.  That  is what is so both ironic and repugnant in what's going on here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  why is that do you think?  I just had this conversation last  night.  Why are the academics spewing this liberalism and they are just --  I mean, even when you look at the day after the election when Donald Trump  won.  They're telling students of different narrative than actually what  happened.  Why?</p><p> ORTAGUS:  I think it's just another symptomatic case where you say they're  completely out of touch with the American people, right?  The university  job especially getting tenure.  It's a bunch of groupthink, I think in a  lot of occasions and these are not people that are out working some job  nine to five or trying to make ends meet.  They had pretty cushy jobs at  universities.  It's like being in the government, right, where you can get  fired.</p><p> What was really interesting to me though about the Berkeley situation,  Maria, is that Berkeley invited at the time President Ahmadinejad from Iran  when he was being incredibly provocative to the U.S.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Death to America.</p><p> ORTAGUS:  And death to America.  So you do not see the type of protests for  him that you saw last night.</p><p> Also, Milo is not without controversy.  So this is -- let's not pretend  that he doesn't -- he stoked the flames a bit so he does it as well.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It doesn't matter though because they said this on this program  when it comes to liberal protests, whether marches here to protest police  brutality for example.  Defending the first amendment means tolerating and  allowing for speech that even you find repugnant and offensive.  That's  what the first amendment is about.  It not about this.</p><p> And it shows liberal left wing distortion of what's really going on when  you hear the young woman saying, we have the right to defend ourselves.   Your right is to not listen to what Milo Yiannopoulos has to say</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, don't go.  Don't show up.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But stop acting like this is a physical attack on you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why are you defending yourself?</p><p> KIERNAN:  I think when it's all said and done, the safe space mentality,  we're going to protect the students from the real world or from the world  that's different from what they believe.  When those students get out into  the real world, they'll find that there are a plurality of points of view,  even though as they never heard on campus.</p><p> And if campuses are meant to create great leaders in the future, what are  they training them for if they don't have full exposure to the voices?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They shut down freedom of expression.  They're shutting down the  first amendment and at the same time, and you can't say this enough.  This  college campuses -- because of these professors, they've become a breeding  ground for anti-Semitism in this country.</p><p> And they're giving people cover to basically preach hatred of Jews and it's  disgusting.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  it's disgusting.  And where is the president?  Where is the  president of the university to come out and stop this and show some  leadership?  Have we heard from anybody at the leadership?</p><p> KIERNAN:  Well, it's interesting, in UC Davis the chancellor did say  something that was not condoning of this, but that's a talk.  Where is the  action and he chose from the day-to-day activity?  Why aren't you opening  your doors to contrary points of view?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  Really a great points this morning on  this.</p><p> I want to turn to immigration because President Trump's administration is  considering an executive order that would take a closer look at visa  programs for foreign workers in the U.S.  This according to \"The Wall  Street Journal\" this morning.</p><p>Morgan, your take on this.  For Trump, it would be another promise  fulfilled in keeping jobs in America, frankly.</p><p> ORTAGUS:  I would like -- first of all, clearly, our immigration system  needs reform.  I think people on both sides of the aisles are honest with  themselves.  What I would like prefer to see over an executive order is  that the president work with congress on comprehensive reform.  And the  reason is that President Obama have seen this firsthand.</p><p> When you issue all of these executive orders, they can easily be done.  And  so one of the problems over the past eight years, one of the reason  President Obama was not effective is because he didn't work with congress  to push this legislation through.</p><p> So I like the idea of this.  I think we need reform.  I would like them to  see him go to congress, get a comprehensive play.  Get something codified  and delude that can't be undone the minute the next president comes in.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The tech industry particularly is upset about this, about the  going after the H-1B visas for highly skilled workers.</p><p> And I would argue on the other hand of that.  In fact, the CEO of GoDaddy  was writing that there are currently 500,000 unfilled high skilled I.T. in  computer science jobs.</p><p> If you want American companies to create more jobs, then you want the best  and brightest minds from around the world living here and creating ideas  and products that are then American-owned.  So I would argue that this is  critical importance.</p><p> We need to reform the education system quite frankly if you want Americans  to fill this jobs.  In the interim, you want to support great American  businesses.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Which is why those CEOs of those technology companies are  putting together a letter to send to President Trump to obviously review  everything you just said, having the crux of the issue.</p><p> KIERNAN:  I think they want it so bad.  About a million people immigrate  here every year.  I think we should take 50,000 or 60,000 of those H-1B  visas and sell them for $50,000.  And if the high-tech companies want those  people so bad to fill those slots, sell them.  We could raise a billion  dollars a year, do that for five years.  That's how you find your fixing of  the education system.  I think there's an opportunity -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How are you going to sell them though?  Are you getting best  students in that way?</p><p> KIERNAN:  I think what you do as I say, we're going to give you a slot.   We'll sell to you for $50,000.  If you want one of those H-1 visas, you  pay.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  OK.</p><p> KIERNAN:  For 50,000.  We still have a million people coming in here with  free of charge, no issue.  But if we're going to turn this into a  commercial partnership, let's really do it.</p><p> ORTAGUS:  This is certainly be a discussion tomorrow with the president  because he has CEOs that he's put on in his Business Roundtable that are  meeting with him tomorrow.  It's reported, I think that Elon Musk and the  Uber CEO among others will be at the meeting.  So I know that this will be  -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Sadly not the Americans living here to fill these highly skilled  jobs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that goes back to education because they don't have the  skillsets required.</p><p> Meanwhile, President Trump tweeted this last night about his predecessor's  decision to take in refugees from Australia.  He writes this.  Do you  believe it?  The Obama administration agreed to take thousands of illegal  immigrants from Australia.  Why?  I will study this dumb deal.\"</p><p> This coming after Trump reportedly clashed with the Prime Minister of  Australia.  Malcom Turnbull last night during a phone call about this  matter, calling it, \"the worst deal ever.\"</p><p> He accused Turnbull of looking to export the next Boston bombers.  Now,  there's a lot of media reporting about this morning, Peter, that they had a  tense call.  Do you predict this change in the U.S. relationship with  Australia?  And how important was this call?  And how impacts -- </p><p> KIERNAN:  Well I think it was cable setting.  We're basically getting  started, but have you been to Australia?  I mean, there's plenty of rooms  to take a few thousand -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They won't take them, by the way.</p><p> KIERNAN: And the problem is why are they dishing their problem to us?  I  think it was very right and appropriate for the president to say, we're  going to level set.  The relationship now has changed.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Or do it as a dumb deal.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p> ORTAGUS:  The call happened on Saturday too and that was after the rollout  of the executive order would bungled.  I think even the administration has  acknowledged that.</p><p> So he's probably on edge given the fact that it's been a rough weekend.</p><p> But the one thing that we have to say is the Australian prime minister  reiterated the special relationship.  We work incredibly closely with the  Australians.  Anytime we go to war and in intelligence matters.  It's an  important relationship.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  These refugees are in offshore detention centers right now in  Australia.  And if it's a deal that President Obama inked with Australia,  it's up to the new president to decide whether it's in our best interest.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do we know when that deal was inked?  Remember, President Obama  was doing so much in the final twilight days of his administration?  We'll  get the answer for you.</p><p> We'll take a short break.  When we come back, rumors in retail.  The long  time CEO of Macy's is stepping down.  Now there's talk the struggling  retailer may put itself up for sale.  Macy's on sale.</p><p> And then this little piggy had none.  Bacon lovers fearing a shortage of  their favorite pork product.  Why a price hike might be in store.  Back in  a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Two staffers are being held hostage at a  Delaware maximum-security prison this morning.  Lauren Simonetti on  headlines now.  Lauren, good morning to you.</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi.  Good morning, Maria.  Two  Delaware department of correction employees have been held hostage since  last night, as inmates remained in an hour's long standoff with police.</p><p> This incident began when four employees at the correctional center were  taken hostage yesterday morning.  One DOC staff member was released four  hours later, another shortly before 8:00 P. M.</p><p> In a call to the News Journal in Wilmington, one inmate reportedly cited  President Donald Trump as the reason for the hostage situation saying  because of Trump, he quote, \"knows the institution is going to change for  the worse.\"</p><p> Well, an attorney representing state inmates says complaints have increased  in the past year from inmates about substandard medical care in poor  record-keeping.</p><p> Big news in business world.  A reported sale from Macy's is on the table.   Longtime CEO Terry Lundgren stepping down as the head of the largest U. S.  department store within the next few months.  That's the report.</p><p> In an attempt to avoid more shakeup, Lundgren is reportedly considering a  sale of Macy's.  Macy's share in the past year are down about 30 percent.   But this morning if you check out this board, they're up about four percent  on the news.</p><p> And Nielsen mobile insights ranks T-Mobile number one in customer service  satisfaction.  The company beating up Verizon and AT&amp;T as the company to  most likely be recommended as well.  This comes after T-Mobile offers to  covers sales tax on new smartphones.</p><p> The deal will give customers more than 11 percent off of a phone's price if  they're using a prepaid MasterCard.</p><p> All right.  I love this story because I love to look at the video.  For  bacon lovers out there.  Reports of frozen pork belly inventories reaching  their lowest level in 50 years.  Rest assured.  </p><p> Earlier this week, we had a story that that was going to happen.  But  claims of these bacon shortages are unsupported.  Meat processors are  however paying 30 percent more than they did just a few months ago and that  increase might show up shortly at supermarkets.</p><p> But for now, bacon prices are holding steady.  And the USDA reports a pound  of bacon averages actually 11 percent less than they did just back in 2015,  Maria.  So there you have it.  Good morning and that's hogwash.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I like it.  I'm glad you got dead end.</p><p> Breaking news right now, Lauren.  We want to show everybody what Donald  Trump has been tweeting.  The president just tweeted this moments ago.  If  UC Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent  people with a different point of view, no federal funds?\"</p><p> Wow, the president is pretty aggressive in terms of coming out and saying,  look, there are consequences for what you're doing.  No federal funding?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that President Trump was watching Fox and Friends first  this morning because Todd Starnes was on and had like a one-minute, two- minute commentary.  That's exactly what Todd Starnes said on Fox and  Friends first roughly an hour ago.</p><p> So I'm not saying that the president is getting his ideas from Mr. Starnes,  but it's exactly what Todd was talking about.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is a big issue though.  How much money are we talking  about in terms of what the federal government could hold back for  university?  We don't have those numbers.</p><p> ORTAGUS:  When you at the pictures that you're showing of the protest, it  looks pretty violent.  So I think that Berkeley would argue.  We cancel  that to keep the students safe.  Because it's incredibly violent.  You saw  fires and just watch it for yourself.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How does he get that out of control?  Where is the leadership  to stop it from getting out of control and putting things on fire at a  university?</p><p> KIERNAN:  Yes.  I think it could become a lot calmer.  If you look at how  UC Davis handle it, they just canceled it.  That's a better way to go</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When we come back, what is in a name?  How Elon Musk is  rebranding Tesla motors after closing a new deal.</p><p> And then we've got an eye on earnings this morning.  Facebook beating  expectations last night.  Wall Street's looking for Amazon to deliver next.   We've got the growth story on Amazon coming up.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets looking lower this morning.  But  Facebook certainly one to watch.  Take a look at the shares this morning.   The company reporting a strong fourth quarter last night, easily topping  analysts' expectations.</p><p> Company's revenue up a staggering 51 percent year-over-year in the quarter.   It was not all good news for the company though.  Jury sided against his  Oculus brand in a lawsuit ordering it to pay $500 million to game maker  ZeniMax.</p><p> Joining us \"Wall Street Journal\" chief economic correspondent, Jon  Hilsenrath on that.  Jon, good morning to you.</p><p> JON HILSENRATH, CHIEF ECONOMIC CORRESPONDENT, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Good  morning, Maria.  It's all about tech yesterday and today.  We've got Amazon  coming up later.  And it looks like they're going to pump out blowout  numbers too.</p><p> It's amazing to me that you have companies like Facebook and Amazon which  are such a huge scale already.  Amazon with almost 1.9 billion users around  the world and it's pumping out 51 percent revenue growth numbers.  To be  that big and growing that fast is just really transformative.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.  And we're talking about Amazon a lot because it  is incredibly successful.  Look at the stock today and look at the business  getting into all different industries.  What do you think, Peter?</p><p> KIERNAN:  Well, it's interesting, isn't it?  That the very month that  Amazon takes over from Macy's as the number one seller of apparel, there's  a changing in the guard there.</p><p> And the thing that strikes me is Amazon went public exactly 20 years ago  and that stock is up 42,000 percent.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Since the IPO?</p><p> KIERNAN:  So if you put $1,000 in, it would be $420,000 today.  It's been  an extraordinary company way beyond e-tailing.  And the thing I saw in a  research report recently that I like is, somebody said it's a great company  and by the way, it does not compete with Amazon.</p><p> So it's becoming a benefit not to be in a competitive view of Amazon.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  It reminds me a lot of Wal-Mart in the night 1990s and that  Wal-Mart wasn't just a retailer.  It became a logistics powerhouse.  The  way it dealt its warehousing networks and technology to move products.   That's what Amazon is really leading the show right now.  They're investing  so much in robotics, in warehousing and getting products to people  overnight.</p><p> They're more than just a retailer.  They're really at the vanguard of  logistics information</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to point out that Wal-Mart actually just rolled out a  free shipping program for every single order and you don't have to like pay  a subscription fee.  Minimum $35 purchase but free two-day shipping to  anybody in the United States.</p><p> So Wal-Mart has enough at least on the retail side to try and compete with  Amazon.  Maybe not the apparel selection, but they're even focused on that.   You saw that over the holidays.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They've got to come up with things like free shipping.  They're  on their heels because Amazon is -- and we didn't even talk about original  content.  Those are competing but with movie company.</p><p> KIERNAN:  They're behind Manchester by the Sea and some of the Academy  award nominations.  And so they are really looking at this world in a very  broad gauge.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  Jon Hilsenrath, let me ask you.  Any thoughts from  the fed meeting and what you heard from Janet Yellen yesterday?  And I want  to ask you about this meeting with the president on Friday.  Several CEOs  headed to the White House tomorrow.  JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon among them.   Bob Iger, Walt Disney, Dr. Toby Cosgrove, as well CEO of IBM Ginni Rometty  and Larry Fink from BlackRock.  What do you expecting?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, on the fed meeting, they're in a wait-and-see mode.  And  what I find most interesting and what I've been debating with colleagues  about for the last few days is whether the fed is on a collision course  with Donald Trump.</p><p> Janet Yellen thinks that we're going to have around two percent growth over  the next few years.  Donald Trump wants four percent growth.</p><p> Now, if we get this faster growth is the fed get accommodated?  As far as  what the fed does next, I think really a lot depends on the jobs numbers.   We're going to get pretty good wage growth numbers on jobs on Friday and  that could keep the -- move the fed towards its next rate increase.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we got a great number, that's for sure.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  The CEO meeting, this president has made a lot of promises  that he's going cut back regulation and that he's going to achieve tax  reform.</p><p> And I think the market has been very excited about that.  At some point  this year we have to see whether he delivers.  One of the things you have  to think about what this whole visa debate and immigration that's going on  right now, that's more regulation, it's not less regulation.  I wonder what  kind of pushback he's going to get from the CEO meeting on that point.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's probably the ones taking points for sure.  Real quick,  Peter.</p><p> KIERNAN:  The one thing that I think is you predicted accurately.  I think  there's going to be a war.  It's coming between Yellen and Trump.  She sees  growth at one-way, he sees another, inflation is coming.  It's going to be  over the dollars that they fight and it's right around the corner.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Jon Hilsenrath, good to see you, sir.  Thank you.   We will see you soon.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, former chief executive of ExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson  sworn in as secretary of state yesterday.  But education secretary nominee  Betsy DeVos still facing roadblocks.  We'll get into it next.</p><p> And then striking gold.  How a man from Kansas won Super Bowl tickets for  life.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Welcome back.  We're happy  you're with us.  </p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, February 2.  Your top stories  right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> President Trump's cabinet finally gaining another member -- Rex Tillerson  sworn in as the next secretary of state yesterday after he was approved by  the Senate in a 56 to 43 vote.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is where you were meant  to be, right here today, at this crossroads in history.  It's time to bring  a clear-eyed focus to foreign affairs, to take a fresh look at the world  around us and to seek new solutions grounded in very ancient truths.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The very latest on the continuing confirmations coming up this  morning.  President Trump honors a hero yesterday making an unannounced  trip to receive the remains of the first service member lost during his  presidency.  </p><p> He went with his daughter, Ivanka Trump.  The president just tweeting  moments ago, \"Attending Chief Ryan Owens' dignified transfer with my  daughter, Ivanka, was my great honor.  To a great and brave man, thank  you.\"  </p><p> What is in a name -- why a deal (ph) has decided to take out the motors  coming up?  We will tell you about it.   </p><p> And then the broader market looking like this, futures indicating a lower  opening for the broader averages today.  We're once again on earnings watch  today.  </p><p> And we are one day ahead of the job's numbers out tomorrow.  Dow  Industrials expected down about 50 points, NASDAQ under some selling  pressure as well, down 17 points, although Facebook is trading up, Amazon  expected to report earnings after the close tonight.  </p><p> Take a look at the Eurozone indices right now.  Markets are mixed this  morning in Europe.  The FTSE 100 is up, the DAX index in Germany is down,  all fractional there, FTSE up a third of a percent.  </p><p> In Asia, declines across the board -- take a look -- Nikkei average in  Japan, worst performer, down one and a quarter percent.  Well, this price  is anything but light -- how one canvas (ph) man won Super Bowl tickets for  life -- why we are showing you the Bud Light can when we tell you this,  though, we will explain.  </p><p> And will he or won't he -- we will take you to Pennsylvania later this hour  to see if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow.  Will we get a sooner spring?  </p><p> We will tell you.  Coming up, though, first, Rex Tillerson was sworn in as  secretary of state last night.  President Trump took to Twitter just a few  minutes ago to congratulate him.  </p><p> Here is what President Trump writes, \"Congratulations to Rex Tillerson on  being sworn in as our new secretary of state.  He will be a star.\"  </p><p> This, as Trump's nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos is facing  trouble -- two GOP members saying that they will vote against her.  Joining  us right now is the Forbes Media Chairman and former Republican  presidential candidate himself, Steve Forbes.  </p><p> Steve, good to see you.  </p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  First, let's -- we've got a  lot to talk to you about.  We want to talk about tax reform as well.  </p><p> But let's talk Betsy DeVos for a moment.  What do you make of these  challenges -- two GOP senators? </p><p> FORBES:  Well, on the case, in the case from the senator of Alaska, Lisa  Murkowski, she owes the National Education Association big time when she  lost the primary in 2010.  She had a successful write-in (ph) campaign to  win the general election.  </p><p> The NEA was critical for that.  They called her that cheat (ph).  And Susan  Collins of Maine, she goes her own way.  </p><p> I think they'll get her through.  If they don't, there's going to be  repercussions in the Republican Party because Betsy is seen as a real  reformer, school reformer. </p><p> If they can't get her through, boy, it's going to be hard to drain the  swamp of our education system.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So why, though?  What are the challenge?  Why are they pushing  back on Betsy DeVos?  </p><p> FORBES:  Because of the fierce opposition of teachers unions.  This will be  the first education secretary since Bill Bennett.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  She didn't realize (ph).</p><p> FORBES:  .back in the Reagan administration.  She knows these fights.   She's very effective in Michigan and Detroit in getting charter schools and  getting real choice.  </p><p> And she exposes the real hypocrisy.  How many members of Congress send  their kids or grandkids to Washington public schools?  Barack Obama didn't  do it.  </p><p> Yet, they're forcing kids to go on failing schools.  It's got to stop.  And  she will do every (AUDIO GAP) to stop.  </p><p> And (ph) she's been through these fights.  That's why they fear.  She's had  experience.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Is there anybody -- not to jump the gun, but is there anybody  who would be as much of a reformer as Betsy DeVos if she doesn't get  confirmed, Steve?  Is it a sign -- if she doesn't get confirmed, is it a  sign that the stranglehold and the kind of cartel that the unions have put  together in Washington will never be broken? </p><p> FORBES:  Yes, there are.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that is the ward, cartel.  </p><p> FORBES:  And it is a cartel -- bad cartel.  And there are good people out  there who have made some reforms in states like Arizona and elsewhere.  </p><p> But if she -- if Betsy DeVos goes down, it says the union is predominant.   And you've got elections coming up next year.  </p><p> Watch out Democrats because we will primary you if you even think of  supporting a real reformer.  So they -- and Republicans fear the NEA,  National Education Association as well.  </p><p> So the Trump administration has got to use (ph) political capital, get this  thing through because she also -- Betsy DeVos is a major figure in the  Republican Party.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.  </p><p> FORBES:  If you can't take care of your own big supporters who have done a  lot of work for the party, who've been pushing reforms that you like, what  does that say about other fights that are coming up? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But even more than that, she's got the goods.  I mean, she's a  school reformer.  </p><p> FORBES:  Absolutely.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> FORBES:  A record of reform.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Go ahead, Morgan. </p><p> ORTAGUS:  Do you think this has anything to do with her somewhat shaky  performance when she went for her confirmation hearing?  Because we have  seen people like Rex Tillerson and Mnuchin who have not had to go through  the confirmation process before, who gave really excellent testimony before  the Hill, were incredibly well-prepared.  </p><p> I think even her, you know, fiercest allies would say it was a shaky  performance.  </p><p> FORBES:  Yes, but what -- what that does is simply give a cover for what  was going to happen anyway.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right (ph).  </p><p> FORBES:  The NEA knows this is a big, big battle.  And they are going to  find any excuse for their husband or her -- anything they could latch onto  to find an excuse to say, kill this nomination.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  Do you see this as the existential threat to the teachers union?   And do you think Mike Pence is going to have to step in and save the day  here? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because we've got these two, you get 50-50 and then Mike Pence  would -- would -- would lead.  </p><p> FORBES:  Yes, well, Pence will be glad to do it.  He -- he's been fighting  these battles.  </p><p> He was governor of Indiana.  He was in Congress before that.  So he  absolutely knows what these stakes are.  </p><p> And with high technology coming along, reformers now have more weapons to  break this monopoly.  And so I think the -- the unions know they've got to  try to stop this.  </p><p> And that's why they've -- even on the state level, they fight fiercely any  kind of reform.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's your take on judge Gorsuch?  Yesterday's meeting about  the Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump encouraged  Senate Republicans to go nuclear to get the nominee approved.  Listen to  this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  If we end up with a Senate gridlock that they've had in Washington  for the last -- longer than eight years, in all fairness to President  Obama, a lot longer than eight years, but if we end up with that gridlock,  I would say, if you can, Mitch, go nuclear, because that would be an  absolute shame if a man of this quality was caught up in the web (ph).  So  I would say it is up to Mitch.  </p><p> But I would say go for it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Trump also saying he would support the approval of Gorsuch with  51 votes instead of the traditional 60 that are required.  That's the  nuclear option.  </p><p> Steve, what do -- what do you think? </p><p> FORBES:  This is a case where that might not be necessary because in the  case of Gorsuch, one, he is so well-qualified.  What I like about him, for  example, is his understanding of the threat of what they call the  administrative regulatory state, where agencies make laws instead of  Congress.  </p><p> And -- but the Democrats are going to have a hard time really getting real  traction against him.  And it doesn't change the real composition of the  Supreme Court.  </p><p> So I think they -- they could peel off enough Democrats because the  Democrats are going to want to preserve the filibuster if the (ph)  nomination comes up that could -- could change the complex of the Supreme  Court, the ideological complexion.  They want to save it for that, to break  that nominee who is so well-qualified, who doesn't change the composition  of the court, they are probably going to save their power (ph) for another  day.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Before we move on, could we talk about tax reform for a moment?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes (ph).  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, we were all in on tax reform.  And we thought that this  was happening sooner rather than later.  </p><p> Now, we're talking about a tax package, reform package, second half of the  year.  And we're talking about a border adjustment tax.  </p><p> Steve Forbes, where are we on this? </p><p> FORBES:  This is where President Trump is going to have to step in and say,  enough of this other stuff.  We've got to get these nominees through and  all that good stuff.  </p><p> But we're here as a tax package.  Move on it.  And this so-called border  adjustment tax, which is a national sales tax in imports -- hugely  destructive to this economy.  </p><p> Leave it out.  Go for a pure tax cut package, cut tax rates, do some  simplification, ram it through and make it retroactive through January 1.   Politically.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what he promised us.  </p><p> FORBES:  And he's got to move on it because politically, if people don't  feel right away that this new president is delivering on a better economy,  better paychecks, new investments coming, they're going to have a much  harder time as opposition gains ground against this administration.  He's  got to understand that his opponents are out -- talk about nuclear, to  destroy him in an impeachment.  </p><p> And he'd better get as much political capital, a good economy as Bill  Clinton discovered does wonders when you get in trouble.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's -- that's the whole -- that's the whole game plan from  the Democrats, is to bog this president down.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  .at -- at every turn and bait him rather than focusing on making  people's lives better.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" put it so brilliantly in  its editorial page about a week ago that every decision out of that White  House has to be scrubbed with does it help grow the economy, does it  improve people's lives, does it grow their wages, period.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that was his priority the whole campaign.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Growth, growth, growth.  But my worry is it's not just the  Democrats.  It's Paul Ryan.  </p><p> He's in the border adjustment tax in the GOP plan.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, it is.  Yes.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  From last year.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  From last year.  </p><p> FORBES:  Yes.  And then this is what's so strong.  You know, the EPA was  doing its job but find out why it is that people like Paul Ryan go to  Washington and then come up with this kind of cool aid (ph) tax increase.  </p><p> And you know, what are they drinking down there, breathing (ph) down there?   It's a destructive tax.  Leave it out.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Will they, though, do?  I mean, I know what you're.</p><p> FORBES:  FORBES:  They -- they -- they.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  recommending.  </p><p> FORBES:  Yes, they.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you think that's where this is going? </p><p> FORBES:  You know, this is where the president has to step in and say, cut  it out, leave it out.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  I think the cooler (ph) heads, when he meets with the CEOs today,  are going to say, this thing is destructive to what you're trying to do.   Cut the corporate tax rate.  </p><p> Go with the pure basis he came up.  And that will drive the economy.  </p><p> FORBES:  This is so bizarre.  They say, well, other countries hurt their  consumers with the sales taxes.  We should do the same thing.  No.  </p><p> It doesn't (ph) make this difference.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I said that yesterday about -- Steve, I was like, here is Steve  Forbes on the border adjustment tax.  It's horrible.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> Of course, you don't speak that way.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Just no.  Great stuff.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> FORBES:  Thank you, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Steve Forbes there.  We want to bring you this tweet -- the  president just tweeting again.  Here is what he said this morning.  </p><p> \"Iran has been formally put on notice for firing a ballistic missile.   Should have been thankful for the terrible deal with the U.S. made with  them.  </p><p> Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along  and gave it a lifeline in the form of the Iran deal, a hundred and $50  billion,\" yes, in cash.  We will have more on this at the top of the hour.  </p><p> President Trump tweeting about Iran and -- and this most recent upset --  we'll get into it next.  Coming up, reaching new speeds -- AT&amp;T announcing  its ultra-fast wireless network is coming to U.S. cities later this year.  </p><p> We will tell you where.  And then Beyonce breaking the internet -- the  pregnancy announcement that everybody is talking about this morning, back  in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Want to show you markets this morning.  We're  looking at a lower opening for the broader averages.  </p><p> Take a look -- Dow Industrials down about 50 points.  We do have the jobs  number out tomorrow for the month of January.  </p><p> A couple of names we're watching -- AT&amp;T, announcing plans to launch its 5G  wireless services in two cities this year.  These rollouts will take place  in Austin and Indianapolis and will offer speeds nearly 40 times faster  than standard cellular service.  </p><p>AT&amp;T stock up nearly 70 percent year-over-year.  We're watching Abercrombie  &amp; Fitch.  The company has named Fran Horowitz as its new CEO.  </p><p> Horowitz will be Abercrombie's first CEO since Michael Jeffries stepped  down.  That was in 2014.  Abercrombie's stock down 56 percent over the last  year, as you can see from that one-year chart.  President Trump and  daughter, Ivanka, made an unannounced trip to Dover Air Force Base  yesterday to honor the returning remains of a U.S. Navy SEAL killed in a  weekend raid in Yemen.  </p><p> Lauren Simonetti with details now.  </p><p> Lauren?  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Hi, Maria.  William \"Ryan\" Owens from Peoria, Illinois, died in  the raid.  And Trump met with the Owens family during his two-hour visit to  the base.  </p><p> Owens was the first known U.S. combat casualty in a mission ordered by the  new president.  Three other service members were wounded. </p><p> And more than a half a dozen militant suspects were also killed in that  raid in al-Qaeda compound.  The dead included the eight-year-old daughter  of a radical clerk and U.S. citizen who was killed by a drone strike six  years ago.  </p><p> Well, Tesla Motors is dropping the motors.  The name changed to Tesla Inc.,  shows the company's ambitions to move beyond just selling high-end electric  cars and shifting into energy products like solar panels and home  batteries.  </p><p>Tesla agreed to buy Solar City, if you remember, for over two and a half  billion dollars back in November.  Well, here is one beer run that won't be  forgotten ever.  </p><p> Over the holidays, this guy, Lyle Randa, of Wichita, Kansas, he ran out to  buy some Bud Light during a family party.  And as he was restocking cans  from the pack into the refrigerator, he noticed that one was gold, meaning  that he was eligible for Bud Light's Super Bowl tickets for life  sweepstakes.  </p><p> Well, as luck would have it, Randa was actually chosen from 37,000 people  to win the grand prize -- Super Bowl tickets for the rest of his life.  And  he is now on his way to Houston for Super Bowl 51 on Sunday right here on  Fox.  </p><p> And finally, check this out, Beyonce shattering even more records with this  photo on Instagram, revealing the news that she is expecting twins.  This  picture is now the most liked post of all time, receiving over seven and a  half million likes since yesterday.  </p><p> Selena Gomez previously held that title.  She had over six million likes  for that photo with the lyrics of her song on the Coke bottle.  </p><p> But back to Beyonce's picture, I don't get the getup.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I don't get it (ph).</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Veil, the flowers.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  And the -- and the veil. </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Can anybody help me out? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's -- that's her pregnant with twins.  That's me after  lunch.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> SIMONETTI:  I don't think so, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm not wearing that.  I'm taking (ph) the photo of it.   But.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The immaculate conception. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, wow.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congratulations, Beyonce.  Coming up, it is Groundhog day.   Those who plan to celebrate in Punxsutawney may want to crawl in a hole  when they see their hotel bill -- how prices rival those in Houston for the  Super Bowl.  </p><p> Yes, back in a minute.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is Groundhog day today.  That means it is  that time of the year when the country watches to find out whether we will  have an early spring or six more miserable weeks of cold and snow.  </p><p>Fox News meteorologist, Janice Dean, is live this morning in Punxsutawney,  Pennsylvania.  </p><p> Hey, Janice.  </p><p> JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria.  We are live in  Punxsutawney.  This is my first Groundhog Day here.  </p><p> And it is exciting.  Phil is going to come out at 7:25 Eastern time.  Will  it be an early spring?  </p><p> We don't know.  But John Griffiths (ph) is here with me.  He is an official  Punxsutawney Phil handler.  </p><p> John, what do you think -- early spring today?  Can you give me any  indication? </p><p> JOHN GRIFFITHS, HANDLER, GROUNDHOG CLUB:  I -- we have no way of knowing  until he comes out of the stump.  He -- we -- we do not have a preconceived  notion on what it's going to be.  </p><p> DEAN:  Now, here is what I hear.  Phil is always right.  He is always  right.  But what happens -- sometimes, the media gets it wrong.  </p><p> And they say he's wrong.  </p><p> GRIFFITHS:  Well, mostly, it's our president.  He may misinterpret every  now and again.  </p><p> He's -- he's not quite fluent in groundhog ease (ph).  </p><p> DEAN:  Groundhog ease (ph) that he speaks. </p><p> GRIFFITHS:  Groundhog ease, absolutely.  </p><p> DEAN:  A lot of people don't speak that.  So it gets lost in translation.  </p><p> GRIFFITH:  First (ph), one person, our president, yes.  </p><p> DEAN:  OK, so tell me what your job is to handle.  </p><p> GRIFFITHS:  Basically, it's -- for this morning, it's to pull him out of  the stump and hold him up for the adoring fans.  </p><p> DEAN:  Yes.  </p><p> GRIFFITHS:  And then my partner will take him onto the stub (ph) and we'll  get his prediction.  Other than that, it's 365 days of feeding him and  cleaning his cage or zoo and.</p><p> DEAN:  And what about Mrs. Punxsutawney? </p><p> GRIFFITHS:  He does have a wife, Phyllis.  And she stays with them at -- at  the burrow, which is their zoo downtown.  </p><p> DEAN:  You know what I heard?  I heard that if he sees his shadow, it's six  more weeks of winter.  If he sees his wife, it's six more groundhogs.  </p><p> GRIFFITHS:  Could be.  </p><p> DEAN:  So 7:25.  This is a huge crowd here.  And I wanted to point out that  the -- the hotels here at Punxsutawney are more expensive than they are at  the Super Bowl.  </p><p> GRIFFITHS:  Yes, they are.  So that report myself, it kind of shocked me.   But you have to remember, we only have two in town so.</p><p> DEAN:  How many people are you expecting here today? </p><p> GRIFFITHS:  I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.  </p><p> DEAN:  How many people are you expecting here today? </p><p> GRIFFITHS:  Really, we never know because a lot of people come in from out  of the area.  They stay in surrounding towns.  </p><p> So we never know what's going to be here.  But I'll tell you what, it's a  great Thursday crowd here this morning, a lot bigger than what we  anticipated.  </p><p> DEAN:  More (ph) awesome.  </p><p> And the weather here, Maria, we're -- we're getting big fat snowflakes  right now.  So I don't know, maybe another six more weeks of winter.  We'll  have to find out.  </p><p> But of course, we'll give you the details when Phil comes out at 7:25  Eastern time.  Back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look at -- look at those gloves you're sporting.  You are  having the best time.  </p><p> It's amazing how many people are coming out for this, Janice.  And you just  said a minute ago that the hotel tickets are even more expensive than the  Super Bowl.  </p><p> But you're also being honored, right, into the Weather Discovery Center  Hall of Fame.

Thank you.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Always so much to talk about -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Donald Trump, President of the United States -- tweeting,  tweeting, tweeting.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tweeting, tweeting this morning on Iran, on -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The UC Berkeley protest.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes -- UC Berkeley protest.  That's what I was thinking of.   Well that was a horrible story, wasn't it?  We're going to get into it this  morning.</p><p> Joining the conversation this morning, the director of Center -- for the  Center for Politics at the University of Virginia Larry Sabato is with us.   The chief investment officer of CalPERS Ted Eliopoulos is here.  And Ohio  Congressman Tim Ryan, who of course, tried to go up against Nancy Pelosi  and lost that fight.  Former NFL star Jack Brewer also with us.  </p><p> Big hour ahead so stay right there with us ahead this morning.</p><p> We kick it off right now with the Trump administration, intensifying its  efforts to secure the southern border in spite of challenges.  President  Trump warned the Mexican president in a phone call that he was ready to  send U.S. troops to stop quote, \"bad hombres\" unless the Mexican military  takes action to control them, according to excerpts of a transcript  obtained by the Associated Press.</p><p> This is coming as Department of Homeland Security Secretary General John  Kelly sat down in an exclusive interview with Fox News' Catherine Herridge  to spell out a time line for that border wall.  Watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GEN. JOHN KELLY, U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  I think it'll be  built where it's needed most first and then fill it in.  </p><p> CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  Ok.</p><p> KELLY:  That's how I'm looking at it.  I really hope to have it done within  the next two years.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is former Minnesota governor, Tim  Pawlenty.  Governor -- good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  </p><p> TIM PAWLENTY (R), FORMER MINNESOTA GOVERNOR:  Good morning.  Good to be  with you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what's your take of the efforts to secure the border and  what a time line might look like?  How do you see it?</p><p> PAWLENTY:  Well, if you're going to have a country you've got to have  border integrity.  We don't on the southern border.  And I think enforcing  the border through a variety of means including enhancing with a wall is  appropriate.  And it's also good negotiating leverage, by the way.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  In terms of paying for it obviously, Governor, that's the  issue.  How do you see that working out?  I mean is this going to turn into  and escalate into a fight between the U.S. and Mexico since Donald Trump  has been pretty adamant in terms of Mexico paying for that wall.  </p><p> PAWLENTY:  It may turn into a fight or have a relationship tension but  think of the size and magnitude of it and the unilateral authority that  Donald Trump possesses.  The estimates for the wall range from $10 billion  to maybe as much $20 billion but spread over a number of years.  That's a  large number but in the context of federal spending it really isn't.</p><p> And by the way, Donald Trump can unilaterally impose surcharges, tariffs or  other potential taxes at the border that would allow him to claim Mexico is  either directly or indirectly paying for the wall.  So he's got a lot of  leverage to implement this as he's suggested or threatened.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, but that's the thing.  I mean this whole idea of an import  tax -- we have been talking a lot about it.  Do you agree with that because  we are trying to -- to see how he's going to implement his campaign promise  which is lower taxes?  You know, border adjustment tax flies right in the  face of that.</p><p> And I don't know.  How does that jive with what you're talking about in  terms of tax on Mexico products?  </p><p> PAWLENTY:  Well, I think you have to look at it this way -- in terms of the  revenues and the cost and the advantages.  The border adjustment tax or so- called BAT tax has been estimated depending on how you do it and how large  it is to raise as much as a trillion dollars over ten years.  There's a lot  of potential concern about the BAT tax but it is unquestionably a very  large revenue raiser.  </p><p> Grover Norquist has said if you then cut other taxes by at least that much  or more. so the net effect of the tax reform is neutral or positive in  terms of cutting taxes, that at least he would find it acceptable as a net  tax cut.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  You know, Governor, I have a question.  Just -- </p><p> PAWLENTY:  Yes.</p><p> KIERNAN:  -- when you look at it, it's 1,900-miles, some of it forbidden  landscape, very tricky.  How are we going to build that out over any kind  of reasonable time period?  Or will there be walls in some part and then  virtual walls, if you will, or heavily guarded?  How do you see that  unfolding?  </p><p> PAWLENTY:  As you know much of the border does have a wall on it already;  much of it does not.  Some of the remaining terrain as you mentioned is  very difficult including semi-mountainous regions and other problems.  And  by the way there's some land ownership rights in Texas as well along the  border so you're going to have to deal with some eminent domain issues as a  practical matter if they are really going to complete the effort in a  couple of years.</p><p> some of it is probably going to have to be physical structure, some of it  maybe drones, some of it may be electronics, some of it maybe more human  resources.  But obviously he's going to make a big piece of progress here  in the next 24 months.  And I think he's going to do it.  He's got the  ability to pay for it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is -- Governor, it's is Dagen McDowell -- this is one of  myriad issues that the Trump administration has tackled just in his first  little more than a week in the White House.  Do you worry given -- because  some things have gone well, some things not like the executive order on  some immigration, it wasn't rolled out with care, if you will.</p><p> Do you worry that this White House is getting bogged down with too many  things and that kind of central promise of tax reform and growing the  economy might be on the back burner?  </p><p> PAWLENTY:  I think you wouldn't describe his first week as bogged down.   You might describe it as hyper-energetic.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I just was talking about bogged down with tax reform --  that's it.  </p><p> PAWLENTY:  I understand.  I think that is a potential concern because that  is one of the main things and as has been said, you want to keep the main  things the main things.  I think the proof will be in the pudding if you  fast forward nine or 12 months if tax reform gets done, nobody is going to  remember that they were a little off message or a little off focus in week  number one or week number two.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Maybe not but the whole border tax -- border adjustment tax,  rather -- has that muddied the waters?  I mean has this become more  complicated than was promised?</p><p> PAWLENTY:  Keep in mind, it's the House Republicans that came up -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> PAWLENTY:  -- primarily with the border adjustment tax.  Donald Trump  actually was somewhat concerned about it a few weeks ago.  He has since  maybe has warmed up or his team has warmed up to it a little bit.  And  again Maria -- the trick is how do you do it?  The border adjustment tax  has got a lot of critics including people who think it's a camel's nose  under the tent to a VAT tax or a value-added tax.  </p><p> But again, until you see the other side of the ledger, the tax cut that  people are going to get, especially everyday Americans who are middle  income, in exchange for having to bear the burden of the BAT tax, let's  just see the other side of the ledger on the relief.  You really can't say  whether the package overall is a good idea or not.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  So do you think we will get tax reform this year  then -- Governor?  I mean that's what we are all wondering.  Because now we  are expecting that we know what it looks like in the first 200 days but  we're going to see implementation second half of the year.  Is that what  you think?  </p><p> PAWLENTY:  I think so.  Look, the Republican Congress and the leaders have  been salivating over tax reform for a decade.  This is their brief --  hopefully not brief but their shining moment to get it done.  And if they  don't, that's going to be a very big, you know, F on the report card.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're absolutely right.  I mean, you know, Kevin McCarthy and  Paul Ryan continue to say, look, we know what this window of opportunity  is, we are not going the waste it.</p><p> Let me switch gears -- Governor.  We want to ask you about Iran.  The White  House taking a strong stance against Iran after it tested ballistic  missiles in a show of aggression.  Listen to this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GEN. MIKE FLYNN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  President Trump has severely  criticized the various agreements reached between Iran and the Obama  administration as well as the United Nations as being weak and ineffective.   Instead of being thankful to the United States in these agreements, Iran is  now feeling emboldened.  As of today, we are officially putting Iran on  notice.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  \"On notice\" -- Governor.  And then President Trump tweeted out  this morning, here is what he said in his tweet today.  \"Iran has been  formally put on notice for firing a ballistic missile.  Should have been  thankful for the terrible deal that the U.S. made with them.  Iran was on  its last leg and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a  lifeline in the form of the Iran deal, $150 billion in cash.\"</p><p> The administration's next step against the country obviously still to be  determined, Governor, what does that mean to you, \"put on notice\"?  </p><p> PAWLENTY:  I think putting on notice that we are not going to tolerate  their menacing behavior and their violations of U.N. resolutions and  treaties is a good thing.  And frankly it's long overdue.</p><p> Iran has been engaged in menacing behavior with respect to U.S. military  assets in the region, our allies' assets in the region.  They've been  flirting with violating the nuclear treaty.  They've been thumbing their  nose at U.N. resolutions including the ballistic missile resolution.  And  they've been coddled.</p><p> And bullies respect strength and not weakness and I think a declared  statement from President Trump and General Flynn is long overdue and  exactly on point.  And they only will respect strength.  And they didn't  see that unfortunately in the Obama administration.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> ORTAGUS:  Governor -- I couldn't agree with you more on the importance of  setting a new tone with Iran and what this new administration will do.   When you look at the JCPOA, the Iran deal, it's a multiparty agreement.   It's not a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and Iran.</p><p> So what are the practical steps that you think that the President and his  team can take to either can they amend this deal or what can they do going  forward to have it more than just putting them on notice?  </p><p> PAWLENTY:  Well, they can do a number of things.  First of all, if they are  trying to warm up our relationships with Russia, Russia has very important  relationships with Iran.  So exploring how Russia could be helpful in this  dynamic maybe of some value, although I'm skeptical of Russia as well.</p><p> Number two, when Iran does things like take runs at our ships in the  region, you have to tell them, you do that again, we are going to light you  up.  We're going to fire back.  Or we're going to fire at you.</p><p> And next when you violate the ballistic missile treaty, we are going to put  sanctions on.  And if the world community won't do it, we will do it  ourselves as the U.S.  But I think you've got to work with the allies and  try to get everybody to do it.</p><p> And then lastly, you have to look them in the eye and say if you violate  that nuclear treat, there are going to be more consequences. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> PAWLENTY:  But this idea that -- we have agreements that nobody enforces  means the agreements themselves don't mean anything and that becomes a very  dangerous world.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How is President Trump doing so far in your view -- Governor?  </p><p> PAWLENTY:  Well, I was a Trump supporter.  I became a skeptic after some of  the revelations during his campaign.  But I have to say he's off to a  strong start.  And I'm hopeful for how he does from here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Governor -- good to see you.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> PAWLENTY:  You're welcome.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Governor Tim Pawlenty there.</p><p> Coming up next, IBM super computer Watson using its smarts to file your  taxes -- how it can help you find deductions that you may have missed.  </p><p> And then one secret McDonald item coming out of hiding -- the fan favorite  sweet treat that is now officially on the menu.</p><p> Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> A mysterious military vehicle that carried a large Trump flag in Kentucky  belongs to the Navy.</p><p> Lauren Simonetti has the story now with other headlines -- Lauren.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey Maria.  </p><p> So a Navy official reportedly saying this vehicle spotted on Sunday flying  a blue Trump flag near Louisville was from a Navy Seal unit.  Now that's a  problem because regulations do not permit an unauthorized flag on a  military vehicle.  Officials have launched an inquiry to determine if any  misconduct can be linked to this incident.</p><p> Well, it's tax season and H&amp;R Block can help you out before you pull out  your hair.  It's using IBM's super computer Watson and its data-crunching  skills to answer customer questions to hopefully help tax filers score  better refund.  H&amp;R Block is betting big on this partnership airing a  commercial during the Super Bowl on Sunday to advertise.</p><p> There's a day care in Texas telling parents get off your phones.  One mom  is picking up her kid at that day care right outside of Houston when she  spotted a new sign on the door reading this.  \"You're picking up your  child, get off your phone.  Your child is happy to see you.  Are you not  happy to see your child?\"</p><p> It goes on from there.  The woman told Fox News that she completely agrees  with the message.  She said she happened to have her phone in her hand, of  course, and decided to snap a picture of it and share it with her friends.   Well, it went viral and has now been shared on Facebook more than 1.2  million times.</p><p> St. Patrick's day right around the corner which means it's McDonalds  shamrock shake season.  And this year there's something new.  The shamrock  shake has been a seasonal favorite at Mickey D for 40 years now but this  year you can get a chocolate shamrock shake.  Up to now you have to ask a  McDonald's staffer to add chocolate if they would do it.  It was at their  discretion, but now it's regular menu item during the season.  McCafe  Shamrock Chocolate Shake is the original Shamrock shake mixed with  chocolate syrup and topped off with mint sprinkles, whipped cream and a  cherry.  McDonalds is also adding a Shamrock chocolate chip Frappe and a  shamrock hot chocolate and shamrock mocha.  That's a lot of shamrocks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.  Too much chocolate.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  I know.  Too much chocolate -- that's a sugar rush for me.  But  you can only get it for a limited time, so if you're interested, go soon.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  Have you tried it -- Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've had a shamrock shake years ago but like -- I generally try  to stay away from things that if you drink one glass of it, it's basically  your daily caloric intake.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p> KIERNAN:  Not to mention green teeth all day.  That's a set back.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO: What do you mean?  It's like 3,000 calories or something?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, it's not 3,000.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  2,000.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Generally it's just -- I'm not a milk shake kind of gal.  I  would rather eat like a piece of cake.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  With green dye in there.</p><p> We are taking a look at the markets next; IPO market in particular.  What  to expect from Snap upcoming.</p><p> Public debut -- we are seeing a couple more IPO's after a long stretch of  weakness there.</p><p> And then we are just minutes away from Punxsutawney Phil's Groundhog Day  prediction.  How long do you expect winter to last?  We will tell you next  in Pennsylvania, live. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Listen to this.  Punxsutawney Phil is about to make his  prediction.  Let's take a look.</p><p> [LIVE COVERAGE OF PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL] </p><p> KIERNAN:  They're done.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  As expected -- we are live in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania and we  just saw the program take place where the groundhog saw his shadow.  That  means six more weeks of winter is expected.  And we thought we were going  to get an early spring.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  I was ready to sign up for it, yes.</p><p> ORTAGUS:  Dagen, can I stay with you in Miami for a weekend?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Unfortunately we work here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Signs of life meanwhile in the IPO market.  Invitation Homes  started trading yesterday.  That was the largest offering in over a year.   But the IPO Wall Street is waiting for the IPO is Snapchat -- that filing  expected any day now.</p><p> Joining us right now is Deven Parekh.  He's managing director at Insight  Venture Partners.  Good to see you -- Deven.  Thank you so much for joining  us.</p><p> DEVEN PAREKH, INSIGHT VENTURE PARTNERS:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How would you characterize the IPO market right now?  You  invest in private companies?  </p><p> PAREKH:  Correct.</p><p> So the IPO market in 2016 was very weak.  It was the weakest since the  financial crisis.  But I think you saw signs of life at the end of 2016,  you're starting to see strength early in the year.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you think Snap sort of snaps everything out of it?  I mean  is that the kind of deal that could get the action moving again in the IPO  market?</p><p> PAREKH:  I think the answer is yes, if you look back two weeks.  You had  AppDynamics which was about to go public and got taken out by Cisco.  It  basically doubled the price of the projected IPO price.  That, I think gave  people a lot of confidence that investors and companies are still looking  for growth.</p><p> The real problem in the IPO market if you look back really is more of a  supply problem than a demand problem.  If you talk to public investors,  they are still very interested in investing in growth.  </p><p> If you take the Internet category, to use Snapchat as an example, there's  164 public Internet companies between a billion and $10 billion dollar  market cap, only nine of them have a growth rate of greater than 30  percent. So there's just not a lot of things to invest in at scale which you need if  you're a large investor.  And Snapchat clearly fulfills that requirement. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's interesting because you would think that when you're  looking for growth it's in tech.</p><p> PAREKH:  It is in tech but if you look at scale, lots of smaller companies  but scale companies, again, between the market capital of a billion and $10  billion, only nine companies to invest in.  Software -- same metrics, only  eight companies to invest in.</p><p> KIERNAN:  So Deven, you talked about a kind of dull period in '15 and '16.   After 2014 was $86 billion, $88 billion, is Snapchat which could be the  second largest U.S. tech IPO ever.  Is it going to be that kind of  triggering event that lights up the market again?  </p><p> PAREKH:  I think it's going to get credit for doing that but I think it was  happening anyway.  What I mean by that is if you look at the IPO backlog  for software and Internet companies, it's growing.  If you talk to any  investment banker you're going to hear that they are busier than they have  been in a very long time, getting companies ready.  We have a lot in our  portfolio really going right now.</p><p> Snapchat because they'll end up having been the first major one, I think  AppDynamics might have gotten a lot of the credit had they gone up and  traded up 100 percent.  Because Snapchat is the next major it'll likely get  the credit but the fundamentals going into 2017 were pretty strong for the  IPO market regardless.  </p><p> ORTAGUS:  There's a report out on Re/Code that five of the major tech  companies among others -- Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Uber, Stripe -- are  writing a letter and they're going to give it to the President opposing the  immigration ban which I think this would be the first formal letter from  CEOs that are from the tech community to the President on this policy.   What's your take on that?  </p><p> PAREKH:  Well, I think if you look at the tech industry, we have a huge  demand for skilled workers particularly around, you know, coding and areas.   And I think if you talk to anybody in the tech industry they would tell you  that they want to solve a long-term structural problem that we have which  is we don't have enough domestic pipeline of that talent.</p><p> That, however, is not a problem we are going to solve in a month or two.   And so to put a -- to put a ban in place that potentially stops these  companies from hiring people that are in this country, often educated in  this country, and make it not possible for them to work here, I don't think  it's long-term good for the growth of those companies which I think is  frankly not long-term good for the growth of the overall economy.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do these companies though realize because the leadership and a  lot of the executives in Silicon Valley were adamantly opposed to Donald  Trump as the presidential candidate.  They actively raised a lot of money  for Hillary Clinton, but now they're caught.</p><p> Do they realize -- are they in Washington trying to hire people who have  better relationships with the GOP and within the Trump administration?   I've heard that from people that these companies -- because they had an  easy ride in terms of policy with the Obama administration, now they're  worried.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  They are trying to hire conservatives.  </p><p> PAREKH:  Look -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Google was hiring like a conservative liaison before -- after  the election.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So is media.  Look at NBC News and look at CNN.  </p><p> PAREKH:  I think all these companies understand that elections have  consequences -- right.  And the policy framework going into this  administration is not going to be the same.  They are going to try to no  doubt build relationships and hire people with more conservative  credentials to deal with the administration.  I don't think there's a  debate there.</p><p> I also don't think there's a debate that these companies have about  improving national security.  I think this is really the tech folks in  particular talking about an area where there's massive supply and demand  imbalance between the talent that we need and the talent that's available.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  Yes.  And even if you exceed that, something in me tightens at  the notion of having a few less programmers from Yemen and Syria and some  of these countries.  I don't think this is a robust supply, so something  about their totality doesn't work for me that I don't think that's where  the real talent they're looking for is coming from.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  </p><p> PAREKH:  Right.  And I think if you think though -- I think the broader  concern is -- I mean the policies haven't come out yet but looks like  there's going to be reevaluation of how H1-Bs work as well.  And that's  probably where the real problem lies for most of these companies.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How should it look?  </p><p> PAREKH:  Well look, the H1-B program was basically created to make sure  that if you had talent that was not readily available in the U.S., that  that talent could come here and be gainfully employed.  And I think the  concerns that some have had is that H1 visas have been gamed and that  people have been coming here that where there are people that are in this  country that could provide the same service.</p><p> I'm not saying that there's not some cases of that, I'm sure there is.  But  in total that's not the case.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There are cases where companies, and we've heard about it on  this very program, where companies will bring in overseas workers on H1-B  visas and they will have the existing employees who are in the United  States train these people and then fire them.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There are certainly instances -- </p><p> PAREKH:  Yes.  I'm not going -- I'm not going to say -- and I don't think I  or anybody in the tech industry is for that from a policy standpoint.  So  if we can solve that, I don't think anyone is going to dispute that.</p><p> But I think there's a broader -- there's a broader issue around  particularly in some of the highly-skilled areas, we just don't have enough  people graduating in those programs in this country.  </p><p> ORTAGUS:  That's the problem, right.  I mean that's the fundamental  problem.  </p><p> PAREKH:  That's absolutely a problem.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Once again it goes back to education.  </p><p> ORTAGUS:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Half a million unfilled jobs according to the CEO of GoDaddy.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  Yes.  And if we can fill up these and just sell 50,000 of those,  if the companies want them so much, why don't you ask the companies to pay  for it.  If you want that visa slot, by the way, that person can train the  young person from the United States.  You can put all kinds of hooks into  it to make sure that it makes sense for the American people.  </p><p> PAREKH:  Look, I think there's lots of different solutions.  I think the  concern right now is that we are going towards -- we're going towards a  policy framework which is trying to stop this type of immigration in total.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We will see what that meeting and the letter  looks like from these technology CEOs.</p><p> Deven, good to have you on the show today.</p><p> PAREKH:  Good to have me.  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Deven Parekh joining us there.</p><p> Coming up, more immigration business on tap for the Trump administration --  the executive order that could be reexamining the visa programs.  We will  get more on that coming up next.</p><p> And then cocktails to go -- how you can shake up something, so exciting for  your flask.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Happy Thursday.  Welcome back everybody, I'm Maria Bartiromo  and it is Thursday, February 2nd, your top stories right now 7:30am on the  East Coast.</p><p> A busy day for President Trump once again today.  The commander-in-chief  set to attend the annual National Prayer Breakfast beginning just moments  from now, we will take you there live when he begin speaking.</p><p> This coming as new reports are surfacing this morning of a possible rift  with an American ally.  President Trump bashing President Obama's decision  to taking refugees from Australia.  The company's prime minister  responding.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MALCOLM TURNBULL, AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER:  I can only say as I've said  before that I received the assurance that I did from the president himself.   That assurance was confirmed by the president's spokesman in the briefing  room of the White House.  And our officials, our respective officials are  continuing to work on the implementation of the arrangements, that's the  position.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The very latest on the tensions coming up this morning.   Meanwhile, the president election win hitting one business hard.  While  Hillary Clinton lost is leading to a decline in ammo sales.</p><p> Earnings once again driving stocks this morning.  Amazon, the name to watch  set to report earnings after the close tonight.  Analysts are expecting a  big quarter given holiday sales.  The stock this morning looking higher on  Amazon.</p><p> Checking the broader market, Futures indicating a lower opening for the  broader average, take a look, DOW Industrials down about 40 points right  now.  This is off of the lowest of the morning nonetheless firmly in the  red.  NASDAQ down about 13 points.  In Europe, markets are mixed right now,  take a look at the euro zone averages and you see that the FTSE and the  CAC40 are both positive.  FTSE100 gaining strength in the last half an  hour, up two-thirds of one percent now, that's 40 points higher.  The DAX  Index still negative, that's just down by a fraction.  And in Asia  overnight, declines across the board to report.  The market in China still  closed for the Lunar Holiday.  The other average is down across the board.</p><p> Exams are the least of one student's worries.  The frigid bake mistake that  put a Massachusetts' teenagers weekend plans on ice.</p><p> Plus, get ready to bundle up, Punxsutawney Phil just making his groundhog  day prediction, listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL, GROUNDHOGS:  My faithful followers, I clearly see a  perfect clear shadow of me six more weeks of winner, it shall be.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Get ready for that.  We will have more on that coming up.  We  kick it off this half an hour though with the president and his stance on  religious issues.</p><p> The president is expected to speak at the National Prayer Breakfast today.   The Trump Administration released this statement earlier saying, \"The  president is proud to have been the first ever G.O.P. nominee to mention  the L.G.B.T.Q. community in his nomination acceptance speech.  Pledging  then to protect the community from violence and oppression.\"</p><p> Joining me right now is the Washington Times Columnists, Charles Hurt.   Charles, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> CHARLES HURT, WASHINGTON TIMES COLUMNIST:  Good to see you Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well it's true.  I mean the president had the opportunity to  firm up his stance on L.G.B.T.Q. rights today and he was the first G.O.P.er  to come out and have Peter Thiel for example have such a big spotlight  during his campaign.  What are you expecting from this breakfast?</p><p> HURT:  Well this is always a sort of a bipartisan affair and I expect -- I  would hope that this year would be no different.</p><p> But I think that Donald Trump has done a very good job.  He's not  particularly known as a particularly overtly religious guy but he has done  a very good job of pinpointing the importance of religious liberty and I  think that that is why he was able to win over so many religious  conservatives in the election and he's done it largely by putting all these  social issues and just sort of putting them off the side and focusing on  things that people actually care about and no matter what your background  you end up supporting these things.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean look, we'll take the audience there live when he  start speaking.  But even more of a headline this morning is the draft of  an executive order calling to reexamine a range of these programs, right?</p><p> And this new report is saying that they want to prioritize both jobs and  wages of the American workers, we do not have a specific industry that's  being pointed out here but it is rattling some firms, what's your take on  that particularly technology firms?</p><p> HURT:  Yes.  I was fascinated by your conversation earlier about this.  We  talk about -- these company executives talk about degree and workers from  overseas and all that's great, important but what about the untapped talent  in America in terms of -- of course, it would require education or it  requires looking at social policies, it require -- it's much more difficult  but wouldn't it be a lot better for America if we actually train people in  this country who are already Americans to do a lot of these jobs?</p><p> But, of course, politicians don't want to do that because they're always  looking for the easier path.  The second thing is on -- Donald Trump, he's  not -- not only is he not overtly religious, he's not a triply diplomatic  guy.  So he kind of rankles a lot of people around here with a lot of the  things that he says.  But for the first time, we're looking at a guy -- in  a long time, we're looking at a guy who looks at our immigration policy,  who looks at visa policies and he says, \"What's good for America?\"  Not  what's good for other countries.  He's not -- the big change between the  Obama Administration and this administration is that the Obama  Administration I think looked at immigration as a solution to other  people's problems.  And Donald Trump is looking at immigration as a  solution through America's problems.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In terms of religious liberty, Charlie, It's Dagen McDowell, the  nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court really speaks volumes about  that and, of course, we talked about that with the expectation of many  people who voted for Donald Trump.</p><p> But Gorsuch's protection of religious liberty and particularly how the  decisions were over the Affordable Care Act, whether it was Hobby Lobby and  the Little Sisters of the Poor.  That really speaks to Trump at least  protecting religious freedom.</p><p> HURT:  Absolutely.  And if there are any never Trumpers left today who are  still suspicious of whether Donald Trump will make good on the promises  that he made to get the republican nomination, nothing will convince him.</p><p>Neil Gorsuch -- the pick of Neil Gorsuch is the entire game as far as I'm  concerned.  Obviously, it's -- you're the Scalia seat, so you're not  shifting the balance of the court but if there is another vacancy and  Donald Trump picks another Neil Gorsuch who simply believes that the  constitution says exactly what it means, then that will be a tremendous  victory that republicans and conservatives haven't seen certainly out of  any republican presidents since at least Ronald Reagan and even he gave us  Justice Kennedy.</p><p> ORTAGUS:  But a lot of people were critical to be fair the past eight years  that President Obama had done so much through executive order and was not  going through the congress.  Do you think putting another executive order  out on immigration is the right way to go or should the president and his  team do the tough job -- an incredibly tough job of trying to get congress  onboard for immigration reform for something that's codified in the law and  that can't be undone by the next president?</p><p> HURT:  I'm sympathetic to that and I agree with you.  I think that's a good  point.  I would far rather these things go to the legislature but there is  per view of the president to do certain things.</p><p> The knock on President Obama though was not just the executive orders, it  was that he was actually changing laws that he had no business changing.   He's actually bypassing congress and nothing that Donald Trump has done so  far approaches anything like what President Obama did in terms of ObamaCare  and a lot of other things that he had no business tinkering with.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Peter.</p><p> KIERNAN:  Charlie, isn't the key to the point we're making earlier about  unfilled jobs essentially a talent management problem that what we have is  thousands -- hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs and people who may or  may not be trained to do those jobs, aren't there ways we can connect those  dots using community colleges and other community resources to make that  happen and isn't that really what the job of this administration is going  forward?</p><p> HURT:  I certainly think so.  But that obviously is very hard to do and  that's why politicians have just sort of ignored it for decades and that  they don't want to address the underlying problems that lead to that  because it does, it's not just education, it's social programs, it's  incentivizing people to work, it's all the things that -- politicians would  rather just give free stuff away, it's much easier.  And so that's why they  just turned to, \"Well let's just open the gates and get cheap labor from  abroad.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well what's your take on the conversation the president had  with the Prime Minister of Australia in terms of saying, \"Look, we don't  want these refugees and that deal was made with President Obama, not me.\"</p><p> HURT:  Yes.  Well Americans did elect the guy who is not very politic,  that's for certain.  He's not very diplomatic and but, again, it's another  example of where this is a president who's looking at immigration, looking  at all of this in terms of what's best for America as supposed to what's  best for other countries.</p><p> I think it's most fascinating that all of the stuff is getting leaked and  it's getting leaked by bureaucrats in the administration, their heads are  exploding and I think that that's exactly what we probably saw over the  weekend as well with all the turmoil over the extreme vetting.  And that  turned out to be not that big of a dig but it was a huge deal all weekend I  think largely because you had bureaucrats all over the federal government  doing everything they could to throw wrenches into the works to make it  look like this huge disaster that it turned out it really wasn't. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I was only laughing because you can hear Donald Trump on the  call saying, \"Come on, this is a dumb deal.\"</p><p> HURT:  Yes.  You felt you were watching an episode of The Apprentice.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It is funny.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But -- I mean -- but he say what he means.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's why he's got the fan club that he does because he just  speaks very clearly, it was dumb.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  Say what you mean and walk the talk and he does  both.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Charles, thank you.</p><p> HURT:  And then if he goes over the line, he -- okay, so he goes over the  line, he doesn't apologize for it.  That's my favorite thing about him.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Nope.  Nope.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Charles, thank you.  Charles Hurt joining us there.</p><p> HURT:  You bet.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, armed with political opinions, why Hillary Clinton's  election lost could be hurting ammunition sales.</p><p> And then one teenager finding herself in the deep end literally, take a  look at this picture of the icy situation she drove into, that's next.   Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tensions rising between police and protestors  over the Dakota Access Pipeline.  Lauren Simonetti with the details and  headlines now, Lauren?</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Hi Maria.  Police say they arrested 76 protestors who refused  to leave the camp that was set up on private property.</p><p> Authorities want that protestors to move to a safer area because the spring  floods will arrive soon.  But official say there was this group of rogue  protestors and they tried to set up another camp nearby where they weren't  supposed to.  Police said that since August, they've made about 700  arrests, these protestors do not want to see the Dakota Access Pipeline  completed because they say the oil it would carry could contaminate their  drinking water.</p><p> Well, could President Donald Trump be hurting sales of ammunition?  The CEO  of Winchester maker, Olin Corporation says gun retailers have been  reporting slower than expected sales of bullets and ammunition after the  election.  He said, before it, gun owners increased buying ammo because  they felt that Hillary Clinton would win and would enforce stronger gun  control.</p><p> Two teenage girls, check out this picture, miraculously not hurt after  crashing their car into that icy swimming pool.  Police say they're on  their way to school when their Lexus veered off the road, crashed through a  fence, and then plunged into an in-ground pool.  Now fortunately, the car  actually landed in the shallow end and the homeowners were nice.  Then with  the police, they helped the girls wave their way out of the waters who took  crews three hours to pull their car out.  Pretty unbelievable.  I'm glad  everybody's okay.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  What a shot.  What an accident.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  And was the pool covered?  I didn't even see a cover on that  pool unless it went down with the car.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know what happens with teenagers though?  I don't know  about that particular accident but they always hit the accelerator instead  of hitting the brake.  It's just so common --  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Oh, because they're new to driving.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, they're new to driving.  Yes.  Accelerator is not brake,  it happens all the time.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Big mistake there.</p><p> KIERNAN:  You need a bumper sign, \"I brake for pools.\"  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you remember the Toyota sudden acceleration problems?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The vast majority of that was related to people hitting the  accelerator, there was nothing wrong with the car.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  All right, coming up, spicy up your flasks, the  cocktails that could shake things up, we've got them, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are shaking things up this morning with  cocktails you can put in your pocket.</p><p> Joining us right now is Men's Journal Correspondent and Fort Defiance  Restaurant owner, St. John Frizell.  Good to see you St. John thank you so  much for joining us.</p><p> ST. JOHN FRIZELL, OWNER, FORT DEFIANCE RESTAURANT:  Good to see you, thanks  for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you brought some goodies here.  Your article in the March  issue of Men's Journal is giving tips on the best concoctions that you can  actually fit in a flask.</p><p> FRIZELL:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell us about that.</p><p> FRIZELL:  Well the idea is that flasks are fun to carry around and put  whiskey in but they're also fun to put like a cocktail in, it's a little  bit surprising when you're sharing it with somebody.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true because usually you don't do a mixed drink in a  flask.</p><p> FRIZELL:  Right.  But you can, there's no reason that you shouldn't.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Okay.  So what are your favorites?  </p><p> FRIZELL:  Well I brought a few here today.  This flask is filled with a  drink called the Ferrari.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The Ferrari?</p><p> FRIZELL:  Which is a drink that is like a bartender shot, in New York, it's  equal parts Fernet-Branca and Campari.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> FRIZELL:  And those are both very strong, bitter liquors but together they  go really nice. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's the Ferrari, okay.</p><p> FRIZELL:  That's the Ferrari.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you'll mix it up and then you put it in a flask or you just  -- because you want to carry the mixed drink in a flask.</p><p> FRIZELL:  That's right.  Yes.  All mixed up and ready to go.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What -- I mean, why do people carry flasks around?  I mean what  are flasks used for?</p><p> FRIZELL:  Well to me, it's a way to -- it's like a secret handshake.  You  don't carry it just for yourself, you carry it to share it.  So you slip it  out your pocket, you look at someone, you give them a little smile, a  little wink, you offer them a drink and all of a sudden you're drinking out  of the same vessel as somebody else, you don't really do that that often.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Okay.  Because oftentimes you're using it when  you're going on a trip but are these becoming more prevalent or becoming --  does it resonate with people more?</p><p> FRIZELL:  I hope so.  I think it's a classy thing to do.  You show up at a  party or a camping trip or something like that with one of these in your  pockets.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now I understand you have a special Mornings with Maria  cocktail that you created.</p><p> FRIZELL:  I do.  I do.  Yes, I'll show you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's see.  </p><p> FRIZELL:  So mornings are good, sparkly wine in the mornings is great.   This is a little Prosecco.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Okay.</p><p> FRIZELL:  And then Mornings with Maria is in this one, this is equal parts  Aperol and Combier triple sec.  So it's got like an orange flavor, it's a  little bit bitter but I think it will be nice, let's see.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Okay.</p><p> FRIZELL:  And it's nice and orange.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  So happy mornings.  Cheerful.  Cheerful color.</p><p> FRIZELL:  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's just Prosecco.  So it's Prosecco and the --  </p><p> FRIZELL:  And Aperol which is (inaudible) and the Combier which is an  orange liquor.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Okay.  Great.  And then this we'll put in a flask or --  </p><p> FRIZELL:  Yes.  Well you see --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why did you choose that for Mornings with Maria?</p><p> FRIZELL:  Well I like the colors.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  It is a good color.</p><p> FRIZELL:  And, yes, it's -- well, Aperol is a very popular morning drink.   There's a drink called the Aperol Spritz which is Aperol and Prosecco and a  little Seltzer and we sell a lot of those at Fort Defiance and this, we're  just upping the orange flavor a little bit to make it more like a Mimosa.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It looks good.  Well thank you for that.  Cheers.</p><p> FRIZELL:  I've got one more called the Diamond Back too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, the Diamond Back.</p><p> FRIZELL:  In this nice little (inaudible) flask.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Okay.</p><p> FRIZELL:  This is rye whiskey, yellow chartreuse, and apple brandy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Apple brandy?</p><p> FRIZELL:  Right here.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Okay. </p><p> FRIZELL:  And that one is named after a turtle, the Diamond Back Terrapin  from Maryland that bites like a snake.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really good stuff, bites like a snake.  Wow.  Okay.  Good to  see you St. John.  Thank you so much.</p><p> FRIZELL:  My pleasure.  Thanks for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Appreciate it very much and cheers to you.  We'll be right  back.  Still to come, we're talking President Trump said to speak at the  National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C., we are bringing you his  remarks live when we come right back right here at Mornings with Maria,  stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning everybody, welcome back.  Thank you so  much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday,  February 2nd.  Your top stories right now 8:00am on the East Coast.</p><p> We are waiting comments from President Trump this morning.  He is set to  speak at the National Prayer Breakfast momentarily.  We will take you back  there live in Washington as soon as he takes the podium.</p><p> Meanwhile, chaos on campus, take a look at these pictures, violent protests  breaking at UC Berkley over a speech from the conservative editor of  Breitbart forcing the cancellation of the event, watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I understand why people are upset for some reasons but  I mean for a campus that was originally a location to free speech movement,  it's kind of sad that we would resort to violent action.</p><p> MILO YIANNOPOULOS, BREITBART NEWS EDITOR:  Students who come to my talk  doesn't necessarily agree with me but just want to hear the other side.   They were prevented from doing so this evening by violent Trump elect,  elect that it's terrified at anyone who they think might be persuasive or  might be interesting or might take people with them.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The outrage this morning on the hills of that breakout.   Meanwhile, another member added to President Trump's cabinet, Former Exxon  Mobile CEO, Rex Tillreson has been confirmed and Sworn In as Secretary of  State.  This happened late yesterday.  Several other cabinet members  however are facing roadblocks, very latest on the confirmation process,  coming up.</p><p> A strong earnings report from Facebook, the stock is higher this morning,  the social media giant posted better than expected fourth quarter revenue.   Profit was also above expectations.  We're breaking down the numbers,  taking a look ahead to tonight's big number from Amazon.  Those Amazon  results after the close tonight, take a look at Facebook and Amazon this  morning.</p><p> Why the markets looking lower despite the strength in technology, take a  look, DOW Industrials down about 40 points.  The NASDAQ Composite also  weakened by about 12 points on the hills of gains yesterday.  In Europe,  mixed performances this morning, take a look at the euro zone indices and  you see the FTSE100 up two-thirds of one percent, the other major is  fractionally moving this morning.  And in Asia overnight, declines across  the board to report, China is still close for the Lunar New Year, however  the Nikkei average in Japan down one and a quarter percent.</p><p> Former President George H.W.

More  winter is on the way.  We heard from Punxsutawney Phil earlier and he did  see his shadow six more weeks of winter.  All that coming up this morning.   And joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell,  former Goldman Sachs partner and New York Times best-selling author Peter  Kiernan and Maverick PAC National Co-Chair Morgan Ortagus.  Good to see  you.  Were you laughing at me?</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PETER KIERNAN, NEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING AUTHOR:  Glad to be with you.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, you had your coat on at the break (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's a little chilly, and I'm still getting over that flu I had,  like, two weeks ago.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is right.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  Youth comes back fast.  Youth comes back fast, you've bounced  right back.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Youth?  Yes.  That's -- I  don't even -- I'm so beyond that.  I don't even know what that word means  anymore.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Come on.  We got -- we got a big show ahead.  Look, we've seen  the markets trade to the flat this year on the heels of the big rally after  election night.  We're going to talk with the chief investment officer  CalPERS coming up, how he's allocating hundreds of billions of dollars  right now, and you wonder if in fact he's expecting the strength in the  market to continue.  What we need to hear from President Trump and his  administration.</p><p> So, Ted Eliopoulos will weigh in.  He's the CIO of CalPERS.  Plus, Ohio  Congressman Tim Ryan is with us this morning.  Of course, he tried to go up  against Nancy Pelosi and lost that bid.  We'll talk with Tim Ryan about the  Democratically Party.  And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney  weighing in as always.  Along with former NFL Star Jack Brewer.  You don't  want to miss a moment of it.  We got a big hour ahead so stay with us this  morning.</p><p> And we kick it off with those violent protests last night erupting at the  University of California, Berkeley Campus, over a speech from conservative  editor, Milo Yiannopoulos.  Rioters started fires, they broke windows --  look at this, they confronted police, ultimately causing the event to be  canceled.  Joining us right now is the University of Virginia Center for  Politics Director Larry Sabato.  Larry, thanks very much for joining us.   And what do you have to say about this violence? </p><p> LARRY SABATO, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CENTER FOR POLITICS DIRECTOR:  Well,  as Peter Kiernan knows, I'm from the University of Virginia.  I've been  associated with university for 47 years, it is Thomas Jefferson's  University.  We believe in free speech, I've had literally a hundreds of  speakers that I've brought in to the university from right to left and  everything in between, I've never had a single problem.  So obviously, what  happened at Berkeley was wrong.</p><p> You've got lots of choices, you can boycott an event you don't like, you  can peacefully protester it, you can go and ask questions during the Q and  A period, you hold a counter event, what you should not do is to shut down  the actual event and deny someone the right to speak, if they've been  invited by a group and it's follow the rules of that university.  So, this  is not a good thing, but let's not overgeneralize, this is one university,  I'm sure it's happened elsewhere but there are plenty of universities, like  the University of Virginia not nearly as good but like they're like the  University of Virginia and that they welcome speakers.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we don't -- we don't want to generalize about  universities across the board but there is a thread that goes through  universities across the board frankly, I mean, not cutting off free speech  but you said that so, I -- what I really wanted to say to you was who's  accountable, who do you guys think is accountable?  Should leadership from  University of Berkeley U.C.  have come and put an end to it?  What could  have been done to stop this?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  That it ultimately falls into the hands of the  leadership of the university, and quite frankly, it leads to anecdotally  there is this move -- this thread among universities particularly with a  lot of professors that there is -- there's no room in the classroom for a  differing opinion.  </p><p> SABATO:  Well, you know, I can't speak for every university or every  professor or every classroom.  I sure know my students don't fear me at all  and they constantly object to this, that, and the other, and raise contrary  opinions and I encourage it and that's what you should do in a classroom.   So, when you say there's a --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you said Peter Kiernan knows that.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  Yes.  Well --</p><p> SABATO:  He knows that.  He knows that.</p><p> KIERNAN:  Larry has taught all four of my children and in the process he's  taught me a heck of a lot too.  And I think, you know, what we're talking  about here though is I think a shared community obligation.  It can't just  be that something that the president does alone or the faculty does alone  or the students.  There are many stakeholders here and I think what UVA  does uniquely well and could be a -- I think a magnet for other people to  watch is bring all these forces together in a way useful that it's useful.   And I think what you're seeing in going on in Berkeley and U.C.  Davis is  not useful in any way and the person ultimately harmed frankly is the  student.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's true.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC NATIONAL CO-CHAIR:  Well, why not hold the  student -- if you peacefully protest, that's fine.  You have every right to  peacefully previous as much as you do to have free speech.  But how about  holding the students who are violent and accountable in some many sort of  punishment so that other students know you can peacefully protest that you  can't -- you can't burn building and break windows, I mean, that's just  silly.  And you're responsible.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KIERNAN:  No.  It's true.  Absolutely, you have to hold -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We all live free on this but unfortunately this bias  continues throughout the university.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I had it at Wake Forest for a shoot, I had it down in Wake  Forest in the late 80s where it was like my speech was only was free if it  agreed with some of my professors and I was targeted because I was in a  sorority and some of my professors didn't like that.  And so, I think that  this has gotten away from itself because there's a lack of leadership, I'm  not talking about the University of Virginia but it's certainly a lack of  leadership or it's just a control of the liberal left.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  Professor Sabato, I want to if I could ask you one question and  that is you've seen -- you've seen them come and go, you've seen  contentious elections, you've seen contentious campaigns but what is the --  what is the way for us to evaluate and think about Trump's start, he's done  some great things, he's had speed bumps.  Where do you see him in continuum  of things and what should we be taking from this is just starting out and  rough spots and what should be longer term concerns if there are any?  </p><p> SABATO:  Well, he's been in office for 14 days.  It is a four-year term.  I  told people, you know, suspend judgment, you give anybody a reasonable  trial period.  Whenever we start a new job, often we have a rough period,  so, you know, his supporters are pleased, they're  focusing on the things  they like, and his opponents, their disbeliefs, they're focusing on things  they don't like.  Let's see how this turns out as we move into, you know, a  six-month period or the first 100 days ends which ends at the end of April.   That seems like a much fair trial period.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me switch gears and ask you about the president's  cabinet, I mean, obviously another member was added yesterday, former  ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Larry was confirmed and  sworn in as  secretary of state but there are other nominees that are facing real  roadblocks.  Two republican senators say they will vote against Trump's  pick for education secretary, that's Betsy DeVos, If these senators follow  through, republicans would only need one more no vote to block DeVos'  appointment, what do you think here?  That the White House administration  shared their confidence that Betsy DeVos would be confirmed and listen to  this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  I have one hundred percent  confidence she will be next secretary of education.  She is unbelievably  qualified educator, an advocate for students, teachers, parents.  It will  be, you know, I think that the games that are being played with Betsy DeVos  are sad.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you see it, Larry?  Do you think she will get confirmed? </p><p> SABATO:  Well, obviously it's a -- it's a close call.  Let's remember,  historically a president losses on one cabinet member, either the person is  forced to withdraw or doesn't pass the senate.  Something happens usually  to at least one some have two or three, I think DeVos might be the only  one, I don't know whether she will lose another republican or not or  whether she will gain one democratic vote, you know, there's always Senator  Joe Manchin from West Virginia, I haven't heard him speak yet on how he's  going to vote, maybe he issued a statement and I missed it.</p><p> But, you know, the broader picture is -- I think represented by someone  like Rex Tillerson.  I've had the opportunity to meet Mr. Tillerson talk  with him in his prior role over the years on a number of occasions.  I  think he will make a very good secretary, I think people will be surprised  that how well-trained he has become, thanks to being CEO of ExxonMobil  which is big and has its own foreign policy.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Larry.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Larry, in terms of how the democrats handle four years of the  Trump administration because there is so much outrage on social media about  the Hillary Clinton loss, about Donald Trump, and they're really pushing  the leadership whether it's Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer to fight the  Trump administration at every single step.  Is this what we're going to get  for four years and will it get worse? </p><p> SABATO:  I don't think you will and I certainly don't think it's wise to do  that simply because you can't fight everything, I mean, that's -- it's  absurd to even try to do that, you have to focus your attention on items or  individuals that really concern you.  And actually the Supreme Court  nominee is going to be a good test, do you -- do you really spend all of  your limited ammunition on somebody who's almost certain to be confirmed?</p><p> And it's a pretty impressive person when you listen to him, you read his  credentials, whether you agree with him or not, I mean, that's not --  that's beside the point.  Or do you wait for that critical change that's  coming when Ginsburg or Kennedy or Briar steps aside, that's when the court  will change.  That's when to use your ammunition.  Don't lose the  filibuster on Gorsuch.</p><p> So there are important distinctions here and it's up to the leadership, you  mentioned, leadership in universities, it's up to party leadership to make  that case to the rank and file.  If they're angry, they're angry but they  also have to -- have to use sense.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But I mean, what about all the other be pushback from  these -- from, you know, on these nominees?  I mean, do you think this is  obstruction by the democrats or is this just politics as usual? </p><p> SABATO:  Well, it's -- this is a continuum.  If you look back over, you  know, 30 years, you'll see that it's gotten worse and worse and worse just  as polarization has gotten worse.  So I would say with each do  administration we seem to go a step or two or three further along this line  of division which is not healthy for the country.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No.  It isn't.  </p><p> SABATO:  I don't have much optimism that it's going to change any time  soon.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Larry.  We'll leave it there.  Good to see you.   Thanks so much.  Larry Sabato.</p><p> SABATO:  Thanks a lot.  Take care.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll take a short break.  When we come back we are awaiting  remarks from President Trump at the National Prayer Breakfast, you see that  on the bottom of your screen here.  And then coming up.  First Lady Melania  Trump getting ready for a big change as she's gearing up for move to the  White House, that's next.  And then investors hoping for a belated  Christmas gift on Amazon's 4th quarter earnings.  What to expect from the  Ecommerce retailer straight ahead.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Market this morning expected to open lower, stocks soared after  the presidential election of course, but the Trump rally has been slowing  down, this year, leading investors to look into Trump policy before they  make their next move.  Joining me right now is CalPERS Chief Investment  Officer Ted Eliopoulos joining us right now.  And Ted, it's great to have  you on the show today..  </p><p> TED ELIOPOULOS, CALPERS CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER:  Maria, thank you -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> ELIOPOULOS:  Thank you for having me.  It's so nice to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, it's important to check in with you because you are  overseeing such a massive amount of capital, $306 billion, is that right?   The AUM at CalPERS right now?</p><p> ELIOPOULOS:  That's exactly right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How are you allocating that and has it changed with the new  administration coming in?  </p><p> ELIOPOULOS:  Well, we're allocating it according to our long-term strategic  asset allocation of course and we're heavily waited to equities in our  strategic allocation.  And really going into this U.S. election, we  position the portfolio to -- take into account both the hopes for equity  allocations in the future but also the risks of this election.  Post- election is really the same story.  There is much hope and optimism for  growth in the U.S. in positioning of portfolios to take advantage of that  growth.  CalPERS benefited immensely from the run-up in equity markets over  the last month and a half for sure.  Now the question really is as you  know, what happens in the future?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, I think this market was really rallying on the  idea that we would see corporate tax reform, obviously a 15 percent  corporate tax rate or a 20 percent corporate tax rate, would do a lot for  earnings, yes? </p><p> ELIOPOULOS:  Yes, it would.  As well as regulatory reform.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> ELIOPOULOS:  Both would be very productive for growth in the U.S. and  translate to better earnings, better equity returns for the future.  But  there are also some risks to take into account.  One is what impact on  inflation, we have been on a -- in a very low inflation -- inflationary  environment and what impact could be on inflation is something to keep an  eye on.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you prepare yourself as an asset manager for that?  I  mean when you look at inflation perhaps on the horizon, does that change  your assessment of what to do with bonds versus stocks?</p><p> ELIOPOULOS:  Well, it's very difficult spot for investors right now because  you have to prepare for some  divergent outcomes is -- are we having  inflationary environment going forward or continue to have a deflationary  environment?  There is no one portfolio that's going to be maximized in  each of those environment.  So, for CalPERS, we have such a dominate equity  position in our portfolio, almost 48 percent of the portfolio today.  We  have bought some inflation protective securities and repositioned the  portfolio as well as commodities in the run-up to the election.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  In terms of 48 percent in equities, is that through index  funds, ETFs or specific names?</p><p> ELIOPOULOS:  We're direct in the -- in that global index of stocks, so we  are predominantly an index investor with enhancements that we do mostly  internally with our internal global equity.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What are the enhancements?  Tell us about that because today,  you can buy an index with whatever combination you want, right?</p><p> ELIOPOULOS:  That's right.  So, we have several factors we look at, it  could be momentum, value, quality, low volatility, maximum diversification,  there are risk factors that allow us to tilt the portfolio slightly in  directions that we see benefit.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  When you look at overall areas that you have to allocate  capital, we talked in the past about hedge funds and you've been vocal  about -- look, the fees are something to watch, and it's not as, you know,  a profitable thing anymore as well as private equity.  You're developing  plans to shift somewhat, $30 billion in terms of private equity away from - - what are you doing in terms of shifting?  </p><p> ELIOPOULOS:  Sure, yes  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're going to move in-house as pensions cut fees.  </p><p> ELIOPOULOS:  Yes.  We're trying to bring as much in-house as we can, we  have over 70 percent of our portfolio we managed internally.  Most of that  is in a public asset classes.  We have added a new allocation to actually  opportunistic credit, to new credit strategy, structured credit, private,  we think that's an opportunity for the future.  And that bringing -- we  have that talent in-house, we have active fixed income managers within our  staff that are able to execute those strategies with confidence.</p><p> In the private market much is a much tougher assessment whether you can  bring in-house, those strategies, and we're not sure right now on the  private equity side that we could effectuate a strategy to compete with the  external managers that are our partners that have done extraordinarily well  for us overtime.  The fees are high but the returns and the performance net  of all those fees have been quite robust, and persistent for over 20 years  for now -- for us now.  So, it is a very important calculus to try and  adjust the external internal model internally.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you have any concern that we're not going to see the tax  cuts and the rollback of regulations instituted this year and would that  dictate a change in the way you invest in all those equities?</p><p> ELIOPOULOS:  Well,  we'll stay heavily invested in equities for the long  term, we are a long-term investor, we'll be watching quite closely over the  next six months to see how difficult and how swift these policy changes may  come.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because people are wondering if in fact, you know, there's  money for this.  I mean, yes, they want it revenue neutral and one of the  president's underlying Mick Mulvaney says, look, we got to take a chopping  block to the entitlements as the guy running who's running the largest  pension fund, CalPERS out there in the country, what's your take on cutting  entitlements?.  </p><p> ELIOPOULOS:  Well, you know, these are -- these are promises that have been  made to -- ordinary pensioners, that's our -- that's our view.  For  CalPERS, our duty is to pensioners and we have hardworking policemen,  firemen firewomen --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Going to keep those promises.</p><p> ELIOPOULOS:  You have to keep those promises, so the key to make sure you  price them and you save for them in order to keep those promises for the  long term.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ted, it's great to have you on the show today.  </p><p> ELIOPOULOS:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Ted Eliopoulos is the chief investment  officer of CalPERS.  We have breaking news right now, the hostage situation  at a Delaware Prison.

Blake Burman with the very latest right now  at the White House, Blake.  </p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Maria.  Good morning to you.  Despite reservations really on both sides of  the aisle with past business dealings with Russia, the Senate yesterday did  indeed confirmed Rex Tillerson to become the next Secretary of State.  A  very narrow nomination but it passed, nonetheless.</p><p> He then came here to the White House, the Former ExxonMobil CEO did and  with the President and Vice President by his side, he was officially sworn  in.  The president also turned some heads yesterday at the White House  earlier in the day in which he appeared to give the OK for the Senate  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to change the Senate rules, should it get  to that point with another nomination.  That being the Supreme Court  nominee Neil Gorsuch. </p><p> (BEHIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  If we end up with the same gridlock that they've had in Washington  for the last -- longer than eight years in all fairness to President Obama  -- a lot longer than eight years.  Then we end up with that gridlock, I  would say if you can Mitch, don't go near.  Because that would be an  absolute shame if a man of this quality was caught up in the web. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  You heard the president there say go nuclear.  That refers to the  so-called Nuclear Option, which would eliminate the 60 votes filibuster  threshold that Democrats are calling for and bring it down to 51.  I asked  the White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer about this yesterday Maria,  whether the White House would be comfortable going forward with that path,  Spicer told me that it's not the president's preference at this point, and  that essentially, it would Mitch McConnell's call.  We'll see if it gets to  that point, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake.  Thank you so much.  Blake Burman at the  White House.  Joining us right now is the man who ran against Nancy Pelosi  for Minority Leader.  Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan is with us.  And  congressman, it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p> TIM RYAN, UNITED STATES CONGRESSMAN OF OHIO:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, your reaction to all of these stall tactics on the side of  Democrats, Sir, I mean, obviously, they are stopping and trying to do  whatever they can to stall President Trump from having his cabinet in  place. </p><p> RYAN:  Well, I mean, that's the process.  I mean, we're not messy  democracy, that's where we live.  You know, you saw it happen during  President Obama's tenure where the Republicans were literally blocking  every single thing he tried to do.  Jobs, bill of Supreme Court Nominee, so  now there is some real disagreement I think, whether it's with the Supreme  Court Justice or some of his nominees that violates some of the basic  values that, I think, Democrats have.</p><p> So, it's important for us to stand up, Republicans have the majority, they  are getting some of their nominees through, but this is all part of the  process, and I don't think it's anything unnecessary is happening but we  get - we have to stand up for what we believe in too. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What specific values are being violated? </p><p> RYAN:  Well, I think if you look at The Supreme Court Nominee, Trump, you  know, campaigned about draining the swamp.  The Supreme Court Nominee is  not for any kind of campaign finance reform at all.  I think if you look,  you know, at DeVos for example, the Secretary of Education absolutely no  experience in public education and also owes Ohio $5 million from fines  that she got a few years ago, when she was involved in another organization  that she hasn't paid.  I mean, these are legitimate things that - </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well wait a second - </p><p> RYAN:  Obviously, we need to talk about. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  When you say Judge Gorsuch, I mean, this is the individual who  was confirmed unanimously just 10 years ago by Republicans and Democrats.   So, what changed other than him being Donald Trump's pick? </p><p> RYAN:  Well, I think the fact that Donald Trump campaigned on draining the  swamp, that he is not for draining the swamp, he is for, you know,  unfettered money coming into politics with many, many people are against.   President Trump campaigned -- </p><p> Maria:  Yes.  I want to ask you about draining the swamp. </p><p> RYAN:  Hold on.  Hold on, Maria. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Go ahead. </p><p> RYAN:  He also campaigned on helping working class people where the Supreme  Court Nominee is against right to work which would allow working class  people to organize.  So, I think these are legitimate things that we are  going to have fights over.  Let's not make too big a of a deal out of it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK, all right.  Well, the problem is that the president needs a  team in place in order to execute some of the promises he's made.  I got to  get my team in here for you but I have one more question on draining the  swamp for you because there's an article right now, saying Nancy Pelosi is  leading her party into oblivion.  I mean, Nancy Pelosi said that the --  Judge Gorsuch is hostile to women's productive rights, hostility toward  children and school, children with autism, hostile appointments.  And as  far as President Trump, she says he's been wreck less and incompetent in  his recent Executive Order.  I mean, does she not understand what just  happened in terms of the election?  She is going against what the people  just voted for. </p><p> RYAN:  Well, I mean Democrats, not to be too frank, but we are in oblivion  as we speak now.  I mean, we are completely wiped out in the election so  we're trying to work our way back.  But I think Donald Trump also  campaigned, Maria, on stability and he's doing everything in his power to  make the globe more unstable at this point. </p><p> You see, the rally with the stock market has subsided a bit because he is  picking fights, he's doing things with -- the Muslim ban and immigration  that makes us look hostile to our allies in Muslim countries and Muslims  here in the United States when we know that these are very important things  that the kind of stability that we need. </p><p> He campaigned on bringing us that stability.  And he is making things  unstable, he campaigned on making us stronger and the Muslim ban makes it  harder for us to prosecute the war on terrorism. </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Congressman, I have to push  back.  It's not a Muslim ban.  These are seven countries that were  identified by the Obama Administration.  And the restrictions are based on  country, not religion, first and foremost.  But I want to get back to Nancy  Pelosi and the loss of the Democrats in rebuilding the party and making a  comeback is -- but is the way to do that, this kind of fierce rhetoric and  opposition that you're getting from not only Nancy Pelosi, but also Chuck  Schumer.  Is that how you win over voters over the next two to four years? </p><p> RYAN:  Well, you know, you have to take a stand on things that you believe  in, and it may not always be popular in the moment.  I'm not into real  hostile rhetoric.  I'm not into inflaming the situation.  We have enough of  that in Washington.  We need to reach out to each other and see if we can  find some common ground.  But </p><p> I will tell you, that it is the Chief Executive's responsibility to do  that.  I mean, he hasn't even reached out to his own national security  people, for example, with the immigration issue that we were just talking  about.  He even didn't talk to his own people.  They're not talking to  Democrats, that's the responsibility of the President of The United States.   President Obama did a lot of reaching out to Republicans, early on, through  a lot of the affordable care stuff.  He was always reaching out. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on.  The Affordable Care Act?  Don't go there.  He  don't care and he pushed through and he had absolutely no support on the  Republican side at all. </p><p> RYAN:  Are you kidding me?  He had no support?  I'm saying he reached out  for months and months.  And including in the Stimulus Bill, incorporated  the tax cuts into the Stimulus Bill that many Democrats didn't want.  We  wanted straight infrastructure spending to juice up the economy. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why did he have to do so many Executive Orders, then?  Then how  come he had to do so many Executive Orders?</p><p> RYAN:  OK.  Because the Republicans were blocking every single thing he  did.  He had no choice.  But if he wants to get anything done to do  Executive Orders, you know it and I know it - </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No.  I don't know that.  I don't know that at all.  </p><p> RYAN:  Mitch McConnell said that his number one goal -- Mitch McConnell  said his number one goal was to make sure President Obama didn't have a  second term.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I think -</p><p> RYAN:  They blocked his jobs bill, they didn't vote, not one vote for  health care, their whole M.O. was to destroy Obama and make him a one  termer.  So, don't turn around two weeks into Trump's presidency and say,  \"Boy, you guys are being really unfair.\"  Look, this is not the rotary  club.  This is politics.  It's a full contact support.  If you can't take  the heat, get out of the kitchen. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ryan, I think it's also important to know that part of the  reason Donald Trump won the election is because of those Executive Orders.   It was as much a repudiation against President Obama, as it was the fact  that there was no message from your candidate. </p><p> RYAN:  Well, look. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's not forget what the reality is.  Your team lost. </p><p> RYAN:  And I like some of his Executive Orders.  Small business  regulations, I agree with it.  Re-negotiating TPP, I agree with it.   Finding a way to make NAFTA work for places like Youngstown in Warren  Akron, Ohio sit?  Let's sit down and do that.  I'm not here to butt heads  with him at every turn.  I'm here to work with him if we can.  But as I  said, he's not even reaching out to his own people on policy decisions,  he's certainly not reaching out the Democrats.  But when we stand ready if  there is something we can work on. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, one final question.  Are the Democrats going to put  anybody under 70 years old in power?  In leadership? </p><p> RYAN:  Well -- I did my part I did my part to try to try.  You know, I  think we do need new faces in the democratic party and I think we need a  solid approach that reaches out to all corners of the country.  I think we  have a good agenda that we need to just push and get out.  We need to  rebuild the country, we need broadband in every corner of the country to  unlock certain communities that just can't compete in the new economy  because they don't have the new America 2.0 infrastructure like broadband.   And, you know, education reform and all the rest.  So we have an agenda but  we've got to be willing to sit down and try to get it through. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, part of that issue is the party is being hijacked by the  extreme left.  Is that a fair statement? </p><p> RYAN:  Well, we're in an era in the country of extreme partisanship and I  think President Trump needs to do a better job of figuring out how to do  things without inciting everybody in the country and in the world.  Now you  look at what is going on with refugees and people coming over here. </p><p> Look, no bureaucratic system is perfect.  If there's things we need to do  to sit down and some, fine.  But the reality is, if we're going to be real  concerned with refugees coming over here or people coming over here as  terrorists, they're probability not going to come from Yemen.  They're  probably not going to come from Syria. ]</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why not?  </p><p> RYAN:  They're probably going to be smart enough to come through a European  country into the United States.  And so let's sit down and figure out how  we can work with our European allies to tighten things up to make sure that  we are covering the entire ground.  We have a really strong vetting  process, of course it can be improved but he didn't need to do it in a way  that makes it hostile to where tech companies are freaking out because, you  know, they have Muslim workers to where a doctor at the Cleveland clinic is  getting stopped and not allowed back into the country.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> RYAN:  You don't need to do this.  It just - there's too much chaos with  Trump, too much drama.  Sit down, relax, breathe in through nose and let's  figure out how to work together and get the country going again. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Real quick.  Peter Kiernan.</p><p> PETER KIERNAN, NEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING AUTHOR:  Well I have to say I  watched you closely when you were running your campaign for -- excuse me --  minority leader.  I think you would have made a great one.  I don't believe  you would have fought at every single step, at every single turn, the way  Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are.  Do you have a reaction to that?  </p><p> RYAN:  I think we do need to pick our spots.  I think we've got to find  points of agreement and -- but there are people are -- excited about a  couple of these nominees.  I think that the immigration issue, the Muslim  issue, insight a lot of people's sensibilities including mine that, you  know, you're going to put Muslims back in the line trying to get in the  country.  You're going to tell refugees who want to come into a safe haven,  sometimes United States, sometimes other countries that are coming from a  war that we started guys.  I mean, we started this war.  So we have some  responsibility.  So, no.  I don't think you fight on every turn, I think  you try to find some common ground. </p><p> But when there are basic issues that violate our values, you stand up and  you fight.  And we're giving him, I think, will give him a lot more  hearings for Supreme Court justice than the Republicans gave the President  Obama.  So, it's important for us to remember that as well. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to have you on the program this morning.   We'll be watching.  Thanks so much. </p><p> RYAN:  Thanks, Maria. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman Tim Ryan, joining us there.  Coming up, we are  waiting remarks from President Trump at the National Breakfast.  The Prayer  Breakfast.  We'll be right back. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  45 minutes away from the opening bell.  Markets  are looking lower this morning.  We are at the lows of the morning right  now.  And the DOW Industrials average now expecting a decline of about 60  points.  NASDAQ, down in 11.  Couple of names are watching Macy's.  The  stock is looking higher this morning reportedly considering a possible  sale.  The New York Post is reporting that longtime CEO Terry Lundgren is  set to be weighing the move before he steps down later this quarter.   Macy's shares and we're seeing a bit off.  Tesla Motors dropping the  motors.  The name change to Tesla Inc. chose the company's ambition to move  beyond just selling high end electric cars and shifting into energy  products like solar panels and home batteries.  Tesla agreed to acquire  Solar City, remember, for $2.6 billion.  That was back in November. </p><p> Blowout earnings from big technology names like Microsoft, Apple, Facebook.   Amazon is reporting tonight.  And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart  Varney joins me.  Taking a look at tech in the spotlight, Stu.  Good  morning.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY &amp; COMPANY HOST:  I continue my  astonishment at the financial performance of America's big tech companies.   As you point out, Apple, $246 billion in cash, Facebook last night, 1.8  billion monthly users and a ton of money coming over every year.  And  tonight, it's Amazon.  I don't know whether they're going to disappoint or  what.  But I do know that if you look at the numbers, it will be a shock. </p><p> Maria, you and I have covered financial news for a few years.  I have  covered it for decades longer than you have and I have never, ever seen  such a concentration of financial power among the four or five top American  big name technology companies.  Never seen this before.  And remember, they  are now in opposition to President Trump.  Both on ideologic grounds and on  trade grounds, on visa grounds, this is quite a confrontation that's coming  here. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.  Part of the issue, I think, is because  technology is seeped into so many other industries, Stu.  Right?  I mean,  tech has changed transportation, it's changed health care, it's changed  retailing.  So, one of the reasons for power base is that it's not just  traditional tech, it's technology changing so many other industries.</p><p> VARNEY:  That is very true.  I mean, it seeped into the automobile  industry. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That, too.</p><p> VARNEY:  I mean, I don't know what percentage of a car these days comes  from Silicon Valley or is computer oriented.  It's big and it's growing.  I  just -- I don't think I've ever seen that kind of concentration of  financial power.  The money these guys have, the influence that brings, is  really astonishing.  I love it, by the way.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We know President Trump doesn't like monopolies.  So, we'll see  where that goes. </p><p> VARNEY:  Who wants a monopoly?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  See you in about 10 minutes, Stu.  </p><p> VARNEY:  You will.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" again at the top of the hour  right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart, 9:00 a.m. Eastern this  morning.  </p><p> Coming up, the NFL takes its Super Bowl patrons on the ride of their life.   Our own Cheryl Casone is on the ground in Houston with former NFL Star,  Jack Brewer.  Check it out.  We're going to join them momentarily. back in  a minute.</p><p> Then, they took an interstellar journey that made even jack brewer scream. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Houston, of course home to NASA's Johnson Space  Center so it should come as no surprise that the space travel agency will  play a part in the pre-Super Bowl festivities.  Our own Cheryl Casone and  Former NFL Star Jack Brewer took a ride on NASA's 90-foot virtual reality  simulated trip to mars and back.  And they lived to tell the tale.  Cheryl? </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Maria, good  morning.  Yes, it was a two-minute ride but it was full of thrills.  NASA  does, someday, want go to mars.  They're working with Boeing and race it on  to make it happen.  But as far as the ride itself, Jack, how would you  describe what we went through yesterday for Maria?  </p><p> JACK BREWER, FORMER NFL STAR:  I was freaked out. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREWER:  Whoa. </p><p> CASONE:  We're ready.  Let's do this.  </p><p> BREWER:  Let's do this. </p><p> CASONE:  We're about to go up 90 feet so we can drop 90 feet.  Jack, you  are afraid of heights.  Right?  </p><p> BREWER:  I can't believe you talked me into this. </p><p> CASONE:  We're standing in the middle of the field in NRG Stadium. </p><p> BREWER:  Maria, the only thing missing here is you. </p><p> CASONE:  Oh, boy.  We're above the Earth. </p><p> BREWER:  Oh, my God. </p><p> CASONE:  We're in space, Jack.  We're on the Orion Spacecraft. </p><p> BREWER:  Yes.</p><p> CASONE:  We're approaching Mars. </p><p> BREWER:  It's kind of beautiful, actually. </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BREWER:  Wow.</p><p> BREWER:  I did not say anything that was not on T.V.  It was amazing.</p><p> CASONE:  That was cool.  That was cool.  Jack, here we go.</p><p> BREWER:  Oh, man. </p><p> CASONE:  That was crazy.  Are you OK? </p><p> BREWER:  Yes.  I was just happy that I -</p><p> CASONE:  I'm a little dizzy.  Look, we just want to mars, Maria. you owe  us. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  What we do for you, Maria.  Right, Jack? </p><p> BREWER:  That is right.  We love you.  </p><p> CASONE:  We love you.  It was a lot of fun.  It was a bit crazy out there  but all the fans can come in and experience that today.  If they're in  Texas, come on down in the Super Bowl live.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You guys have real spunk.  Dagen and I were just talking about  when you went on that roller-coaster ride, Cheryl.  Wow.</p><p> Meanwhile, how about this, guys?  Former President George H.W. Bush and his  wife Barbara are flipping the coin before the 2017 Super Bowl according to  their spokesperson.  Jack, what do you think about that?  Who do you think  the former president is rooting for? </p><p> BREWER:  Well, I mean.  I am sure he's already a fan.  But down deeply in  his heart, he wishes he was watching the Dallas Cowboys.  But you know,  President Bush is a very, very admired person in Texas, you know.  I am a  Texan as well as Cheryl. </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  This is our home state, Maria.  But you know, the thing is,  this is his hometown and there's so much buzz because there's just so many  well wishes from him that are coming from all over just on a local  perspective.  But I can't imagine what that stadium is going to be like  when he comes out to do that coin toss on Sunday.  We are going to be there  so we will let you know. </p><p> BREWER:  No question. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, guys.  Thank you, Cheryl and jack.  We will see you  later, thanks for that.  And remember you can watch Super Bowl only on one  network live on the Fox Network.  This Sunday night, 6:30 pm Eastern.  We  will be watching.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, we will.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.  Final thoughts from our  all-star panel when we come right back.  Stay with us. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We're awaiting comments from President Trump at the National  Prayer Breakfast.  We want to get some final thoughts are we're all  scratching our heads trying to figure out what Congressman Tim Ryan just  said about we started this war.  Twitter's going nuts about it too.  Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just -- to push back on that, I don't know exactly what he's  talking about as if we asked for 9/11 going down that road, but in terms of  Syria and the refugee crisis, Trump -- President Trump is now trying to  deal with.  The situation in Syria erupted because of the vacuum by  President Obama.  There was a red line that wasn't honored.  And Assad and  Putin, essentially took over.  So, let's blame and put blame where it needs  to lie.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's the bottom line.  Thank you Morgan Ortagus, Peter  Kiernan, Dagen McDowell.  It's a pleasure.  We'll see you tomorrow,  everybody.  Here's Stuart. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Happy Thursday.   Thanks for being with us this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, February 2.  Here are your top  stories, 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Groundhog's Day.  Chaos on campus.  Violent protesters breaking out last  night at UC Berkeley over a speech from a conservative editor, forcing the  cancellation of the event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Broken windows, as you see flames.  The university and local residents  frustrated as agitators got in the way of the first amendment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I support free speech.  See what he had to say  (INAUDIBLE) ideas talked about and it just got shut down by a bunch of  people (INAUDIBLE) protester masks.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's not a proud day for this campus on the free speech  movement.  The violence is deplorable.  And there's really nothing to be  proud about because of what happened here tonight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The outrage coming up this morning.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Trump's cabinet adding another member.  Former  ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson has been confirmed and sworn in as secretary  of state.  This happened late yesterday.</p><p>Even his other nominees are still facing roadblocks.  We've got all the  details on the confirmations coming up.</p><p>A strong earnings report from Facebook to tell you about.  The social media  giant posting better than expected fourth-quarter revenue.  Profit also was  above expectations.  We're breaking down those numbers.</p><p>Looking ahead to Amazon's results there out tonight after the close.   Facebook shares going to be up this morning.</p><p>Checking the broader markets.  Take a look at where we're looking at this  morning and it is a pullback.  Some selling underway.  The Dow Industrials  expected to be down about 50 points today.  NASDAQ down about 20 points  after a gain yesterday.</p><p>In Europe, muted action this morning.  Take a look at the major indices  throughout the Eurozone and you'll see mixed performance.  The FT 100 is up  a third of a percent.  That's 22 points higher.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board to report.  Take a look, Asian  markets finished like this.  Still a holiday in China.  Shanghai Composite  closed but the Nikkei average in japan down one in a quarter percent.  The  worst performer throughout the Asian markets.</p><p>One football fan scoring the ultimate ticket, Super Bowl seats for life.   The details coming up.</p><p>And then a great American tradition.  It's Groundhogs Day today.  Will  Punxsutawney still see his shadow?  We will take you to Pennsylvania later  this hour live where the crowd are lining up.  It is incredibly packed  right there this morning at this time.</p><p>All that coming up this morning.</p><p>And joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.   Former Goldman Sachs partner and New York Times best-selling author Peter  Kiernan is with us.  And Maverick PAC national co-chair, Morgan Ortagus.   Good to see you.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, CO-CHAIR, MAVERICK PAC:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Great to see you.  Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  I love being here every morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Groundhogs Day.  Every day is Groundhogs Day.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, we got Rex Tillerson confirmed.  We'll see who else is on  the docket.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Betsy DeVos having some problems with two republican senators  saying they're not going to vote for her.  And so now it looks -- it looks  split 50 votes for the republicans and so she's hanging on by a thread.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I didn't expect that coming to republicans.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did not either.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll talk about that this morning.  Big show ahead.   Forbes media chairman and former republican presidential candidate Steve  Forbes is in the house.  We got to talk to with him about tax reform.</p><p>Plus, the former republican presidential candidate and former Minnesota  governor Tim Pawlenty with us this morning.</p><p>The chief investment officer of CalPERS Ted Eliopoulos is with us this  morning.  We're going to find out how he's allocating capital.</p><p>And Ohio congressman who ran against Nancy Pelosi from minority leader.   Tim Ryan is with us.  Big show.</p><p>Plus, former NFL star, Jack Brewer as well.  Stick around.  Stay right  there.  We've got a big program ahead.</p><p>We kick it off right now with a wave of destruction blanketing the  University of California campus Berkeley campus last night.  Protesters  rallying against the planned speech by the school by Breitbart news editor  Milo Yiannopoulos.  Rioter's started fires, they broke windows.  They  confronted police.  Ultimately causing the talk to be canceled.</p><p>Fox News' Tucker Carlson spoke with Milo Yiannopoulos last night about the  chain of events and protesters spoke out as well.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MILO YIANNOPOULOS, NEWS EDITOR, BREITBART:  This evening we got into the  building, started preparing for the show and people started arriving in  black clothes then masks.  They were clearly carrying concealed shields  weapons and things.  And then stuff being thrown at the building.  There  were rocks being thrown.  Various other things being thrown out of the  building.  Eventually the ground floor was breached and I was evacuated.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have the right to defend ourselves.  And so this  shutting this down Milo Yiannopoulos and doing whatever is necessary to do  that is our right to self-defend.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's one thing to protest someone's right to come here  and speak, but it's another thing to create this much amount of destruction  and violence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  Peter Kiernan, what's your reaction here?  I mean,  UC Berkeley was -- I know -- regardless it is a left-leaning university.   But isn't this the place where typically students go and say we want free  speech and look what they do to somebody who's about to give a speech?</p><p>PETER KIERNAN, FORMER PARTNER, GOLDMAN SACHS:  Yes.  I have to say, this  man is on the campus tour from hell.  He got cancelled a couple of weeks  ago at UC Davis and the University of New Mexico.  They just find the group  that was hosting in $3,500.</p><p>He is somebody who is basically being rejected everywhere.  And I thought  universities were places of free and open exchange of ideas.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not in modern history they're not.  These left-wing individuals  -- and this is throughout the college system in this country and it's led  by professors quite frankly, that they preach tolerance, but breed  intolerance.  They're breeding intolerance in the name of tolerance.  That  is what is so both ironic and repugnant in what's going on here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  why is that do you think?  I just had this conversation last  night.  Why are the academics spewing this liberalism and they are just --  I mean, even when you look at the day after the election when Donald Trump  won.  They're telling students of different narrative than actually what  happened.  Why?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I think it's just another symptomatic case where you say they're  completely out of touch with the American people, right?  The university  job especially getting tenure.  It's a bunch of groupthink, I think in a  lot of occasions and these are not people that are out working some job  nine to five or trying to make ends meet.  They had pretty cushy jobs at  universities.  It's like being in the government, right, where you can get  fired.</p><p>What was really interesting to me though about the Berkeley situation,  Maria, is that Berkeley invited at the time President Ahmadinejad from Iran  when he was being incredibly provocative to the U.S.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Death to America.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  And death to America.  So you do not see the type of protests for  him that you saw last night.</p><p>Also, Milo is not without controversy.  So this is -- let's not pretend  that he doesn't -- he stoked the flames a bit so he does it as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It doesn't matter though because they said this on this program  when it comes to liberal protests, whether marches here to protest police  brutality for example.  Defending the first amendment means tolerating and  allowing for speech that even you find repugnant and offensive.  That's  what the first amendment is about.  It not about this.</p><p>And it shows liberal left wing distortion of what's really going on when  you hear the young woman saying, we have the right to defend ourselves.   Your right is to not listen to what Milo Yiannopoulos has to say</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, don't go.  Don't show up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But stop acting like this is a physical attack on you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are you defending yourself?</p><p>KIERNAN:  I think when it's all said and done, the safe space mentality,  we're going to protect the students from the real world or from the world  that's different from what they believe.  When those students get out into  the real world, they'll find that there are a plurality of points of view,  even though as they never heard on campus.</p><p>And if campuses are meant to create great leaders in the future, what are  they training them for if they don't have full exposure to the voices?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They shut down freedom of expression.  They're shutting down the  first amendment and at the same time, and you can't say this enough.  This  college campuses -- because of these professors, they've become a breeding  ground for anti-Semitism in this country.</p><p>And they're giving people cover to basically preach hatred of Jews and it's  disgusting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  it's disgusting.  And where is the president?  Where is the  president of the university to come out and stop this and show some  leadership?  Have we heard from anybody at the leadership?</p><p>KIERNAN:  Well, it's interesting, in UC Davis the chancellor did say  something that was not condoning of this, but that's a talk.  Where is the  action and he chose from the day-to-day activity?  Why aren't you opening  your doors to contrary points of view?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  Really a great points this morning on  this.</p><p>I want to turn to immigration because President Trump's administration is  considering an executive order that would take a closer look at visa  programs for foreign workers in the U.S.  This according to \"The Wall  Street Journal\" this morning.</p><p>Morgan, your take on this.  For Trump, it would be another promise  fulfilled in keeping jobs in America, frankly.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I would like -- first of all, clearly, our immigration system  needs reform.  I think people on both sides of the aisles are honest with  themselves.  What I would like prefer to see over an executive order is  that the president work with congress on comprehensive reform.  And the  reason is that President Obama have seen this firsthand.</p><p>When you issue all of these executive orders, they can easily be done.  And  so one of the problems over the past eight years, one of the reason  President Obama was not effective is because he didn't work with congress  to push this legislation through.</p><p>So I like the idea of this.  I think we need reform.  I would like them to  see him go to congress, get a comprehensive play.  Get something codified  and delude that can't be undone the minute the next president comes in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The tech industry particularly is upset about this, about the  going after the H-1B visas for highly skilled workers.</p><p>And I would argue on the other hand of that.  In fact, the CEO of GoDaddy  was writing that there are currently 500,000 unfilled high skilled I.T. in  computer science jobs.</p><p>If you want American companies to create more jobs, then you want the best  and brightest minds from around the world living here and creating ideas  and products that are then American-owned.  So I would argue that this is  critical importance.</p><p>We need to reform the education system quite frankly if you want Americans  to fill this jobs.  In the interim, you want to support great American  businesses.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why those CEOs of those technology companies are  putting together a letter to send to President Trump to obviously review  everything you just said, having the crux of the issue.</p><p>KIERNAN:  I think they want it so bad.  About a million people immigrate  here every year.  I think we should take 50,000 or 60,000 of those H-1B  visas and sell them for $50,000.  And if the high-tech companies want those  people so bad to fill those slots, sell them.  We could raise a billion  dollars a year, do that for five years.  That's how you find your fixing of  the education system.  I think there's an opportunity -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How are you going to sell them though?  Are you getting best  students in that way?</p><p>KIERNAN:  I think what you do as I say, we're going to give you a slot.   We'll sell to you for $50,000.  If you want one of those H-1 visas, you  pay.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  OK.</p><p>KIERNAN:  For 50,000.  We still have a million people coming in here with  free of charge, no issue.  But if we're going to turn this into a  commercial partnership, let's really do it.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  This is certainly be a discussion tomorrow with the president  because he has CEOs that he's put on in his Business Roundtable that are  meeting with him tomorrow.  It's reported, I think that Elon Musk and the  Uber CEO among others will be at the meeting.  So I know that this will be  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sadly not the Americans living here to fill these highly skilled  jobs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that goes back to education because they don't have the  skillsets required.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Trump tweeted this last night about his predecessor's  decision to take in refugees from Australia.  He writes this.  Do you  believe it?  The Obama administration agreed to take thousands of illegal  immigrants from Australia.  Why?  I will study this dumb deal.\"</p><p>This coming after Trump reportedly clashed with the Prime Minister of  Australia.  Malcom Turnbull last night during a phone call about this  matter, calling it, \"the worst deal ever.\"</p><p>He accused Turnbull of looking to export the next Boston bombers.  Now,  there's a lot of media reporting about this morning, Peter, that they had a  tense call.  Do you predict this change in the U.S. relationship with  Australia?  And how important was this call?  And how impacts -- </p><p>KIERNAN:  Well I think it was cable setting.  We're basically getting  started, but have you been to Australia?  I mean, there's plenty of rooms  to take a few thousand -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They won't take them, by the way.</p><p>KIERNAN: And the problem is why are they dishing their problem to us?  I  think it was very right and appropriate for the president to say, we're  going to level set.  The relationship now has changed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or do it as a dumb deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  The call happened on Saturday too and that was after the rollout  of the executive order would bungled.  I think even the administration has  acknowledged that.</p><p>So he's probably on edge given the fact that it's been a rough weekend.</p><p>But the one thing that we have to say is the Australian prime minister  reiterated the special relationship.  We work incredibly closely with the  Australians.  Anytime we go to war and in intelligence matters.  It's an  important relationship.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  These refugees are in offshore detention centers right now in  Australia.  And if it's a deal that President Obama inked with Australia,  it's up to the new president to decide whether it's in our best interest.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do we know when that deal was inked?  Remember, President Obama  was doing so much in the final twilight days of his administration?  We'll  get the answer for you.</p><p>We'll take a short break.  When we come back, rumors in retail.  The long  time CEO of Macy's is stepping down.  Now there's talk the struggling  retailer may put itself up for sale.  Macy's on sale.</p><p>And then this little piggy had none.  Bacon lovers fearing a shortage of  their favorite pork product.  Why a price hike might be in store.  Back in  a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Two staffers are being held hostage at a  Delaware maximum-security prison this morning.  Lauren Simonetti on  headlines now.  Lauren, good morning to you.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi.  Good morning, Maria.  Two  Delaware department of correction employees have been held hostage since  last night, as inmates remained in an hour's long standoff with police.</p><p>This incident began when four employees at the correctional center were  taken hostage yesterday morning.  One DOC staff member was released four  hours later, another shortly before 8:00 P. M.</p><p>In a call to the News Journal in Wilmington, one inmate reportedly cited  President Donald Trump as the reason for the hostage situation saying  because of Trump, he quote, \"knows the institution is going to change for  the worse.\"</p><p>Well, an attorney representing state inmates says complaints have increased  in the past year from inmates about substandard medical care in poor  record-keeping.</p><p>Big news in business world.  A reported sale from Macy's is on the table.   Longtime CEO Terry Lundgren stepping down as the head of the largest U. S.  department store within the next few months.  That's the report.</p><p>In an attempt to avoid more shakeup, Lundgren is reportedly considering a  sale of Macy's.  Macy's share in the past year are down about 30 percent.   But this morning if you check out this board, they're up about four percent  on the news.</p><p>And Nielsen mobile insights ranks T-Mobile number one in customer service  satisfaction.  The company beating up Verizon and AT&amp;T as the company to  most likely be recommended as well.  This comes after T-Mobile offers to  covers sales tax on new smartphones.</p><p>The deal will give customers more than 11 percent off of a phone's price if  they're using a prepaid MasterCard.</p><p>All right.  I love this story because I love to look at the video.  For  bacon lovers out there.  Reports of frozen pork belly inventories reaching  their lowest level in 50 years.  Rest assured.  </p><p>Earlier this week, we had a story that that was going to happen.  But  claims of these bacon shortages are unsupported.  Meat processors are  however paying 30 percent more than they did just a few months ago and that  increase might show up shortly at supermarkets.</p><p>But for now, bacon prices are holding steady.  And the USDA reports a pound  of bacon averages actually 11 percent less than they did just back in 2015,  Maria.  So there you have it.  Good morning and that's hogwash.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  I'm glad you got dead end.</p><p>Breaking news right now, Lauren.  We want to show everybody what Donald  Trump has been tweeting.  The president just tweeted this moments ago.  If  UC Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent  people with a different point of view, no federal funds?\"</p><p>Wow, the president is pretty aggressive in terms of coming out and saying,  look, there are consequences for what you're doing.  No federal funding?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that President Trump was watching Fox and Friends first  this morning because Todd Starnes was on and had like a one-minute, two- minute commentary.  That's exactly what Todd Starnes said on Fox and  Friends first roughly an hour ago.</p><p>So I'm not saying that the president is getting his ideas from Mr. Starnes,  but it's exactly what Todd was talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a big issue though.  How much money are we talking  about in terms of what the federal government could hold back for  university?  We don't have those numbers.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  When you at the pictures that you're showing of the protest, it  looks pretty violent.  So I think that Berkeley would argue.  We cancel  that to keep the students safe.  Because it's incredibly violent.  You saw  fires and just watch it for yourself.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How does he get that out of control?  Where is the leadership  to stop it from getting out of control and putting things on fire at a  university?</p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes.  I think it could become a lot calmer.  If you look at how  UC Davis handle it, they just canceled it.  That's a better way to go</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When we come back, what is in a name?  How Elon Musk is  rebranding Tesla motors after closing a new deal.</p><p>And then we've got an eye on earnings this morning.  Facebook beating  expectations last night.  Wall Street's looking for Amazon to deliver next.   We've got the growth story on Amazon coming up.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets looking lower this morning.  But  Facebook certainly one to watch.  Take a look at the shares this morning.   The company reporting a strong fourth quarter last night, easily topping  analysts' expectations.</p><p>Company's revenue up a staggering 51 percent year-over-year in the quarter.   It was not all good news for the company though.  Jury sided against his  Oculus brand in a lawsuit ordering it to pay $500 million to game maker  ZeniMax.</p><p>Joining us \"Wall Street Journal\" chief economic correspondent, Jon  Hilsenrath on that.  Jon, good morning to you.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, CHIEF ECONOMIC CORRESPONDENT, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Good  morning, Maria.  It's all about tech yesterday and today.  We've got Amazon  coming up later.  And it looks like they're going to pump out blowout  numbers too.</p><p>It's amazing to me that you have companies like Facebook and Amazon which  are such a huge scale already.  Amazon with almost 1.9 billion users around  the world and it's pumping out 51 percent revenue growth numbers.  To be  that big and growing that fast is just really transformative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  And we're talking about Amazon a lot because it  is incredibly successful.  Look at the stock today and look at the business  getting into all different industries.  What do you think, Peter?</p><p>KIERNAN:  Well, it's interesting, isn't it?  That the very month that  Amazon takes over from Macy's as the number one seller of apparel, there's  a changing in the guard there.</p><p>And the thing that strikes me is Amazon went public exactly 20 years ago  and that stock is up 42,000 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Since the IPO?</p><p>KIERNAN:  So if you put $1,000 in, it would be $420,000 today.  It's been  an extraordinary company way beyond e-tailing.  And the thing I saw in a  research report recently that I like is, somebody said it's a great company  and by the way, it does not compete with Amazon.</p><p>So it's becoming a benefit not to be in a competitive view of Amazon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It reminds me a lot of Wal-Mart in the night 1990s and that  Wal-Mart wasn't just a retailer.  It became a logistics powerhouse.  The  way it dealt its warehousing networks and technology to move products.   That's what Amazon is really leading the show right now.  They're investing  so much in robotics, in warehousing and getting products to people  overnight.</p><p>They're more than just a retailer.  They're really at the vanguard of  logistics information</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to point out that Wal-Mart actually just rolled out a  free shipping program for every single order and you don't have to like pay  a subscription fee.  Minimum $35 purchase but free two-day shipping to  anybody in the United States.</p><p>So Wal-Mart has enough at least on the retail side to try and compete with  Amazon.  Maybe not the apparel selection, but they're even focused on that.   You saw that over the holidays.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've got to come up with things like free shipping.  They're  on their heels because Amazon is -- and we didn't even talk about original  content.  Those are competing but with movie company.</p><p>KIERNAN:  They're behind Manchester by the Sea and some of the Academy  award nominations.  And so they are really looking at this world in a very  broad gauge.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  Jon Hilsenrath, let me ask you.  Any thoughts from  the fed meeting and what you heard from Janet Yellen yesterday?  And I want  to ask you about this meeting with the president on Friday.  Several CEOs  headed to the White House tomorrow.  JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon among them.   Bob Iger, Walt Disney, Dr. Toby Cosgrove, as well CEO of IBM Ginni Rometty  and Larry Fink from BlackRock.  What do you expecting?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, on the fed meeting, they're in a wait-and-see mode.  And  what I find most interesting and what I've been debating with colleagues  about for the last few days is whether the fed is on a collision course  with Donald Trump.</p><p>Janet Yellen thinks that we're going to have around two percent growth over  the next few years.  Donald Trump wants four percent growth.</p><p>Now, if we get this faster growth is the fed get accommodated?  As far as  what the fed does next, I think really a lot depends on the jobs numbers.   We're going to get pretty good wage growth numbers on jobs on Friday and  that could keep the -- move the fed towards its next rate increase.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we got a great number, that's for sure.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The CEO meeting, this president has made a lot of promises  that he's going cut back regulation and that he's going to achieve tax  reform.</p><p>And I think the market has been very excited about that.  At some point  this year we have to see whether he delivers.  One of the things you have  to think about what this whole visa debate and immigration that's going on  right now, that's more regulation, it's not less regulation.  I wonder what  kind of pushback he's going to get from the CEO meeting on that point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's probably the ones taking points for sure.  Real quick,  Peter.</p><p>KIERNAN:  The one thing that I think is you predicted accurately.  I think  there's going to be a war.  It's coming between Yellen and Trump.  She sees  growth at one-way, he sees another, inflation is coming.  It's going to be  over the dollars that they fight and it's right around the corner.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Jon Hilsenrath, good to see you, sir.  Thank you.   We will see you soon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, former chief executive of ExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson  sworn in as secretary of state yesterday.  But education secretary nominee  Betsy DeVos still facing roadblocks.  We'll get into it next.</p><p>And then striking gold.  How a man from Kansas won Super Bowl tickets for  life.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Welcome back.  We're happy  you're with us.  </p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, February 2.  Your top stories  right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>President Trump's cabinet finally gaining another member -- Rex Tillerson  sworn in as the next secretary of state yesterday after he was approved by  the Senate in a 56 to 43 vote.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is where you were meant  to be, right here today, at this crossroads in history.  It's time to bring  a clear-eyed focus to foreign affairs, to take a fresh look at the world  around us and to seek new solutions grounded in very ancient truths.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The very latest on the continuing confirmations coming up this  morning.  President Trump honors a hero yesterday making an unannounced  trip to receive the remains of the first service member lost during his  presidency.  </p><p>He went with his daughter, Ivanka Trump.  The president just tweeting  moments ago, \"Attending Chief Ryan Owens' dignified transfer with my  daughter, Ivanka, was my great honor.  To a great and brave man, thank  you.\"  </p><p>What is in a name -- why a deal (ph) has decided to take out the motors  coming up?  We will tell you about it.   </p><p>And then the broader market looking like this, futures indicating a lower  opening for the broader averages today.  We're once again on earnings watch  today.  </p><p>And we are one day ahead of the job's numbers out tomorrow.  Dow  Industrials expected down about 50 points, NASDAQ under some selling  pressure as well, down 17 points, although Facebook is trading up, Amazon  expected to report earnings after the close tonight.  </p><p>Take a look at the Eurozone indices right now.  Markets are mixed this  morning in Europe.  The FTSE 100 is up, the DAX index in Germany is down,  all fractional there, FTSE up a third of a percent.  </p><p>In Asia, declines across the board -- take a look -- Nikkei average in  Japan, worst performer, down one and a quarter percent.  Well, this price  is anything but light -- how one canvas (ph) man won Super Bowl tickets for  life -- why we are showing you the Bud Light can when we tell you this,  though, we will explain.  </p><p>And will he or won't he -- we will take you to Pennsylvania later this hour  to see if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow.  Will we get a sooner spring?  </p><p>We will tell you.  Coming up, though, first, Rex Tillerson was sworn in as  secretary of state last night.  President Trump took to Twitter just a few  minutes ago to congratulate him.  </p><p>Here is what President Trump writes, \"Congratulations to Rex Tillerson on  being sworn in as our new secretary of state.  He will be a star.\"  </p><p>This, as Trump's nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos is facing  trouble -- two GOP members saying that they will vote against her.  Joining  us right now is the Forbes Media Chairman and former Republican  presidential candidate himself, Steve Forbes.  </p><p>Steve, good to see you.  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  First, let's -- we've got a  lot to talk to you about.  We want to talk about tax reform as well.  </p><p>But let's talk Betsy DeVos for a moment.  What do you make of these  challenges -- two GOP senators? </p><p>FORBES:  Well, on the case, in the case from the senator of Alaska, Lisa  Murkowski, she owes the National Education Association big time when she  lost the primary in 2010.  She had a successful write-in (ph) campaign to  win the general election.  </p><p>The NEA was critical for that.  They called her that cheat (ph).  And Susan  Collins of Maine, she goes her own way.  </p><p>I think they'll get her through.  If they don't, there's going to be  repercussions in the Republican Party because Betsy is seen as a real  reformer, school reformer. </p><p>If they can't get her through, boy, it's going to be hard to drain the  swamp of our education system.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So why, though?  What are the challenge?  Why are they pushing  back on Betsy DeVos?  </p><p>FORBES:  Because of the fierce opposition of teachers unions.  This will be  the first education secretary since Bill Bennett.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  She didn't realize (ph).</p><p>FORBES:  .back in the Reagan administration.  She knows these fights.   She's very effective in Michigan and Detroit in getting charter schools and  getting real choice.  </p><p>And she exposes the real hypocrisy.  How many members of Congress send  their kids or grandkids to Washington public schools?  Barack Obama didn't  do it.  </p><p>Yet, they're forcing kids to go on failing schools.  It's got to stop.  And  she will do every (AUDIO GAP) to stop.  </p><p>And (ph) she's been through these fights.  That's why they fear.  She's had  experience.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is there anybody -- not to jump the gun, but is there anybody  who would be as much of a reformer as Betsy DeVos if she doesn't get  confirmed, Steve?  Is it a sign -- if she doesn't get confirmed, is it a  sign that the stranglehold and the kind of cartel that the unions have put  together in Washington will never be broken? </p><p>FORBES:  Yes, there are.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that is the ward, cartel.  </p><p>FORBES:  And it is a cartel -- bad cartel.  And there are good people out  there who have made some reforms in states like Arizona and elsewhere.  </p><p>But if she -- if Betsy DeVos goes down, it says the union is predominant.   And you've got elections coming up next year.  </p><p>Watch out Democrats because we will primary you if you even think of  supporting a real reformer.  So they -- and Republicans fear the NEA,  National Education Association as well.  </p><p>So the Trump administration has got to use (ph) political capital, get this  thing through because she also -- Betsy DeVos is a major figure in the  Republican Party.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.  </p><p>FORBES:  If you can't take care of your own big supporters who have done a  lot of work for the party, who've been pushing reforms that you like, what  does that say about other fights that are coming up? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But even more than that, she's got the goods.  I mean, she's a  school reformer.  </p><p>FORBES:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>FORBES:  A record of reform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead, Morgan. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Do you think this has anything to do with her somewhat shaky  performance when she went for her confirmation hearing?  Because we have  seen people like Rex Tillerson and Mnuchin who have not had to go through  the confirmation process before, who gave really excellent testimony before  the Hill, were incredibly well-prepared.  </p><p>I think even her, you know, fiercest allies would say it was a shaky  performance.  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes, but what -- what that does is simply give a cover for what  was going to happen anyway.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right (ph).  </p><p>FORBES:  The NEA knows this is a big, big battle.  And they are going to  find any excuse for their husband or her -- anything they could latch onto  to find an excuse to say, kill this nomination.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Do you see this as the existential threat to the teachers union?   And do you think Mike Pence is going to have to step in and save the day  here? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we've got these two, you get 50-50 and then Mike Pence  would -- would -- would lead.  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes, well, Pence will be glad to do it.  He -- he's been fighting  these battles.  </p><p>He was governor of Indiana.  He was in Congress before that.  So he  absolutely knows what these stakes are.  </p><p>And with high technology coming along, reformers now have more weapons to  break this monopoly.  And so I think the -- the unions know they've got to  try to stop this.  </p><p>And that's why they've -- even on the state level, they fight fiercely any  kind of reform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on judge Gorsuch?  Yesterday's meeting about  the Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump encouraged  Senate Republicans to go nuclear to get the nominee approved.  Listen to  this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  If we end up with a Senate gridlock that they've had in Washington  for the last -- longer than eight years, in all fairness to President  Obama, a lot longer than eight years, but if we end up with that gridlock,  I would say, if you can, Mitch, go nuclear, because that would be an  absolute shame if a man of this quality was caught up in the web (ph).  So  I would say it is up to Mitch.  </p><p>But I would say go for it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Trump also saying he would support the approval of Gorsuch with  51 votes instead of the traditional 60 that are required.  That's the  nuclear option.  </p><p>Steve, what do -- what do you think? </p><p>FORBES:  This is a case where that might not be necessary because in the  case of Gorsuch, one, he is so well-qualified.  What I like about him, for  example, is his understanding of the threat of what they call the  administrative regulatory state, where agencies make laws instead of  Congress.  </p><p>And -- but the Democrats are going to have a hard time really getting real  traction against him.  And it doesn't change the real composition of the  Supreme Court.  </p><p>So I think they -- they could peel off enough Democrats because the  Democrats are going to want to preserve the filibuster if the (ph)  nomination comes up that could -- could change the complex of the Supreme  Court, the ideological complexion.  They want to save it for that, to break  that nominee who is so well-qualified, who doesn't change the composition  of the court, they are probably going to save their power (ph) for another  day.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before we move on, could we talk about tax reform for a moment?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes (ph).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, we were all in on tax reform.  And we thought that this  was happening sooner rather than later.  </p><p>Now, we're talking about a tax package, reform package, second half of the  year.  And we're talking about a border adjustment tax.  </p><p>Steve Forbes, where are we on this? </p><p>FORBES:  This is where President Trump is going to have to step in and say,  enough of this other stuff.  We've got to get these nominees through and  all that good stuff.  </p><p>But we're here as a tax package.  Move on it.  And this so-called border  adjustment tax, which is a national sales tax in imports -- hugely  destructive to this economy.  </p><p>Leave it out.  Go for a pure tax cut package, cut tax rates, do some  simplification, ram it through and make it retroactive through January 1.   Politically.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what he promised us.  </p><p>FORBES:  And he's got to move on it because politically, if people don't  feel right away that this new president is delivering on a better economy,  better paychecks, new investments coming, they're going to have a much  harder time as opposition gains ground against this administration.  He's  got to understand that his opponents are out -- talk about nuclear, to  destroy him in an impeachment.  </p><p>And he'd better get as much political capital, a good economy as Bill  Clinton discovered does wonders when you get in trouble.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's -- that's the whole -- that's the whole game plan from  the Democrats, is to bog this president down.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  .at -- at every turn and bait him rather than focusing on making  people's lives better.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" put it so brilliantly in  its editorial page about a week ago that every decision out of that White  House has to be scrubbed with does it help grow the economy, does it  improve people's lives, does it grow their wages, period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was his priority the whole campaign.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Growth, growth, growth.  But my worry is it's not just the  Democrats.  It's Paul Ryan.  </p><p>He's in the border adjustment tax in the GOP plan.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, it is.  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  From last year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  From last year.  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  And then this is what's so strong.  You know, the EPA was  doing its job but find out why it is that people like Paul Ryan go to  Washington and then come up with this kind of cool aid (ph) tax increase.  </p><p>And you know, what are they drinking down there, breathing (ph) down there?   It's a destructive tax.  Leave it out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will they, though, do?  I mean, I know what you're.</p><p>FORBES:  FORBES:  They -- they -- they.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  recommending.  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes, they.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that's where this is going? </p><p>FORBES:  You know, this is where the president has to step in and say, cut  it out, leave it out.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  I think the cooler (ph) heads, when he meets with the CEOs today,  are going to say, this thing is destructive to what you're trying to do.   Cut the corporate tax rate.  </p><p>Go with the pure basis he came up.  And that will drive the economy.  </p><p>FORBES:  This is so bizarre.  They say, well, other countries hurt their  consumers with the sales taxes.  We should do the same thing.  No.  </p><p>It doesn't (ph) make this difference.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said that yesterday about -- Steve, I was like, here is Steve  Forbes on the border adjustment tax.  It's horrible.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Of course, you don't speak that way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just no.  Great stuff.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>FORBES:  Thank you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve Forbes there.  We want to bring you this tweet -- the  president just tweeting again.  Here is what he said this morning.  </p><p>\"Iran has been formally put on notice for firing a ballistic missile.   Should have been thankful for the terrible deal with the U.S. made with  them.  </p><p>Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along  and gave it a lifeline in the form of the Iran deal, a hundred and $50  billion,\" yes, in cash.  We will have more on this at the top of the hour.  </p><p>President Trump tweeting about Iran and -- and this most recent upset --  we'll get into it next.  Coming up, reaching new speeds -- AT&amp;T announcing  its ultra-fast wireless network is coming to U.S. cities later this year.  </p><p>We will tell you where.  And then Beyonce breaking the internet -- the  pregnancy announcement that everybody is talking about this morning, back  in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Want to show you markets this morning.  We're  looking at a lower opening for the broader averages.  </p><p>Take a look -- Dow Industrials down about 50 points.  We do have the jobs  number out tomorrow for the month of January.  </p><p>A couple of names we're watching -- AT&amp;T, announcing plans to launch its 5G  wireless services in two cities this year.  These rollouts will take place  in Austin and Indianapolis and will offer speeds nearly 40 times faster  than standard cellular service.  </p><p>AT&amp;T stock up nearly 70 percent year-over-year.  We're watching Abercrombie  &amp; Fitch.  The company has named Fran Horowitz as its new CEO.  </p><p>Horowitz will be Abercrombie's first CEO since Michael Jeffries stepped  down.  That was in 2014.  Abercrombie's stock down 56 percent over the last  year, as you can see from that one-year chart.  President Trump and  daughter, Ivanka, made an unannounced trip to Dover Air Force Base  yesterday to honor the returning remains of a U.S. Navy SEAL killed in a  weekend raid in Yemen.  </p><p>Lauren Simonetti with details now.  </p><p>Lauren?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Hi, Maria.  William \"Ryan\" Owens from Peoria, Illinois, died in  the raid.  And Trump met with the Owens family during his two-hour visit to  the base.  </p><p>Owens was the first known U.S. combat casualty in a mission ordered by the  new president.  Three other service members were wounded. </p><p>And more than a half a dozen militant suspects were also killed in that  raid in al-Qaeda compound.  The dead included the eight-year-old daughter  of a radical clerk and U.S. citizen who was killed by a drone strike six  years ago.  </p><p>Well, Tesla Motors is dropping the motors.  The name changed to Tesla Inc.,  shows the company's ambitions to move beyond just selling high-end electric  cars and shifting into energy products like solar panels and home  batteries.  </p><p>Tesla agreed to buy Solar City, if you remember, for over two and a half  billion dollars back in November.  Well, here is one beer run that won't be  forgotten ever.  </p><p>Over the holidays, this guy, Lyle Randa, of Wichita, Kansas, he ran out to  buy some Bud Light during a family party.  And as he was restocking cans  from the pack into the refrigerator, he noticed that one was gold, meaning  that he was eligible for Bud Light's Super Bowl tickets for life  sweepstakes.  </p><p>Well, as luck would have it, Randa was actually chosen from 37,000 people  to win the grand prize -- Super Bowl tickets for the rest of his life.  And  he is now on his way to Houston for Super Bowl 51 on Sunday right here on  Fox.  </p><p>And finally, check this out, Beyonce shattering even more records with this  photo on Instagram, revealing the news that she is expecting twins.  This  picture is now the most liked post of all time, receiving over seven and a  half million likes since yesterday.  </p><p>Selena Gomez previously held that title.  She had over six million likes  for that photo with the lyrics of her song on the Coke bottle.  </p><p>But back to Beyonce's picture, I don't get the getup.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I don't get it (ph).</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Veil, the flowers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  And the -- and the veil. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Can anybody help me out? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's -- that's her pregnant with twins.  That's me after  lunch.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I don't think so, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm not wearing that.  I'm taking (ph) the photo of it.   But.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The immaculate conception. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, wow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations, Beyonce.  Coming up, it is Groundhog day.   Those who plan to celebrate in Punxsutawney may want to crawl in a hole  when they see their hotel bill -- how prices rival those in Houston for the  Super Bowl.  </p><p>Yes, back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is Groundhog day today.  That means it is  that time of the year when the country watches to find out whether we will  have an early spring or six more miserable weeks of cold and snow.  </p><p>Fox News meteorologist, Janice Dean, is live this morning in Punxsutawney,  Pennsylvania.  </p><p>Hey, Janice.  </p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria.  We are live in  Punxsutawney.  This is my first Groundhog Day here.  </p><p>And it is exciting.  Phil is going to come out at 7:25 Eastern time.  Will  it be an early spring?  </p><p>We don't know.  But John Griffiths (ph) is here with me.  He is an official  Punxsutawney Phil handler.  </p><p>John, what do you think -- early spring today?  Can you give me any  indication? </p><p>JOHN GRIFFITHS, HANDLER, GROUNDHOG CLUB:  I -- we have no way of knowing  until he comes out of the stump.  He -- we -- we do not have a preconceived  notion on what it's going to be.  </p><p>DEAN:  Now, here is what I hear.  Phil is always right.  He is always  right.  But what happens -- sometimes, the media gets it wrong.  </p><p>And they say he's wrong.  </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  Well, mostly, it's our president.  He may misinterpret every  now and again.  </p><p>He's -- he's not quite fluent in groundhog ease (ph).  </p><p>DEAN:  Groundhog ease (ph) that he speaks. </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  Groundhog ease, absolutely.  </p><p>DEAN:  A lot of people don't speak that.  So it gets lost in translation.  </p><p>GRIFFITH:  First (ph), one person, our president, yes.  </p><p>DEAN:  OK, so tell me what your job is to handle.  </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  Basically, it's -- for this morning, it's to pull him out of  the stump and hold him up for the adoring fans.  </p><p>DEAN:  Yes.  </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  And then my partner will take him onto the stub (ph) and we'll  get his prediction.  Other than that, it's 365 days of feeding him and  cleaning his cage or zoo and.</p><p>DEAN:  And what about Mrs. Punxsutawney? </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  He does have a wife, Phyllis.  And she stays with them at -- at  the burrow, which is their zoo downtown.  </p><p>DEAN:  You know what I heard?  I heard that if he sees his shadow, it's six  more weeks of winter.  If he sees his wife, it's six more groundhogs.  </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  Could be.  </p><p>DEAN:  So 7:25.  This is a huge crowd here.  And I wanted to point out that  the -- the hotels here at Punxsutawney are more expensive than they are at  the Super Bowl.  </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  Yes, they are.  So that report myself, it kind of shocked me.   But you have to remember, we only have two in town so.</p><p>DEAN:  How many people are you expecting here today? </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.  </p><p>DEAN:  How many people are you expecting here today? </p><p>GRIFFITHS:  Really, we never know because a lot of people come in from out  of the area.  They stay in surrounding towns.  </p><p>So we never know what's going to be here.  But I'll tell you what, it's a  great Thursday crowd here this morning, a lot bigger than what we  anticipated.  </p><p>DEAN:  More (ph) awesome.  </p><p>And the weather here, Maria, we're -- we're getting big fat snowflakes  right now.  So I don't know, maybe another six more weeks of winter.  We'll  have to find out.  </p><p>But of course, we'll give you the details when Phil comes out at 7:25  Eastern time.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look at -- look at those gloves you're sporting.  You are  having the best time.  </p><p>It's amazing how many people are coming out for this, Janice.  And you just  said a minute ago that the hotel tickets are even more expensive than the  Super Bowl.  </p><p>But you're also being honored, right, into the Weather Discovery Center  Hall of Fame.  Wow, what an honor.  </p><p>Congratulations, Janice.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Yey, Janice.  </p><p>DEAN:  Thank you.  Oh, thanks, Maria.  Thank you.  What an -- what an honor  to be here today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching you, Janice.  Thanks so much.  We want to  know, Fox News (ph) meteorologist and author of the children's book,  \"Freddie the Frogcaster,\" and the \"Terrible Tornado.\"  </p><p>Thank you, Janice.  We will get back to you to see Punxsutawney Phil and  whether or not he sees the shadow.  He has not seen the shadow 18 times in  decades.  </p><p>All right, coming up, we are shaking things up with cocktails you can put  in your pocket, next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  You'll want to check it  out.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Welcome back.

Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the  U.S. made with them.\"  </p><p>He is echoing sentiments from national security adviser, General Michael  Flynn.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MICHAEL FLYNN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  Iran continues to threaten U.S.  friends and allies in the region.  The Obama administration failed to  respond adequately to Tehran's maligned actions, including weapons  transfer, support for terrorism and other violations of international  norms.  </p><p>The Trump administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine  security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East  and place -- which places American lives at risk.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are taking a closer look.

And joining me to talk all about  it Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, former Goldman Sachs partner and  \"New York Times\" bestselling author Peter Kiernan and Maverick PAC national  co-chairman Morgan Ortagus.  Great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC:  Good morning.  </p><p>PETER KIERNAN, AUTHOR:  Wonderful to be with you again.  Thank you</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You too, Peter.  Thank you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Always so much to talk about -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Donald Trump, President of the United States -- tweeting,  tweeting, tweeting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tweeting, tweeting this morning on Iran, on -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The UC Berkeley protest.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- UC Berkeley protest.  That's what I was thinking of.   Well that was a horrible story, wasn't it?  We're going to get into it this  morning.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, the director of Center -- for the  Center for Politics at the University of Virginia Larry Sabato is with us.   The chief investment officer of CalPERS Ted Eliopoulos is here.  And Ohio  Congressman Tim Ryan, who of course, tried to go up against Nancy Pelosi  and lost that fight.  Former NFL star Jack Brewer also with us.  </p><p>Big hour ahead so stay right there with us ahead this morning.</p><p>We kick it off right now with the Trump administration, intensifying its  efforts to secure the southern border in spite of challenges.  President  Trump warned the Mexican president in a phone call that he was ready to  send U.S. troops to stop quote, \"bad hombres\" unless the Mexican military  takes action to control them, according to excerpts of a transcript  obtained by the Associated Press.</p><p>This is coming as Department of Homeland Security Secretary General John  Kelly sat down in an exclusive interview with Fox News' Catherine Herridge  to spell out a time line for that border wall.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEN. JOHN KELLY, U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  I think it'll be  built where it's needed most first and then fill it in.  </p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  Ok.</p><p>KELLY:  That's how I'm looking at it.  I really hope to have it done within  the next two years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is former Minnesota governor, Tim  Pawlenty.  Governor -- good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  </p><p>TIM PAWLENTY (R), FORMER MINNESOTA GOVERNOR:  Good morning.  Good to be  with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's your take of the efforts to secure the border and  what a time line might look like?  How do you see it?</p><p>PAWLENTY:  Well, if you're going to have a country you've got to have  border integrity.  We don't on the southern border.  And I think enforcing  the border through a variety of means including enhancing with a wall is  appropriate.  And it's also good negotiating leverage, by the way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In terms of paying for it obviously, Governor, that's the  issue.  How do you see that working out?  I mean is this going to turn into  and escalate into a fight between the U.S. and Mexico since Donald Trump  has been pretty adamant in terms of Mexico paying for that wall.  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  It may turn into a fight or have a relationship tension but  think of the size and magnitude of it and the unilateral authority that  Donald Trump possesses.  The estimates for the wall range from $10 billion  to maybe as much $20 billion but spread over a number of years.  That's a  large number but in the context of federal spending it really isn't.</p><p>And by the way, Donald Trump can unilaterally impose surcharges, tariffs or  other potential taxes at the border that would allow him to claim Mexico is  either directly or indirectly paying for the wall.  So he's got a lot of  leverage to implement this as he's suggested or threatened.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but that's the thing.  I mean this whole idea of an import  tax -- we have been talking a lot about it.  Do you agree with that because  we are trying to -- to see how he's going to implement his campaign promise  which is lower taxes?  You know, border adjustment tax flies right in the  face of that.</p><p>And I don't know.  How does that jive with what you're talking about in  terms of tax on Mexico products?  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  Well, I think you have to look at it this way -- in terms of the  revenues and the cost and the advantages.  The border adjustment tax or so- called BAT tax has been estimated depending on how you do it and how large  it is to raise as much as a trillion dollars over ten years.  There's a lot  of potential concern about the BAT tax but it is unquestionably a very  large revenue raiser.  </p><p>Grover Norquist has said if you then cut other taxes by at least that much  or more. so the net effect of the tax reform is neutral or positive in  terms of cutting taxes, that at least he would find it acceptable as a net  tax cut.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  You know, Governor, I have a question.  Just -- </p><p>PAWLENTY:  Yes.</p><p>KIERNAN:  -- when you look at it, it's 1,900-miles, some of it forbidden  landscape, very tricky.  How are we going to build that out over any kind  of reasonable time period?  Or will there be walls in some part and then  virtual walls, if you will, or heavily guarded?  How do you see that  unfolding?  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  As you know much of the border does have a wall on it already;  much of it does not.  Some of the remaining terrain as you mentioned is  very difficult including semi-mountainous regions and other problems.  And  by the way there's some land ownership rights in Texas as well along the  border so you're going to have to deal with some eminent domain issues as a  practical matter if they are really going to complete the effort in a  couple of years.</p><p>some of it is probably going to have to be physical structure, some of it  maybe drones, some of it may be electronics, some of it maybe more human  resources.  But obviously he's going to make a big piece of progress here  in the next 24 months.  And I think he's going to do it.  He's got the  ability to pay for it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is -- Governor, it's is Dagen McDowell -- this is one of  myriad issues that the Trump administration has tackled just in his first  little more than a week in the White House.  Do you worry given -- because  some things have gone well, some things not like the executive order on  some immigration, it wasn't rolled out with care, if you will.</p><p>Do you worry that this White House is getting bogged down with too many  things and that kind of central promise of tax reform and growing the  economy might be on the back burner?  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  I think you wouldn't describe his first week as bogged down.   You might describe it as hyper-energetic.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I just was talking about bogged down with tax reform --  that's it.  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  I understand.  I think that is a potential concern because that  is one of the main things and as has been said, you want to keep the main  things the main things.  I think the proof will be in the pudding if you  fast forward nine or 12 months if tax reform gets done, nobody is going to  remember that they were a little off message or a little off focus in week  number one or week number two.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe not but the whole border tax -- border adjustment tax,  rather -- has that muddied the waters?  I mean has this become more  complicated than was promised?</p><p>PAWLENTY:  Keep in mind, it's the House Republicans that came up -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>PAWLENTY:  -- primarily with the border adjustment tax.  Donald Trump  actually was somewhat concerned about it a few weeks ago.  He has since  maybe has warmed up or his team has warmed up to it a little bit.  And  again Maria -- the trick is how do you do it?  The border adjustment tax  has got a lot of critics including people who think it's a camel's nose  under the tent to a VAT tax or a value-added tax.  </p><p>But again, until you see the other side of the ledger, the tax cut that  people are going to get, especially everyday Americans who are middle  income, in exchange for having to bear the burden of the BAT tax, let's  just see the other side of the ledger on the relief.  You really can't say  whether the package overall is a good idea or not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So do you think we will get tax reform this year  then -- Governor?  I mean that's what we are all wondering.  Because now we  are expecting that we know what it looks like in the first 200 days but  we're going to see implementation second half of the year.  Is that what  you think?  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  I think so.  Look, the Republican Congress and the leaders have  been salivating over tax reform for a decade.  This is their brief --  hopefully not brief but their shining moment to get it done.  And if they  don't, that's going to be a very big, you know, F on the report card.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're absolutely right.  I mean, you know, Kevin McCarthy and  Paul Ryan continue to say, look, we know what this window of opportunity  is, we are not going the waste it.</p><p>Let me switch gears -- Governor.  We want to ask you about Iran.  The White  House taking a strong stance against Iran after it tested ballistic  missiles in a show of aggression.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEN. MIKE FLYNN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  President Trump has severely  criticized the various agreements reached between Iran and the Obama  administration as well as the United Nations as being weak and ineffective.   Instead of being thankful to the United States in these agreements, Iran is  now feeling emboldened.  As of today, we are officially putting Iran on  notice.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"On notice\" -- Governor.  And then President Trump tweeted out  this morning, here is what he said in his tweet today.  \"Iran has been  formally put on notice for firing a ballistic missile.  Should have been  thankful for the terrible deal that the U.S. made with them.  Iran was on  its last leg and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a  lifeline in the form of the Iran deal, $150 billion in cash.\"</p><p>The administration's next step against the country obviously still to be  determined, Governor, what does that mean to you, \"put on notice\"?  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  I think putting on notice that we are not going to tolerate  their menacing behavior and their violations of U.N. resolutions and  treaties is a good thing.  And frankly it's long overdue.</p><p>Iran has been engaged in menacing behavior with respect to U.S. military  assets in the region, our allies' assets in the region.  They've been  flirting with violating the nuclear treaty.  They've been thumbing their  nose at U.N. resolutions including the ballistic missile resolution.  And  they've been coddled.</p><p>And bullies respect strength and not weakness and I think a declared  statement from President Trump and General Flynn is long overdue and  exactly on point.  And they only will respect strength.  And they didn't  see that unfortunately in the Obama administration.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Governor -- I couldn't agree with you more on the importance of  setting a new tone with Iran and what this new administration will do.   When you look at the JCPOA, the Iran deal, it's a multiparty agreement.   It's not a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and Iran.</p><p>So what are the practical steps that you think that the President and his  team can take to either can they amend this deal or what can they do going  forward to have it more than just putting them on notice?  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  Well, they can do a number of things.  First of all, if they are  trying to warm up our relationships with Russia, Russia has very important  relationships with Iran.  So exploring how Russia could be helpful in this  dynamic maybe of some value, although I'm skeptical of Russia as well.</p><p>Number two, when Iran does things like take runs at our ships in the  region, you have to tell them, you do that again, we are going to light you  up.  We're going to fire back.  Or we're going to fire at you.</p><p>And next when you violate the ballistic missile treaty, we are going to put  sanctions on.  And if the world community won't do it, we will do it  ourselves as the U.S.  But I think you've got to work with the allies and  try to get everybody to do it.</p><p>And then lastly, you have to look them in the eye and say if you violate  that nuclear treat, there are going to be more consequences. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PAWLENTY:  But this idea that -- we have agreements that nobody enforces  means the agreements themselves don't mean anything and that becomes a very  dangerous world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is President Trump doing so far in your view -- Governor?  </p><p>PAWLENTY:  Well, I was a Trump supporter.  I became a skeptic after some of  the revelations during his campaign.  But I have to say he's off to a  strong start.  And I'm hopeful for how he does from here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Governor -- good to see you.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>PAWLENTY:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor Tim Pawlenty there.</p><p>Coming up next, IBM super computer Watson using its smarts to file your  taxes -- how it can help you find deductions that you may have missed.  </p><p>And then one secret McDonald item coming out of hiding -- the fan favorite  sweet treat that is now officially on the menu.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>A mysterious military vehicle that carried a large Trump flag in Kentucky  belongs to the Navy.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti has the story now with other headlines -- Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey Maria.  </p><p>So a Navy official reportedly saying this vehicle spotted on Sunday flying  a blue Trump flag near Louisville was from a Navy Seal unit.  Now that's a  problem because regulations do not permit an unauthorized flag on a  military vehicle.  Officials have launched an inquiry to determine if any  misconduct can be linked to this incident.</p><p>Well, it's tax season and H&amp;R Block can help you out before you pull out  your hair.  It's using IBM's super computer Watson and its data-crunching  skills to answer customer questions to hopefully help tax filers score  better refund.  H&amp;R Block is betting big on this partnership airing a  commercial during the Super Bowl on Sunday to advertise.</p><p>There's a day care in Texas telling parents get off your phones.  One mom  is picking up her kid at that day care right outside of Houston when she  spotted a new sign on the door reading this.  \"You're picking up your  child, get off your phone.  Your child is happy to see you.  Are you not  happy to see your child?\"</p><p>It goes on from there.  The woman told Fox News that she completely agrees  with the message.  She said she happened to have her phone in her hand, of  course, and decided to snap a picture of it and share it with her friends.   Well, it went viral and has now been shared on Facebook more than 1.2  million times.</p><p>St. Patrick's day right around the corner which means it's McDonalds  shamrock shake season.  And this year there's something new.  The shamrock  shake has been a seasonal favorite at Mickey D for 40 years now but this  year you can get a chocolate shamrock shake.  Up to now you have to ask a  McDonald's staffer to add chocolate if they would do it.  It was at their  discretion, but now it's regular menu item during the season.  McCafe  Shamrock Chocolate Shake is the original Shamrock shake mixed with  chocolate syrup and topped off with mint sprinkles, whipped cream and a  cherry.  McDonalds is also adding a Shamrock chocolate chip Frappe and a  shamrock hot chocolate and shamrock mocha.  That's a lot of shamrocks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.  Too much chocolate.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.  Too much chocolate -- that's a sugar rush for me.  But  you can only get it for a limited time, so if you're interested, go soon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  Have you tried it -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've had a shamrock shake years ago but like -- I generally try  to stay away from things that if you drink one glass of it, it's basically  your daily caloric intake.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Not to mention green teeth all day.  That's a set back.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you mean?  It's like 3,000 calories or something?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, it's not 3,000.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  2,000.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Generally it's just -- I'm not a milk shake kind of gal.  I  would rather eat like a piece of cake.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  With green dye in there.</p><p>We are taking a look at the markets next; IPO market in particular.  What  to expect from Snap upcoming.</p><p>Public debut -- we are seeing a couple more IPO's after a long stretch of  weakness there.</p><p>And then we are just minutes away from Punxsutawney Phil's Groundhog Day  prediction.  How long do you expect winter to last?  We will tell you next  in Pennsylvania, live. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Listen to this.  Punxsutawney Phil is about to make his  prediction.  Let's take a look.</p><p>[LIVE COVERAGE OF PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL] </p><p>KIERNAN:  They're done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  As expected -- we are live in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania and we  just saw the program take place where the groundhog saw his shadow.  That  means six more weeks of winter is expected.  And we thought we were going  to get an early spring.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  I was ready to sign up for it, yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Dagen, can I stay with you in Miami for a weekend?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Unfortunately we work here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Signs of life meanwhile in the IPO market.  Invitation Homes  started trading yesterday.  That was the largest offering in over a year.   But the IPO Wall Street is waiting for the IPO is Snapchat -- that filing  expected any day now.</p><p>Joining us right now is Deven Parekh.  He's managing director at Insight  Venture Partners.  Good to see you -- Deven.  Thank you so much for joining  us.</p><p>DEVEN PAREKH, INSIGHT VENTURE PARTNERS:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How would you characterize the IPO market right now?  You  invest in private companies?  </p><p>PAREKH:  Correct.</p><p>So the IPO market in 2016 was very weak.  It was the weakest since the  financial crisis.  But I think you saw signs of life at the end of 2016,  you're starting to see strength early in the year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think Snap sort of snaps everything out of it?  I mean  is that the kind of deal that could get the action moving again in the IPO  market?</p><p>PAREKH:  I think the answer is yes, if you look back two weeks.  You had  AppDynamics which was about to go public and got taken out by Cisco.  It  basically doubled the price of the projected IPO price.  That, I think gave  people a lot of confidence that investors and companies are still looking  for growth.</p><p>The real problem in the IPO market if you look back really is more of a  supply problem than a demand problem.  If you talk to public investors,  they are still very interested in investing in growth.  </p><p>If you take the Internet category, to use Snapchat as an example, there's  164 public Internet companies between a billion and $10 billion dollar  market cap, only nine of them have a growth rate of greater than 30  percent. So there's just not a lot of things to invest in at scale which you need if  you're a large investor.  And Snapchat clearly fulfills that requirement. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting because you would think that when you're  looking for growth it's in tech.</p><p>PAREKH:  It is in tech but if you look at scale, lots of smaller companies  but scale companies, again, between the market capital of a billion and $10  billion, only nine companies to invest in.  Software -- same metrics, only  eight companies to invest in.</p><p>KIERNAN:  So Deven, you talked about a kind of dull period in '15 and '16.   After 2014 was $86 billion, $88 billion, is Snapchat which could be the  second largest U.S. tech IPO ever.  Is it going to be that kind of  triggering event that lights up the market again?  </p><p>PAREKH:  I think it's going to get credit for doing that but I think it was  happening anyway.  What I mean by that is if you look at the IPO backlog  for software and Internet companies, it's growing.  If you talk to any  investment banker you're going to hear that they are busier than they have  been in a very long time, getting companies ready.  We have a lot in our  portfolio really going right now.</p><p>Snapchat because they'll end up having been the first major one, I think  AppDynamics might have gotten a lot of the credit had they gone up and  traded up 100 percent.  Because Snapchat is the next major it'll likely get  the credit but the fundamentals going into 2017 were pretty strong for the  IPO market regardless.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  There's a report out on Re/Code that five of the major tech  companies among others -- Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Uber, Stripe -- are  writing a letter and they're going to give it to the President opposing the  immigration ban which I think this would be the first formal letter from  CEOs that are from the tech community to the President on this policy.   What's your take on that?  </p><p>PAREKH:  Well, I think if you look at the tech industry, we have a huge  demand for skilled workers particularly around, you know, coding and areas.   And I think if you talk to anybody in the tech industry they would tell you  that they want to solve a long-term structural problem that we have which  is we don't have enough domestic pipeline of that talent.</p><p>That, however, is not a problem we are going to solve in a month or two.   And so to put a -- to put a ban in place that potentially stops these  companies from hiring people that are in this country, often educated in  this country, and make it not possible for them to work here, I don't think  it's long-term good for the growth of those companies which I think is  frankly not long-term good for the growth of the overall economy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do these companies though realize because the leadership and a  lot of the executives in Silicon Valley were adamantly opposed to Donald  Trump as the presidential candidate.  They actively raised a lot of money  for Hillary Clinton, but now they're caught.</p><p>Do they realize -- are they in Washington trying to hire people who have  better relationships with the GOP and within the Trump administration?   I've heard that from people that these companies -- because they had an  easy ride in terms of policy with the Obama administration, now they're  worried.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  They are trying to hire conservatives.  </p><p>PAREKH:  Look -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Google was hiring like a conservative liaison before -- after  the election.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is media.  Look at NBC News and look at CNN.  </p><p>PAREKH:  I think all these companies understand that elections have  consequences -- right.  And the policy framework going into this  administration is not going to be the same.  They are going to try to no  doubt build relationships and hire people with more conservative  credentials to deal with the administration.  I don't think there's a  debate there.</p><p>I also don't think there's a debate that these companies have about  improving national security.  I think this is really the tech folks in  particular talking about an area where there's massive supply and demand  imbalance between the talent that we need and the talent that's available.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes.  And even if you exceed that, something in me tightens at  the notion of having a few less programmers from Yemen and Syria and some  of these countries.  I don't think this is a robust supply, so something  about their totality doesn't work for me that I don't think that's where  the real talent they're looking for is coming from.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  </p><p>PAREKH:  Right.  And I think if you think though -- I think the broader  concern is -- I mean the policies haven't come out yet but looks like  there's going to be reevaluation of how H1-Bs work as well.  And that's  probably where the real problem lies for most of these companies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How should it look?  </p><p>PAREKH:  Well look, the H1-B program was basically created to make sure  that if you had talent that was not readily available in the U.S., that  that talent could come here and be gainfully employed.  And I think the  concerns that some have had is that H1 visas have been gamed and that  people have been coming here that where there are people that are in this  country that could provide the same service.</p><p>I'm not saying that there's not some cases of that, I'm sure there is.  But  in total that's not the case.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are cases where companies, and we've heard about it on  this very program, where companies will bring in overseas workers on H1-B  visas and they will have the existing employees who are in the United  States train these people and then fire them.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are certainly instances -- </p><p>PAREKH:  Yes.  I'm not going -- I'm not going to say -- and I don't think I  or anybody in the tech industry is for that from a policy standpoint.  So  if we can solve that, I don't think anyone is going to dispute that.</p><p>But I think there's a broader -- there's a broader issue around  particularly in some of the highly-skilled areas, we just don't have enough  people graduating in those programs in this country.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  That's the problem, right.  I mean that's the fundamental  problem.  </p><p>PAREKH:  That's absolutely a problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Once again it goes back to education.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Half a million unfilled jobs according to the CEO of GoDaddy.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes.  And if we can fill up these and just sell 50,000 of those,  if the companies want them so much, why don't you ask the companies to pay  for it.  If you want that visa slot, by the way, that person can train the  young person from the United States.  You can put all kinds of hooks into  it to make sure that it makes sense for the American people.  </p><p>PAREKH:  Look, I think there's lots of different solutions.  I think the  concern right now is that we are going towards -- we're going towards a  policy framework which is trying to stop this type of immigration in total.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We will see what that meeting and the letter  looks like from these technology CEOs.</p><p>Deven, good to have you on the show today.</p><p>PAREKH:  Good to have me.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Deven Parekh joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, more immigration business on tap for the Trump administration --  the executive order that could be reexamining the visa programs.  We will  get more on that coming up next.</p><p>And then cocktails to go -- how you can shake up something, so exciting for  your flask.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy Thursday.  Welcome back everybody, I'm Maria Bartiromo  and it is Thursday, February 2nd, your top stories right now 7:30am on the  East Coast.</p><p>A busy day for President Trump once again today.  The commander-in-chief  set to attend the annual National Prayer Breakfast beginning just moments  from now, we will take you there live when he begin speaking.</p><p>This coming as new reports are surfacing this morning of a possible rift  with an American ally.  President Trump bashing President Obama's decision  to taking refugees from Australia.  The company's prime minister  responding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MALCOLM TURNBULL, AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER:  I can only say as I've said  before that I received the assurance that I did from the president himself.   That assurance was confirmed by the president's spokesman in the briefing  room of the White House.  And our officials, our respective officials are  continuing to work on the implementation of the arrangements, that's the  position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The very latest on the tensions coming up this morning.   Meanwhile, the president election win hitting one business hard.  While  Hillary Clinton lost is leading to a decline in ammo sales.</p><p>Earnings once again driving stocks this morning.  Amazon, the name to watch  set to report earnings after the close tonight.  Analysts are expecting a  big quarter given holiday sales.  The stock this morning looking higher on  Amazon.</p><p>Checking the broader market, Futures indicating a lower opening for the  broader average, take a look, DOW Industrials down about 40 points right  now.  This is off of the lowest of the morning nonetheless firmly in the  red.  NASDAQ down about 13 points.  In Europe, markets are mixed right now,  take a look at the euro zone averages and you see that the FTSE and the  CAC40 are both positive.  FTSE100 gaining strength in the last half an  hour, up two-thirds of one percent now, that's 40 points higher.  The DAX  Index still negative, that's just down by a fraction.  And in Asia  overnight, declines across the board to report.  The market in China still  closed for the Lunar Holiday.  The other average is down across the board.</p><p>Exams are the least of one student's worries.  The frigid bake mistake that  put a Massachusetts' teenagers weekend plans on ice.</p><p>Plus, get ready to bundle up, Punxsutawney Phil just making his groundhog  day prediction, listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL, GROUNDHOGS:  My faithful followers, I clearly see a  perfect clear shadow of me six more weeks of winner, it shall be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get ready for that.  We will have more on that coming up.  We  kick it off this half an hour though with the president and his stance on  religious issues.</p><p>The president is expected to speak at the National Prayer Breakfast today.   The Trump Administration released this statement earlier saying, \"The  president is proud to have been the first ever G.O.P. nominee to mention  the L.G.B.T.Q. community in his nomination acceptance speech.  Pledging  then to protect the community from violence and oppression.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is the Washington Times Columnists, Charles Hurt.   Charles, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>CHARLES HURT, WASHINGTON TIMES COLUMNIST:  Good to see you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well it's true.  I mean the president had the opportunity to  firm up his stance on L.G.B.T.Q. rights today and he was the first G.O.P.er  to come out and have Peter Thiel for example have such a big spotlight  during his campaign.  What are you expecting from this breakfast?</p><p>HURT:  Well this is always a sort of a bipartisan affair and I expect -- I  would hope that this year would be no different.</p><p>But I think that Donald Trump has done a very good job.  He's not  particularly known as a particularly overtly religious guy but he has done  a very good job of pinpointing the importance of religious liberty and I  think that that is why he was able to win over so many religious  conservatives in the election and he's done it largely by putting all these  social issues and just sort of putting them off the side and focusing on  things that people actually care about and no matter what your background  you end up supporting these things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean look, we'll take the audience there live when he  start speaking.  But even more of a headline this morning is the draft of  an executive order calling to reexamine a range of these programs, right?</p><p>And this new report is saying that they want to prioritize both jobs and  wages of the American workers, we do not have a specific industry that's  being pointed out here but it is rattling some firms, what's your take on  that particularly technology firms?</p><p>HURT:  Yes.  I was fascinated by your conversation earlier about this.  We  talk about -- these company executives talk about degree and workers from  overseas and all that's great, important but what about the untapped talent  in America in terms of -- of course, it would require education or it  requires looking at social policies, it require -- it's much more difficult  but wouldn't it be a lot better for America if we actually train people in  this country who are already Americans to do a lot of these jobs?</p><p>But, of course, politicians don't want to do that because they're always  looking for the easier path.  The second thing is on -- Donald Trump, he's  not -- not only is he not overtly religious, he's not a triply diplomatic  guy.  So he kind of rankles a lot of people around here with a lot of the  things that he says.  But for the first time, we're looking at a guy -- in  a long time, we're looking at a guy who looks at our immigration policy,  who looks at visa policies and he says, \"What's good for America?\"  Not  what's good for other countries.  He's not -- the big change between the  Obama Administration and this administration is that the Obama  Administration I think looked at immigration as a solution to other  people's problems.  And Donald Trump is looking at immigration as a  solution through America's problems.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of religious liberty, Charlie, It's Dagen McDowell, the  nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court really speaks volumes about  that and, of course, we talked about that with the expectation of many  people who voted for Donald Trump.</p><p>But Gorsuch's protection of religious liberty and particularly how the  decisions were over the Affordable Care Act, whether it was Hobby Lobby and  the Little Sisters of the Poor.  That really speaks to Trump at least  protecting religious freedom.</p><p>HURT:  Absolutely.  And if there are any never Trumpers left today who are  still suspicious of whether Donald Trump will make good on the promises  that he made to get the republican nomination, nothing will convince him.</p><p>Neil Gorsuch -- the pick of Neil Gorsuch is the entire game as far as I'm  concerned.  Obviously, it's -- you're the Scalia seat, so you're not  shifting the balance of the court but if there is another vacancy and  Donald Trump picks another Neil Gorsuch who simply believes that the  constitution says exactly what it means, then that will be a tremendous  victory that republicans and conservatives haven't seen certainly out of  any republican presidents since at least Ronald Reagan and even he gave us  Justice Kennedy.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  But a lot of people were critical to be fair the past eight years  that President Obama had done so much through executive order and was not  going through the congress.  Do you think putting another executive order  out on immigration is the right way to go or should the president and his  team do the tough job -- an incredibly tough job of trying to get congress  onboard for immigration reform for something that's codified in the law and  that can't be undone by the next president?</p><p>HURT:  I'm sympathetic to that and I agree with you.  I think that's a good  point.  I would far rather these things go to the legislature but there is  per view of the president to do certain things.</p><p>The knock on President Obama though was not just the executive orders, it  was that he was actually changing laws that he had no business changing.   He's actually bypassing congress and nothing that Donald Trump has done so  far approaches anything like what President Obama did in terms of ObamaCare  and a lot of other things that he had no business tinkering with.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Peter.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Charlie, isn't the key to the point we're making earlier about  unfilled jobs essentially a talent management problem that what we have is  thousands -- hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs and people who may or  may not be trained to do those jobs, aren't there ways we can connect those  dots using community colleges and other community resources to make that  happen and isn't that really what the job of this administration is going  forward?</p><p>HURT:  I certainly think so.  But that obviously is very hard to do and  that's why politicians have just sort of ignored it for decades and that  they don't want to address the underlying problems that lead to that  because it does, it's not just education, it's social programs, it's  incentivizing people to work, it's all the things that -- politicians would  rather just give free stuff away, it's much easier.  And so that's why they  just turned to, \"Well let's just open the gates and get cheap labor from  abroad.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well what's your take on the conversation the president had  with the Prime Minister of Australia in terms of saying, \"Look, we don't  want these refugees and that deal was made with President Obama, not me.\"</p><p>HURT:  Yes.  Well Americans did elect the guy who is not very politic,  that's for certain.  He's not very diplomatic and but, again, it's another  example of where this is a president who's looking at immigration, looking  at all of this in terms of what's best for America as supposed to what's  best for other countries.</p><p>I think it's most fascinating that all of the stuff is getting leaked and  it's getting leaked by bureaucrats in the administration, their heads are  exploding and I think that that's exactly what we probably saw over the  weekend as well with all the turmoil over the extreme vetting.  And that  turned out to be not that big of a dig but it was a huge deal all weekend I  think largely because you had bureaucrats all over the federal government  doing everything they could to throw wrenches into the works to make it  look like this huge disaster that it turned out it really wasn't. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was only laughing because you can hear Donald Trump on the  call saying, \"Come on, this is a dumb deal.\"</p><p>HURT:  Yes.  You felt you were watching an episode of The Apprentice.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It is funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- I mean -- but he say what he means.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why he's got the fan club that he does because he just  speaks very clearly, it was dumb.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  Say what you mean and walk the talk and he does  both.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Charles, thank you.</p><p>HURT:  And then if he goes over the line, he -- okay, so he goes over the  line, he doesn't apologize for it.  That's my favorite thing about him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nope.  Nope.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Charles, thank you.  Charles Hurt joining us there.</p><p>HURT:  You bet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, armed with political opinions, why Hillary Clinton's  election lost could be hurting ammunition sales.</p><p>And then one teenager finding herself in the deep end literally, take a  look at this picture of the icy situation she drove into, that's next.   Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tensions rising between police and protestors  over the Dakota Access Pipeline.  Lauren Simonetti with the details and  headlines now, Lauren?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Hi Maria.  Police say they arrested 76 protestors who refused  to leave the camp that was set up on private property.</p><p>Authorities want that protestors to move to a safer area because the spring  floods will arrive soon.  But official say there was this group of rogue  protestors and they tried to set up another camp nearby where they weren't  supposed to.  Police said that since August, they've made about 700  arrests, these protestors do not want to see the Dakota Access Pipeline  completed because they say the oil it would carry could contaminate their  drinking water.</p><p>Well, could President Donald Trump be hurting sales of ammunition?  The CEO  of Winchester maker, Olin Corporation says gun retailers have been  reporting slower than expected sales of bullets and ammunition after the  election.  He said, before it, gun owners increased buying ammo because  they felt that Hillary Clinton would win and would enforce stronger gun  control.</p><p>Two teenage girls, check out this picture, miraculously not hurt after  crashing their car into that icy swimming pool.  Police say they're on  their way to school when their Lexus veered off the road, crashed through a  fence, and then plunged into an in-ground pool.  Now fortunately, the car  actually landed in the shallow end and the homeowners were nice.  Then with  the police, they helped the girls wave their way out of the waters who took  crews three hours to pull their car out.  Pretty unbelievable.  I'm glad  everybody's okay.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  What a shot.  What an accident.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  And was the pool covered?  I didn't even see a cover on that  pool unless it went down with the car.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know what happens with teenagers though?  I don't know  about that particular accident but they always hit the accelerator instead  of hitting the brake.  It's just so common --  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Oh, because they're new to driving.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they're new to driving.  Yes.  Accelerator is not brake,  it happens all the time.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Big mistake there.</p><p>KIERNAN:  You need a bumper sign, \"I brake for pools.\"  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you remember the Toyota sudden acceleration problems?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The vast majority of that was related to people hitting the  accelerator, there was nothing wrong with the car.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  All right, coming up, spicy up your flasks, the  cocktails that could shake things up, we've got them, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are shaking things up this morning with  cocktails you can put in your pocket.</p><p>Joining us right now is Men's Journal Correspondent and Fort Defiance  Restaurant owner, St. John Frizell.  Good to see you St. John thank you so  much for joining us.</p><p>ST. JOHN FRIZELL, OWNER, FORT DEFIANCE RESTAURANT:  Good to see you, thanks  for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you brought some goodies here.  Your article in the March  issue of Men's Journal is giving tips on the best concoctions that you can  actually fit in a flask.</p><p>FRIZELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about that.</p><p>FRIZELL:  Well the idea is that flasks are fun to carry around and put  whiskey in but they're also fun to put like a cocktail in, it's a little  bit surprising when you're sharing it with somebody.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true because usually you don't do a mixed drink in a  flask.</p><p>FRIZELL:  Right.  But you can, there's no reason that you shouldn't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.  So what are your favorites?  </p><p>FRIZELL:  Well I brought a few here today.  This flask is filled with a  drink called the Ferrari.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Ferrari?</p><p>FRIZELL:  Which is a drink that is like a bartender shot, in New York, it's  equal parts Fernet-Branca and Campari.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>FRIZELL:  And those are both very strong, bitter liquors but together they  go really nice. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's the Ferrari, okay.</p><p>FRIZELL:  That's the Ferrari.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you'll mix it up and then you put it in a flask or you just  -- because you want to carry the mixed drink in a flask.</p><p>FRIZELL:  That's right.  Yes.  All mixed up and ready to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What -- I mean, why do people carry flasks around?  I mean what  are flasks used for?</p><p>FRIZELL:  Well to me, it's a way to -- it's like a secret handshake.  You  don't carry it just for yourself, you carry it to share it.  So you slip it  out your pocket, you look at someone, you give them a little smile, a  little wink, you offer them a drink and all of a sudden you're drinking out  of the same vessel as somebody else, you don't really do that that often.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Okay.  Because oftentimes you're using it when  you're going on a trip but are these becoming more prevalent or becoming --  does it resonate with people more?</p><p>FRIZELL:  I hope so.  I think it's a classy thing to do.  You show up at a  party or a camping trip or something like that with one of these in your  pockets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now I understand you have a special Mornings with Maria  cocktail that you created.</p><p>FRIZELL:  I do.  I do.  Yes, I'll show you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's see.  </p><p>FRIZELL:  So mornings are good, sparkly wine in the mornings is great.   This is a little Prosecco.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.</p><p>FRIZELL:  And then Mornings with Maria is in this one, this is equal parts  Aperol and Combier triple sec.  So it's got like an orange flavor, it's a  little bit bitter but I think it will be nice, let's see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.</p><p>FRIZELL:  And it's nice and orange.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So happy mornings.  Cheerful.  Cheerful color.</p><p>FRIZELL:  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's just Prosecco.  So it's Prosecco and the --  </p><p>FRIZELL:  And Aperol which is (inaudible) and the Combier which is an  orange liquor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.  Great.  And then this we'll put in a flask or --  </p><p>FRIZELL:  Yes.  Well you see --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did you choose that for Mornings with Maria?</p><p>FRIZELL:  Well I like the colors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  It is a good color.</p><p>FRIZELL:  And, yes, it's -- well, Aperol is a very popular morning drink.   There's a drink called the Aperol Spritz which is Aperol and Prosecco and a  little Seltzer and we sell a lot of those at Fort Defiance and this, we're  just upping the orange flavor a little bit to make it more like a Mimosa.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It looks good.  Well thank you for that.  Cheers.</p><p>FRIZELL:  I've got one more called the Diamond Back too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, the Diamond Back.</p><p>FRIZELL:  In this nice little (inaudible) flask.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.</p><p>FRIZELL:  This is rye whiskey, yellow chartreuse, and apple brandy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Apple brandy?</p><p>FRIZELL:  Right here.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay. </p><p>FRIZELL:  And that one is named after a turtle, the Diamond Back Terrapin  from Maryland that bites like a snake.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really good stuff, bites like a snake.  Wow.  Okay.  Good to  see you St. John.  Thank you so much.</p><p>FRIZELL:  My pleasure.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Appreciate it very much and cheers to you.  We'll be right  back.  Still to come, we're talking President Trump said to speak at the  National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C., we are bringing you his  remarks live when we come right back right here at Mornings with Maria,  stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning everybody, welcome back.

They were prevented from doing so this evening by violent Trump elect,  elect that it's terrified at anyone who they think might be persuasive or  might be interesting or might take people with them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The outrage this morning on the hills of that breakout.   Meanwhile, another member added to President Trump's cabinet, Former Exxon  Mobile CEO, Rex Tillreson has been confirmed and Sworn In as Secretary of  State.  This happened late yesterday.  Several other cabinet members  however are facing roadblocks, very latest on the confirmation process,  coming up.</p><p>A strong earnings report from Facebook, the stock is higher this morning,  the social media giant posted better than expected fourth quarter revenue.

More  winter is on the way.  We heard from Punxsutawney Phil earlier and he did  see his shadow six more weeks of winter.  All that coming up this morning.   And joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell,  former Goldman Sachs partner and New York Times best-selling author Peter  Kiernan and Maverick PAC National Co-Chair Morgan Ortagus.  Good to see  you.  Were you laughing at me?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PETER KIERNAN, NEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING AUTHOR:  Glad to be with you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, you had your coat on at the break (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a little chilly, and I'm still getting over that flu I had,  like, two weeks ago.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is right.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Youth comes back fast.  Youth comes back fast, you've bounced  right back.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Youth?  Yes.  That's -- I  don't even -- I'm so beyond that.  I don't even know what that word means  anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.  We got -- we got a big show ahead.  Look, we've seen  the markets trade to the flat this year on the heels of the big rally after  election night.  We're going to talk with the chief investment officer  CalPERS coming up, how he's allocating hundreds of billions of dollars  right now, and you wonder if in fact he's expecting the strength in the  market to continue.  What we need to hear from President Trump and his  administration.</p><p>So, Ted Eliopoulos will weigh in.  He's the CIO of CalPERS.  Plus, Ohio  Congressman Tim Ryan is with us this morning.  Of course, he tried to go up  against Nancy Pelosi and lost that bid.  We'll talk with Tim Ryan about the  Democratically Party.  And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney  weighing in as always.  Along with former NFL Star Jack Brewer.  You don't  want to miss a moment of it.  We got a big hour ahead so stay with us this  morning.</p><p>And we kick it off with those violent protests last night erupting at the  University of California, Berkeley Campus, over a speech from conservative  editor, Milo Yiannopoulos.  Rioters started fires, they broke windows --  look at this, they confronted police, ultimately causing the event to be  canceled.  Joining us right now is the University of Virginia Center for  Politics Director Larry Sabato.  Larry, thanks very much for joining us.   And what do you have to say about this violence? </p><p>LARRY SABATO, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CENTER FOR POLITICS DIRECTOR:  Well,  as Peter Kiernan knows, I'm from the University of Virginia.  I've been  associated with university for 47 years, it is Thomas Jefferson's  University.  We believe in free speech, I've had literally a hundreds of  speakers that I've brought in to the university from right to left and  everything in between, I've never had a single problem.  So obviously, what  happened at Berkeley was wrong.</p><p>You've got lots of choices, you can boycott an event you don't like, you  can peacefully protester it, you can go and ask questions during the Q and  A period, you hold a counter event, what you should not do is to shut down  the actual event and deny someone the right to speak, if they've been  invited by a group and it's follow the rules of that university.  So, this  is not a good thing, but let's not overgeneralize, this is one university,  I'm sure it's happened elsewhere but there are plenty of universities, like  the University of Virginia not nearly as good but like they're like the  University of Virginia and that they welcome speakers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we don't -- we don't want to generalize about  universities across the board but there is a thread that goes through  universities across the board frankly, I mean, not cutting off free speech  but you said that so, I -- what I really wanted to say to you was who's  accountable, who do you guys think is accountable?  Should leadership from  University of Berkeley U.C.  have come and put an end to it?  What could  have been done to stop this?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  That it ultimately falls into the hands of the  leadership of the university, and quite frankly, it leads to anecdotally  there is this move -- this thread among universities particularly with a  lot of professors that there is -- there's no room in the classroom for a  differing opinion.  </p><p>SABATO:  Well, you know, I can't speak for every university or every  professor or every classroom.  I sure know my students don't fear me at all  and they constantly object to this, that, and the other, and raise contrary  opinions and I encourage it and that's what you should do in a classroom.   So, when you say there's a --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you said Peter Kiernan knows that.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes.  Well --</p><p>SABATO:  He knows that.  He knows that.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Larry has taught all four of my children and in the process he's  taught me a heck of a lot too.  And I think, you know, what we're talking  about here though is I think a shared community obligation.  It can't just  be that something that the president does alone or the faculty does alone  or the students.  There are many stakeholders here and I think what UVA  does uniquely well and could be a -- I think a magnet for other people to  watch is bring all these forces together in a way useful that it's useful.   And I think what you're seeing in going on in Berkeley and U.C.  Davis is  not useful in any way and the person ultimately harmed frankly is the  student.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's true.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC NATIONAL CO-CHAIR:  Well, why not hold the  student -- if you peacefully protest, that's fine.  You have every right to  peacefully previous as much as you do to have free speech.  But how about  holding the students who are violent and accountable in some many sort of  punishment so that other students know you can peacefully protest that you  can't -- you can't burn building and break windows, I mean, that's just  silly.  And you're responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KIERNAN:  No.  It's true.  Absolutely, you have to hold -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We all live free on this but unfortunately this bias  continues throughout the university.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had it at Wake Forest for a shoot, I had it down in Wake  Forest in the late 80s where it was like my speech was only was free if it  agreed with some of my professors and I was targeted because I was in a  sorority and some of my professors didn't like that.  And so, I think that  this has gotten away from itself because there's a lack of leadership, I'm  not talking about the University of Virginia but it's certainly a lack of  leadership or it's just a control of the liberal left.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Professor Sabato, I want to if I could ask you one question and  that is you've seen -- you've seen them come and go, you've seen  contentious elections, you've seen contentious campaigns but what is the --  what is the way for us to evaluate and think about Trump's start, he's done  some great things, he's had speed bumps.  Where do you see him in continuum  of things and what should we be taking from this is just starting out and  rough spots and what should be longer term concerns if there are any?  </p><p>SABATO:  Well, he's been in office for 14 days.  It is a four-year term.  I  told people, you know, suspend judgment, you give anybody a reasonable  trial period.  Whenever we start a new job, often we have a rough period,  so, you know, his supporters are pleased, they're  focusing on the things  they like, and his opponents, their disbeliefs, they're focusing on things  they don't like.  Let's see how this turns out as we move into, you know, a  six-month period or the first 100 days ends which ends at the end of April.   That seems like a much fair trial period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me switch gears and ask you about the president's  cabinet, I mean, obviously another member was added yesterday, former  ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Larry was confirmed and  sworn in as  secretary of state but there are other nominees that are facing real  roadblocks.  Two republican senators say they will vote against Trump's  pick for education secretary, that's Betsy DeVos, If these senators follow  through, republicans would only need one more no vote to block DeVos'  appointment, what do you think here?  That the White House administration  shared their confidence that Betsy DeVos would be confirmed and listen to  this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  I have one hundred percent  confidence she will be next secretary of education.  She is unbelievably  qualified educator, an advocate for students, teachers, parents.  It will  be, you know, I think that the games that are being played with Betsy DeVos  are sad.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you see it, Larry?  Do you think she will get confirmed? </p><p>SABATO:  Well, obviously it's a -- it's a close call.  Let's remember,  historically a president losses on one cabinet member, either the person is  forced to withdraw or doesn't pass the senate.  Something happens usually  to at least one some have two or three, I think DeVos might be the only  one, I don't know whether she will lose another republican or not or  whether she will gain one democratic vote, you know, there's always Senator  Joe Manchin from West Virginia, I haven't heard him speak yet on how he's  going to vote, maybe he issued a statement and I missed it.</p><p>But, you know, the broader picture is -- I think represented by someone  like Rex Tillerson.  I've had the opportunity to meet Mr. Tillerson talk  with him in his prior role over the years on a number of occasions.  I  think he will make a very good secretary, I think people will be surprised  that how well-trained he has become, thanks to being CEO of ExxonMobil  which is big and has its own foreign policy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Larry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Larry, in terms of how the democrats handle four years of the  Trump administration because there is so much outrage on social media about  the Hillary Clinton loss, about Donald Trump, and they're really pushing  the leadership whether it's Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer to fight the  Trump administration at every single step.  Is this what we're going to get  for four years and will it get worse? </p><p>SABATO:  I don't think you will and I certainly don't think it's wise to do  that simply because you can't fight everything, I mean, that's -- it's  absurd to even try to do that, you have to focus your attention on items or  individuals that really concern you.  And actually the Supreme Court  nominee is going to be a good test, do you -- do you really spend all of  your limited ammunition on somebody who's almost certain to be confirmed?</p><p>And it's a pretty impressive person when you listen to him, you read his  credentials, whether you agree with him or not, I mean, that's not --  that's beside the point.  Or do you wait for that critical change that's  coming when Ginsburg or Kennedy or Briar steps aside, that's when the court  will change.  That's when to use your ammunition.  Don't lose the  filibuster on Gorsuch.</p><p>So there are important distinctions here and it's up to the leadership, you  mentioned, leadership in universities, it's up to party leadership to make  that case to the rank and file.  If they're angry, they're angry but they  also have to -- have to use sense.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But I mean, what about all the other be pushback from  these -- from, you know, on these nominees?  I mean, do you think this is  obstruction by the democrats or is this just politics as usual? </p><p>SABATO:  Well, it's -- this is a continuum.  If you look back over, you  know, 30 years, you'll see that it's gotten worse and worse and worse just  as polarization has gotten worse.  So I would say with each do  administration we seem to go a step or two or three further along this line  of division which is not healthy for the country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  It isn't.  </p><p>SABATO:  I don't have much optimism that it's going to change any time  soon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Larry.  We'll leave it there.  Good to see you.   Thanks so much.  Larry Sabato.</p><p>SABATO:  Thanks a lot.  Take care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a short break.  When we come back we are awaiting  remarks from President Trump at the National Prayer Breakfast, you see that  on the bottom of your screen here.  And then coming up.  First Lady Melania  Trump getting ready for a big change as she's gearing up for move to the  White House, that's next.  And then investors hoping for a belated  Christmas gift on Amazon's 4th quarter earnings.  What to expect from the  Ecommerce retailer straight ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Market this morning expected to open lower, stocks soared after  the presidential election of course, but the Trump rally has been slowing  down, this year, leading investors to look into Trump policy before they  make their next move.  Joining me right now is CalPERS Chief Investment  Officer Ted Eliopoulos joining us right now.  And Ted, it's great to have  you on the show today..  </p><p>TED ELIOPOULOS, CALPERS CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER:  Maria, thank you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Thank you for having me.  It's so nice to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's important to check in with you because you are  overseeing such a massive amount of capital, $306 billion, is that right?   The AUM at CalPERS right now?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  That's exactly right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How are you allocating that and has it changed with the new  administration coming in?  </p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Well, we're allocating it according to our long-term strategic  asset allocation of course and we're heavily waited to equities in our  strategic allocation.  And really going into this U.S. election, we  position the portfolio to -- take into account both the hopes for equity  allocations in the future but also the risks of this election.  Post- election is really the same story.  There is much hope and optimism for  growth in the U.S. in positioning of portfolios to take advantage of that  growth.  CalPERS benefited immensely from the run-up in equity markets over  the last month and a half for sure.  Now the question really is as you  know, what happens in the future?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, I think this market was really rallying on the  idea that we would see corporate tax reform, obviously a 15 percent  corporate tax rate or a 20 percent corporate tax rate, would do a lot for  earnings, yes? </p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Yes, it would.  As well as regulatory reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Both would be very productive for growth in the U.S. and  translate to better earnings, better equity returns for the future.  But  there are also some risks to take into account.  One is what impact on  inflation, we have been on a -- in a very low inflation -- inflationary  environment and what impact could be on inflation is something to keep an  eye on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you prepare yourself as an asset manager for that?  I  mean when you look at inflation perhaps on the horizon, does that change  your assessment of what to do with bonds versus stocks?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Well, it's very difficult spot for investors right now because  you have to prepare for some  divergent outcomes is -- are we having  inflationary environment going forward or continue to have a deflationary  environment?  There is no one portfolio that's going to be maximized in  each of those environment.  So, for CalPERS, we have such a dominate equity  position in our portfolio, almost 48 percent of the portfolio today.  We  have bought some inflation protective securities and repositioned the  portfolio as well as commodities in the run-up to the election.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In terms of 48 percent in equities, is that through index  funds, ETFs or specific names?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  We're direct in the -- in that global index of stocks, so we  are predominantly an index investor with enhancements that we do mostly  internally with our internal global equity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the enhancements?  Tell us about that because today,  you can buy an index with whatever combination you want, right?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  That's right.  So, we have several factors we look at, it  could be momentum, value, quality, low volatility, maximum diversification,  there are risk factors that allow us to tilt the portfolio slightly in  directions that we see benefit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you look at overall areas that you have to allocate  capital, we talked in the past about hedge funds and you've been vocal  about -- look, the fees are something to watch, and it's not as, you know,  a profitable thing anymore as well as private equity.  You're developing  plans to shift somewhat, $30 billion in terms of private equity away from - - what are you doing in terms of shifting?  </p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Sure, yes  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to move in-house as pensions cut fees.  </p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Yes.  We're trying to bring as much in-house as we can, we  have over 70 percent of our portfolio we managed internally.  Most of that  is in a public asset classes.  We have added a new allocation to actually  opportunistic credit, to new credit strategy, structured credit, private,  we think that's an opportunity for the future.  And that bringing -- we  have that talent in-house, we have active fixed income managers within our  staff that are able to execute those strategies with confidence.</p><p>In the private market much is a much tougher assessment whether you can  bring in-house, those strategies, and we're not sure right now on the  private equity side that we could effectuate a strategy to compete with the  external managers that are our partners that have done extraordinarily well  for us overtime.  The fees are high but the returns and the performance net  of all those fees have been quite robust, and persistent for over 20 years  for now -- for us now.  So, it is a very important calculus to try and  adjust the external internal model internally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you have any concern that we're not going to see the tax  cuts and the rollback of regulations instituted this year and would that  dictate a change in the way you invest in all those equities?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Well,  we'll stay heavily invested in equities for the long  term, we are a long-term investor, we'll be watching quite closely over the  next six months to see how difficult and how swift these policy changes may  come.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because people are wondering if in fact, you know, there's  money for this.  I mean, yes, they want it revenue neutral and one of the  president's underlying Mick Mulvaney says, look, we got to take a chopping  block to the entitlements as the guy running who's running the largest  pension fund, CalPERS out there in the country, what's your take on cutting  entitlements?.  </p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Well, you know, these are -- these are promises that have been  made to -- ordinary pensioners, that's our -- that's our view.  For  CalPERS, our duty is to pensioners and we have hardworking policemen,  firemen firewomen --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Going to keep those promises.</p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  You have to keep those promises, so the key to make sure you  price them and you save for them in order to keep those promises for the  long term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ted, it's great to have you on the show today.  </p><p>ELIOPOULOS:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Ted Eliopoulos is the chief investment  officer of CalPERS.  We have breaking news right now, the hostage situation  at a Delaware Prison.

Well, it's  February 2nd,  groundhog day and Punxsutawney Phil says, \"I'm sorry, six more weeks of  winter.\"</p><p>A short time ago he happened to see his shadow and according to legend that  means spring's arrival is going to have wait a little bit longer, how  accurate is Phil?

And they want to make you look as bad as possible, I think there is  a certain dishonesty if they go against -- from not very long ago and he  did get a unanimous endorsement.  </p><p>REX TILLERSON, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  I'm not concerned about  that and I can tell you why, because I think that their record of  obstruction is going to wear same with the people.

Blake Burman with the very latest right now  at the White House, Blake.  </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Maria.  Good morning to you.  Despite reservations really on both sides of  the aisle with past business dealings with Russia, the Senate yesterday did  indeed confirmed Rex Tillerson to become the next Secretary of State.  A  very narrow nomination but it passed, nonetheless.</p><p>He then came here to the White House, the Former ExxonMobil CEO did and  with the President and Vice President by his side, he was officially sworn  in.  The president also turned some heads yesterday at the White House  earlier in the day in which he appeared to give the OK for the Senate  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to change the Senate rules, should it get  to that point with another nomination.  That being the Supreme Court  nominee Neil Gorsuch. </p><p>(BEHIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If we end up with the same gridlock that they've had in Washington  for the last -- longer than eight years in all fairness to President Obama  -- a lot longer than eight years.  Then we end up with that gridlock, I  would say if you can Mitch, don't go near.  Because that would be an  absolute shame if a man of this quality was caught up in the web. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  You heard the president there say go nuclear.  That refers to the  so-called Nuclear Option, which would eliminate the 60 votes filibuster  threshold that Democrats are calling for and bring it down to 51.  I asked  the White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer about this yesterday Maria,  whether the White House would be comfortable going forward with that path,  Spicer told me that it's not the president's preference at this point, and  that essentially, it would Mitch McConnell's call.  We'll see if it gets to  that point, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake.  Thank you so much.  Blake Burman at the  White House.  Joining us right now is the man who ran against Nancy Pelosi  for Minority Leader.  Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan is with us.  And  congressman, it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>TIM RYAN, UNITED STATES CONGRESSMAN OF OHIO:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, your reaction to all of these stall tactics on the side of  Democrats, Sir, I mean, obviously, they are stopping and trying to do  whatever they can to stall President Trump from having his cabinet in  place. </p><p>RYAN:  Well, I mean, that's the process.  I mean, we're not messy  democracy, that's where we live.  You know, you saw it happen during  President Obama's tenure where the Republicans were literally blocking  every single thing he tried to do.  Jobs, bill of Supreme Court Nominee, so  now there is some real disagreement I think, whether it's with the Supreme  Court Justice or some of his nominees that violates some of the basic  values that, I think, Democrats have.</p><p>So, it's important for us to stand up, Republicans have the majority, they  are getting some of their nominees through, but this is all part of the  process, and I don't think it's anything unnecessary is happening but we  get - we have to stand up for what we believe in too. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What specific values are being violated? </p><p>RYAN:  Well, I think if you look at The Supreme Court Nominee, Trump, you  know, campaigned about draining the swamp.  The Supreme Court Nominee is  not for any kind of campaign finance reform at all.  I think if you look,  you know, at DeVos for example, the Secretary of Education absolutely no  experience in public education and also owes Ohio $5 million from fines  that she got a few years ago, when she was involved in another organization  that she hasn't paid.  I mean, these are legitimate things that - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well wait a second - </p><p>RYAN:  Obviously, we need to talk about. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you say Judge Gorsuch, I mean, this is the individual who  was confirmed unanimously just 10 years ago by Republicans and Democrats.   So, what changed other than him being Donald Trump's pick? </p><p>RYAN:  Well, I think the fact that Donald Trump campaigned on draining the  swamp, that he is not for draining the swamp, he is for, you know,  unfettered money coming into politics with many, many people are against.   President Trump campaigned -- </p><p>Maria:  Yes.  I want to ask you about draining the swamp. </p><p>RYAN:  Hold on.  Hold on, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Go ahead. </p><p>RYAN:  He also campaigned on helping working class people where the Supreme  Court Nominee is against right to work which would allow working class  people to organize.  So, I think these are legitimate things that we are  going to have fights over.  Let's not make too big a of a deal out of it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, all right.  Well, the problem is that the president needs a  team in place in order to execute some of the promises he's made.  I got to  get my team in here for you but I have one more question on draining the  swamp for you because there's an article right now, saying Nancy Pelosi is  leading her party into oblivion.  I mean, Nancy Pelosi said that the --  Judge Gorsuch is hostile to women's productive rights, hostility toward  children and school, children with autism, hostile appointments.  And as  far as President Trump, she says he's been wreck less and incompetent in  his recent Executive Order.  I mean, does she not understand what just  happened in terms of the election?  She is going against what the people  just voted for. </p><p>RYAN:  Well, I mean Democrats, not to be too frank, but we are in oblivion  as we speak now.  I mean, we are completely wiped out in the election so  we're trying to work our way back.  But I think Donald Trump also  campaigned, Maria, on stability and he's doing everything in his power to  make the globe more unstable at this point. </p><p>You see, the rally with the stock market has subsided a bit because he is  picking fights, he's doing things with -- the Muslim ban and immigration  that makes us look hostile to our allies in Muslim countries and Muslims  here in the United States when we know that these are very important things  that the kind of stability that we need. </p><p>He campaigned on bringing us that stability.  And he is making things  unstable, he campaigned on making us stronger and the Muslim ban makes it  harder for us to prosecute the war on terrorism. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Congressman, I have to push  back.  It's not a Muslim ban.  These are seven countries that were  identified by the Obama Administration.  And the restrictions are based on  country, not religion, first and foremost.  But I want to get back to Nancy  Pelosi and the loss of the Democrats in rebuilding the party and making a  comeback is -- but is the way to do that, this kind of fierce rhetoric and  opposition that you're getting from not only Nancy Pelosi, but also Chuck  Schumer.  Is that how you win over voters over the next two to four years? </p><p>RYAN:  Well, you know, you have to take a stand on things that you believe  in, and it may not always be popular in the moment.  I'm not into real  hostile rhetoric.  I'm not into inflaming the situation.  We have enough of  that in Washington.  We need to reach out to each other and see if we can  find some common ground.  But </p><p>I will tell you, that it is the Chief Executive's responsibility to do  that.  I mean, he hasn't even reached out to his own national security  people, for example, with the immigration issue that we were just talking  about.  He even didn't talk to his own people.  They're not talking to  Democrats, that's the responsibility of the President of The United States.   President Obama did a lot of reaching out to Republicans, early on, through  a lot of the affordable care stuff.  He was always reaching out. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on.  The Affordable Care Act?  Don't go there.  He  don't care and he pushed through and he had absolutely no support on the  Republican side at all. </p><p>RYAN:  Are you kidding me?  He had no support?  I'm saying he reached out  for months and months.  And including in the Stimulus Bill, incorporated  the tax cuts into the Stimulus Bill that many Democrats didn't want.  We  wanted straight infrastructure spending to juice up the economy. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did he have to do so many Executive Orders, then?  Then how  come he had to do so many Executive Orders?</p><p>RYAN:  OK.  Because the Republicans were blocking every single thing he  did.  He had no choice.  But if he wants to get anything done to do  Executive Orders, you know it and I know it - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  I don't know that.  I don't know that at all.  </p><p>RYAN:  Mitch McConnell said that his number one goal -- Mitch McConnell  said his number one goal was to make sure President Obama didn't have a  second term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I think -</p><p>RYAN:  They blocked his jobs bill, they didn't vote, not one vote for  health care, their whole M.O. was to destroy Obama and make him a one  termer.  So, don't turn around two weeks into Trump's presidency and say,  \"Boy, you guys are being really unfair.\"  Look, this is not the rotary  club.  This is politics.  It's a full contact support.  If you can't take  the heat, get out of the kitchen. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ryan, I think it's also important to know that part of the  reason Donald Trump won the election is because of those Executive Orders.   It was as much a repudiation against President Obama, as it was the fact  that there was no message from your candidate. </p><p>RYAN:  Well, look. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's not forget what the reality is.  Your team lost. </p><p>RYAN:  And I like some of his Executive Orders.  Small business  regulations, I agree with it.  Re-negotiating TPP, I agree with it.   Finding a way to make NAFTA work for places like Youngstown in Warren  Akron, Ohio sit?  Let's sit down and do that.  I'm not here to butt heads  with him at every turn.  I'm here to work with him if we can.  But as I  said, he's not even reaching out to his own people on policy decisions,  he's certainly not reaching out the Democrats.  But when we stand ready if  there is something we can work on. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, one final question.  Are the Democrats going to put  anybody under 70 years old in power?  In leadership? </p><p>RYAN:  Well -- I did my part I did my part to try to try.  You know, I  think we do need new faces in the democratic party and I think we need a  solid approach that reaches out to all corners of the country.  I think we  have a good agenda that we need to just push and get out.  We need to  rebuild the country, we need broadband in every corner of the country to  unlock certain communities that just can't compete in the new economy  because they don't have the new America 2.0 infrastructure like broadband.   And, you know, education reform and all the rest.  So we have an agenda but  we've got to be willing to sit down and try to get it through. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, part of that issue is the party is being hijacked by the  extreme left.  Is that a fair statement? </p><p>RYAN:  Well, we're in an era in the country of extreme partisanship and I  think President Trump needs to do a better job of figuring out how to do  things without inciting everybody in the country and in the world.  Now you  look at what is going on with refugees and people coming over here. </p><p>Look, no bureaucratic system is perfect.  If there's things we need to do  to sit down and some, fine.  But the reality is, if we're going to be real  concerned with refugees coming over here or people coming over here as  terrorists, they're probability not going to come from Yemen.  They're  probably not going to come from Syria. ]</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why not?  </p><p>RYAN:  They're probably going to be smart enough to come through a European  country into the United States.  And so let's sit down and figure out how  we can work with our European allies to tighten things up to make sure that  we are covering the entire ground.  We have a really strong vetting  process, of course it can be improved but he didn't need to do it in a way  that makes it hostile to where tech companies are freaking out because, you  know, they have Muslim workers to where a doctor at the Cleveland clinic is  getting stopped and not allowed back into the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>RYAN:  You don't need to do this.  It just - there's too much chaos with  Trump, too much drama.  Sit down, relax, breathe in through nose and let's  figure out how to work together and get the country going again. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick.  Peter Kiernan.</p><p>PETER KIERNAN, NEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING AUTHOR:  Well I have to say I  watched you closely when you were running your campaign for -- excuse me --  minority leader.  I think you would have made a great one.  I don't believe  you would have fought at every single step, at every single turn, the way  Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are.  Do you have a reaction to that?  </p><p>RYAN:  I think we do need to pick our spots.  I think we've got to find  points of agreement and -- but there are people are -- excited about a  couple of these nominees.  I think that the immigration issue, the Muslim  issue, insight a lot of people's sensibilities including mine that, you  know, you're going to put Muslims back in the line trying to get in the  country.  You're going to tell refugees who want to come into a safe haven,  sometimes United States, sometimes other countries that are coming from a  war that we started guys.  I mean, we started this war.  So we have some  responsibility.  So, no.  I don't think you fight on every turn, I think  you try to find some common ground. </p><p>But when there are basic issues that violate our values, you stand up and  you fight.  And we're giving him, I think, will give him a lot more  hearings for Supreme Court justice than the Republicans gave the President  Obama.  So, it's important for us to remember that as well. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to have you on the program this morning.   We'll be watching.  Thanks so much. </p><p>RYAN:  Thanks, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Tim Ryan, joining us there.  Coming up, we are  waiting remarks from President Trump at the National Breakfast.  The Prayer  Breakfast.  We'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  45 minutes away from the opening bell.  Markets  are looking lower this morning.  We are at the lows of the morning right  now.  And the DOW Industrials average now expecting a decline of about 60  points.  NASDAQ, down in 11.  Couple of names are watching Macy's.  The  stock is looking higher this morning reportedly considering a possible  sale.  The New York Post is reporting that longtime CEO Terry Lundgren is  set to be weighing the move before he steps down later this quarter.   Macy's shares and we're seeing a bit off.  Tesla Motors dropping the  motors.  The name change to Tesla Inc. chose the company's ambition to move  beyond just selling high end electric cars and shifting into energy  products like solar panels and home batteries.  Tesla agreed to acquire  Solar City, remember, for $2.6 billion.  That was back in November. </p><p>Blowout earnings from big technology names like Microsoft, Apple, Facebook.   Amazon is reporting tonight.  And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart  Varney joins me.  Taking a look at tech in the spotlight, Stu.  Good  morning.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY &amp; COMPANY HOST:  I continue my  astonishment at the financial performance of America's big tech companies.   As you point out, Apple, $246 billion in cash, Facebook last night, 1.8  billion monthly users and a ton of money coming over every year.  And  tonight, it's Amazon.  I don't know whether they're going to disappoint or  what.  But I do know that if you look at the numbers, it will be a shock. </p><p>Maria, you and I have covered financial news for a few years.  I have  covered it for decades longer than you have and I have never, ever seen  such a concentration of financial power among the four or five top American  big name technology companies.  Never seen this before.  And remember, they  are now in opposition to President Trump.  Both on ideologic grounds and on  trade grounds, on visa grounds, this is quite a confrontation that's coming  here. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.  Part of the issue, I think, is because  technology is seeped into so many other industries, Stu.  Right?  I mean,  tech has changed transportation, it's changed health care, it's changed  retailing.  So, one of the reasons for power base is that it's not just  traditional tech, it's technology changing so many other industries.</p><p>VARNEY:  That is very true.  I mean, it seeped into the automobile  industry. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That, too.</p><p>VARNEY:  I mean, I don't know what percentage of a car these days comes  from Silicon Valley or is computer oriented.  It's big and it's growing.  I  just -- I don't think I've ever seen that kind of concentration of  financial power.  The money these guys have, the influence that brings, is  really astonishing.  I love it, by the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know President Trump doesn't like monopolies.  So, we'll see  where that goes. </p><p>VARNEY:  Who wants a monopoly?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  See you in about 10 minutes, Stu.  </p><p>VARNEY:  You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" again at the top of the hour  right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart, 9:00 a.m. Eastern this  morning.  </p><p>Coming up, the NFL takes its Super Bowl patrons on the ride of their life.   Our own Cheryl Casone is on the ground in Houston with former NFL Star,  Jack Brewer.  Check it out.  We're going to join them momentarily. back in  a minute.</p><p>Then, they took an interstellar journey that made even jack brewer scream. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Houston, of course home to NASA's Johnson Space  Center so it should come as no surprise that the space travel agency will  play a part in the pre-Super Bowl festivities.  Our own Cheryl Casone and  Former NFL Star Jack Brewer took a ride on NASA's 90-foot virtual reality  simulated trip to mars and back.  And they lived to tell the tale.  Cheryl? </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Maria, good  morning.  Yes, it was a two-minute ride but it was full of thrills.  NASA  does, someday, want go to mars.  They're working with Boeing and race it on  to make it happen.  But as far as the ride itself, Jack, how would you  describe what we went through yesterday for Maria?  </p><p>JACK BREWER, FORMER NFL STAR:  I was freaked out. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREWER:  Whoa. </p><p>CASONE:  We're ready.  Let's do this.  </p><p>BREWER:  Let's do this. </p><p>CASONE:  We're about to go up 90 feet so we can drop 90 feet.  Jack, you  are afraid of heights.  Right?  </p><p>BREWER:  I can't believe you talked me into this. </p><p>CASONE:  We're standing in the middle of the field in NRG Stadium. </p><p>BREWER:  Maria, the only thing missing here is you. </p><p>CASONE:  Oh, boy.  We're above the Earth. </p><p>BREWER:  Oh, my God. </p><p>CASONE:  We're in space, Jack.  We're on the Orion Spacecraft. </p><p>BREWER:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  We're approaching Mars. </p><p>BREWER:  It's kind of beautiful, actually. </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BREWER:  Wow.</p><p>BREWER:  I did not say anything that was not on T.V.  It was amazing.</p><p>CASONE:  That was cool.  That was cool.  Jack, here we go.</p><p>BREWER:  Oh, man. </p><p>CASONE:  That was crazy.  Are you OK? </p><p>BREWER:  Yes.  I was just happy that I -</p><p>CASONE:  I'm a little dizzy.  Look, we just want to mars, Maria. you owe  us. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  What we do for you, Maria.  Right, Jack? </p><p>BREWER:  That is right.  We love you.  </p><p>CASONE:  We love you.  It was a lot of fun.  It was a bit crazy out there  but all the fans can come in and experience that today.  If they're in  Texas, come on down in the Super Bowl live.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You guys have real spunk.  Dagen and I were just talking about  when you went on that roller-coaster ride, Cheryl.  Wow.</p><p>Meanwhile, how about this, guys?  Former President George H.W. Bush and his  wife Barbara are flipping the coin before the 2017 Super Bowl according to  their spokesperson.  Jack, what do you think about that?  Who do you think  the former president is rooting for? </p><p>BREWER:  Well, I mean.  I am sure he's already a fan.  But down deeply in  his heart, he wishes he was watching the Dallas Cowboys.  But you know,  President Bush is a very, very admired person in Texas, you know.  I am a  Texan as well as Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  This is our home state, Maria.  But you know, the thing is,  this is his hometown and there's so much buzz because there's just so many  well wishes from him that are coming from all over just on a local  perspective.  But I can't imagine what that stadium is going to be like  when he comes out to do that coin toss on Sunday.  We are going to be there  so we will let you know. </p><p>BREWER:  No question. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, guys.  Thank you, Cheryl and jack.  We will see you  later, thanks for that.  And remember you can watch Super Bowl only on one  network live on the Fox Network.  This Sunday night, 6:30 pm Eastern.  We  will be watching.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, we will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.  Final thoughts from our  all-star panel when we come right back.  Stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're awaiting comments from President Trump at the National  Prayer Breakfast.  We want to get some final thoughts are we're all  scratching our heads trying to figure out what Congressman Tim Ryan just  said about we started this war.  Twitter's going nuts about it too.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just -- to push back on that, I don't know exactly what he's  talking about as if we asked for 9/11 going down that road, but in terms of  Syria and the refugee crisis, Trump -- President Trump is now trying to  deal with.  The situation in Syria erupted because of the vacuum by  President Obama.  There was a red line that wasn't honored.  And Assad and  Putin, essentially took over.  So, let's blame and put blame where it needs  to lie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's the bottom line.  Thank you Morgan Ortagus, Peter  Kiernan, Dagen McDowell.  It's a pleasure.  We'll see you tomorrow,  everybody.  Here's Stuart. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
