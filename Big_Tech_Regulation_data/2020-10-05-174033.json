Trump said he's committed once again to repealing and replacing Obamacare after the Justice Department reversed course and told a federal court the entire Affordable Care Act should be struck down. The president will tweet and now, Twitter will add its say. A major shift for the social media platform who will start labeling tweets from officials that violate its rules. In another bizarre turn for Jussie Smollett, the files in his case are released before being resealed. The Illinois attorney general has been asked to review the handling of the case as prosecutors abruptly dropped charges that Smollett allegedly plotted a bogus attack on himself. The $768.4 million Powerball has a winner and it's probably not you unless you are a Wisconsin resident who got all winning numbers: 16, 20, 37, 44, 62 and the Powerball number 12. A single ticket sold in the state matched all six numbers to win the third-largest jackpot in U.S. lottery history.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[05:30:34] JESSICA DEAN, CNN ANCHOR: The White House is scrambling to get a health care plan ready.

The files in his case are released before being resealed.</p><p>And somebody won three-quarters of a billion dollars. We'll tell you where.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p>DEAN: Hi, everyone. I'm Jessica Dean.</p><p>BRIGGS: Good morning.</p><p>DEAN: It is 31 minutes past the hour.</p><p>Even Republicans appear bewildered by President Trump's promise to make the GOP the party of health care. Deep divisions over the Affordable Care Act that bogged down the party two years ago remain.</p><p>And according to Axios, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told the president the decision to renew efforts to kill Obamacare made no sense, especially after Democrats routed Republicans in the midterms, in part, over the issue of preexisting conditions. BRIGGS: Right now, the White House has no plan for replacing the Affordable Care Act if a decision by a Texas judge to strike down the law is upheld. But the administration insists there will be a plan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARC SHORT, CHIEF OF STAFF TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: The president will be putting forward plans this year that we hope to introduce into Congress, Wolf. But the reality is that the court decision is likely not until the summer of 2020 by the time it would reach the Supreme Court. We don't know how they would rule.</p><p>The president has said repeatedly he would not sign any law unless it protected preexisting conditions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: President Trump has repeatedly promised protections for preexisting conditions but keeps backing plans that would eliminate them.</p><p>Joining us this morning, Politico reporter Daniel Lippman, co-author of the Politico Playbook, joining us in-studio today. Good to see you, sir.</p><p>DANIEL LIPPMAN, REPORTER, POLITICO, CO-AUTHOR OF POLITICO'S PLAYBOOK: Good to see you.</p><p>BRIGGS: So the president, in this 45-minute rambling conversation with Sean Hannity last night, promised incredible health care that the Democrats, frankly, wouldn't know how to do. That is about as detailed a plan as we've seen from the White House.</p><p>So is there any makings of a plan, and what was congressional reaction, other than Kevin McCarthy we just mentioned there?</p><p>LIPPMAN: There isn't a plan to have and there is lots of internal fighting in the administration because Mick Mulvaney really wanted to push this. He's a conservative hardliner.</p><p>And the attorney general, Bill Barr, and the HHS secretary, Alex Azar -- they were pushing against this proposal to basically get rid of the Affordable Care Act because they know that the last time Republicans tried this it failed multiple times and it handed the Democrats the House.</p><p>And so, this is basically handing a huge gift to the Democratic Party right after that Mueller delivery -- the report of the delivery.</p><p>DEAN: Yes, it's almost stepping on the delivery of that Mueller report.</p><p>And, Daniel, it goes back to the political question here, which is this is proven to be a loser for Republicans. Why is the White House -- I mean, I know -- I know you were kind of explaining the infighting that's going back, but what makes them think it's a winner this time? LIPPMAN: They -- you know, President Trump feels like he's on his front foot and that he wants to take advantage of the positive press that he got in the last few days. And it's almost being overconfident that he thinks well, he can knock everything he wants to accomplish in his presidency.</p><p>But that -- there are still legislative realities, especially -- Democrats control the House and they are not going to let this happen. And they are going to talk about this issue even more.</p><p>This is good news for those 2020 Democratic candidates. It gives them something to rail against.</p><p>And this is funny enough that Democrats now have the upper hand in this health care issue because it dogged them during the Obama presidency because the Tea Party movement was launched because of that. And it just makes it much harder for Trump to actually talk about things that he can accomplish, like infrastructure spending or --</p><p>And then, you're talking about things like gutting the Special Olympics when Betsy DeVos flies on her private jet --</p><p>BRIGGS: Wow.</p><p>LIPPMAN: -- everywhere. That is seen as tone-deaf and that will not go anywhere in Congress.</p><p>BRIGGS: You mention that Special Olympics cut. That was bizarre for a couple of reasons but mainly because the budget from the White House is really just a political document.</p><p>[05:35:02] LIPPMAN: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: It's really messaging. Congress controls the purse strings. So, Betsy DeVos has got to go up there and say well, it's not a federal program. She likes its work.</p><p>But what does that reveal to you? Why would you put that out there when, in fact, those cuts won't go into place? Why do you want that to be your message?</p><p>LIPPMAN: That's a great question. You don't want that to be your message.</p><p>But, Mick Mulvaney is a hardline budget hawk and he doesn't think that the $17 million that the U.S. government helps with the Special Olympics is a priority.</p><p>And, the Education Department is pushing back and they say well, it's not our choice. The White House -- blaming the White House.</p><p>And this Roy Blunt who is very influential on this issue, he's not going to let this through.</p><p>And, she'll -- BRIGGS: No, and Republicans -- it's a non-starter for even Republicans.</p><p>LIPPMAN: To go against --</p><p>BRIGGS: And they sent Betsy DeVos to the Hill to be a sacrificial lamb. It was one of the mind-boggling moves.</p><p>LIPPMAN: And to go against like severely developmentally disabled kids who just want to --</p><p>BRIGGS: One of the few bipartisan issues in D.C.</p><p>LIPPMAN: -- who just want to like play sports. That is not fun.</p><p>BRIGGS: Everybody supports the Special Olympics -- everybody.</p><p>DEAN: So, also, the president talked to Fox News night.</p><p>LIPPMAN: Yes.</p><p>DEAN: I want to listen to a quick clip from that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Our new Attorney General Bill Barr is a -- is a great gentleman and I've heard about him for years. He's a great -- he's a great man. Had he been there initially this all would have not have happened because what's gone on there is a just a disgrace to our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: So, Daniel, in there, he's saying look, if Jeff Sessions hadn't been there -- if he hadn't recused himself we would have control over this the whole time.</p><p>LIPPMAN: Yes.</p><p>DEAN: Is that so much as saying out loud I was going to obstruct this anyway? Is that obstruction -- kind of saying that in a roundabout what?</p><p>LIPPMAN: That's tacitly admitting that he wanted to make sure that this inquiry went nowhere and didn't find anything on the president. And it also raises the question would all of those six Trump aides and people connected to Trump -- would they have gotten dinged because of this or would they have basically had a whitewash?</p><p>And it's unclear, actually, whether Bill Barr would have done Trump's bidding like that. It's very possible -- it's very possible that he would have had a proper investigation, it just wouldn't have ballooned with the special counsel and would have been more contained within the department.</p><p>BRIGGS: Even though the White House, we the media, Congress has not seen the Mueller report, the victory lap continues and it will tonight in Michigan.</p><p>Daniel, good to see you in person, my friend.</p><p>DEAN: Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>LIPPMAN: Thanks for having me.</p><p>DEAN: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right.</p><p>The president will tweet and now, Twitter will add its say. A major shift for the social media platform. Twitter will start labeling tweets from officials that violate its rules.</p><p>Twitter's head of legal policy appeared at a \"Washington Post\"- sponsored event in San Francisco late last night.</p><p>And the social media giant still refusing to remove President Trump's more questionable tweets, saying they are in the public interest. But next time, the president sends an offensive tweet it might be accompanied by a note providing more information.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VIJAYA GADDE, GLOBAL LEAD FOR LEGAL, POLICY, TRUST, AND SAFETY, TWITTER: There are other types of content that we believe have -- are newsworthy or are in the public interest that people may want to have a conversation around. But today, when we leave that content on a platform, there's no context around that and it just lives on Twitter and people can see it, and they just assume that that's the type of content or behavior that's allowed by our rules.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Even though your rules say no bullying.</p><p>GADDE: Exactly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: Twitter will still remove tweets from anyone with violent or threatening content.</p><p>The president regularly uses the platform to attack political enemies, even sharing images of his foes behind bars. The president has also gone after big tech itself, claiming it favors Democrats.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I'm able to get the word out through my social media because I have great social media. But I'll tell you, it's much tougher than it should be. I deal with Twitter. It's not right the way they do it.</p><p>And it seems to be if they're conservative, if they're Republicans, if they're in a certain group there's discrimination -- and big discrimination.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: There are growing concerns the president's Twitter behavior has influenced politicians on the local and state levels, as well as abroad.</p><p>BRIGGS: Breaking overnight, a shooting rampage in Seattle leaving two people dead and others -- two others critically wounded.</p><p>Seattle police describe this as a random, senseless act that unfolded when a gunman tried to carjack a woman. She was shot and is in critical condition. The gunman then set his sights on a crowded bus.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARC GARTH GREEN, DEPUTY POLICE CHIEF, SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT: The suspect then opened fire on the Metro bus, striking the driver. The driver was able to back the bus up and turn it around and get it out of the area where it is currently -- where you see it right now -- to a safe area. We were able to get aid to him and the passengers on the bus.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: Police say the gunman then carjacked a second person, shooting and killing the driver. A high-speed chase with police ensued and the suspect collided with another car, killing that driver as well.</p><p>After a brief standoff, officers took the suspect into custody.</p><p>[05:40:00] BRIGGS: A South Carolina fifth-grader being -- is dead this morning after being injured in a school fight. Paramedics found Raniya Wright unconscious in the nurse's station at Forest Hills Elementary in Walterboro. She was airlifted to a medical center in Charleston where she died two days later.</p><p>A special ed teacher at the school says bullying has been an issue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My child personally had went through it on two different occasions to one point where she had to switch schools. Being an educator, I think our students should be put first in all situations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: The student has been suspended while an investigation is underway. It's unclear whether that student was involved in the fight.</p><p>DEAN: Someone in Wisconsin has a lot of extra cheddar this morning. The one jackpot-winning ticket in Wednesday's $768 million Powerball drawing was sold in Wisconsin. The jackpot is the third-largest in U.S. lottery history.</p><p>And the winning numbers, just in case you're in Wisconsin and watching -- 16, 20, 37, 44, 62 and the Powerball number is 12.</p><p>And for everyone who missed Powerball, there is a Mega Millions tomorrow night. That jackpot just $75 million.</p><p>BRIGGS: You can't help but wonder if it's like the previous massive billion-dollar --</p><p>DEAN: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: -- if that prize winner will remain anonymous for a long time.</p><p>DEAN: Oh, yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: Get their --</p><p>DEAN: I would want to remain anonymous.</p><p>BRIGGS: For as long as you can.</p><p>DEAN: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: You have a year to claim it.</p><p>Ahead, two college students and their parents now suing. They say top colleges passed on them to accept bribes from others.</p><p>[05:45:42] BRIGGS: The case of \"EMPIRE\" actor Jussie Smollett going from surprising to flat-out bizarre. The Illinois attorney general has been asked to review the handling of the case as prosecutors, this week, abruptly dropped charges that Smollett allegedly plotted a bogus attack on himself.</p><p>DEAN: He was let off despite video evidence showing his attackers buying materials that Smollett gave them cash for.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Chicago Police Department released a portion of Smollett's investigation reports before being advised a court order actually prohibited that release.</p><p>BRIGGS: Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx claims the clerks made a mistake sealing the case but that does not square with what CNN witnessed in court Tuesday where the prosecutor did not object when Smollett's lawyers asked for the record to be sealed.</p><p>DEAN: Foxx had recused herself in the case. She defends her office's decision to drop the charges.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIM FOXX, COOK COUNTY STATE'S ATTORNEY, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS: The likelihood that someone would get a prison sentence for a class-four felony is slim. I don't want people to believe that there are two measures of justice for the privileged and those without. And once the rhetoric and the emotions stop, we will stand by our record.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has called the decision a \"whitewash of justice.\"</p><p>Embattled plane maker Boeing making its most direct attempt to fix a safety issue that investigators believe led to two recent crashes that killed 346 people.</p><p>Regulators and some 200 pilots gathered at its plant in Washington State as it unveiled an overhaul to its safety software and trained pilots through scenarios on a flight simulator.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, the FAA's acting chief fiercely defended the federal government's approach, delegating broad oversight and safety certification of those 737 MAX planes to Boeing, itself. He also told lawmakers early data was not enough to warrant grounding the planes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANIEL ELWELL, ACTING ADMINISTRATION, FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION: I can't speak to the reasoning that the other nations took. I know that in communication with those countries, they -- and our request what data might they have -- they did not have any data for us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: Southwest, the largest domestic carrier in the U.S., says it has cut 9,400 flights in the past six weeks and more cancelations are expected.</p><p>BRIGGS: It's time to get a check on business at 5:47 Eastern time.</p><p>Global markets are mixed as U.S.-China trade talks continue. Asian markets closed lower. European markets are higher at the beginning of trading there.</p><p>On Wall Street, futures are higher. Markets finished lower Wednesday. The Dow closed down 32 points, recovering from an earlier slide of 232 points. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both closed lower as well.</p><p>An important number for investors and the president. GDP will be released in a couple of hours and economists expect fourth-quarter GDP to be revised down as low as 1.8 percent -- well below the president's goal of three percent.</p><p>We are less than one month away from this year's biggest film, \"Avengers: Endgame\" -- and fans, you might be sitting awhile watching the team take on Thanos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCARLETT JOHANSSON, ACTRESS, AVENGERS: END GAME: We owe this to everyone who's not in this room to try.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: An online ticketing site at AMC Theaters reported \"Endgame\" ran 182 minutes or just over three hours before deleting that information. If it's anywhere close to that, it would be the longest film Marvel Studios has ever produced.</p><p>The previous Avengers sequel \"Infinity War\" ran roughly 2 1/2 hours. Disney is not confirming the length of the movie.</p><p>\"Endgame\" premieres April 26th and I cannot wait.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>[05:54:00] DEAN: More fallout from the college admissions scandal. Two students and their parents filing a class-action complaint because they did not get accepted into the schools of their choice.</p><p>The lawsuit targets the alleged mastermind of the scheme, Rick Singer, and several universities including USC, Stanford, Yale, and Georgetown.</p><p>BRIGGS: The complaint alleges, \"Unqualified students found their way into the admissions rolls of highly selective universities, while those students who played by the rules and did not have college- bribing parents were denied admission.\"</p><p>It goes on to say had the families known the system was rigged they would not have spent the money to apply.</p><p>An $80 million award for a California man who says Roundup gave him cancer. A federal jury found the popular Monsanto weed killer was a substantial factor causing Edwin Hardeman's Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Hardeman claimed Roundup's design was defective and Monsanto was negligent to not warn him of the product's risk.</p><p>BayerMonsanto's parent company says it will appeal.</p><p>[05:55:01] Hardeman's is the first lawsuit against Monsanto to reach trial in federal court. About 11,000 similar cases, though, are still pending.</p><p>DEAN: The Charlottesville car attacker avoids the death penalty by changing his plea to guilty on hate crime charges. James Fields drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p><p>Fields was convicted of 29 federal hate crimes for that 2017 attack. It resulted in the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer.</p><p>Fields will be sentenced in July.</p><p>BRIGGS: Police in Florida have identified the student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who apparently took his own life last weekend. Sixteen-year-old Calvin Desir was a sophomore.</p><p>He is the second teenager who attended Stoneman Douglas during the Parkland shooting to die by suicide recently. The other, Sydney Aiello, was 19. She graduated last year.</p><p>Their deaths have put a renewed focus on post-traumatic stress and the lasting effects of mass shootings.</p><p>If you or someone you know might be at risk of suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline -- 1-800-273-8255.</p><p>DEAN: For the first time in more than two decades, the FDA is proposing new guidelines to modernize breast cancer screenings. All women in the U.S. getting mammograms would receive information about breast density. Dense tissue can obscure signs of breast cancer.</p><p>The FDA has also proposed expanding the categories used to classify mammography findings. Now, this should help screening facilities to more precisely classify those findings. It will also help patients and care providers make more informed decisions after receiving mammogram results.</p><p>BRIGGS: McDonald's will no longer pay lobbyists to fight minimum wage hikes. In a letter to the National Restaurant Association, the company says it believes pay increases should be phased in.</p><p>The average starting salary for employees at corporate-owned stores is above $10.00 an hour. Workers are hard to find for low-paying jobs in a labor market with an unemployment rate below four percent.</p><p>McDonald's has been a target for groups fighting to raise the minimum wage nationwide.</p><p>DEAN: Caught on video, a criminal suspect sucker-punches a Florida public defender at a bond hearing. Lawyer Julie Chase was appearing on behalf of another Broward County inmate. A defendant waiting for his own hearing, as you see, got up, walked up behind Chase, and punched her in the head.</p><p>BRIGGS: Oh.</p><p>DEAN: That defendant, 27-year-old William Green, had been arrested Tuesday, charged with attacking a hospital technician.</p><p>The public defender's office says it was a poor judgment call for Green not to be under closer supervision.</p><p>Chase is now at home.</p><p>BRIGGS: A California woman has been awarded $150,000 in child support nearly 50 years after her divorce.</p><p>Toni Anderson married Don Lenhart in 1966. They split two years later. A judge ordered him to pay child support for their then-3- year-old daughter, but he never did. The 74-year-old Anderson says last year she had a life-changing realization. There is no statute of limitations for child support in California. So she Googled her ex-husband and found him living in Oregon with a big house and a boat.</p><p>Anderson filed a motion for the unpaid child support and a judge granted her request.</p><p>DEAN: It's a stunningly beautiful home in the South of France and a court says it's got to be destroyed. The owner custom-built the chateau worth $64 million, transforming it into a Tuscan-style property with a pool, gardens, and two helipads.</p><p>The court says it was built without permission, though, on a protected site so it must be demolished in the next 18 months. The owner was also cited for having loud parties and events. He now has until March 30th to appeal the court's decision.</p><p>BRIGGS: Destroy the home but, please, save the ostrich.</p><p>DEAN: I knew you wanted to save the ostrich.</p><p>BRIGGS: The giant stuffed ostrich must be saved.</p><p>DEAN: Well thank you --</p><p>BRIGGS: We'll start a Twitter hashtag.</p><p>DEAN: Thanks so much for joining us, everyone.

That's the fear of some in the tech industry in the wake of new European Union regulations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To comply with the EU's updated Copyright Directive, tech platforms like Google and Facebook may have to install \"upload filters\" to find and remove copyrighted content -- which critics fear may result in unintended censorship.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Article 13 of the European Union's updated Copyright Directive requires tech platforms to regularly scan for copyright infringement and remove material that violates copyright.</p><p>Some tech platforms already do this -- haven't you ever tried to watch a movie clip on YouTube only to find it removed for violating copyright laws? -- but some open internet advocates fear the vague language of Article 13 will crush websites with the high cost of scanning for copyright while removing perfectly legitimate content along with the bad.</p><p>The EU's directive requires \"best efforts\" from tech platforms to crack down on copyright infringement so as to protect creators, and also \"obtain authorization\" from the creators if they do share the content on their sites.</p><p>Copyrighted material that tech platforms do not have authorized access to must be removed, and tech platforms are liable for any content on their sites that infringe copyright.</p><p>Critics fear this means memes and GIFs will be \"filtered\" out by tech platforms due to copyright infringement, but that's not the language of the directive: the directive requires platforms to adopt something more like YouTube's Content ID filter.</p><p>It reads: \"An online content sharing service provider shall obtain an authorization from the rightholders referred to in Article 3(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29/EC in order to communicate or make available to the public works or other subject matter. Where no such authorization has been obtained, the service provider shall prevent the availability on its service of those works and other subject matter. Member States shall provide that when an authorization has been obtained, including via a licensing agreement, by an online content sharing service provider, this authorization shall also cover acts of uploading by the users of the service falling within Article 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC when they are not acting on a commercial basis.\"</p><p>Previous EU laws already exempt \"parodies\" and memes from copyright laws.</p><p>\"Google is right to be worried because its business units are the directive's prime targets,\" said Richard Bennett, a visiting fellow at AEI, in an email to InsideSources. \"Article 13 targets YouTube because it to pay fair royalties to artists. Its payout -- $0.0006 per play -- are about 10 percent of payouts of platforms such as Apple Music, Spotify, and Pandora. YouTube has guaranteed traffic because Google Search prioritizes it. Artists have to compete against unlawful uploads of their own work if they refuse to play alone, so the only remedy they have is a change to the way copyright is enforced.\"</p><p>There are still many problems with filters like YouTube's -- like the fact that the Content ID filter is automated and can't always distinguish between public domain works and true copyright infringement.</p><p>Furthermore, what may count as \"copyright infringement\" may be a non-issue for some creators.</p><p>Consider the gaming industry: many video gamers stream \"playthroughs\" on YouTube (via Let's Play), which document gameplay from the point of view of the gamer, including the gamer's commentary on the gameplay, allowing interested parties to learn more about the game.</p><p>Just last week, YouTube took down several playthroughs of the new game Marvel's Spider-Man for copyright infringement, despite the studio that made the game -- Insomniac Games -- telling disgruntled gamers on Twitter that, \"We don't have anything to do with those claims, but are trying to figure out what is going on.\"</p><p>YouTube has already reassured gamers that the take down was due to an \"invalid reference file\" and that the videos would be restored.</p><p>Other examples of YouTube rectifying its Content ID mistakes over the past few years shows that the technology is still a work in progress, but because it remains so flawed, some fear the EU's directive cause rampant censorship that will be difficult to undo.</p><p>As the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) claims, sophisticated filters that account for the nuance of different kinds of internet content -- like game playthroughs -- do not yet exist, so requiring tech companies to adopt filters like YouTube's Content ID is more likely to wreak havoc than not.</p><p>Then there's the cost: YouTube's Content ID filter costs $60 million to maintain, according to Motherboard. While the big tech companies may more easily absorb the costs of these kinds of filters, not all websites dispersing content -- like blogs and other non-social media sharing platforms like Wikipedia or DeviantArt -- may be able to afford routine surveillance for copyright infringement.</p><p>At the same time, the directive gives creators an opportunity to reclaim some of the revenue stolen by big tech platforms in the internet age. Implementation may be bumpy as technology races to catch up with policy.</p><p>\"This is giving creators a choice,\"Roslyn Layton, a visiting scholar focusing on telecommunications and the internet at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), told InsideSources. \"[The big tech companies] always stamp on the little guy ... and have not enabled the business models to grow for the benefit of IP.

On the Sidelines of the event Dr. R. Seetharaman CEO of Doha Bank said,\" The discussions at this event may cover inclusive growth, gender equality &amp; sustainable development to be focused at this event amidst global slowdown.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to IMF head, Kristalina Georgieva, The world economy is experiencing a \"synchronized slowdown\" and in some of the largest emerging market economies, such as India and Brazil, the slowdown is even more pronounced this year. There is a serious risk that services and consumption could soon be affected as global trade growth has come to a near standstill. On the economic side discussions on economic policy in turbulent times, global trade and development and the current situation of global value chains (GVCs).</p><p>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>Escalating trade tensions are taking a toll on the global economy and have spread into sensitive areas like technology and currencies. Many central banks have appropriately lowered interest rates, but there are limits with this strategy. No-one can doubt that we are once more living through a period of turmoil. But there has been no comparable questioning of the basic ideas determining economic policy. The failure to re-examine those ideas risks another financial crisis. Global value chains powered an economic revolution over the past three decades: growth accelerated, incomes rose, and poverty rates plunged. Today, almost 50% of global trade involves GVCs, but rising trade tensions and uncertainties over market access threaten their future. On Sustainable development, concerns continue to mount over the impact of climate change and central banks are taking action in a range of areas within their mandates. Discussions are going to happen as to how Central Banks can support fight against climate change. In relation to Sustainable development goals, discussions will evolve on how to get the goals to reality by 2030 and whether the needed financing is in place. It is also expected to cover catalyzing environmental, Social and Governance investment. The world is suffering a historic loss of biodiversity, threatening nature's ability to supply nutritious food, clean air and water, sustain livelihoods, regulate climate and to act as a buffer against extreme weather. Discussions are expected to happen on how to plan to shape the new global biodiversity framework.</p><p>The role of Gender equality has drawn attention in recent years. There is a going to discussion on \"Women, Work, and Leadership \"with IMF head, Kristalina Georgieva. It will focus on the macro-criticality of gender equality, including the need to increase the presence of women at the highest levels of decision-making, and how to address barriers to women's career growth, such as unpaid work and how it influences women's decisions to enter the labor market. Discussions are also going to be held on Unleashing the Potential of Women Entrepreneurs through Finance and Markets and Promoting Women's Financial Inclusion through capacity development.</p><p>On Technology discussions are the role of fintech in inclusive growth of economies. Fintech innovators are transforming financial services around the world. While the world has made progress toward universal inclusion, 3 billion people are still left out or are poorly served by the formal system. Fintech promises to play a central role in addressing this gap. Technology enables innovators and incumbent financial service providers to expand access to services, while improving quality. Rich data offers new ways of evaluating loan eligibility or estimating risk. Advances in technology and connectivity are spurring a new wave of business models. Big Tech are entering Fintech. They bring technology, deep pockets, massive networks, mountains of data, and great user experiences. The opportunities and the risks that are emerging as the financial sector is reshaped, and how regulatory strategies can be adopted to foster sound, inclusive financial innovation and expand the reach of financial services.</p><p>Source: Doha Bank</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IFINNW-0049935873</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IFINNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8P-WX51-JB5M-W38W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365424</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"694\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Islamic Finance News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Islamic Finance News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 15, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Senior staffers are threatening to quit and letting it all hang out in the digital public square.<br/> \"I don't know what to do, but I know doing nothing is not acceptable\", wrote Stirman, who works on research at Facebook, formerly at Twitter.<br/> The backlash against big tech's ideological blind spot comes less than a week after Trump signed an executive order escalating his war with social media companies over how they monitor content. During the same time span, America's main streets are witnessing tense standoffs and violence after the brutal killing on MayA25 of George Floyd, 46, an African American in Minneapolis.<br/> Floyd was forced down onto a sidewalk and a police officer dug his knee into Floyd's neck until he stopped breathing. Floyd was handcuffed at the time of his death. A deli employee had called the police accusing Floyd of buying cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill.<br/> All of this is happening against the grim backdrop of more than 105,000 coronavirus deaths in the US.<br/> \"I'm a FB employee that completely disagrees with Mark's decision to do nothing about Trump's recent posts, which clearly incite violence. I'm not alone inside of FB. There isn't a neutral position on racism\", Stirman tweeted.<br/> \"As allies we must stand in the way of danger, not behind. I will be participating in today's virtual walkout in solidarity with the black community inside and outside FB\", tweeted Sara Zhang, a Facebook staffer.<br/> Zhang wrote that Facebook's decision \"ignores other options to keep our community safe.\"<br/> \"The policy pigeon holes us into addressing harmful user-facing content in two ways: keep content up or take it down.<br/> \"I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we're showing up. The majority of coworkers I've spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard,\" tweeted Jason Toff, a Facebook employee with a verified Twitter handle.<br/> \"I'm also joining today's walkout. Facebook needs to Be Bold and #TakeAction. Black lives matter.\" tweeted Ricky, who works on React Native at Facebook.<br/> Trump's recent executive order coupled with social unrest has reignited the debate about how online platforms are able to publish almost anything, serve as a conduit for a garden variety of content and remain untouched by regulation.<br/> Experts working at the intersection of technology and communication are calling for Congress to revisit Section 230 of the 1996 Communication Decency Act which rewrote telecommunications law and created the playing field that allows companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google to thrive.<br/> Section 230 states that \"no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.a<br/> Twitter flagged Trump's tweet about the protests where he said \"when the looting starts the shooting starts.\" Facebook has let that post stay and Zuckerberg explained his reasoning in a Facebook post last week.<br/> \"I know many people are upset that we've left the President's posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,\" Zuckerberg wrote.<br/> \"Heated debates around content policy will persist for a very long time given our political circumstances, explains Dipayan Ghosh, co-director of the Platform Accountability Project at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School,Ain a CNBC op-ed. His argument is that while such content debates keep flaring up, \"we will be less focused on the more fundamental problem of economic regulation.\"<br/> (Nikhila Natarajan is on Twitter @byniknat)<br/> --IANS<br/> nn/rt <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IANSEN-A-377268</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IANSEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:601W-XN71-DYDW-70TD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410748</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"707\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IANS-English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 2, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

However, it casts a light on a threatening antitrust problem: the privatization and manipulation of the public square by technology companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">China\u2019s Great Firewall blocks Facebook, Twitter and similar U.S. services, and China severely limits the operations of foreign tech giants like Google. This permits ByteDance, Tencent and others to develop social media platforms like TikTok and WeChat and other Internet businesses in a large protected domestic market and still compete in the United States and elsewhere.</p><p>WeChat is how the Chinese diaspora communicates with friends and business associates in China. Western companies like Starbucks and Walmart market and obtain payments on WeChat, stealing sales from U.S. tech companies had they been allowed access in China.</p><p> Instead of complaining about U.S. efforts to stifle Chinese high tech, President Xi Jinping should be thankful its innovators benefited from a hothouse market for so long to develop internet businesses like Alipay and Alibaba.</p><p> The antitrust focus on Big Tech has centered on the data that giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google gather about individual habits to sell ads and market ideas. And the leverage that limiting access to their platforms potentially affords them over present and potential rivals.</p><p>Amazon, for example uses what it learns from the activities of businesses selling on Prime to develop competing products. It has entered mundane businesses like disposable diapers, been accused of predatory pricing to drive out competitors and muscling collaboration with smaller businesses and startups to obtain critical competitive information.</p><p> We need to be careful. While Amazon had its beginnings in the direct sale of books printed by big publishing houses, it has created a remarkable self- publishing platform through Kindle that permits authors to bypass the cultural screening of those publishers.</p><p> App developers can effectively market to iPhone users only through its app store. Apple skims an eye-popping 30% of initial sales for essentially enabling downloads but it controls only 13% of the global smartphone market. Apple and Google\u2019s Android create preferences for their own or third-party products over others.</p><p> These practices may need regulation to avoid stifling competition and innovation, but we should act with care. Without these companies, we would still be thumbing flip phones and Blackberries. Without Amazon, the development of Cloud services would have been left to slower moving legacy techs like Microsoft and IBM.</p><p> The Trump administration\u2019s principal concern with TikTok is the vast amount of data it possesses about American users that the Chinese government could exploit, but its primary servers are in Virginia with backups in Singapore. ByteDance swears it would never share user data with Beijing, and staunch U.S. ally Australia has found no security problem.</p><p> However, updates and algorithms that determine what users see or is censored are developed in China. And anonymized information is plenty good enough for Beijing to manipulate what U.S. users view about its repression of Muslims, crackdown on Hong Kong or an American presidential election.</p><p> Our tech companies and other businesses are under intense pressure from the organized left  directly through boycotts like those afflicting Facebook and the Washington NFL franchise  and indirectly from investment banks and major corporations that now set themselves up as arbiters of acceptable free speech and political correctness  to screen, limit and censor what we see, the language we use and generally how we do business.</p><p> The Chinese government has long done the same thing through WeChat. Communications between American users and China and the rest of the world are filtered, and Beijing pushes its propaganda on the app.</p><p> Big Tech is broadly accused of an anti-conservative bias. In an era where individuals and organizations express their ideas, discontent and praise on-line, free speech and access to all sides of an issue are threatened on platforms like Twitter and Facebook.</p><p> The U.S. Constitution protects freedom of speech from governments, not private censorship but those platforms and others have become the public square equivalent of an essential facility in antitrust law  when a monopolist controls choke points in commerce, like a rail crossing, it is often compelled to share access on fair terms.</p><p> Just as the United States should fence out TikTok, WeChat and others to protect Americans from Chinese censorship and subversion, the Justice Department, FTC and European antitrust authorities should be coming down on Big Tech for using their monopoly power to abridge freedom of speech.</p><p> \u2022 Peter Morici, @pmorici1, is an economist and emeritus business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-17CF8B88DC4E4EB0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABCF8D7D72DC 2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MR-Y0W1-DXVP-V180-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"821\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>20 August 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But that's certainly not what's happening with the DOJ review of T-Mobile's $26 billion merger with Sprint, which antitrust experts (and even the DOJ's own economists) have repeatedly warned[1] will indisputably reduce competition, raise rates, and result in thousands of layoffs as duplicative positions are eliminated. As state AGs continue their lawsuit to stop the merger, details were revealed last week in court showing that Delrahim did everything in his power to help shovel the deal through the merger approval process, including providing T-Mobile tips[2] (via both personal and business accounts) on which officials they should focus their lobbying attention on in order to get the deal across the finish line:\"As the $26 billion blockbuster merger between T-Mobile and Sprint teetered this summer, Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, labored to rescue it behind the scenes, according to text messages revealed this week in a lawsuit to block the deal. Mr. Delrahim connected company executives with the F.C.C. and members of Congress. </p><p>And he gave executives insight into the thinking of Ajit Pai, the chairman of the F.C.C. who would also have to approve the merger. He is 'open and willing' to discussions about the deal, Mr. Delrahim said in one text message in June, a month before regulators blessed the transaction.\"Delrahim's job is to look at the evidence and protect markets where necessary, not help companies push deals that erode competition, harm workers, and hurt markets. Keep in mind, past deals just like this one (AT...-Mobile 2011, T-Mobile/Sprint 2014) were blocked because the harm was so obvious there was simply no way to justify it. This latest merger is no different, yet government officials have stopped even pretending to care. They're intent on shoveling this turd of a deal across the finish line at all costs at the behest of T-Mobile, Sprint, and Japan's Softbank. The FCC rubber stamped the merger before Commissioners had even seen their own staff's full economic analysis[3]. FCC staffers privately met with T-Mobile numerous times[4] to massage their underlying and fragile arguments. Former FCC officials (Clyburn, McDowell) have happily lobbied on T-Mobile's behalf, and T-Mobile executives ramped up patronage of Trump's DC hotels[5] to curry favor with the administration. That's all capped off by Delrahim all but putting out runway lights for T-Mobile in a bid to shine up a deal that, again, is going to be indisputably bad for consumers and the market. Former FCC staffers like Gigi Sohn were not what you'd call impressed: When I was at the @FCC[6], we were told point blank that we could never tell a stakeholder to lobby a member of Congress for ANYTHING. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/LJeRAte84s\">https://t.co/LJeRAte84s</url>[7] \u2014 Gigi Sohn (@gigibsohn) December 20, 2019[8]To justify its mindless rubber stamp of the deal, the DOJ has pushed forth a shaky plan[9] that involves giving Dish Network some spectrum (and prepaid brand Boost Mobile), then just hoping the company can build a replacement fourth wireless carrier over the next 7 years. But with T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT...ll heavily incentivized to make sure a strong fourth competitor never emerges, Dish having a reputation for empty promises[10] and bluster, and regulators largely captured by industry players (who again, want less competition to boost revenues) few serious analysts actually think the plan's going to work. This is, of course, the same DOJ that folks seriously hope will come in and \"fix big tech\" via an ocean of new antitrust inquiries. But it's pretty damn clear this DOJ doesn't actually give a damn about those responsibilities, and has been largely captured by the telecom industry under former Verizon lawyer Bill Barr. And while US corruption is nothing new, we seem to be entering a new era where we can't even bothered with the faintest pretense to the contrary.Permalink[11] | Comments[12] | Email This Story[13] [

Asked after a Media Institute event if there could be other conflicts, he said, \"There could be perhaps, but we'll see. I'll let you all know.\" The division is sorting through tech companies to see if there are any \"appearance\" issues, he said.</p><p>Delrahim's prepared remarks defended DOJ's approval of T-Mobile/Sprint (see 2001270034). The division is awaiting a U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruling on several states' lawsuit challenging the deal. If SDNY sides with the states, it creates the risk that a small subset of states, or perhaps even just one, could undermine future beneficial transactions approved by two expert federal agencies, said the antitrust chief. His remarks were posted after the event.</p><p>\"If you find this situation odd, you're not alone,\" Delrahim said. \"Courts should not award any private party, including the states, relief that is incompatible with relief secured by the federal government,\" which has been settled by Supreme Court precedent. He noted it isn't DOJ's position that states lack standing to sue for antitrust violations or seek relief different from relief pursued by the federal government.</p><p>Delrahim was asked if he expects the division to reach the same conclusion for the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees (see 1911050064) that it did for Paramount's (see 1911220068). He noted other obscure consent decrees DOJ has terminated, saying the Paramount one resulted in regulations for a particular industry never granted by Congress. The pact regulated how some movie studios distributed films to theaters.</p><p>\"I didn't think it was appropriate for us to do that, and frankly, it probably has prohibited a lot of innovative consumer products,\" Delrahim said of Paramount. \"A 75-year-old consent decree shouldn't prevent the free market and the consumer from benefiting.\" The underlying basis for the Paramount consent decree was a price-fixing and market division conspiracy that no longer applies, he said.</p><p>Though Delrahim cited some relevance between ASCAP and Paramount, he emphasized they affect two totally different industries. \"I would not read into that at all between those two reviews,\" he said. Consent decrees concerning the horseshoe industry and music roles for player pianos were terminated, he noted. \"There's a lot of great consent decrees that we've had that we are addressing each day.\"</p><p>FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips was asked at a Technology Policy Institute event Wednesday about Delrahim's contention it would be a mistake not to consider privacy implications in antitrust reviews. If Google tried to buy DuckDuckGo, a search engine company that makes a point of competing on privacy, that would require a close look from the FTC, Phillips said. But privacy isn't a traditional antitrust element like price because it's so subjective, he said. Some people like targeted ads while others find them creepy, the GOP commissioner added.</p><p>Phillips was asked if he's concerned about Facebook buying and growing nascent social media companies. The FTC is always interested in any firms that can be characterized as dominant in any given market using mergers and acquisitions in a way that's anticompetitive, Phillips said. Every fact of every case differs, though, he added, saying it won't prejudge any transaction. Sometimes complaints arise from companies being out-competed, he said: If the FTC brings a case, it's always based in part on input from competitors in the marketplace.</p><p>Phillips said his issue with calls to break up big tech companies is that the complaints aren't always tethered to a market problem intervention is aimed to fix. A problem must be identified first, he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y5Y-XG91-DYRJ-035D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"639\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 06, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The legislation would alter the controversial Section 230 so that tech companies would be accountable when they 'unlawfully censor speech and when they knowingly facilitate criminal activity online.''For too long Section 230 has provided a shield for online platforms to operate with impunity,' Attorney General William Barr said in a statement[2]. 'Ensuring that the internet is a safe, but also vibrant, open and competitive environment is vitally important to America.\" Politicians have been poking at Section 230[3] for months. The DoJ doesn't typically weigh in on legislation, but now, Barr is asking Congress to roll back critical aspects of Section 230. Not only is that unusual, it could add to speculation that some politicians are attempting to 'bully tech companies into political submission,' as Senator Brian Schatz previously put it[4].Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have been looking for ways to alter Section 230 and better regulate Big Tech in general. </p><p>But President Trump also seems to have a personal vendetta against social media platforms. In addition to accusing Facebook and Twitter[5] of having an anti-conservative bias, Trump criticized Twitter[6] after it flagged and hid one of his tweets[7] 'for making misleading health claims that could potentially dissuade people from participation in voting.' Earlier this year, shortly after Twitter hid another Trump tweet[8] for glorifying violence, the President signed an executive order targeting social media[9] platforms.It's unclear what the future holds for Section 230, but with a push from Barr and the DoJ, reform could arrive sooner rather than later.

Here\u2019s the full story \u00a0from the DD team.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon </emphasis>killed brick and mortar.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steven Mnuchin</emphasis> thinks so anyway. The US Treasury secretary said on Wednesday that Amazon had destroyed the retail industry in the US and stifled competition.\u00a0</p><p>What prompted this? The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Department of Justice</emphasis> has announced a widespread investigation into Big Tech companies. The agency said it would investigate how platforms had achieved and wielded their market power.\u00a0</p><p>About time, right? American technology giants have been taking some serious hits on the other side of the Atlantic from\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU</emphasis>\u00a0competition commissioner <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Margrethe Vestager</emphasis>.</p><p>Last month, the US <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Federal Trade Commission</emphasis> and the DoJ agreed to carve up responsibility for investigating individual tech companies (even regulators think they\u2019re too big to deal with!). The DoJ took <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis> and the FTC landed <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis>.\u00a0</p><p>The DoJ said it would look into \u201cwidespread concerns\u201d expressed about \u201csearch, social media and some retail services online\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>It will\u00a0please White House resident <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Donald Trump</emphasis>. He has criticised Vestager\u2019s crackdown on Silicon Valley, saying she \u201chates the US\u201d. Trump said lawsuits against the likes of Google and Facebook should be brought by America itself.</p><p>Under Vestager, the EU has taken the lead on investigating and coming down hard on Big Tech groups. Google has been fined more than \u20ac8bn collectively in three separate antitrust cases and Brussels has just launched a formal investigation into how Amazon uses data from other merchants selling goods on its websites. DD notes that these fines are a drop in the ocean for such companies.\u00a0</p><p>There are major concerns, on both sides of the Atlantic, about companies that effectively wear two hats:\u00a0acting as platform providers while delivering their own competing service. How can they be trusted not to prioritise their own products at the expense of smaller operators?</p><p>The Big Tech backlash gained momentum last April with the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cambridge Analytica</emphasis> scandal at Facebook, which has just received a $5bn fine from the FTC.\u00a0</p><p>Large technology groups have now found themselves at the centre of a big debate on privacy, competitiveness, and innovation. And some, like US Senator Elizabeth Warren, are calling for more drastic measures. The Democratic presidential hopeful\u00a0has proposed breaking up badly behaved Big Tech companies.\u00a0</p><p>The net around America\u2019s tech titans may be closing in.\u00a0Get more information here, by the FT\u2019s Richard Waters.</p><p>European banks can\u2019t catch a break</p><p>2018 was the year when the hits just kept coming for European banks.

There was a 59 per cent jump\u00a0in advisory revenue at UBS after a few big deals, but profits fell 23 per cent at its investment bank.</p><p>Trading revenue fell at both banks \u2014 echoing Wall Street\u2019s tepid quarter \u2014 and they warned there\u2019s more pain to come with looming European rate cuts, more regulations and an enduring lack of volatility.</p><p>Over the past year the Swiss lender\u2019s shares have fallen 27 per cent while Deutsche\u2019s are down a third.

The House Judiciary committee also announced it will open a bipartisan investigation into whether Big Tech suppresses competition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The open internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment, and new pathways for education online,\" Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \"But there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications.\"</p><p>The FTC investigated Google for antitrust violations in 2013 and, despite releasing a 160-page report finding that Google uses anti-competitive tactics that harm consumers and the internet ecosystem, did not take action against the company.</p><p>2020 presidential contender Elizabeth Warren and President Donald Trump both spoke out against Apple, Google and other Big Tech companies over the past year, with Warren calling for breaking up Big Tech and Trump threatening antitrust investigations.</p><p>But Big Tech lobbying groups and some economists insist that companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook don't violate antitrust law based on the current understanding of consumer welfare.</p><p>(Under the current understanding of consumer welfare, economists assume that if monetary prices for goods and services are falling, then that can only be a good thing -- even if falling prices are accompanied by market consolidation and fewer choices for consumers. Some economists also say consumers pay for Big Tech services with their personal data, which has led to privacy violations and the current debate over writing a federal privacy law.)</p><p>\"The Justice Department's investigation of Google will come to the same conclusion as the FTC's did in 2013 -- that there is no antitrust case,\" said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel for Big Tech lobbying group NetChoice, of which Google and Facebook are members. \"It's illogical that the DOJ is investigating competitors in the same market for monopoly behavior. Amazon, Apple and Google all compete with each other in a vibrant and competitive marketplace,\" he said in a statement to InsideSources.</p><p>On Apple's website, the company recently set up a page listing ways its App Store encourages competition among app developers and benefits consumers.</p><p>\"We believe competition makes everything better and results in the best apps for our customers,\" Apple said, almost as if speaking directly to federal lawmakers and regulators. \"We also care about quality over quantity, and trust over transactions. That's why, even though other stores have more users and more app downloads, the App Store earns more money for developers. Our users trust Apple -- and that trust is critical to how we operate a fair, competitive store for developer app distribution.\"</p><p>Aram Sinnreich, chair of communication studies at American University, said an antitrust investigation could jolt Big Tech into self-regulating and halting anticompetitive practices.</p><p>\"Antitrust scrutiny on its own if nothing else is a good red flag to encourage companies to act more competitively and divest themselves of businesses that might invite regulatory action,\" Sinnreich told InsideSources. \"I think antitrust by the FTC is a good idea, that doesn't necessarily mean the government will decide to break the company up.\"</p><p>Despite Apple's protests to the contrary, Sinnreich believes Apple does behave anticompetitively in its App Store because its business model encourages it -- Apple works hard to dissuade any Apple customer from switching brands.</p><p>\"I can't get a new brand phone unless I find a place to store all the 15,000 photos I've taken over the years [with an iPhone],\" Sinnreich said. \"Their role in streaming distribution, combine that with their role in facial recognition and biometrics, it begins to get really problematic.\"</p><p>Apple's not alone in the scrutiny: tech experts and economists say the same about Amazon and Google.</p><p>\"[Big Tech companies] do behave anticompetitively and are not concerned with maintaining a robust landscape of software providers,\" Sinnreich said. \"They use that landscape for free market research and then they adopt whatever is popular and undercut the market for the third parties that developed the technology in the first place.\"</p><p>But not everyone agrees Big Tech should be broken up, even those who criticize Big Tech's role in the marketplace. At a tech event hosted by the Hoover Institution in May, experts on both the right and the left discussed how we may not have a proper regulatory framework to deal with Big Tech because the internet evolved so rapidly.</p><p>\"The ideal outcome would be for antitrust law to develop a more nuanced understanding of this new object we call tech platform and to develop a non-biased rationally based across the board approach to regulating platforms in a way that recognizes the synergy between hardware, software, advertising, and biometrics and then to apply that standard forcefully to every company that occupies the space in a way that prevents them from using vertical and horizontally integrated monopolies in a way that harms civil liberties and competitive markets,\" Sinnreich said. \"It would be jumping the gun to say the ideal outcome is google gets broken up. It's important we have a sensible policy that is enforced and forward-thinking.\"</p><p>Google told InsideSources that the company does not have a comment for this story.</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

This is being done 'in an effort to make tech companies more responsible in how they police their content,' The Wall Street Journal[1] reported.The Journal made note that 'the department will propose to strike from federal law a provision that allows platforms to delete content that they merely deem to be 'objectionable.'' That is in direct response to abuses by Big Tech firms restricting conservative political content.Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) has also proposed legislation that would reportedly empower users 'who believe the provider is not 'operating in good faith' by consistently and fairly applying its content rules' to sue Big Tech companies for $5,000 and attorneys' fees, according to Axios[2].The Journal reported that these upcoming changes will have a massive impact on Big Tech on multiple fronts:'The department's proposed changes, to be unveiled as soon as Wednesday, are designed to spur online platforms to be more aggressive in addressing illicit and harmful conduct on their sites, and to be fairer and more consistent in their decisions to take down content they find objectionable, the official said.'These actions come after President Donald Trump just last month announced an executive order[3] in response to him being censored by Twitter. </p><p>The Journal summarized that 'The executive order sought to impose limits on legal immunity for social-media companies when they are deemed to unfairly curb users' speech, for instance by deleting their posts or suspending their accounts.'The changes being proposed by the Justice Department, however, look to be on an even greater scale. The Journal explained that the legislative changes to be proposed are 'seeking to strip civil immunity afforded to tech companies in a range of other circumstances, the administration official said.' The Journal summarized that Big Tech companies, which have been shielded by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 thus far, are in for a reckoning:'Under that law, tech platforms are generally not legally liable for actions of their users, except in relatively narrow circumstances. Internet platforms also are given broad ability to police their sites as they see fit under the current law.'Sen. Hawley will reportedly 'introduce legislation that would give consumers grounds to sue companies like Facebook or Twitter over accusations of selective censorship of political speech' on Wednesday, according to Axios[4].'The Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act[5]' reportedly will hold Big Tech accountable to America's fundamental value of free speech. Axios summarized a statement from Hawley's office, suggesting it would 'prevent major online companies from receiving the protections of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act unless they revise their terms of service to include pledges to operate in good faith and details of their content moderation policies.'Hawley explained in a tweet[6] that this bill has both significant legal implications and support from several other Republican senators:'Today I'm introducing new legislation to combat #BigTech censorship. It gives users the right to sue if the big platforms enforce their terms unfairly or unequally. Proud to be joined by \u2066@marcorubio @SenTomCotton @SenatorBraun.'

This is being done 'in an effort to make tech companies more responsible in how they police their content,' The Wall Street Journal[1] reported.The Journal made note that 'the department will propose to strike from federal law a provision that allows platforms to delete content that they merely deem to be 'objectionable.'' That is in direct response to abuses by Big Tech firms restricting conservative political content.Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) has also proposed legislation that would reportedly empower users 'who believe the provider is not 'operating in good faith' by consistently and fairly applying its content rules' to sue Big Tech companies for $5,000 and attorneys' fees, according to Axios[2].The Journal reported that these upcoming changes will have a massive impact on Big Tech on multiple fronts:'The department's proposed changes, to be unveiled as soon as Wednesday, are designed to spur online platforms to be more aggressive in addressing illicit and harmful conduct on their sites, and to be fairer and more consistent in their decisions to take down content they find objectionable, the official said.'These actions come after President Donald Trump just last month announced an executive order[3] in response to him being censored by Twitter. </p><p>The Journal summarized that 'The executive order sought to impose limits on legal immunity for social-media companies when they are deemed to unfairly curb users' speech, for instance by deleting their posts or suspending their accounts.'The changes being proposed by the Justice Department, however, look to be on an even greater scale. The Journal explained that the legislative changes to be proposed are 'seeking to strip civil immunity afforded to tech companies in a range of other circumstances, the administration official said.' The Journal summarized that Big Tech companies, which have been shielded by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 thus far, are in for a reckoning:'Under that law, tech platforms are generally not legally liable for actions of their users, except in relatively narrow circumstances. Internet platforms also are given broad ability to police their sites as they see fit under the current law.'Sen. Hawley will reportedly 'introduce legislation that would give consumers grounds to sue companies like Facebook or Twitter over accusations of selective censorship of political speech' on Wednesday, according to Axios[4].'The Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act[5]' reportedly will hold Big Tech accountable to America's fundamental value of free speech. Axios summarized a statement from Hawley's office, suggesting it would 'prevent major online companies from receiving the protections of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act unless they revise their terms of service to include pledges to operate in good faith and details of their content moderation policies.'Hawley explained in a tweet[6] that this bill has both significant legal implications and support from several other Republican senators:'Today I'm introducing new legislation to combat #BigTech censorship. It gives users the right to sue if the big platforms enforce their terms unfairly or unequally. Proud to be joined by  @marcorubio @SenTomCotton @SenatorBraun.'

The US Department of Justice Antitrust Division has been on a hiring spree amid investigations into Silicon Valley tech giants, according to Reuters[3], citing two DOJ officials with knowledge of the matter.   The department is scheduled to post an advertisement for positions, potentially on Monday, for additional attorneys, paralegals with an interest in tech and others to work in San Francisco to focus on the tech industry, one of the sources said.  A job posting for five people for two-year Washington positions that dates from November specifies that the attorneys hired will work on a broad investigation of major digital technology firms into whether they engage in anticompetitive practices. </p><p>The posting includes a link to the agency's press release announcing the probes. -Reuters[4]  Companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google are facing a litany of antitrust probes by the US government, along with Congressional investigators and state attorneys general.  \"We have capacity to take on a good number of folks,\" said the source, who added that the number of new hires in the antitrust division will depend on the caliber of applicants.  The division works in conjunction with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to analyze mergers to ensure they are legal, as well as accusations of price-fixing.  In July, the Wall Street Journal reported that the DOJ was opening a broad antitrust review[5] into whether dominant technology firms are unlawfully stifling competition.  The review is reportedly centered around examining the practices of online platforms that dominate internet search, social media and retail services; the report notes that the new antitrust inquiry is \"the strongest signal yet of Attorney General William Barr's deep interest in the tech sector, and it could ratchet up the already considerable regulatory pressures facing the top U.S. tech firms.\"  The agency is also reportedly looking into how the most dominant tech firms have grown in size and might\u2014and expanded their reach into additional businesses, as well as weather big tech firms have abused the power that comes with having such large networks of users.  The DOJ's Antitrust Division began 2019 with a staff of approximately 622, which dropped to around 600 over the course of last year due to a hiring freeze which has recently been lifted. In the past six months, 86 employees have been hired #8212; including an unspecified number of attorneys, paralegals and others.

He spent the day with the president.   So he's going to fill us in on that, Laura.  Thank you very much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All right.  Let's get you caught up now on three breaking stories tonight.   The inspector general at the justice department is starting an  investigation into what Republicans contend is bias at the DOJ and FBI and  the Russia collision investigation and those FISA warrants.  We're also  learning this evening that President Trump has fired his Veteran Affairs  secretary, Dr. David Shulkin.  Senior North and South Korean officials are  just launching high-level talks to set up a planned summit in April with  President Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Team coverage tonight, Lucas Tomlinson standing by at the Pentagon with why  Dr. Shulkin was let's go.  And who's replacing him.  Leland Vittert  tracking the diplomatic moves on the Korean Peninsula.  But we begin  tonight with chief national correspondent, Ed Henry following the new  pressure on the FBI.  Good evening, Ed.</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Shannon, great to see  you.  Democrats initially laughed off these allegations about FISA abuse  but there may be some people in the Obama inner circle tonight that are  starting to sweat, not to mention former top FBI officials who were  supposed to be nonpolitical, like James Comey and Andrew McCabe, who will  now be facing even more scrutiny from the justice department inspector  general, Michael Horowitz.</p><p>Remember, Attorney General Jeff Sessions weeks ago said he wanted Horowitz  to handle this and got more heat from supporters of President Trump who  said, well, the inspector general is going to bury this.  Sessions had  passed the buck once again.  But this, tonight, is a sign maybe Horowitz  moving full speed ahead on what Republican Devin Nunes first brought to the  nation's attention with that Republican memo laying out how top FBI and  justice department officials in the Obama administration got a warrant in  2016 from the secretive FISA court to spy on former Trump advisor Carter  Page.  Most importantly, Comey, McCabe and other top officials used  information from former British spy, Christopher Steele's anti-Trump  dossier to get that warrant without disclosing to the judge that in fact  the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign had paid for that dirt.</p><p>Horowitz declaring in a statement tonight, \"As part of this examination,  the office of inspector general will review information that was known to  the DOJ and FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an  alleged FBI confidential source, that being Steele.  Additionally, the  inspector general will review the DOJ and FBI relationship, communications  with the alleged source as they relate to FISA applications.  If  circumstances warrant, the inspector general will consider, including other  issues that may arise during the course of the review.\"</p><p>That suggest its wide open could go into a whole bunch of issues.  And in  fact, House intelligence committee chair, Devin Nunes tonight was on with  \"HANNITY\" when he called out Democrats.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  Well, now, this is effectively  boomeranged on them.  You have at least, I think half of the American  people now know that the other party, the Democrats, appear like they  weaponized to some degree, the intelligence services.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY:  House judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte is another republican  probing the FISA abuse.  He has issued a subpoena for more documents on the  FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe.  Well, Democrat Jerry  Nadler is declaring that that's a problem.  \"It seems that the subpoena is  intended to speed up that production of documents to pivot the discussion  back to Hillary Clinton and divert attention from the chaos surrounding the  Trump administration and allegations involving the Trump campaign.\"  Well, there were new allegations today in The New York Times that former  Trump personal attorney, John Dowd discussed the possibility of pardons  with lawyers for Paul Manafort and retired general, Michael Flynn.  Ty  Cobb, another attorney for the president inside the White House, put out a  statement saying, I have only been asked about pardons by the press and  have routinely responded on the record that no pardons are under discussion  or even under consideration at the White House.</p><p>Either way the president's power to pardon is broad.  Discussions would not  necessarily be improper.  The question tonight is whether it becomes part  of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into potential obstruction of  justice.  Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  Ed Henry with the very latest.  Thank you so much.  We're going to  talk about it with the panel, coming up.</p><p>In the meantime, President Trump making big news at the White House tonight  as his doctor and navy admiral was nominated to take over at the V.A.  The  two have worked in close proximity at the White House, effectively firing  now Secretary David Shulkin.  Lucas Tomlinson has the story for us tonight.   Lucas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  For the second time in two weeks,  President Trump fired a member of his cabinet, this time acting V.A.  secretary Dr. David Shulkin, an Obama holdover, after calls for his removal  over an epic scandal boiled over.  Last month, the VA watchdogs said  Shulkin improperly accepted Wimbledon tickets and his former chief of staff  doctored e-mails to justify his wife traveling to Europe with him at tax  bear expense.</p><p>The inspector general is currently investigating whether his security deal  detail was made to deliver furniture from Home Depot to Shulkin's home.   President Trump has nominated White House Dr. Ronny Jackson to replace the  Shulkin, a navy rear admiral, a surprise choice to lead the government's  second largest department.  He has served as White House physician over the  past three administrations.  Recently, Jackson has been criticized by some  after giving a glowing report on the president's health.</p><p>RONNY JACKSON, NOMINATED AS THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS  AFFAIRS:  Some people have just great genes.  I told the president that if  he had a healthier dot over the last 20 years, he might have could love to  be 200 years old.</p><p>SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  The president has heart  disease.  Those numbers qualify him for having heart disease.  It clearly  needs a plan to and prevent some sort of heart problem down the road.</p><p>TOMLINSON:  In a statement, President Trump said Admiral Jackson is highly  trained and qualified.  One of the first GOP lawmakers to call for  Shulkin's ouster applauded the move.  Dr. Shulkin came from within the V.A.  and did nothing to clean up the culture of bureaucratic incompetence that  has defined the leadership at the V.A.  I'm absolutely convinced that only  someone from outside the V.A. can clean up the V.A.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>The president named Robert Wilkie, the Pentagon's undersecretary of defense  for personal and readiness, to serve as the acting V.A. secretary until  Admiral Jackson is confirmed.  But expect Senate Democrats to put up a  fight.  Shannon?</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Lucas Tomlinson from the Pentagon.  Thank you.</p><p>Kim Jong-un's secretive meeting with Chinese President, Xi Jinping, has  left many in the U.S. wondering what will happen next.  And what it could  mean for a future meeting with President Trump.</p><p>Leland Vittert joins us live with more on that.  Hey, Leland.</p><p>LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Shannon.  Lots of  news but very few answers to the core questions here.  When and where does  the Trump-Kim summit take place, what are the ground rules, and what does  the North Koreans really want for their nukes?  One thing is sure.  The  Chinese made it clear with this visit that they play front and center role  when it comes to dealing with the Kim regime.  The president paid respect  to his Chinese counterpart to that effect today tweeting, \"Received a  message last night from Xi Jinping of China that his meeting with Kim Jong- un went very well and that Kim looks forward to his meeting with me.  In  the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be  maintained at all cost.\"</p><p>Despite their freeze on missile and nuclear test, the North Koreans appear  to be moving forward at all costs and it breakneck speed with their nuclear  program.  New photo show another reactor, the north claims it's for  peaceful electricity generation.  But intelligence reports it is also  capable of throwing off highly and rich plutonium for more bombs.  If the  White House or U.S. intelligence community knew about the Chinese summit,  they didn't say anything, nor did they seem particularly surprised.  The  Chinese official state media reiterated the offer by Kim Jong-un of a face- to-face with President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Certainly, we're  going to be cautiously optimistic, but we feel like things are moving in  the right direction, and that the meeting yesterday was a good indication  that the maximum pressure campaign has been working.  You saw him leave for  the first time since becoming the leader of North Korea, leaving his  country for the first time for that meeting.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VITTERT:  Speaking of leaving, Kim Jong-un used his private luxury train to  make the journey to Beijing, a flight that normally takes two hours,  evidently Kim doesn't like to fly and showed off the train, as you can see  to the Chinese media.  So we were turned to when and where a meeting could  take place, if the president is going to show up.  It's highly unlikely it  will be a surprise and if Kim will only travel by a train that moves at a  reported 40 miles an hour, fair to say, Shannon, it greatly limits the  options for locations.</p><p>BREAM:  To one continent. It looks like.  All right.  Leland, thank you  very much.</p><p>Kim's surprise summit with Chinese president Xi Jinping this week was the  first time he traveled outside of his country since he assumed power in  2011.  That's according to his own state media.  But Beijing is just the  start.  Next, is a meeting just south of the DMZ with South Korean  president Moon Jae-in.  Then potentially with President Trump and as yet  undisclosed location.  He's also rumored to be considering a sit down with  Russia's Vladimir Putin, while one of its staunchest critics, Japanese  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he's ready for a meeting too.  So, what is  drawing him out of Hermit Kingdom all of a sudden?</p><p>Let's talk about it with Republican senator from South Carolina, Lindsey  Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  Great to have you  with us, Senator.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  That is a stunning overview.  If  you told me a year ago that the North Korean leader would be meeting with  President Trump, potentially the Russians and the Japanese, I wouldn't  believe it, and hats off to President Trump and his team for making this a  reality.  Maximum pressure has worked.</p><p>BREAM:  Let's talk first about China, because I read an account today that  said for six years, he's been pushing China to have an official meeting  with him.  They weren't really interested, it never happened, they held him  at arm's length.  As soon as it's becoming apparent that he's going to meet  with President Trump, China says, hey, come for a visit.  They obviously  have different interests in the region than we do.  There are some similar  but there are some differences.</p><p>Yun Sun writing a piece in 38 North, says that \"Beijing is concerned with  any concessions that North Korea might make toward the U.S. in exchange for  U.S. security guarantee or settlement that could lead to the unification of  the Korean Peninsula by absorption and the emergence of a unified Korea as  an American military ally on China's border.\"</p><p>GRAHAM:  I think that's a pretty good analysis of what they fear.  Now,  here's what they hope.  They hope that North Korea will stop being a pain  in the rear for them.  The North Korean nuclear program destabilizes the  entire world.  I hope that Kim Jong-un was told by the Chinese president,  we stand with America.  You need to give up your nukes.  I would tell the  Chinese, our goal is not to reunify South Korea and North Korea.  Our goal  is to make sure that North Korea gives up their nuclear weapons to protect  the American homeland and the world at large.  Help us there.</p><p>BREAM:  Do you think it will though?  Because the messages were relayed  after their meetings that they're open to denuclearizing the peninsula,  there are plenty of skeptics who aren't buying that or wonder what kind of  agreement we can get with North Korea as far as rigorous, legitimate  inspection.</p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, one, we've seen this movie before.  In 1994, they gave up  their nuclear program for food.  They took the food and they kept their  nukes.  The one thing I would tell China and North Korea, the worst mistake  you could make is meet with President Trump personally, have a discussion  about what to do, and try to play him.  If that happens, that's the end of  North Korea.</p><p>I met with the president today.  He doesn't want a war.  He's hopeful that  this can resolve in ending the North Korea and nuclear threat, stabilizing  that part of the world.  And I think he's ready to go big.  The Korean War  is still -- it's never been ended.</p><p>BREAM:  Technically.</p><p>GRAHAM:  What I would like to see happen is a peace treaty between South  Korea and North Korea, China, and the United States.  North Korea give up  their weapons.  Japan doesn't have them.  South Korea doesn't have them.   We'll give them an insurance that we're not going to invade North Korea.   We're going to tell the Chinese we're not trying to unify the Korean  Peninsula, but we are insisting that Kim Jong-un give up his nuclear  program.  There is a chance for a deal.  This is the last, best chance to  avoid a war.  The worst thing that can happen is North Korea try to play  Donald Trump.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you have said that the damage from a war with North Korea  would be worth it in terms of long-term stability and national security.   That scares a lot of people when you say that.</p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, I don't want to minimize the damage would be great.  Worth  it.  It's all about bad choices.  If there's a war between North Korea and  us, South Korea and Japan will get hit, hit hard.  Thousands of people  could die.  That is not lost upon me.  But if we allow them to get an ICBM,  they can hit America with a nuclear tipped missile.  The names of Americans  are at risk and he will sell anything he develops.  He sold to Syria, he  tried to help Iraq.  So North Korea proliferates nuclear materials.  So you  got two bad choices.  To me, it is worth it to stop him from getting a big  nuclear arsenal because he'll give it or sell it to people who would use it  if he would not.</p><p>BREAM:  Let's talk about Russia.  Interesting because the president took  these steps obviously in tandem with a number of European allies to expel a  number of Russian personnel, intelligence officers, those kinds of things  and response to this poisoning on British soil that Russians are now saying  the U.K. did made it look like the Russians did it.  I'm no security expert  or professional on so I won't comment on that.</p><p>Anyway, a couple of people now stepping up in the mainstream media to  praise the president, David Sanger from The New York Times saying this,  \"It's getting harder to make the argument that the president has not gotten  tough with Putin.\"  John Avlon of the Daily Beast saying, \"This is big and  it deserves credit.\"</p><p>GRAHAM:  He deserves a lot of credit, 60 diplomats/spies.  The president  mentioned that today.  The best thing can happen is to unite the world  against Russia's aggression, not just be the United States versus Russia,  but the entire world.  Look what happened when we decided to expel Russian  diplomats and spies, the entire world followed President Trump.  The best  thing he can do in my view, here at home and abroad, is to tell Putin, I  don't want to be your enemy but you're making me be your enemy and if you  continue to disrupt the world, invade your neighbor, assassinate people, in  foreign countries, then you're going to pay a price.</p><p>If China -- excuse me, if France and Germany would get behind Trump's  efforts to change business practices in China, guess what, China would stop  cheating if they had to pay a price.  Putin would stop disrupting the world  if he paid a price.  And I can tell you this.  Putin will respond to  weakness, to aggression, and he will respond to strength by backing off.   And President Trump's got a moment in time here to really make Putin pay a  price.  His economy is the size of Italy.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, 15 seconds.  You spent 90 minutes with the president  today.  How did he seem to?  Because there's a lot of news swirling around  him, much of it not positive.</p><p>GRAHAM:  Very, very focused, very upbeat.  It feels like he's doing a good  job.  And we have some historic moments coming in may when North Korea and  Iran, tax cuts are working, he wants to try to get a deal on immigration  that would include the wall.  The President was very upbeat and quite  frankly, and I think he's done a very good job as Commander-in-Chief.  </p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Senator Graham, always good to have you with us.   Thanks.  Well, the Polish government signing off on a huge deal to buy the  U.S. patriot missile defense system today for nearly $5 billion.  It's the  largest arms procurement deal in Poland's history and it's a major step in  modernizing their forces which analysts do not sit well with the Kremlin.   Well, the U.S. economy looks to be on stable footing.  In the final quarter  of 2017, marked the third quarter in a row with GDP close to or exceeding  three percent.  The pace that the Trump administration set as a target.  </p><p>Gross domestic product measures the value of every item produced in every  service rendered in the U.S.  President Trump will visit Northeast Ohio  tomorrow afternoon to present his proposed $1.5-trillion program to rebuild  some of the country's aging infrastructure.  Some economists argue the  infrastructure will not add to the U.S. economy.  The White House Council  of Economic Advisors says the plan would give a significant boost to the  GDP over the next ten years adding up to 400,000 new jobs.</p><p>Well, they're calling it a boomerang effect.  What began as surveillance of  a Trump campaign turning into an investigation of the alleged FISA abuse by  the FBI under the Obama administration.  What it all means for the special  counsel probe, next.  Plus new developments tonight on a breaking story.  A  new Trump administration proposal aimed at making sure immigrants don't  become dependent on government benefits if they want to attain legal  status, lots doesn't like it.  Also on tap, from marching for our lives to  marching for life.  Now another group of students is trying to organize a  nationwide school walkout.  But will it get some the same kind of support.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  After being criticized by conservatives for signing a $1.5 trillion  spending package last week, well just a small fraction of the border wall  funding the White House wanted President Trump is touting its construction  on Twitter.  The President tweeting photos of portion of the wall being  built, adding, great briefing this afternoon on the start of our southern  border wall.  It comes following are report that the Trump administration  is seeking to restrict legal status for immigrants who rely on tax credits  and other government welfare programs.  Let's talk about with tonight's  panel.  Radio host Ethan Bearman, Fox News Contributor Lisa Boothe, and The  Federalists Mollie Hemingway, also a Fox News Contributor.  Good to see all  of you tonight.  </p><p>LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, Shannon.  </p><p>ETHAN BEARMAN, RADIO HOST:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  To tell you a little bit more about this.  This is what  the DHS spokeswoman said.  Now, this is their proposal, apparently they say  nothing is finalized yet.  But once it is approved, it will be released,  they will have a comment period the whole nine yards.  This is what she  said in a statement.  The administration is committed to enforcing existing  immigration law which is clearly intended to protect the American taxpayer  by ensuring that foreign national seeking to enter or remain in the U.S.  are self-sufficient.  Now, Mollie, the left says, this is an attack on  people who have come here illegally and want to gain legal status that --  and it may need some financial help along the way.</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  This really gets to the heart of  the debate about what type of immigration policy you should have.  There  are some people who think it should be pretty random and lottery based.   And then there are people who are pushing for a move to the more Australian  or Canadian style where self-sufficiency does play a role.  Now, it doesn't  play a role for people who have special needs or our refugee status or  particular persecution.  But in general, a lot of immigration that comes  into this country -- a lot of the immigrants that come into this country,  American citizens are looking for people who can be self-sufficient and can  contribute to the economy.  And a lot of immigrants do.  But this is one of  the tests to make sure that this is working out for current American  citizens as well.  </p><p>BREAM:  Well, in reacting to this, the statement from DNC Chair Tom Perez  says this, it's another heartless attack on immigrants.  Donald Trump  should spend less time finding ways to punish hardworking families and more  time standing up to the values of inclusion and opportunity that make  America great.  Your response, Lisa? </p><p>BOOTHE:  Well, I think Mollie is absolutely right.  This is consistent with  what we have seen from this White House particularly on legal immigration  on the race act as well that President Trump endorse, it was introduced by  Senator Cohn and Perdue that looks at what Mollie discussed was a merit- based immigration approach and something that President Trump pushed for as  well when he laid out what he would ideally like to see Congress passed and  address on the DACA issue.  You know, also, so I think this is very  consistent with what we have seen from President Trump wanting to bring  people into this country that would benefit more economically, maybe not  take as much public assistance and, you know, it would bring some sort of  skill set to the workforce.  </p><p>BREAM:  Ethan, the DHS says too, this is about making sure that U.S.  taxpayers are treated fairly because ultimately there is a price tag for  some of these benefits.  What say you?  </p><p>BEARMAN:  Well, of course we want U.S. taxpayers to be treated fairly.  But  the 1996 Welfare Act and Immigration Act of 1996 already addressed this  issue.  So this is just a very marginal number of people, immigrants --  illegal immigrants already over abundantly contribute to our economy.   There are greater number of small business owners that are native-born.   They actually work at a higher percentage than native-borns.  And they are  higher education levels, they actually earn more than native-born  Americans.  So this is just meat to the base because it is such a tiny  percentage of people that we are even talking about.  It's not billions of  dollars that are being abused or wasted right now.  </p><p>BREAM:  OK.  I want to make sure that this next topic I get all three of  you in.  So if you keep you answers relatively brief.  Ethan, I'll start  with you and we'll work back.  Today the inspector general of the DOJ says  he's going to look into these allegations about whether the FISA warrant  system was abused, whether the DOJ and FBI under the Obama administration  was fair and complied with the law.  </p><p>BEARMAN:  Yes.  I think any time that there is an objective investigation  by an -- objective investor -- excuse me, inspector general, that's  something that we all need.  We need to know that the process works.   However, in this case it sure seems to be a right-wing move that seems to  think of the deep state is so embedded that the FBI is not able to  function.  Yes.  We have a couple of bad apples who were caught red-handed  and were removed from the process.  But really, I mean, we have the new  Manafort connection to the Russian intelligence and that's not what we're  talking about.  </p><p>BREAM:  Lisa? </p><p>BOOTHE:  There are also bad actors that were in part helping to lead these  investigations, that's where the concern boils down to.  But I do think to  Ethan's point, Michael Horowitz is going to be deemed as a more objective  investigator in this term.  However he doesn't have the prosecutorial  authority which is why, you know, people like Chairman Gowdy, also members  of the Senate calling for a second special counsel.  </p><p>BREAM:  Uh-hmm.  Mollie the top Democrat on this judiciary committee says  this is a conspiracy theory that's been debunked, it's a waste of time and  money.  </p><p>HEMMINGWAY:  Well, in the last year, you've had Congressional committees on  both sides of, you know, the senate and the House looking into Russian  meddling, you've had t he inspector general looking into Hillary Clinton e- mail probe.  And what everybody has found is some violation of processes  and serious problems at the department of Justice and FBI.  You've already  had at least six, seven, eight people who were fired, demoted, moved around  because of these problems.  And you have very serious issues with FISA  abuse.  So these are secret courts, it's incumbent upon our government to  make sure that we are -- we are handling the surveillance authority well.   And we do need to restore the credibility of our Federal Law Enforcement.   This I.G. is a good step, it's a small step though because they can't --  the I.G. can't compel testimony from people who have left FBI or DOJ.  And  it also doesn't deal with the problems that we found at state, CIA and  other agencies as well.  So, we'll probably still need a special prosecutor  just so everyone can trust the FBI and DOJ.  </p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  The calls for those continue.  All right.  Panel, you were  fabulous.  We want you to come back.  So stick around, we've got some more  hot topics for you in just a minute.  Thank you, guys.  Meanwhile, Amazon  founder Jeff Bezos is reportedly the richest man in the world but his  network took a serious tumble today all because he's reportedly made one  very powerful enemy.  Plus the news stories are so unbelievable, we have to  remind you they are actually legit.  The real news roundup coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  In the wake of anti-gun student walkout, the California teacher was  suspended for asking whether pro-life protesters could do the same thing.   She wound up suspended, now, one of her students is fighting back.  Trace  Gallagher, has all the details from the West Coast.  Hey, Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Shannon.  The nationwide pro- life walkout is specifically meant to imitate the recent gun violence  protest except the goal this time is to shine a bright light on the lives  destroyed by abortion.  The event will also test if there's a double  standard when it comes to allowing students to protest things that take  lives.</p><p>The walkout is being organized by 17 year old, Brandon Gillespie, he is a  junior at Rocklin High School outside of Sacramento.  Gillespie, says he  wants to honor the lives of aborted babies, raise awareness of what he  calls the injustices of Planned Parenthood, and to protest the suspension  of his history teacher, Julianne Benzel, who was placed on leave when she  brought up the double standard.  Here is the teacher.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIANNE BENZEL, TEACHER, ROCKLIN HIGH SCHOOL, CALIFORNIA:  I open up the  discussion for -- if schools, not only just our school and our  administration but across the country are going to allow one group of  students to get up during class -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.</p><p>BENZEL:  -- and walkout to protest one issue, -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.</p><p>BENZEL:  -- would they still give the same courtesy to another group of  students who wanted to get up and walk out to protest?  And I use the  example of abortion -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Ms. Benzel, who's back teaching now says the upcoming pro-life  walkout will literally answer the double standard question.  The event is  now set for April 11th, and the students are asking for the very same 17  minutes given to students who protested gun violence.  It remains unclear  how schools across the country will respond.</p><p>Meantime, we're getting a better idea of exactly, who participated in the  March for Our Lives against gun violence.  And it -- apparently, it wasn't  mostly young people.  A sociology professor at the University of Maryland  and her six-person research team randomly surveyed hundreds of people who  joined in the march and found 70 percent were women and quoting, \"Only  about 10 percent of the participants were under 18.  The average age of the  adults in the crowd was just under 49 years old.\"</p><p>She also says 27 percent of the participants had never protested before and  most of the new protesters were not motivated by gun-control but rather, by  issues of peace, and of President Trump.  Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Trace.  Very interesting details, thank you.  Well,  tonight, the ACLU is urging Greyhound not to let ICE agents search its  buses for illegal immigrants without a warrant.</p><p>Meanwhile, the ACLU's efforts against law enforcement may have had some  perhaps unintended consequences.  Researchers are blaming tougher rules on  police officers for Chicago's huge spike in homicides.  They're calling at  the ACLU effect, the ACLU calling it junk science.  Senior Correspondent  Mike Tobin takes a look at the evidence from Chicago tonight.</p><p>MICHAEL TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  The ACLU is to blame for  Chicago's 2016 increase in violent crime, that according to a new study  from the University of Utah.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAUL CASSELL, LAW PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH:  We have a collection of  data that come together to make it clear that causation exists here.</p><p>TOBIN:  The study concludes burdens placed on the city's police force have  taken their toll.  Street protest erupted in 2015, in response to a video  of black teenager Laquan McDonald, being shot 16 times by a Chicago police  officer.</p><p>In the aftermath, the ACLU in Chicago police reach an agreement to address  accusations of racial profiling.  Police officers were required to fill out  elaborate cards after stop and frisk.  Researcher say the form with 70  entries take 15 to 20 minutes to complete.  As a result, stops dropped by  82 percent in 2016.  Homicides jumped by 58 percent, and Chicago endured an  additional 1100 gun crimes.</p><p>The study examined other factors, from anger on the street to the opioid  epidemic.  However, it concluded that the ACLU effect is the anomaly and  cops are discouraged from checking suspicious people for weapons.</p><p>CASSELL:  Criminals on the streets of Chicago became emboldened to carry  guns, and deterrent effect decreased.  And when there were more guns on the  street being carried by criminals, the predictable result is an increase in  gun-related crimes.</p><p>TOBIN:  The spike in bloodshed is undeniable.  That and enhanced scrutiny  of a police frequently gets attention from the president.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  What the hell is going on in  Chicago?</p><p>TOBIN:  An ACLU lawyer says you can't just look at the chronology and blame  the contact cards.</p><p>KAREN SHELEY, ATTORNEY, AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION, ILLINOIS:  Its junk  science, it makes claims that the math that it uses control that one thing  caused another.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOBIN:  The ACLU also claims that most of the entries on the contact cards  are required by the Chicago P.D., not their organization.  And  representatives challenge the objectivity of the researchers who also  authored a study in 2017, reaching the conclusion that Miranda requirements  reduce police effectiveness.  Shannon, back to you.</p><p>BREAM:  Time for a quick \"ROUNDUP OF THE REAL NEWS\" out there.  The way is  often derided by the mainstream media for being weak on Russia or even  colluding with President Vladimir Putin, to influence the 2016 election,  The New York Times is actually crediting President Trump with getting tough  on Russia, after expelling 60 Russian diplomats earlier this week.  David  Sanger is the great lady chief Washington correspondent.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID SANGER, CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  He is  getting a harder to make the argument that the president has not got in  tough with Putin.  This is certainly a tougher move, for example, than  President Obama took when he expelled 30 some odd diplomats after the  election issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  President Trump, also getting tough on portraits of government  officials.  One of three bills signed into law yesterday, the Eliminating  Government-funded Oil-painting Act bars the use of taxpayer funds for  portraits of federal workers.  Like former EPA administrator Lisa Jackson,  former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and more.  Some of these  portraits cost taxpayers $40,000 each.</p><p>Well, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania High School has a rifle team with equipment  more than 40 years old.  That's not the only problem facing the  Mountaineers, the school board if they are voted Monday night to reject a  $5,000 grant from the National Rifle Association meant to help them buy new  gear and guns.</p><p>So, the team put together a Go-Fund Me site with an appeal for help that  says, \"Let's put our political ideology aside and come together as a  community in support of our rifle team.\"  Well, tonight, they've nearly  doubled their original goal after about a dozen local businesses got  together and decided to help fund the team.</p><p>Well, classic '90s T.V. show made its much-anticipated return last night,  but, is Roseanne really representing Trump voters?  Tonight's panel returns  for what is sure to be a lively debate.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  It's a scene that's all too familiar too many American families  that divide over the 2016 election.  ABC showed us by reviving \"Roseanne\"  after a 20 year high at us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURIE METCALF, AS JACKIE HARRIS IN A SITCOM, ROSEANNE:  How could you have  voted for him, Roseanne?</p><p>ROSEANNE BARR, ACTRESS, COMEDIAN:  He talked about jobs, Jackie.  He said  he'd shake things up.  I mean, this might come as a (INAUDIBLE) shock to  you but we almost lost our house the way things are going.</p><p>METCALF:  Have you looked at the news?  Because now things are worse.</p><p>BARR:  Not on the real news.</p><p>METCALF:  Oh, police!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  \"Roseanne's\" debut scoring massive ratings in American cities like  New York, but also all across the middle of America, dominating in States  where President Trump won.  Like Ohio, there is a debate about exactly why.   So let's talk about it with our panel tonight.  I thought it was  interesting guys, it had monster ratings but not everybody agreed it was  necessarily a good thing for conservatives because Roseanne's character  supports Trump.</p><p>Ben Shapiro writing this, he said, \"There's something else going on in  \"Roseanne\" that should disturb conservatives.  The redefinition of Trump  supporters as blue-collar leftists rather than conservatives.  Roseanne's  character is pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion, feminist, and pro- transgenderism.  And the implication is that she's a good person because of  these views, but the real difference between Trump voters and Hillary  voters are economic in nature, not cultural.\"  Lisa, what do you make of  that?</p><p>BOOTHE:  I don't want to get an argument with Ben Shapiro because he's a  pretty smart guy there, but I also think that -- look, if you try to look  at the Trump coalition, it's sort of a hodgepodge of individuals in this  country.  So, I think you certainly have people like Roseanne Barr, who's a  Trump supporter.</p><p>Herself, in real life, also an executive producer of this show that -- you  know, maybe a little bit more socially liberal but voted on him for the  economic issues alone.  But I also think you additionally have people that  went for President Trump because of these cultural words.  Again, President  Trump sort of had this broad, hodgepodge of a coalition.  So, I see his  point, I think it's a smart point, but I don't necessarily a 100 percent  agree with the point he is making.</p><p>BREAM:  Ethan, what do you make of those monster ratings last night?</p><p>BEARMAN:  Well, I say congratulations to the show.  The cast, I think they  did a great job.  I'm not necessarily the biggest fan but I'm going to tell  you something, Ben Shapiro, is totally wrong on this one.  It's about love,  it's not about hate, and that's what Roseanne is preaching here and what  she's been doing for many, many years.</p><p>She led the way both the advocate and out have come out in support of  Roseanne, not just the show -- I think, but the show 24 years ago -- almost  24 years ago was a groundbreaker in terms of the first kiss between two  women on T.V.  So, that's a big deal for a lot of people because especially  in light of what the president has been doing with some of the anti-LGBT  moves, Roseanne, shows that you can love and support Trump at the same  time, well, the LGBT.</p><p>BREAM:  OK, and I think that's Ben's concern is that it portrays Trump  voters is being ones who care about the economy but not these cultural  issues.  He doesn't think that's the case, but -- you know, we'll see.  We  love having Ben on, to maybe we can talk about this.</p><p>All right, I want to make sure we get to our second topic.  We'll start  with you, Mollie.  A young student out in California says he's going to do  a pro-life walkout, April 11th, I believe is the time a date for that.  He  wants to test a couple of things.  He says this, he says, \"Along with being  a movement commemorating the millions of children who fell victim to  abortion, the movement is one that stands for all students' rights to  freedom of speech and assembly.\"</p><p>He says, he wants to test this theory about whether it will get the same  kind of support that the anti-gun rally has did.</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  Well, it's interesting that the study came out showing that the  people at this weekends' march, the average age was 50, and there weren't  that many children there.  If you go to the March for Life which is held  annually in D.C., and also in state capitals and other cities throughout  the country, you are blown away by how many young people are there, high  school students and even younger.  This is an issue of ending the  destruction of human life in the womb and violence in the womb and how that  hurts women and their children is an issue that young people care deeply  about.  And it is something that the media have not done a very good job  covering.  And I think it's a really interesting question to ask, whether  schools will be supportive of this as they were actively colluding and  trying to push this anti-gun rights march that they did.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, and Ethan, this student directly was a student of the teacher  got suspended out in California for asking this and having this  conversation in her class.  Do you think the two topics will be treated the  same?  What do you of this plan?</p><p>BEARMAN:  I mean, I always support people to exercise their First Amendment  rights, but there is a significant difference between an already existing  march for life and pro -- anti-abortion rally that goes on and a reaction  by a lot of people.  By the way, I was at the march for our lives with my  two small children, well under the age of 50, and my kids are way under the  age of 50.  So I think we saw a lot of young people there.  I don't -- that  study was somewhat non-scientific in D.C. only.  But the point is this, the  kids in Parkland and around the country are worried about the violence that  took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.  Abortions are not  happening in high school classrooms so these are different topics and there  are separate marches for that.</p><p>BREAM:  We got to leave it there because we're out of time.  But thank you  all, Ethan, Lisa and Mollie, we'll watch April 11th and we'll see what  happens.</p><p>HEMMINGWAY:  Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BEARMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>BREAM:  Thank you, guys.  All right, Facebook under fire, Amazon stocks  plummeting as a third news technology company raises eyebrows with a  controversial appointment with board of directors breaking down the tech  headlines next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Amazon chair slumping after Axios reported that President Trump  believes the e-commerce giant is making life harder for small businesses  and is reportedly considering legal means to change that.  Joining me now  from Los Angeles, Steve Hilton, Host of the \"NEXT REVOLUTION\" on Sunday  nights right here on Fox, also, the Co-Founder and CEO of a tech company  himself and Axios Reporter Alayna Treene.  Great to have both of you with  us tonight.</p><p>ALAYNA TREENE, REPORTER, AXIOS:  Great to have be here.</p><p>BREAM:  Steve, there's been a lot of hostility in recent weeks against a  lot of the big tech companies.  Is it paying to specific stories do you  think were there's a broader backlash?</p><p>STEVE HILTON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  It's a broader backlash, Shannon.  In  many ways, I think it's really helpful that it's happening because it's  shining a spotlight on something really important, which is that these tech  companies have just got too big and too powerful and it mirrors something  that is happening in the economy generally where you got a concentration of  power, of economic power and that's always bad news.  It's bad news when it  happens in government when you get a concentration of power in Washington.   That's why I believe in decentralizing power from the federal government to  the states and to communities.  But the same thing needs happen in the  economy too.  We actually need to really toughen up the antitrust laws and  start breaking up these companies, not just tech, throughout the economy,  to get more competition into the marketplace.</p><p>BREAM:  OK, and Alayna, to that point, the President apparently, the  reporting from your outlet, Axios is that he'd to possibly take some steps  against Amazon, thinking it's hurting brick-and-mortar stores, retailers,  shopping malls, people in real estate, which is a business where he has a  lot of friends, the quote is, \"the tech behemoth Trump wants to go after is  Amazon according to five sources who has discussed it with him.  He's  obsessed with Amazon, a source said, \"obsessed.\"  Alayna?</p><p>TREENE:  Well, it's definitely interesting to see and that's exactly what  the reporting shows. And really, what we're seeing is the President, he is  a 1950s man.  He's a businessman before he was President.  He kind of is  nostalgic for the days that it used to be and he's starting to see -- talking to Steve's point, he thinks that there's a lot of power in the  hands of these tech companies, and Amazon in particular for its e-commerce  aspect of that and what it's doing to mom-and-pop stores and other  retailers that he sees it as a big threat to some of those smaller  businesses.  And so, he's looking at perhaps taking some action.  Press  Secretary Sarah Sanders said today that there is nothing in the works right  now but from what the sources have told Axios is that he really is looking  at anti -- maybe anti-trust regulations or some other tax treatment that  they might be abusing.</p><p>BREAM:  And another tech company that's revolutionized the way we get  entertainment, Netflix has announced Susan Rice, former Ambassador and  former NSA under the Obama Administration is going to join their board.  I  want to get a quick reaction for both of you.  Steve, first to you.</p><p>HILTON:  I think you know, there's nothing that -- not to be upset about  except the fact that it is so typical, isn't it?  People who serve in  government and then they basically cash in on their public service and they  get who burned up by these big companies and stock on their board.  It's  happened forever, it's part of the swamp.  That is the real story here  rather than the politics of Netflix.  It's all about the swamp.  This is  how they work.</p><p>BREAM:  And Alayna, you know, there's been backlash and threats of a  boycott because of the Ambassador's role in the Benghazi fiasco.  How do  you think that plays out?</p><p>TREENE:  Well, a lot of people have been taking on to Twitter and other  forms of social media to say that they're going to boycott Netflix for  putting Susan Rice on the board.  And we saw similar things happen when  there was buzz that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama might also have a  Netflix series on Netflix.  And so a lot of people believed, just like  Steve's point, as he was saying it's the swamp coming to these big media  outlets and a lot of people don't like that crossover from the political  world in Washington into some of the more tech companies and media  companies that they see as their entertainment and ways of escaping all of  that.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, a tough day for many in the tech companies.  A tough week in  the markets.  We'll see how they fare tomorrow with the next news cycle.   Steve and Alayna, great to have both of you with us tonight.  Thanks. </p><p>TREENE:  Thank you.</p><p>HILTON:  Thanks, Shannon.  See you soon. </p><p>BREAM:  OK, so many of you who have reached out in the last few days after  I put out a Twitter plea for a young boy he was very ill and had one last  wish.  So we've got an update for you right after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  I want to close tonight by updating you about young Emilio who is  dying wish was to get a message of one of the Avengers.  I launched a  Twitter campaign after getting the request from Emilio's uncle whom I've  met on a plane weeks ago.  Thanks to your tens of thousands of retweets,  and the kindness of many strangers in three short days, videos personalized  for Emilio poured in from multiple Avengers and other superheroes.  Today  one of them was set to call him at the hospital, but the 11-year-old cancer  fighter did not make it.  Emilio's family started a foundation to help  others facing the same struggles that they have.  Emilio also wrote a book  last year, and all the proceeds will help fund the foundation.</p><p>If you want to help, just go to genesfoundation -- that's G-E-N-E-S  foundation.com.  And please remember this.  Emilio proved that social media  can be actually an enormous force for good and that there is plenty of  kindness in the world.  Strangers will often care and have compassion even  when it will benefit them in no way.  We've seen that over and over since  Sunday.  So thanks all of you who made that happen.  Tonight, most-watched,  most trusted, and most grateful you spent the evening with us.  Good night  from Washington.  I'm Shannon Bream.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

He spent the day with the president. So he's going to fill us in on that, Laura. Thank you very much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All right. Let's get you caught up now on three breaking stories tonight. The inspector general at the justice department is starting an investigation into what Republicans contend is bias at the DOJ and FBI and the Russia collision investigation and those FISA warrants. We're also learning this evening that President Trump has fired his Veteran Affairs secretary, Dr. David Shulkin. Senior North and South Korean officials are just launching high-level talks to set up a planned summit in April with President Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Team coverage tonight, Lucas Tomlinson standing by at the Pentagon with why Dr. Shulkin was let's go. And who's replacing him. Leland Vittert tracking the diplomatic moves on the Korean Peninsula. But we begin tonight with chief national correspondent, Ed Henry following the new pressure on the FBI. Good evening, Ed.</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, great to see you. Democrats initially laughed off these allegations about FISA abuse but there may be some people in the Obama inner circle tonight that are starting to sweat, not to mention former top FBI officials who were supposed to be nonpolitical, like James Comey and Andrew McCabe, who will now be facing even more scrutiny from the justice department inspector general, Michael Horowitz.</p><p>Remember, Attorney General Jeff Sessions weeks ago said he wanted Horowitz to handle this and got more heat from supporters of President Trump who said, well, the inspector general is going to bury this. Sessions had passed the buck once again. But this, tonight, is a sign maybe Horowitz moving full speed ahead on what Republican Devin Nunes first brought to the nation's attention with that Republican memo laying out how top FBI and justice department officials in the Obama administration got a warrant in 2016 from the secretive FISA court to spy on former Trump advisor Carter Page. Most importantly, Comey, McCabe and other top officials used information from former British spy, Christopher Steele's anti-Trump dossier to get that warrant without disclosing to the judge that in fact the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign had paid for that dirt.</p><p>Horowitz declaring in a statement tonight, \"As part of this examination, the office of inspector general will review information that was known to the DOJ and FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source, that being Steele. Additionally, the inspector general will review the DOJ and FBI relationship, communications with the alleged source as they relate to FISA applications. If circumstances warrant, the inspector general will consider, including other issues that may arise during the course of the review.\"</p><p>That suggest its wide open could go into a whole bunch of issues. And in fact, House intelligence committee chair, Devin Nunes tonight was on with \"HANNITY\" when he called out Democrats.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA: Well, now, this is effectively boomeranged on them. You have at least, I think half of the American people now know that the other party, the Democrats, appear like they weaponized to some degree, the intelligence services.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY: House judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte is another republican probing the FISA abuse. He has issued a subpoena for more documents on the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe. Well, Democrat Jerry Nadler is declaring that that's a problem. \"It seems that the subpoena is intended to speed up that production of documents to pivot the discussion back to Hillary Clinton and divert attention from the chaos surrounding the Trump administration and allegations involving the Trump campaign.\" Well, there were new allegations today in The New York Times that former Trump personal attorney, John Dowd discussed the possibility of pardons with lawyers for Paul Manafort and retired general, Michael Flynn. Ty Cobb, another attorney for the president inside the White House, put out a statement saying, I have only been asked about pardons by the press and have routinely responded on the record that no pardons are under discussion or even under consideration at the White House.</p><p>Either way the president's power to pardon is broad. Discussions would not necessarily be improper. The question tonight is whether it becomes part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into potential obstruction of justice. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: Ed Henry with the very latest. Thank you so much. We're going to talk about it with the panel, coming up.</p><p>In the meantime, President Trump making big news at the White House tonight as his doctor and navy admiral was nominated to take over at the V.A. The two have worked in close proximity at the White House, effectively firing now Secretary David Shulkin. Lucas Tomlinson has the story for us tonight. Lucas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: For the second time in two weeks, President Trump fired a member of his cabinet, this time acting V.A. secretary Dr. David Shulkin, an Obama holdover, after calls for his removal over an epic scandal boiled over. Last month, the VA watchdogs said Shulkin improperly accepted Wimbledon tickets and his former chief of staff doctored e-mails to justify his wife traveling to Europe with him at tax bear expense.</p><p>The inspector general is currently investigating whether his security deal detail was made to deliver furniture from Home Depot to Shulkin's home. President Trump has nominated White House Dr. Ronny Jackson to replace the Shulkin, a navy rear admiral, a surprise choice to lead the government's second largest department. He has served as White House physician over the past three administrations. Recently, Jackson has been criticized by some after giving a glowing report on the president's health.</p><p>RONNY JACKSON, NOMINATED AS THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS: Some people have just great genes. I told the president that if he had a healthier dot over the last 20 years, he might have could love to be 200 years old.</p><p>SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: The president has heart disease. Those numbers qualify him for having heart disease. It clearly needs a plan to and prevent some sort of heart problem down the road.</p><p>TOMLINSON: In a statement, President Trump said Admiral Jackson is highly trained and qualified. One of the first GOP lawmakers to call for Shulkin's ouster applauded the move. Dr. Shulkin came from within the V.A. and did nothing to clean up the culture of bureaucratic incompetence that has defined the leadership at the V.A. I'm absolutely convinced that only someone from outside the V.A. can clean up the V.A.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>The president named Robert Wilkie, the Pentagon's undersecretary of defense for personal and readiness, to serve as the acting V.A. secretary until Admiral Jackson is confirmed. But expect Senate Democrats to put up a fight. Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: All right. Lucas Tomlinson from the Pentagon. Thank you.</p><p>Kim Jong-un's secretive meeting with Chinese President, Xi Jinping, has left many in the U.S. wondering what will happen next. And what it could mean for a future meeting with President Trump.</p><p>Leland Vittert joins us live with more on that. Hey, Leland.</p><p>LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. Lots of news but very few answers to the core questions here. When and where does the Trump-Kim summit take place, what are the ground rules, and what does the North Koreans really want for their nukes? One thing is sure. The Chinese made it clear with this visit that they play front and center role when it comes to dealing with the Kim regime. The president paid respect to his Chinese counterpart to that effect today tweeting, \"Received a message last night from Xi Jinping of China that his meeting with Kim Jong- un went very well and that Kim looks forward to his meeting with me. In the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost.\"</p><p>Despite their freeze on missile and nuclear test, the North Koreans appear to be moving forward at all costs and it breakneck speed with their nuclear program. New photo show another reactor, the north claims it's for peaceful electricity generation. But intelligence reports it is also capable of throwing off highly and rich plutonium for more bombs. If the White House or U.S. intelligence community knew about the Chinese summit, they didn't say anything, nor did they seem particularly surprised. The Chinese official state media reiterated the offer by Kim Jong-un of a face- to-face with President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Certainly, we're going to be cautiously optimistic, but we feel like things are moving in the right direction, and that the meeting yesterday was a good indication that the maximum pressure campaign has been working. You saw him leave for the first time since becoming the leader of North Korea, leaving his country for the first time for that meeting.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VITTERT: Speaking of leaving, Kim Jong-un used his private luxury train to make the journey to Beijing, a flight that normally takes two hours, evidently Kim doesn't like to fly and showed off the train, as you can see to the Chinese media. So we were turned to when and where a meeting could take place, if the president is going to show up. It's highly unlikely it will be a surprise and if Kim will only travel by a train that moves at a reported 40 miles an hour, fair to say, Shannon, it greatly limits the options for locations.</p><p>BREAM: To one continent. It looks like. All right. Leland, thank you very much.</p><p>Kim's surprise summit with Chinese president Xi Jinping this week was the first time he traveled outside of his country since he assumed power in 2011. That's according to his own state media. But Beijing is just the start. Next, is a meeting just south of the DMZ with South Korean president Moon Jae-in. Then potentially with President Trump and as yet undisclosed location. He's also rumored to be considering a sit down with Russia's Vladimir Putin, while one of its staunchest critics, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he's ready for a meeting too. So, what is drawing him out of Hermit Kingdom all of a sudden?</p><p>Let's talk about it with Republican senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Great to have you with us, Senator.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: That is a stunning overview. If you told me a year ago that the North Korean leader would be meeting with President Trump, potentially the Russians and the Japanese, I wouldn't believe it, and hats off to President Trump and his team for making this a reality. Maximum pressure has worked.</p><p>BREAM: Let's talk first about China, because I read an account today that said for six years, he's been pushing China to have an official meeting with him. They weren't really interested, it never happened, they held him at arm's length. As soon as it's becoming apparent that he's going to meet with President Trump, China says, hey, come for a visit. They obviously have different interests in the region than we do. There are some similar but there are some differences.</p><p>Yun Sun writing a piece in 38 North, says that \"Beijing is concerned with any concessions that North Korea might make toward the U.S. in exchange for U.S. security guarantee or settlement that could lead to the unification of the Korean Peninsula by absorption and the emergence of a unified Korea as an American military ally on China's border.\"</p><p>GRAHAM: I think that's a pretty good analysis of what they fear. Now, here's what they hope. They hope that North Korea will stop being a pain in the rear for them. The North Korean nuclear program destabilizes the entire world. I hope that Kim Jong-un was told by the Chinese president, we stand with America. You need to give up your nukes. I would tell the Chinese, our goal is not to reunify South Korea and North Korea. Our goal is to make sure that North Korea gives up their nuclear weapons to protect the American homeland and the world at large. Help us there.</p><p>BREAM: Do you think it will though? Because the messages were relayed after their meetings that they're open to denuclearizing the peninsula, there are plenty of skeptics who aren't buying that or wonder what kind of agreement we can get with North Korea as far as rigorous, legitimate inspection.</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, one, we've seen this movie before. In 1994, they gave up their nuclear program for food. They took the food and they kept their nukes. The one thing I would tell China and North Korea, the worst mistake you could make is meet with President Trump personally, have a discussion about what to do, and try to play him. If that happens, that's the end of North Korea.</p><p>I met with the president today. He doesn't want a war. He's hopeful that this can resolve in ending the North Korea and nuclear threat, stabilizing that part of the world. And I think he's ready to go big. The Korean War is still -- it's never been ended.</p><p>BREAM: Technically.</p><p>GRAHAM: What I would like to see happen is a peace treaty between South Korea and North Korea, China, and the United States. North Korea give up their weapons. Japan doesn't have them. South Korea doesn't have them. We'll give them an insurance that we're not going to invade North Korea. We're going to tell the Chinese we're not trying to unify the Korean Peninsula, but we are insisting that Kim Jong-un give up his nuclear program. There is a chance for a deal. This is the last, best chance to avoid a war. The worst thing that can happen is North Korea try to play Donald Trump.</p><p>BREAM: Well, you have said that the damage from a war with North Korea would be worth it in terms of long-term stability and national security. That scares a lot of people when you say that.</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, I don't want to minimize the damage would be great. Worth it. It's all about bad choices. If there's a war between North Korea and us, South Korea and Japan will get hit, hit hard. Thousands of people could die. That is not lost upon me. But if we allow them to get an ICBM, they can hit America with a nuclear tipped missile. The names of Americans are at risk and he will sell anything he develops. He sold to Syria, he tried to help Iraq. So North Korea proliferates nuclear materials. So you got two bad choices. To me, it is worth it to stop him from getting a big nuclear arsenal because he'll give it or sell it to people who would use it if he would not.</p><p>BREAM: Let's talk about Russia. Interesting because the president took these steps obviously in tandem with a number of European allies to expel a number of Russian personnel, intelligence officers, those kinds of things and response to this poisoning on British soil that Russians are now saying the U.K. did made it look like the Russians did it. I'm no security expert or professional on so I won't comment on that.</p><p>Anyway, a couple of people now stepping up in the mainstream media to praise the president, David Sanger from The New York Times saying this, \"It's getting harder to make the argument that the president has not gotten tough with Putin.\" John Avlon of the Daily Beast saying, \"This is big and it deserves credit.\"</p><p>GRAHAM: He deserves a lot of credit, 60 diplomats/spies. The president mentioned that today. The best thing can happen is to unite the world against Russia's aggression, not just be the United States versus Russia, but the entire world. Look what happened when we decided to expel Russian diplomats and spies, the entire world followed President Trump. The best thing he can do in my view, here at home and abroad, is to tell Putin, I don't want to be your enemy but you're making me be your enemy and if you continue to disrupt the world, invade your neighbor, assassinate people, in foreign countries, then you're going to pay a price.</p><p>If China -- excuse me, if France and Germany would get behind Trump's efforts to change business practices in China, guess what, China would stop cheating if they had to pay a price. Putin would stop disrupting the world if he paid a price. And I can tell you this. Putin will respond to weakness, to aggression, and he will respond to strength by backing off. And President Trump's got a moment in time here to really make Putin pay a price. His economy is the size of Italy.</p><p>BREAM: All right, 15 seconds. You spent 90 minutes with the president today. How did he seem to? Because there's a lot of news swirling around him, much of it not positive.</p><p>GRAHAM: Very, very focused, very upbeat. It feels like he's doing a good job. And we have some historic moments coming in may when North Korea and Iran, tax cuts are working, he wants to try to get a deal on immigration that would include the wall. The President was very upbeat and quite frankly, and I think he's done a very good job as Commander-in-Chief.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Senator Graham, always good to have you with us. Thanks. Well, the Polish government signing off on a huge deal to buy the U.S. patriot missile defense system today for nearly $5 billion. It's the largest arms procurement deal in Poland's history and it's a major step in modernizing their forces which analysts do not sit well with the Kremlin. Well, the U.S. economy looks to be on stable footing. In the final quarter of 2017, marked the third quarter in a row with GDP close to or exceeding three percent. The pace that the Trump administration set as a target.</p><p>Gross domestic product measures the value of every item produced in every service rendered in the U.S. President Trump will visit Northeast Ohio tomorrow afternoon to present his proposed $1.5-trillion program to rebuild some of the country's aging infrastructure. Some economists argue the infrastructure will not add to the U.S. economy. The White House Council of Economic Advisors says the plan would give a significant boost to the GDP over the next ten years adding up to 400,000 new jobs.</p><p>Well, they're calling it a boomerang effect. What began as surveillance of a Trump campaign turning into an investigation of the alleged FISA abuse by the FBI under the Obama administration. What it all means for the special counsel probe, next. Plus new developments tonight on a breaking story. A new Trump administration proposal aimed at making sure immigrants don't become dependent on government benefits if they want to attain legal status, lots doesn't like it. Also on tap, from marching for our lives to marching for life. Now another group of students is trying to organize a nationwide school walkout. But will it get some the same kind of support.</p><p>BREAM: After being criticized by conservatives for signing a $1.5 trillion spending package last week, well just a small fraction of the border wall funding the White House wanted President Trump is touting its construction on Twitter. The President tweeting photos of portion of the wall being built, adding, great briefing this afternoon on the start of our southern border wall. It comes following are report that the Trump administration is seeking to restrict legal status for immigrants who rely on tax credits and other government welfare programs. Let's talk about with tonight's panel. Radio host Ethan Bearman, Fox News Contributor Lisa Boothe, and The Federalists Mollie Hemingway, also a Fox News Contributor. Good to see all of you tonight.</p><p>LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Shannon.</p><p>ETHAN BEARMAN, RADIO HOST: Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. To tell you a little bit more about this. This is what the DHS spokeswoman said. Now, this is their proposal, apparently they say nothing is finalized yet. But once it is approved, it will be released, they will have a comment period the whole nine yards. This is what she said in a statement. The administration is committed to enforcing existing immigration law which is clearly intended to protect the American taxpayer by ensuring that foreign national seeking to enter or remain in the U.S. are self-sufficient. Now, Mollie, the left says, this is an attack on people who have come here illegally and want to gain legal status that -- and it may need some financial help along the way.</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: This really gets to the heart of the debate about what type of immigration policy you should have. There are some people who think it should be pretty random and lottery based. And then there are people who are pushing for a move to the more Australian or Canadian style where self-sufficiency does play a role. Now, it doesn't play a role for people who have special needs or our refugee status or particular persecution. But in general, a lot of immigration that comes into this country -- a lot of the immigrants that come into this country, American citizens are looking for people who can be self-sufficient and can contribute to the economy. And a lot of immigrants do. But this is one of the tests to make sure that this is working out for current American citizens as well.</p><p>BREAM: Well, in reacting to this, the statement from DNC Chair Tom Perez says this, it's another heartless attack on immigrants. Donald Trump should spend less time finding ways to punish hardworking families and more time standing up to the values of inclusion and opportunity that make America great. Your response, Lisa?</p><p>BOOTHE: Well, I think Mollie is absolutely right. This is consistent with what we have seen from this White House particularly on legal immigration on the race act as well that President Trump endorse, it was introduced by Senator Cohn and Perdue that looks at what Mollie discussed was a merit- based immigration approach and something that President Trump pushed for as well when he laid out what he would ideally like to see Congress passed and address on the DACA issue. You know, also, so I think this is very consistent with what we have seen from President Trump wanting to bring people into this country that would benefit more economically, maybe not take as much public assistance and, you know, it would bring some sort of skill set to the workforce.</p><p>BREAM: Ethan, the DHS says too, this is about making sure that U.S. taxpayers are treated fairly because ultimately there is a price tag for some of these benefits. What say you?</p><p>BEARMAN: Well, of course we want U.S. taxpayers to be treated fairly. But the 1996 Welfare Act and Immigration Act of 1996 already addressed this issue. So this is just a very marginal number of people, immigrants -- illegal immigrants already over abundantly contribute to our economy. There are greater number of small business owners that are native-born. They actually work at a higher percentage than native-borns. And they are higher education levels, they actually earn more than native-born Americans. So this is just meat to the base because it is such a tiny percentage of people that we are even talking about. It's not billions of dollars that are being abused or wasted right now.</p><p>BREAM: OK. I want to make sure that this next topic I get all three of you in. So if you keep you answers relatively brief. Ethan, I'll start with you and we'll work back. Today the inspector general of the DOJ says he's going to look into these allegations about whether the FISA warrant system was abused, whether the DOJ and FBI under the Obama administration was fair and complied with the law.</p><p>BEARMAN: Yes. I think any time that there is an objective investigation by an -- objective investor -- excuse me, inspector general, that's something that we all need. We need to know that the process works. However, in this case it sure seems to be a right-wing move that seems to think of the deep state is so embedded that the FBI is not able to function. Yes. We have a couple of bad apples who were caught red-handed and were removed from the process. But really, I mean, we have the new Manafort connection to the Russian intelligence and that's not what we're talking about.</p><p>BREAM: Lisa?</p><p>BOOTHE: There are also bad actors that were in part helping to lead these investigations, that's where the concern boils down to. But I do think to Ethan's point, Michael Horowitz is going to be deemed as a more objective investigator in this term. However he doesn't have the prosecutorial authority which is why, you know, people like Chairman Gowdy, also members of the Senate calling for a second special counsel.</p><p>BREAM: Uh-hmm. Mollie the top Democrat on this judiciary committee says this is a conspiracy theory that's been debunked, it's a waste of time and money.</p><p>HEMMINGWAY: Well, in the last year, you've had Congressional committees on both sides of, you know, the senate and the House looking into Russian meddling, you've had t he inspector general looking into Hillary Clinton e- mail probe. And what everybody has found is some violation of processes and serious problems at the department of Justice and FBI. You've already had at least six, seven, eight people who were fired, demoted, moved around because of these problems. And you have very serious issues with FISA abuse. So these are secret courts, it's incumbent upon our government to make sure that we are -- we are handling the surveillance authority well. And we do need to restore the credibility of our Federal Law Enforcement. This I.G. is a good step, it's a small step though because they can't -- the I.G. can't compel testimony from people who have left FBI or DOJ. And it also doesn't deal with the problems that we found at state, CIA and other agencies as well. So, we'll probably still need a special prosecutor just so everyone can trust the FBI and DOJ.</p><p>BREAM: Yes. The calls for those continue. All right. Panel, you were fabulous. We want you to come back. So stick around, we've got some more hot topics for you in just a minute. Thank you, guys. Meanwhile, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is reportedly the richest man in the world but his network took a serious tumble today all because he's reportedly made one very powerful enemy. Plus the news stories are so unbelievable, we have to remind you they are actually legit. The real news roundup coming up.</p><p>BREAM: In the wake of anti-gun student walkout, the California teacher was suspended for asking whether pro-life protesters could do the same thing. She wound up suspended, now, one of her students is fighting back. Trace Gallagher, has all the details from the West Coast. Hey, Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Shannon. The nationwide pro- life walkout is specifically meant to imitate the recent gun violence protest except the goal this time is to shine a bright light on the lives destroyed by abortion. The event will also test if there's a double standard when it comes to allowing students to protest things that take lives.</p><p>The walkout is being organized by 17 year old, Brandon Gillespie, he is a junior at Rocklin High School outside of Sacramento. Gillespie, says he wants to honor the lives of aborted babies, raise awareness of what he calls the injustices of Planned Parenthood, and to protest the suspension of his history teacher, Julianne Benzel, who was placed on leave when she brought up the double standard. Here is the teacher.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIANNE BENZEL, TEACHER, ROCKLIN HIGH SCHOOL, CALIFORNIA: I open up the discussion for -- if schools, not only just our school and our administration but across the country are going to allow one group of students to get up during class --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>BENZEL: -- and walkout to protest one issue, --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>BENZEL: -- would they still give the same courtesy to another group of students who wanted to get up and walk out to protest? And I use the example of abortion --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Ms. Benzel, who's back teaching now says the upcoming pro-life walkout will literally answer the double standard question. The event is now set for April 11th, and the students are asking for the very same 17 minutes given to students who protested gun violence. It remains unclear how schools across the country will respond.</p><p>Meantime, we're getting a better idea of exactly, who participated in the March for Our Lives against gun violence. And it -- apparently, it wasn't mostly young people. A sociology professor at the University of Maryland and her six-person research team randomly surveyed hundreds of people who joined in the march and found 70 percent were women and quoting, \"Only about 10 percent of the participants were under 18. The average age of the adults in the crowd was just under 49 years old.\"</p><p>She also says 27 percent of the participants had never protested before and most of the new protesters were not motivated by gun-control but rather, by issues of peace, and of President Trump. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right, Trace. Very interesting details, thank you. Well, tonight, the ACLU is urging Greyhound not to let ICE agents search its buses for illegal immigrants without a warrant.</p><p>Meanwhile, the ACLU's efforts against law enforcement may have had some perhaps unintended consequences. Researchers are blaming tougher rules on police officers for Chicago's huge spike in homicides. They're calling at the ACLU effect, the ACLU calling it junk science. Senior Correspondent Mike Tobin takes a look at the evidence from Chicago tonight.</p><p>MICHAEL TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: The ACLU is to blame for Chicago's 2016 increase in violent crime, that according to a new study from the University of Utah.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAUL CASSELL, LAW PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH: We have a collection of data that come together to make it clear that causation exists here.</p><p>TOBIN: The study concludes burdens placed on the city's police force have taken their toll. Street protest erupted in 2015, in response to a video of black teenager Laquan McDonald, being shot 16 times by a Chicago police officer.</p><p>In the aftermath, the ACLU in Chicago police reach an agreement to address accusations of racial profiling. Police officers were required to fill out elaborate cards after stop and frisk. Researcher say the form with 70 entries take 15 to 20 minutes to complete. As a result, stops dropped by 82 percent in 2016. Homicides jumped by 58 percent, and Chicago endured an additional 1100 gun crimes.</p><p>The study examined other factors, from anger on the street to the opioid epidemic. However, it concluded that the ACLU effect is the anomaly and cops are discouraged from checking suspicious people for weapons.</p><p>CASSELL: Criminals on the streets of Chicago became emboldened to carry guns, and deterrent effect decreased. And when there were more guns on the street being carried by criminals, the predictable result is an increase in gun-related crimes.</p><p>TOBIN: The spike in bloodshed is undeniable. That and enhanced scrutiny of a police frequently gets attention from the president.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What the hell is going on in Chicago?</p><p>TOBIN: An ACLU lawyer says you can't just look at the chronology and blame the contact cards.</p><p>KAREN SHELEY, ATTORNEY, AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION, ILLINOIS: Its junk science, it makes claims that the math that it uses control that one thing caused another.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOBIN: The ACLU also claims that most of the entries on the contact cards are required by the Chicago P.D., not their organization. And representatives challenge the objectivity of the researchers who also authored a study in 2017, reaching the conclusion that Miranda requirements reduce police effectiveness. Shannon, back to you.</p><p>BREAM: Time for a quick \"ROUNDUP OF THE REAL NEWS\" out there. The way is often derided by the mainstream media for being weak on Russia or even colluding with President Vladimir Putin, to influence the 2016 election, The New York Times is actually crediting President Trump with getting tough on Russia, after expelling 60 Russian diplomats earlier this week. David Sanger is the great lady chief Washington correspondent.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID SANGER, CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: He is getting a harder to make the argument that the president has not got in tough with Putin. This is certainly a tougher move, for example, than President Obama took when he expelled 30 some odd diplomats after the election issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: President Trump, also getting tough on portraits of government officials. One of three bills signed into law yesterday, the Eliminating Government-funded Oil-painting Act bars the use of taxpayer funds for portraits of federal workers. Like former EPA administrator Lisa Jackson, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and more. Some of these portraits cost taxpayers $40,000 each.</p><p>Well, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania High School has a rifle team with equipment more than 40 years old. That's not the only problem facing the Mountaineers, the school board if they are voted Monday night to reject a $5,000 grant from the National Rifle Association meant to help them buy new gear and guns.</p><p>So, the team put together a Go-Fund Me site with an appeal for help that says, \"Let's put our political ideology aside and come together as a community in support of our rifle team.\" Well, tonight, they've nearly doubled their original goal after about a dozen local businesses got together and decided to help fund the team.</p><p>Well, classic '90s T.V. show made its much-anticipated return last night, but, is Roseanne really representing Trump voters? Tonight's panel returns for what is sure to be a lively debate.</p><p>BREAM: It's a scene that's all too familiar too many American families that divide over the 2016 election. ABC showed us by reviving \"Roseanne\" after a 20 year high at us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURIE METCALF, AS JACKIE HARRIS IN A SITCOM, ROSEANNE: How could you have voted for him, Roseanne?</p><p>ROSEANNE BARR, ACTRESS, COMEDIAN: He talked about jobs, Jackie. He said he'd shake things up. I mean, this might come as a (INAUDIBLE) shock to you but we almost lost our house the way things are going.</p><p>METCALF: Have you looked at the news? Because now things are worse.</p><p>BARR: Not on the real news.</p><p>METCALF: Oh, police!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: \"Roseanne's\" debut scoring massive ratings in American cities like New York, but also all across the middle of America, dominating in States where President Trump won. Like Ohio, there is a debate about exactly why. So let's talk about it with our panel tonight. I thought it was interesting guys, it had monster ratings but not everybody agreed it was necessarily a good thing for conservatives because Roseanne's character supports Trump.</p><p>Ben Shapiro writing this, he said, \"There's something else going on in \"Roseanne\" that should disturb conservatives. The redefinition of Trump supporters as blue-collar leftists rather than conservatives. Roseanne's character is pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion, feminist, and pro- transgenderism. And the implication is that she's a good person because of these views, but the real difference between Trump voters and Hillary voters are economic in nature, not cultural.\" Lisa, what do you make of that?</p><p>BOOTHE: I don't want to get an argument with Ben Shapiro because he's a pretty smart guy there, but I also think that -- look, if you try to look at the Trump coalition, it's sort of a hodgepodge of individuals in this country. So, I think you certainly have people like Roseanne Barr, who's a Trump supporter.</p><p>Herself, in real life, also an executive producer of this show that -- you know, maybe a little bit more socially liberal but voted on him for the economic issues alone. But I also think you additionally have people that went for President Trump because of these cultural words. Again, President Trump sort of had this broad, hodgepodge of a coalition. So, I see his point, I think it's a smart point, but I don't necessarily a 100 percent agree with the point he is making.</p><p>BREAM: Ethan, what do you make of those monster ratings last night?</p><p>BEARMAN: Well, I say congratulations to the show. The cast, I think they did a great job. I'm not necessarily the biggest fan but I'm going to tell you something, Ben Shapiro, is totally wrong on this one. It's about love, it's not about hate, and that's what Roseanne is preaching here and what she's been doing for many, many years.</p><p>She led the way both the advocate and out have come out in support of Roseanne, not just the show -- I think, but the show 24 years ago -- almost 24 years ago was a groundbreaker in terms of the first kiss between two women on T.V. So, that's a big deal for a lot of people because especially in light of what the president has been doing with some of the anti-LGBT moves, Roseanne, shows that you can love and support Trump at the same time, well, the LGBT.</p><p>BREAM: OK, and I think that's Ben's concern is that it portrays Trump voters is being ones who care about the economy but not these cultural issues. He doesn't think that's the case, but -- you know, we'll see. We love having Ben on, to maybe we can talk about this.</p><p>All right, I want to make sure we get to our second topic. We'll start with you, Mollie. A young student out in California says he's going to do a pro-life walkout, April 11th, I believe is the time a date for that. He wants to test a couple of things. He says this, he says, \"Along with being a movement commemorating the millions of children who fell victim to abortion, the movement is one that stands for all students' rights to freedom of speech and assembly.\"</p><p>He says, he wants to test this theory about whether it will get the same kind of support that the anti-gun rally has did.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well, it's interesting that the study came out showing that the people at this weekends' march, the average age was 50, and there weren't that many children there. If you go to the March for Life which is held annually in D.C., and also in state capitals and other cities throughout the country, you are blown away by how many young people are there, high school students and even younger. This is an issue of ending the destruction of human life in the womb and violence in the womb and how that hurts women and their children is an issue that young people care deeply about. And it is something that the media have not done a very good job covering. And I think it's a really interesting question to ask, whether schools will be supportive of this as they were actively colluding and trying to push this anti-gun rights march that they did.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, and Ethan, this student directly was a student of the teacher got suspended out in California for asking this and having this conversation in her class. Do you think the two topics will be treated the same? What do you of this plan?</p><p>BEARMAN: I mean, I always support people to exercise their First Amendment rights, but there is a significant difference between an already existing march for life and pro -- anti-abortion rally that goes on and a reaction by a lot of people. By the way, I was at the march for our lives with my two small children, well under the age of 50, and my kids are way under the age of 50. So I think we saw a lot of young people there. I don't -- that study was somewhat non-scientific in D.C. only. But the point is this, the kids in Parkland and around the country are worried about the violence that took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Abortions are not happening in high school classrooms so these are different topics and there are separate marches for that.</p><p>BREAM: We got to leave it there because we're out of time. But thank you all, Ethan, Lisa and Mollie, we'll watch April 11th and we'll see what happens.</p><p>HEMMINGWAY: Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BEARMAN: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: Thank you, guys. All right, Facebook under fire, Amazon stocks plummeting as a third news technology company raises eyebrows with a controversial appointment with board of directors breaking down the tech headlines next.</p><p>BREAM: Amazon chair slumping after Axios reported that President Trump believes the e-commerce giant is making life harder for small businesses and is reportedly considering legal means to change that. Joining me now from Los Angeles, Steve Hilton, Host of the \"NEXT REVOLUTION\" on Sunday nights right here on Fox, also, the Co-Founder and CEO of a tech company himself and Axios Reporter Alayna Treene. Great to have both of you with us tonight.</p><p>ALAYNA TREENE, REPORTER, AXIOS: Great to have be here.</p><p>BREAM: Steve, there's been a lot of hostility in recent weeks against a lot of the big tech companies. Is it paying to specific stories do you think were there's a broader backlash?</p><p>STEVE HILTON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: It's a broader backlash, Shannon. In many ways, I think it's really helpful that it's happening because it's shining a spotlight on something really important, which is that these tech companies have just got too big and too powerful and it mirrors something that is happening in the economy generally where you got a concentration of power, of economic power and that's always bad news. It's bad news when it happens in government when you get a concentration of power in Washington. That's why I believe in decentralizing power from the federal government to the states and to communities. But the same thing needs happen in the economy too. We actually need to really toughen up the antitrust laws and start breaking up these companies, not just tech, throughout the economy, to get more competition into the marketplace.</p><p>BREAM: OK, and Alayna, to that point, the President apparently, the reporting from your outlet, Axios is that he'd to possibly take some steps against Amazon, thinking it's hurting brick-and-mortar stores, retailers, shopping malls, people in real estate, which is a business where he has a lot of friends, the quote is, \"the tech behemoth Trump wants to go after is Amazon according to five sources who has discussed it with him. He's obsessed with Amazon, a source said, \"obsessed.\" Alayna?</p><p>TREENE: Well, it's definitely interesting to see and that's exactly what the reporting shows. And really, what we're seeing is the President, he is a 1950s man. He's a businessman before he was President. He kind of is nostalgic for the days that it used to be and he's starting to see -- talking to Steve's point, he thinks that there's a lot of power in the hands of these tech companies, and Amazon in particular for its e-commerce aspect of that and what it's doing to mom-and-pop stores and other retailers that he sees it as a big threat to some of those smaller businesses. And so, he's looking at perhaps taking some action. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said today that there is nothing in the works right now but from what the sources have told Axios is that he really is looking at anti -- maybe anti-trust regulations or some other tax treatment that they might be abusing.</p><p>BREAM: And another tech company that's revolutionized the way we get entertainment, Netflix has announced Susan Rice, former Ambassador and former NSA under the Obama Administration is going to join their board. I want to get a quick reaction for both of you. Steve, first to you.</p><p>HILTON: I think you know, there's nothing that -- not to be upset about except the fact that it is so typical, isn't it? People who serve in government and then they basically cash in on their public service and they get who burned up by these big companies and stock on their board. It's happened forever, it's part of the swamp. That is the real story here rather than the politics of Netflix. It's all about the swamp. This is how they work.</p><p>BREAM: And Alayna, you know, there's been backlash and threats of a boycott because of the Ambassador's role in the Benghazi fiasco. How do you think that plays out?</p><p>TREENE: Well, a lot of people have been taking on to Twitter and other forms of social media to say that they're going to boycott Netflix for putting Susan Rice on the board. And we saw similar things happen when there was buzz that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama might also have a Netflix series on Netflix. And so a lot of people believed, just like Steve's point, as he was saying it's the swamp coming to these big media outlets and a lot of people don't like that crossover from the political world in Washington into some of the more tech companies and media companies that they see as their entertainment and ways of escaping all of that.</p><p>BREAM: Well, a tough day for many in the tech companies. A tough week in the markets. We'll see how they fare tomorrow with the next news cycle. Steve and Alayna, great to have both of you with us tonight. Thanks.</p><p>TREENE: Thank you.</p><p>HILTON: Thanks, Shannon. See you soon.</p><p>BREAM: OK, so many of you who have reached out in the last few days after I put out a Twitter plea for a young boy he was very ill and had one last wish. So we've got an update for you right after the break.</p><p>BREAM: I want to close tonight by updating you about young Emilio who is dying wish was to get a message of one of the Avengers. I launched a Twitter campaign after getting the request from Emilio's uncle whom I've met on a plane weeks ago. Thanks to your tens of thousands of retweets, and the kindness of many strangers in three short days, videos personalized for Emilio poured in from multiple Avengers and other superheroes. Today one of them was set to call him at the hospital, but the 11-year-old cancer fighter did not make it. Emilio's family started a foundation to help others facing the same struggles that they have. Emilio also wrote a book last year, and all the proceeds will help fund the foundation.</p><p>If you want to help, just go to genesfoundation -- that's G-E-N-E-S foundation.com. And please remember this. Emilio proved that social media can be actually an enormous force for good and that there is plenty of kindness in the world. Strangers will often care and have compassion even when it will benefit them in no way. We've seen that over and over since Sunday. So thanks all of you who made that happen. Tonight, most-watched, most trusted, and most grateful you spent the evening with us. Good night from Washington. I'm Shannon Bream.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018032801cb259</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S06-3MK1-DXH2-63R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7692\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 28, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERATION OF AMERICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Political</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Investigation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Firing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Meetings</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>White House Council of Economic Advisors</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>GDP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FBI</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DHS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tom Perez</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DACA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DOJ</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>California</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Brandon Gillespie</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Rocklin High School</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Planned Parenthood</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Julianne Benzel</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>March for Our Lives</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>President Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ACLU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Laquan McDonald</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chicago</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>oil-painting Act</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania High School</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Go-Fund Me</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Roseanne</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ben Shapiro</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Military &amp;

He spent the day with the president.   So he's going to fill us in on that, Laura.  Thank you very much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> All right.  Let's get you caught up now on three breaking stories tonight.   The inspector general at the justice department is starting an  investigation into what Republicans contend is bias at the DOJ and FBI and  the Russia collision investigation and those FISA warrants.  We're also  learning this evening that President Trump has fired his Veteran Affairs  secretary, Dr. David Shulkin.  Senior North and South Korean officials are  just launching high-level talks to set up a planned summit in April with  President Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Team coverage tonight, Lucas Tomlinson standing by at the Pentagon with why  Dr. Shulkin was let's go.  And who's replacing him.  Leland Vittert  tracking the diplomatic moves on the Korean Peninsula.  But we begin  tonight with chief national correspondent, Ed Henry following the new  pressure on the FBI.  Good evening, Ed.</p><p> ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Shannon, great to see  you.  Democrats initially laughed off these allegations about FISA abuse  but there may be some people in the Obama inner circle tonight that are  starting to sweat, not to mention former top FBI officials who were  supposed to be nonpolitical, like James Comey and Andrew McCabe, who will  now be facing even more scrutiny from the justice department inspector  general, Michael Horowitz.</p><p> Remember, Attorney General Jeff Sessions weeks ago said he wanted Horowitz  to handle this and got more heat from supporters of President Trump who  said, well, the inspector general is going to bury this.  Sessions had  passed the buck once again.  But this, tonight, is a sign maybe Horowitz  moving full speed ahead on what Republican Devin Nunes first brought to the  nation's attention with that Republican memo laying out how top FBI and  justice department officials in the Obama administration got a warrant in  2016 from the secretive FISA court to spy on former Trump advisor Carter  Page.  Most importantly, Comey, McCabe and other top officials used  information from former British spy, Christopher Steele's anti-Trump  dossier to get that warrant without disclosing to the judge that in fact  the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign had paid for that dirt.</p><p> Horowitz declaring in a statement tonight, \"As part of this examination,  the office of inspector general will review information that was known to  the DOJ and FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an  alleged FBI confidential source, that being Steele.  Additionally, the  inspector general will review the DOJ and FBI relationship, communications  with the alleged source as they relate to FISA applications.  If  circumstances warrant, the inspector general will consider, including other  issues that may arise during the course of the review.\"</p><p> That suggest its wide open could go into a whole bunch of issues.  And in  fact, House intelligence committee chair, Devin Nunes tonight was on with  \"HANNITY\" when he called out Democrats.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  Well, now, this is effectively  boomeranged on them.  You have at least, I think half of the American  people now know that the other party, the Democrats, appear like they  weaponized to some degree, the intelligence services.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HENRY:  House judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte is another republican  probing the FISA abuse.  He has issued a subpoena for more documents on the  FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe.  Well, Democrat Jerry  Nadler is declaring that that's a problem.  \"It seems that the subpoena is  intended to speed up that production of documents to pivot the discussion  back to Hillary Clinton and divert attention from the chaos surrounding the  Trump administration and allegations involving the Trump campaign.\"  Well, there were new allegations today in The New York Times that former  Trump personal attorney, John Dowd discussed the possibility of pardons  with lawyers for Paul Manafort and retired general, Michael Flynn.  Ty  Cobb, another attorney for the president inside the White House, put out a  statement saying, I have only been asked about pardons by the press and  have routinely responded on the record that no pardons are under discussion  or even under consideration at the White House.</p><p> Either way the president's power to pardon is broad.  Discussions would not  necessarily be improper.  The question tonight is whether it becomes part  of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into potential obstruction of  justice.  Shannon.</p><p> BREAM:  Ed Henry with the very latest.  Thank you so much.  We're going to  talk about it with the panel, coming up.</p><p> In the meantime, President Trump making big news at the White House tonight  as his doctor and navy admiral was nominated to take over at the V.A.  The  two have worked in close proximity at the White House, effectively firing  now Secretary David Shulkin.  Lucas Tomlinson has the story for us tonight.   Lucas.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  For the second time in two weeks,  President Trump fired a member of his cabinet, this time acting V.A.  secretary Dr. David Shulkin, an Obama holdover, after calls for his removal  over an epic scandal boiled over.  Last month, the VA watchdogs said  Shulkin improperly accepted Wimbledon tickets and his former chief of staff  doctored e-mails to justify his wife traveling to Europe with him at tax  bear expense.</p><p> The inspector general is currently investigating whether his security deal  detail was made to deliver furniture from Home Depot to Shulkin's home.   President Trump has nominated White House Dr. Ronny Jackson to replace the  Shulkin, a navy rear admiral, a surprise choice to lead the government's  second largest department.  He has served as White House physician over the  past three administrations.  Recently, Jackson has been criticized by some  after giving a glowing report on the president's health.</p><p> RONNY JACKSON, NOMINATED AS THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS  AFFAIRS:  Some people have just great genes.  I told the president that if  he had a healthier dot over the last 20 years, he might have could love to  be 200 years old.</p><p> SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  The president has heart  disease.  Those numbers qualify him for having heart disease.  It clearly  needs a plan to and prevent some sort of heart problem down the road.</p><p> TOMLINSON:  In a statement, President Trump said Admiral Jackson is highly  trained and qualified.  One of the first GOP lawmakers to call for  Shulkin's ouster applauded the move.  Dr. Shulkin came from within the V.A.  and did nothing to clean up the culture of bureaucratic incompetence that  has defined the leadership at the V.A.  I'm absolutely convinced that only  someone from outside the V.A. can clean up the V.A.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> The president named Robert Wilkie, the Pentagon's undersecretary of defense  for personal and readiness, to serve as the acting V.A. secretary until  Admiral Jackson is confirmed.  But expect Senate Democrats to put up a  fight.  Shannon?</p><p> BREAM:  All right.  Lucas Tomlinson from the Pentagon.  Thank you.</p><p> Kim Jong-un's secretive meeting with Chinese President, Xi Jinping, has  left many in the U.S. wondering what will happen next.  And what it could  mean for a future meeting with President Trump.</p><p> Leland Vittert joins us live with more on that.  Hey, Leland.</p><p> LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Shannon.  Lots of  news but very few answers to the core questions here.  When and where does  the Trump-Kim summit take place, what are the ground rules, and what does  the North Koreans really want for their nukes?  One thing is sure.  The  Chinese made it clear with this visit that they play front and center role  when it comes to dealing with the Kim regime.  The president paid respect  to his Chinese counterpart to that effect today tweeting, \"Received a  message last night from Xi Jinping of China that his meeting with Kim Jong- un went very well and that Kim looks forward to his meeting with me.  In  the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be  maintained at all cost.\"</p><p> Despite their freeze on missile and nuclear test, the North Koreans appear  to be moving forward at all costs and it breakneck speed with their nuclear  program.  New photo show another reactor, the north claims it's for  peaceful electricity generation.  But intelligence reports it is also  capable of throwing off highly and rich plutonium for more bombs.  If the  White House or U.S. intelligence community knew about the Chinese summit,  they didn't say anything, nor did they seem particularly surprised.  The  Chinese official state media reiterated the offer by Kim Jong-un of a face- to-face with President Trump.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Certainly, we're  going to be cautiously optimistic, but we feel like things are moving in  the right direction, and that the meeting yesterday was a good indication  that the maximum pressure campaign has been working.  You saw him leave for  the first time since becoming the leader of North Korea, leaving his  country for the first time for that meeting.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VITTERT:  Speaking of leaving, Kim Jong-un used his private luxury train to  make the journey to Beijing, a flight that normally takes two hours,  evidently Kim doesn't like to fly and showed off the train, as you can see  to the Chinese media.  So we were turned to when and where a meeting could  take place, if the president is going to show up.  It's highly unlikely it  will be a surprise and if Kim will only travel by a train that moves at a  reported 40 miles an hour, fair to say, Shannon, it greatly limits the  options for locations.</p><p> BREAM:  To one continent. It looks like.  All right.  Leland, thank you  very much.</p><p> Kim's surprise summit with Chinese president Xi Jinping this week was the  first time he traveled outside of his country since he assumed power in  2011.  That's according to his own state media.  But Beijing is just the  start.  Next, is a meeting just south of the DMZ with South Korean  president Moon Jae-in.  Then potentially with President Trump and as yet  undisclosed location.  He's also rumored to be considering a sit down with  Russia's Vladimir Putin, while one of its staunchest critics, Japanese  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he's ready for a meeting too.  So, what is  drawing him out of Hermit Kingdom all of a sudden?</p><p> Let's talk about it with Republican senator from South Carolina, Lindsey  Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  Great to have you  with us, Senator.</p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  That is a stunning overview.  If  you told me a year ago that the North Korean leader would be meeting with  President Trump, potentially the Russians and the Japanese, I wouldn't  believe it, and hats off to President Trump and his team for making this a  reality.  Maximum pressure has worked.</p><p> BREAM:  Let's talk first about China, because I read an account today that  said for six years, he's been pushing China to have an official meeting  with him.  They weren't really interested, it never happened, they held him  at arm's length.  As soon as it's becoming apparent that he's going to meet  with President Trump, China says, hey, come for a visit.  They obviously  have different interests in the region than we do.  There are some similar  but there are some differences.</p><p> Yun Sun writing a piece in 38 North, says that \"Beijing is concerned with  any concessions that North Korea might make toward the U.S. in exchange for  U.S. security guarantee or settlement that could lead to the unification of  the Korean Peninsula by absorption and the emergence of a unified Korea as  an American military ally on China's border.\"</p><p> GRAHAM:  I think that's a pretty good analysis of what they fear.  Now,  here's what they hope.  They hope that North Korea will stop being a pain  in the rear for them.  The North Korean nuclear program destabilizes the  entire world.  I hope that Kim Jong-un was told by the Chinese president,  we stand with America.  You need to give up your nukes.  I would tell the  Chinese, our goal is not to reunify South Korea and North Korea.  Our goal  is to make sure that North Korea gives up their nuclear weapons to protect  the American homeland and the world at large.  Help us there.</p><p> BREAM:  Do you think it will though?  Because the messages were relayed  after their meetings that they're open to denuclearizing the peninsula,  there are plenty of skeptics who aren't buying that or wonder what kind of  agreement we can get with North Korea as far as rigorous, legitimate  inspection.</p><p> GRAHAM:  Well, one, we've seen this movie before.  In 1994, they gave up  their nuclear program for food.  They took the food and they kept their  nukes.  The one thing I would tell China and North Korea, the worst mistake  you could make is meet with President Trump personally, have a discussion  about what to do, and try to play him.  If that happens, that's the end of  North Korea.</p><p> I met with the president today.  He doesn't want a war.  He's hopeful that  this can resolve in ending the North Korea and nuclear threat, stabilizing  that part of the world.  And I think he's ready to go big.  The Korean War  is still -- it's never been ended.</p><p> BREAM:  Technically.</p><p> GRAHAM:  What I would like to see happen is a peace treaty between South  Korea and North Korea, China, and the United States.  North Korea give up  their weapons.  Japan doesn't have them.  South Korea doesn't have them.   We'll give them an insurance that we're not going to invade North Korea.   We're going to tell the Chinese we're not trying to unify the Korean  Peninsula, but we are insisting that Kim Jong-un give up his nuclear  program.  There is a chance for a deal.  This is the last, best chance to  avoid a war.  The worst thing that can happen is North Korea try to play  Donald Trump.</p><p> BREAM:  Well, you have said that the damage from a war with North Korea  would be worth it in terms of long-term stability and national security.   That scares a lot of people when you say that.</p><p> GRAHAM:  Well, I don't want to minimize the damage would be great.  Worth  it.  It's all about bad choices.  If there's a war between North Korea and  us, South Korea and Japan will get hit, hit hard.  Thousands of people  could die.  That is not lost upon me.  But if we allow them to get an ICBM,  they can hit America with a nuclear tipped missile.  The names of Americans  are at risk and he will sell anything he develops.  He sold to Syria, he  tried to help Iraq.  So North Korea proliferates nuclear materials.  So you  got two bad choices.  To me, it is worth it to stop him from getting a big  nuclear arsenal because he'll give it or sell it to people who would use it  if he would not.</p><p> BREAM:  Let's talk about Russia.  Interesting because the president took  these steps obviously in tandem with a number of European allies to expel a  number of Russian personnel, intelligence officers, those kinds of things  and response to this poisoning on British soil that Russians are now saying  the U.K. did made it look like the Russians did it.  I'm no security expert  or professional on so I won't comment on that.</p><p> Anyway, a couple of people now stepping up in the mainstream media to  praise the president, David Sanger from The New York Times saying this,  \"It's getting harder to make the argument that the president has not gotten  tough with Putin.\"  John Avlon of the Daily Beast saying, \"This is big and  it deserves credit.\"</p><p> GRAHAM:  He deserves a lot of credit, 60 diplomats/spies.  The president  mentioned that today.  The best thing can happen is to unite the world  against Russia's aggression, not just be the United States versus Russia,  but the entire world.  Look what happened when we decided to expel Russian  diplomats and spies, the entire world followed President Trump.  The best  thing he can do in my view, here at home and abroad, is to tell Putin, I  don't want to be your enemy but you're making me be your enemy and if you  continue to disrupt the world, invade your neighbor, assassinate people, in  foreign countries, then you're going to pay a price.</p><p> If China -- excuse me, if France and Germany would get behind Trump's  efforts to change business practices in China, guess what, China would stop  cheating if they had to pay a price.  Putin would stop disrupting the world  if he paid a price.  And I can tell you this.  Putin will respond to  weakness, to aggression, and he will respond to strength by backing off.   And President Trump's got a moment in time here to really make Putin pay a  price.  His economy is the size of Italy.</p><p> BREAM:  All right, 15 seconds.  You spent 90 minutes with the president  today.  How did he seem to?  Because there's a lot of news swirling around  him, much of it not positive.</p><p> GRAHAM:  Very, very focused, very upbeat.  It feels like he's doing a good  job.  And we have some historic moments coming in may when North Korea and  Iran, tax cuts are working, he wants to try to get a deal on immigration  that would include the wall.  The President was very upbeat and quite  frankly, and I think he's done a very good job as Commander-in-Chief.  </p><p> BREAM:  All right.  Senator Graham, always good to have you with us.   Thanks.  Well, the Polish government signing off on a huge deal to buy the  U.S. patriot missile defense system today for nearly $5 billion.  It's the  largest arms procurement deal in Poland's history and it's a major step in  modernizing their forces which analysts do not sit well with the Kremlin.   Well, the U.S. economy looks to be on stable footing.  In the final quarter  of 2017, marked the third quarter in a row with GDP close to or exceeding  three percent.  The pace that the Trump administration set as a target.  </p><p> Gross domestic product measures the value of every item produced in every  service rendered in the U.S.  President Trump will visit Northeast Ohio  tomorrow afternoon to present his proposed $1.5-trillion program to rebuild  some of the country's aging infrastructure.  Some economists argue the  infrastructure will not add to the U.S. economy.  The White House Council  of Economic Advisors says the plan would give a significant boost to the  GDP over the next ten years adding up to 400,000 new jobs.</p><p> Well, they're calling it a boomerang effect.  What began as surveillance of  a Trump campaign turning into an investigation of the alleged FISA abuse by  the FBI under the Obama administration.  What it all means for the special  counsel probe, next.  Plus new developments tonight on a breaking story.  A  new Trump administration proposal aimed at making sure immigrants don't  become dependent on government benefits if they want to attain legal  status, lots doesn't like it.  Also on tap, from marching for our lives to  marching for life.  Now another group of students is trying to organize a  nationwide school walkout.  But will it get some the same kind of support.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BREAM:  After being criticized by conservatives for signing a $1.5 trillion  spending package last week, well just a small fraction of the border wall  funding the White House wanted President Trump is touting its construction  on Twitter.  The President tweeting photos of portion of the wall being  built, adding, great briefing this afternoon on the start of our southern  border wall.  It comes following are report that the Trump administration  is seeking to restrict legal status for immigrants who rely on tax credits  and other government welfare programs.  Let's talk about with tonight's  panel.  Radio host Ethan Bearman, Fox News Contributor Lisa Boothe, and The  Federalists Mollie Hemingway, also a Fox News Contributor.  Good to see all  of you tonight.  </p><p> LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, Shannon.  </p><p> ETHAN BEARMAN, RADIO HOST:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p> BREAM:  All right.  To tell you a little bit more about this.  This is what  the DHS spokeswoman said.  Now, this is their proposal, apparently they say  nothing is finalized yet.  But once it is approved, it will be released,  they will have a comment period the whole nine yards.  This is what she  said in a statement.  The administration is committed to enforcing existing  immigration law which is clearly intended to protect the American taxpayer  by ensuring that foreign national seeking to enter or remain in the U.S.  are self-sufficient.  Now, Mollie, the left says, this is an attack on  people who have come here illegally and want to gain legal status that --  and it may need some financial help along the way.</p><p> MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  This really gets to the heart of  the debate about what type of immigration policy you should have.  There  are some people who think it should be pretty random and lottery based.   And then there are people who are pushing for a move to the more Australian  or Canadian style where self-sufficiency does play a role.  Now, it doesn't  play a role for people who have special needs or our refugee status or  particular persecution.  But in general, a lot of immigration that comes  into this country -- a lot of the immigrants that come into this country,  American citizens are looking for people who can be self-sufficient and can  contribute to the economy.  And a lot of immigrants do.  But this is one of  the tests to make sure that this is working out for current American  citizens as well.  </p><p> BREAM:  Well, in reacting to this, the statement from DNC Chair Tom Perez  says this, it's another heartless attack on immigrants.  Donald Trump  should spend less time finding ways to punish hardworking families and more  time standing up to the values of inclusion and opportunity that make  America great.  Your response, Lisa? </p><p> BOOTHE:  Well, I think Mollie is absolutely right.  This is consistent with  what we have seen from this White House particularly on legal immigration  on the race act as well that President Trump endorse, it was introduced by  Senator Cohn and Perdue that looks at what Mollie discussed was a merit- based immigration approach and something that President Trump pushed for as  well when he laid out what he would ideally like to see Congress passed and  address on the DACA issue.  You know, also, so I think this is very  consistent with what we have seen from President Trump wanting to bring  people into this country that would benefit more economically, maybe not  take as much public assistance and, you know, it would bring some sort of  skill set to the workforce.  </p><p> BREAM:  Ethan, the DHS says too, this is about making sure that U.S.  taxpayers are treated fairly because ultimately there is a price tag for  some of these benefits.  What say you?  </p><p> BEARMAN:  Well, of course we want U.S. taxpayers to be treated fairly.  But  the 1996 Welfare Act and Immigration Act of 1996 already addressed this  issue.  So this is just a very marginal number of people, immigrants --  illegal immigrants already over abundantly contribute to our economy.   There are greater number of small business owners that are native-born.   They actually work at a higher percentage than native-borns.  And they are  higher education levels, they actually earn more than native-born  Americans.  So this is just meat to the base because it is such a tiny  percentage of people that we are even talking about.  It's not billions of  dollars that are being abused or wasted right now.  </p><p> BREAM:  OK.  I want to make sure that this next topic I get all three of  you in.  So if you keep you answers relatively brief.  Ethan, I'll start  with you and we'll work back.  Today the inspector general of the DOJ says  he's going to look into these allegations about whether the FISA warrant  system was abused, whether the DOJ and FBI under the Obama administration  was fair and complied with the law.  </p><p> BEARMAN:  Yes.  I think any time that there is an objective investigation  by an -- objective investor -- excuse me, inspector general, that's  something that we all need.  We need to know that the process works.   However, in this case it sure seems to be a right-wing move that seems to  think of the deep state is so embedded that the FBI is not able to  function.  Yes.  We have a couple of bad apples who were caught red-handed  and were removed from the process.  But really, I mean, we have the new  Manafort connection to the Russian intelligence and that's not what we're  talking about.  </p><p> BREAM:  Lisa? </p><p> BOOTHE:  There are also bad actors that were in part helping to lead these  investigations, that's where the concern boils down to.  But I do think to  Ethan's point, Michael Horowitz is going to be deemed as a more objective  investigator in this term.  However he doesn't have the prosecutorial  authority which is why, you know, people like Chairman Gowdy, also members  of the Senate calling for a second special counsel.  </p><p> BREAM:  Uh-hmm.  Mollie the top Democrat on this judiciary committee says  this is a conspiracy theory that's been debunked, it's a waste of time and  money.  </p><p> HEMMINGWAY:  Well, in the last year, you've had Congressional committees on  both sides of, you know, the senate and the House looking into Russian  meddling, you've had t he inspector general looking into Hillary Clinton e- mail probe.  And what everybody has found is some violation of processes  and serious problems at the department of Justice and FBI.  You've already  had at least six, seven, eight people who were fired, demoted, moved around  because of these problems.  And you have very serious issues with FISA  abuse.  So these are secret courts, it's incumbent upon our government to  make sure that we are -- we are handling the surveillance authority well.   And we do need to restore the credibility of our Federal Law Enforcement.   This I.G. is a good step, it's a small step though because they can't --  the I.G. can't compel testimony from people who have left FBI or DOJ.  And  it also doesn't deal with the problems that we found at state, CIA and  other agencies as well.  So, we'll probably still need a special prosecutor  just so everyone can trust the FBI and DOJ.  </p><p> BREAM:  Yes.  The calls for those continue.  All right.  Panel, you were  fabulous.  We want you to come back.  So stick around, we've got some more  hot topics for you in just a minute.  Thank you, guys.  Meanwhile, Amazon  founder Jeff Bezos is reportedly the richest man in the world but his  network took a serious tumble today all because he's reportedly made one  very powerful enemy.  Plus the news stories are so unbelievable, we have to  remind you they are actually legit.  The real news roundup coming up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BREAM:  In the wake of anti-gun student walkout, the California teacher was  suspended for asking whether pro-life protesters could do the same thing.   She wound up suspended, now, one of her students is fighting back.  Trace  Gallagher, has all the details from the West Coast.  Hey, Trace.</p><p> TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Shannon.  The nationwide pro- life walkout is specifically meant to imitate the recent gun violence  protest except the goal this time is to shine a bright light on the lives  destroyed by abortion.  The event will also test if there's a double  standard when it comes to allowing students to protest things that take  lives.</p><p> The walkout is being organized by 17 year old, Brandon Gillespie, he is a  junior at Rocklin High School outside of Sacramento.  Gillespie, says he  wants to honor the lives of aborted babies, raise awareness of what he  calls the injustices of Planned Parenthood, and to protest the suspension  of his history teacher, Julianne Benzel, who was placed on leave when she  brought up the double standard.  Here is the teacher.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JULIANNE BENZEL, TEACHER, ROCKLIN HIGH SCHOOL, CALIFORNIA:  I open up the  discussion for -- if schools, not only just our school and our  administration but across the country are going to allow one group of  students to get up during class -- </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.</p><p> BENZEL:  -- and walkout to protest one issue, -- </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.</p><p> BENZEL:  -- would they still give the same courtesy to another group of  students who wanted to get up and walk out to protest?  And I use the  example of abortion -- </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GALLAGHER:  Ms. Benzel, who's back teaching now says the upcoming pro-life  walkout will literally answer the double standard question.  The event is  now set for April 11th, and the students are asking for the very same 17  minutes given to students who protested gun violence.  It remains unclear  how schools across the country will respond.</p><p> Meantime, we're getting a better idea of exactly, who participated in the  March for Our Lives against gun violence.  And it -- apparently, it wasn't  mostly young people.  A sociology professor at the University of Maryland  and her six-person research team randomly surveyed hundreds of people who  joined in the march and found 70 percent were women and quoting, \"Only  about 10 percent of the participants were under 18.  The average age of the  adults in the crowd was just under 49 years old.\"</p><p> She also says 27 percent of the participants had never protested before and  most of the new protesters were not motivated by gun-control but rather, by  issues of peace, and of President Trump.  Shannon.</p><p> BREAM:  All right, Trace.  Very interesting details, thank you.  Well,  tonight, the ACLU is urging Greyhound not to let ICE agents search its  buses for illegal immigrants without a warrant.</p><p> Meanwhile, the ACLU's efforts against law enforcement may have had some  perhaps unintended consequences.  Researchers are blaming tougher rules on  police officers for Chicago's huge spike in homicides.  They're calling at  the ACLU effect, the ACLU calling it junk science.  Senior Correspondent  Mike Tobin takes a look at the evidence from Chicago tonight.</p><p> MICHAEL TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  The ACLU is to blame for  Chicago's 2016 increase in violent crime, that according to a new study  from the University of Utah.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PAUL CASSELL, LAW PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH:  We have a collection of  data that come together to make it clear that causation exists here.</p><p> TOBIN:  The study concludes burdens placed on the city's police force have  taken their toll.  Street protest erupted in 2015, in response to a video  of black teenager Laquan McDonald, being shot 16 times by a Chicago police  officer.</p><p> In the aftermath, the ACLU in Chicago police reach an agreement to address  accusations of racial profiling.  Police officers were required to fill out  elaborate cards after stop and frisk.  Researcher say the form with 70  entries take 15 to 20 minutes to complete.  As a result, stops dropped by  82 percent in 2016.  Homicides jumped by 58 percent, and Chicago endured an  additional 1100 gun crimes.</p><p> The study examined other factors, from anger on the street to the opioid  epidemic.  However, it concluded that the ACLU effect is the anomaly and  cops are discouraged from checking suspicious people for weapons.</p><p> CASSELL:  Criminals on the streets of Chicago became emboldened to carry  guns, and deterrent effect decreased.  And when there were more guns on the  street being carried by criminals, the predictable result is an increase in  gun-related crimes.</p><p> TOBIN:  The spike in bloodshed is undeniable.  That and enhanced scrutiny  of a police frequently gets attention from the president.</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  What the hell is going on in  Chicago?</p><p> TOBIN:  An ACLU lawyer says you can't just look at the chronology and blame  the contact cards.</p><p>KAREN SHELEY, ATTORNEY, AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION, ILLINOIS:  Its junk  science, it makes claims that the math that it uses control that one thing  caused another.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TOBIN:  The ACLU also claims that most of the entries on the contact cards  are required by the Chicago P.D., not their organization.  And  representatives challenge the objectivity of the researchers who also  authored a study in 2017, reaching the conclusion that Miranda requirements  reduce police effectiveness.  Shannon, back to you.</p><p> BREAM:  Time for a quick \"ROUNDUP OF THE REAL NEWS\" out there.  The way is  often derided by the mainstream media for being weak on Russia or even  colluding with President Vladimir Putin, to influence the 2016 election,  The New York Times is actually crediting President Trump with getting tough  on Russia, after expelling 60 Russian diplomats earlier this week.  David  Sanger is the great lady chief Washington correspondent.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVID SANGER, CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  He is  getting a harder to make the argument that the president has not got in  tough with Putin.  This is certainly a tougher move, for example, than  President Obama took when he expelled 30 some odd diplomats after the  election issues.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM:  President Trump, also getting tough on portraits of government  officials.  One of three bills signed into law yesterday, the Eliminating  Government-funded Oil-painting Act bars the use of taxpayer funds for  portraits of federal workers.  Like former EPA administrator Lisa Jackson,  former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and more.  Some of these  portraits cost taxpayers $40,000 each.</p><p> Well, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania High School has a rifle team with equipment  more than 40 years old.  That's not the only problem facing the  Mountaineers, the school board if they are voted Monday night to reject a  $5,000 grant from the National Rifle Association meant to help them buy new  gear and guns.</p><p> So, the team put together a Go-Fund Me site with an appeal for help that  says, \"Let's put our political ideology aside and come together as a  community in support of our rifle team.\"  Well, tonight, they've nearly  doubled their original goal after about a dozen local businesses got  together and decided to help fund the team.</p><p> Well, classic '90s T.V. show made its much-anticipated return last night,  but, is Roseanne really representing Trump voters?  Tonight's panel returns  for what is sure to be a lively debate.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BREAM:  It's a scene that's all too familiar too many American families  that divide over the 2016 election.  ABC showed us by reviving \"Roseanne\"  after a 20 year high at us.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAURIE METCALF, AS JACKIE HARRIS IN A SITCOM, ROSEANNE:  How could you have  voted for him, Roseanne?</p><p> ROSEANNE BARR, ACTRESS, COMEDIAN:  He talked about jobs, Jackie.  He said  he'd shake things up.  I mean, this might come as a (INAUDIBLE) shock to  you but we almost lost our house the way things are going.</p><p> METCALF:  Have you looked at the news?  Because now things are worse.</p><p> BARR:  Not on the real news.</p><p> METCALF:  Oh, police!</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM:  \"Roseanne's\" debut scoring massive ratings in American cities like  New York, but also all across the middle of America, dominating in States  where President Trump won.  Like Ohio, there is a debate about exactly why.   So let's talk about it with our panel tonight.  I thought it was  interesting guys, it had monster ratings but not everybody agreed it was  necessarily a good thing for conservatives because Roseanne's character  supports Trump.</p><p> Ben Shapiro writing this, he said, \"There's something else going on in  \"Roseanne\" that should disturb conservatives.  The redefinition of Trump  supporters as blue-collar leftists rather than conservatives.  Roseanne's  character is pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion, feminist, and pro- transgenderism.  And the implication is that she's a good person because of  these views, but the real difference between Trump voters and Hillary  voters are economic in nature, not cultural.\"  Lisa, what do you make of  that?</p><p> BOOTHE:  I don't want to get an argument with Ben Shapiro because he's a  pretty smart guy there, but I also think that -- look, if you try to look  at the Trump coalition, it's sort of a hodgepodge of individuals in this  country.  So, I think you certainly have people like Roseanne Barr, who's a  Trump supporter.</p><p> Herself, in real life, also an executive producer of this show that -- you  know, maybe a little bit more socially liberal but voted on him for the  economic issues alone.  But I also think you additionally have people that  went for President Trump because of these cultural words.  Again, President  Trump sort of had this broad, hodgepodge of a coalition.  So, I see his  point, I think it's a smart point, but I don't necessarily a 100 percent  agree with the point he is making.</p><p> BREAM:  Ethan, what do you make of those monster ratings last night?</p><p> BEARMAN:  Well, I say congratulations to the show.  The cast, I think they  did a great job.  I'm not necessarily the biggest fan but I'm going to tell  you something, Ben Shapiro, is totally wrong on this one.  It's about love,  it's not about hate, and that's what Roseanne is preaching here and what  she's been doing for many, many years.</p><p> She led the way both the advocate and out have come out in support of  Roseanne, not just the show -- I think, but the show 24 years ago -- almost  24 years ago was a groundbreaker in terms of the first kiss between two  women on T.V.  So, that's a big deal for a lot of people because especially  in light of what the president has been doing with some of the anti-LGBT  moves, Roseanne, shows that you can love and support Trump at the same  time, well, the LGBT.</p><p> BREAM:  OK, and I think that's Ben's concern is that it portrays Trump  voters is being ones who care about the economy but not these cultural  issues.  He doesn't think that's the case, but -- you know, we'll see.  We  love having Ben on, to maybe we can talk about this.</p><p> All right, I want to make sure we get to our second topic.  We'll start  with you, Mollie.  A young student out in California says he's going to do  a pro-life walkout, April 11th, I believe is the time a date for that.  He  wants to test a couple of things.  He says this, he says, \"Along with being  a movement commemorating the millions of children who fell victim to  abortion, the movement is one that stands for all students' rights to  freedom of speech and assembly.\"</p><p> He says, he wants to test this theory about whether it will get the same  kind of support that the anti-gun rally has did.</p><p> HEMINGWAY:  Well, it's interesting that the study came out showing that the  people at this weekends' march, the average age was 50, and there weren't  that many children there.  If you go to the March for Life which is held  annually in D.C., and also in state capitals and other cities throughout  the country, you are blown away by how many young people are there, high  school students and even younger.  This is an issue of ending the  destruction of human life in the womb and violence in the womb and how that  hurts women and their children is an issue that young people care deeply  about.  And it is something that the media have not done a very good job  covering.  And I think it's a really interesting question to ask, whether  schools will be supportive of this as they were actively colluding and  trying to push this anti-gun rights march that they did.</p><p> BREAM:  Yes, and Ethan, this student directly was a student of the teacher  got suspended out in California for asking this and having this  conversation in her class.  Do you think the two topics will be treated the  same?  What do you of this plan?</p><p> BEARMAN:  I mean, I always support people to exercise their First Amendment  rights, but there is a significant difference between an already existing  march for life and pro -- anti-abortion rally that goes on and a reaction  by a lot of people.  By the way, I was at the march for our lives with my  two small children, well under the age of 50, and my kids are way under the  age of 50.  So I think we saw a lot of young people there.  I don't -- that  study was somewhat non-scientific in D.C. only.  But the point is this, the  kids in Parkland and around the country are worried about the violence that  took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.  Abortions are not  happening in high school classrooms so these are different topics and there  are separate marches for that.</p><p> BREAM:  We got to leave it there because we're out of time.  But thank you  all, Ethan, Lisa and Mollie, we'll watch April 11th and we'll see what  happens.</p><p> HEMMINGWAY:  Thank you, Shannon.</p><p> BEARMAN:  Thank you.</p><p> BREAM:  Thank you, guys.  All right, Facebook under fire, Amazon stocks  plummeting as a third news technology company raises eyebrows with a  controversial appointment with board of directors breaking down the tech  headlines next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BREAM:  Amazon chair slumping after Axios reported that President Trump  believes the e-commerce giant is making life harder for small businesses  and is reportedly considering legal means to change that.  Joining me now  from Los Angeles, Steve Hilton, Host of the \"NEXT REVOLUTION\" on Sunday  nights right here on Fox, also, the Co-Founder and CEO of a tech company  himself and Axios Reporter Alayna Treene.  Great to have both of you with  us tonight.</p><p> ALAYNA TREENE, REPORTER, AXIOS:  Great to have be here.</p><p> BREAM:  Steve, there's been a lot of hostility in recent weeks against a  lot of the big tech companies.  Is it paying to specific stories do you  think were there's a broader backlash?</p><p> STEVE HILTON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  It's a broader backlash, Shannon.  In  many ways, I think it's really helpful that it's happening because it's  shining a spotlight on something really important, which is that these tech  companies have just got too big and too powerful and it mirrors something  that is happening in the economy generally where you got a concentration of  power, of economic power and that's always bad news.  It's bad news when it  happens in government when you get a concentration of power in Washington.   That's why I believe in decentralizing power from the federal government to  the states and to communities.  But the same thing needs happen in the  economy too.  We actually need to really toughen up the antitrust laws and  start breaking up these companies, not just tech, throughout the economy,  to get more competition into the marketplace.</p><p> BREAM:  OK, and Alayna, to that point, the President apparently, the  reporting from your outlet, Axios is that he'd to possibly take some steps  against Amazon, thinking it's hurting brick-and-mortar stores, retailers,  shopping malls, people in real estate, which is a business where he has a  lot of friends, the quote is, \"the tech behemoth Trump wants to go after is  Amazon according to five sources who has discussed it with him.  He's  obsessed with Amazon, a source said, \"obsessed.\"  Alayna?</p><p> TREENE:  Well, it's definitely interesting to see and that's exactly what  the reporting shows. And really, what we're seeing is the President, he is  a 1950s man.  He's a businessman before he was President.  He kind of is  nostalgic for the days that it used to be and he's starting to see -- talking to Steve's point, he thinks that there's a lot of power in the  hands of these tech companies, and Amazon in particular for its e-commerce  aspect of that and what it's doing to mom-and-pop stores and other  retailers that he sees it as a big threat to some of those smaller  businesses.  And so, he's looking at perhaps taking some action.  Press  Secretary Sarah Sanders said today that there is nothing in the works right  now but from what the sources have told Axios is that he really is looking  at anti -- maybe anti-trust regulations or some other tax treatment that  they might be abusing.</p><p> BREAM:  And another tech company that's revolutionized the way we get  entertainment, Netflix has announced Susan Rice, former Ambassador and  former NSA under the Obama Administration is going to join their board.  I  want to get a quick reaction for both of you.  Steve, first to you.</p><p>HILTON:  I think you know, there's nothing that -- not to be upset about  except the fact that it is so typical, isn't it?  People who serve in  government and then they basically cash in on their public service and they  get who burned up by these big companies and stock on their board.  It's  happened forever, it's part of the swamp.  That is the real story here  rather than the politics of Netflix.  It's all about the swamp.  This is  how they work.</p><p> BREAM:  And Alayna, you know, there's been backlash and threats of a  boycott because of the Ambassador's role in the Benghazi fiasco.  How do  you think that plays out?</p><p> TREENE:  Well, a lot of people have been taking on to Twitter and other  forms of social media to say that they're going to boycott Netflix for  putting Susan Rice on the board.  And we saw similar things happen when  there was buzz that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama might also have a  Netflix series on Netflix.  And so a lot of people believed, just like  Steve's point, as he was saying it's the swamp coming to these big media  outlets and a lot of people don't like that crossover from the political  world in Washington into some of the more tech companies and media  companies that they see as their entertainment and ways of escaping all of  that.</p><p> BREAM:  Well, a tough day for many in the tech companies.  A tough week in  the markets.  We'll see how they fare tomorrow with the next news cycle.   Steve and Alayna, great to have both of you with us tonight.  Thanks. </p><p> TREENE:  Thank you.</p><p>HILTON:  Thanks, Shannon.  See you soon. </p><p> BREAM:  OK, so many of you who have reached out in the last few days after  I put out a Twitter plea for a young boy he was very ill and had one last  wish.  So we've got an update for you right after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BREAM:  I want to close tonight by updating you about young Emilio who is  dying wish was to get a message of one of the Avengers.  I launched a  Twitter campaign after getting the request from Emilio's uncle whom I've  met on a plane weeks ago.  Thanks to your tens of thousands of retweets,  and the kindness of many strangers in three short days, videos personalized  for Emilio poured in from multiple Avengers and other superheroes.  Today  one of them was set to call him at the hospital, but the 11-year-old cancer  fighter did not make it.  Emilio's family started a foundation to help  others facing the same struggles that they have.  Emilio also wrote a book  last year, and all the proceeds will help fund the foundation.</p><p> If you want to help, just go to genesfoundation -- that's G-E-N-E-S  foundation.com.  And please remember this.  Emilio proved that social media  can be actually an enormous force for good and that there is plenty of  kindness in the world.  Strangers will often care and have compassion even  when it will benefit them in no way.  We've seen that over and over since  Sunday.  So thanks all of you who made that happen.  Tonight, most-watched,  most trusted, and most grateful you spent the evening with us.  Good night  from Washington.  I'm Shannon Bream.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

The 14-year former General Counsel to the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee points to what he says is \"Google's anticompetitive conduct and abuse of its search engine monopoly\" that, in combination with its ad business, pose an existential threat to journalism. Save Journalism Project has some figures to back up those claims as well. </p><p>In 2019 alone, the group says, more than 7,200 media professionals have been laid off. That follows a decline in the size of newsrooms by 45-percent over the last 10 years and the decimation of local newspapers. According to figures posted by the group. As many as 60-percent of counties in the U.S. no longer have a local newspaper. Facebook can't be left out of the fray[2] either since ad revenues have skyrocketed for both companies over that period. Over the last seven years, the climb has been more dramatic. Specifically, Google and Facebook saw ad revenue shoot by $80 billion and $50 billion, respectively. That's despite ad revenues dropping by $2 billion per year over that time frame. News publishers managed just $14.3 billion in 2018, the group says. If the trend continues, the next seven years will see the end of that ad revenue and \"the free press.\"The DOJ investigation into GoogleThe figures pooled by the Save Journalism Project are undoubtedly under review by the Justice Department and the FTC. The organizations respectively took over the investigation of Google and Facebook earlier this year, splitting the enormous task. The bulk of the DOJ investigation into Google has been kept well under wraps but comes in the wake of countless global privacy and serious antitrust inquiries into the company. In particular, the company has faced challenges centered on Android. The fines the company has paid and concessions result from policies requiring Google services to be pre-installed and Google to be set as the default search. Google has since started moving away from those violations but Mr. Bloom notes that a major monopolization case is the biggest risk Google faces. Not only has the steps the company has taken not been enough. The search giant has grown substantially and has broken into new territories such as IoT and AI, among other things. Its foray into those areas isn't slight either, with the company arguably falling just behind Amazon in the smart home market. Additionally, its AI comes installed on nearly every new smartphone that isn't built by Apple. Since nearly all of those services utilize its search and ad businesses to some extent, those don't do the company any favors.A resolution could be a long way outThere is any number of avenues Google[3] will be investigated from before the Justice Department determines how to proceed. Another such avenue is Google's recent push to limit the sharing of user data in Chrome and other services. Giving users greater control over privacy is good for consumers but also limits competition in that space. That's without considering the search giant's sister and daughter companies, such as YouTube. It doesn't take into account the ongoing push for regulatory action that could force the company to keep even more user data under tighter restrictions. Simultaneously, several leading politicians are considering the break-up of the company. That's a solution to the issue that could feasibly be pursued by the DOJ and FTC. For a company Google's size, this is a massive undertaking for the Justice Department. Regardless of how serious it is, it's going to take a long time to complete.

Such warnings are a familiar refrain in Europe, where antitrust regulators have probed and penalized tech giants for wielding their massive stores of data in anti-competitive ways. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>With Amazon, a key concern is the e-commerce giant's collection of sales data from third-party merchants and whether the tech giant is able to leverage that unique position against smaller rivals. In Facebook's case, the fear is that no competitor could ever launch a viable social network of their own because they could never match Facebook's stores of data - a serious threat to users, experts say, given the company's pockmarked record on privacy.</p><p>And for Google, advocates for aggressive antitrust action against the tech industry take issue with its unparalleled view into its users' lives from the wide array of services it provides - from its search engine to its Android smartphone operating system. Federal regulators are likely to confront this issue directly in the coming months, following Google's announcement that it would acquire FitBit, a wearables company, for $2.1 billion. The purchase, if approved, could grant the tech giant access to even more information - this time, about device-owners' health and wellness.</p><p>Without commenting on those or other companies, Delrahim said collecting data is not by itself anti-competitive - rather, it is about what is done with that data. He delivered that message in front of an antitrust conference at Harvard Law School hosted by the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, which counts Amazon, Facebook and Google as members.</p><p>\"Amassing a large quantity of data is not necessarily anticompetitive,\" he said. \"The more complicated question for enforcers is how data is collected, analyzed and used, and, most importantly, whether these practices harm competition.\"</p><p>Delrahim said the Justice Department is \"especially vigilant\" when a company \"cuts off a profitable relationship supplying business partners with key data, code, or other technological inputs in ways that are contrary to the company's economic interests.\"</p><p>And the Justice Department antitrust chief also stressed the agency is mindful about the effects on users as well: \"Just as antitrust enforcers care about companies charging higher prices or degrading quality as a sign of allocative inefficiency, it may be important to examine circumstances where companies acquire or extract more data from consumers in exchange for less.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-9de7802ad5144baeb3160300758d90b3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFV-38P1-JB4M-V0N4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"656\"/><timeReceived>8:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But if the FTC agreement offered a chance for Facebook to move past a lengthy probe into its handling of users' data, the Justice Department's announcement Tuesday showed that the legal troubles may be just beginning for the social media company and its peers.</p><p>The DOJ's antitrust division was vague about its plans, saying it will look into \"the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online.\" The release doesn't mention Google, Facebook and Amazon by name but says antitrust officials are seeking information from \"industry participants who have direct insight into competition in online platforms.\" All three companies, along with Apple, were the subject of a House antitrust hearing just last week.</p><p>\"Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,\" Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim said in a statement. \"The Department's antitrust review will explore these important issues.\"</p><p>Critics have raised antitrust concerns related to Google competing against rivals in search results, Facebook and Google's power in ad markets and whether Amazon prioritizes its own products over those from other sellers. Policymakers have suggested remedies to those issues ranging from bolstering the FTC's oversight capabilities by boosting its funding to trying to break tech giants apart.</p><p>Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential hopeful who has called for breaking up big tech companies, said she supports a \"legitimate antitrust investigation\" but also sounded a note of caution about DOJ's plans.</p><p>\"But we should be wary that this administration doesn't abuse this necessary review in order to pursue its own partisan agenda,\" Warren said via Twitter. \"This issue is too important to be dragged into Trump's petty grievances against these companies. This requires careful congressional oversight.\"</p><p>President Donald Trump, who has railed against tech companies over allegations of anti-conservative bias, said at a recent White House summit on social media that he is directing his administration to \"explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free speech rights of all Americans.\"</p><p>GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, a close Trump ally, cheered the DOJ news on Twitter, adding that she plans to discuss \"how to foster free markets and competition\" at the next meeting of a Senate Judiciary tech task force she's leading. The bipartisan group is probing an array of issues related to Silicon Valley companies, including privacy, competition and the anti-conservative bias allegations, for which there's no clear evidence and which the tech companies have denied.</p><p>Lawmakers of both parties have already slammed the proposed FTC settlement, which the commission is expected to formally unveil Wednesday after getting DOJ's sign-off. Critics from both parties have noted that Facebook's annual revenue dwarfs the known $5 billion penalty and cited reports that the FTC opted against punishing conditions like making Facebook stop sharing data with third parties.</p><p>Facebook's stock price rose when news of the proposed fine leaked earlier this month - but sagged slightly in after-hours trading Tuesday following news of the DOJ's probe.</p><p>Tuesday's news also raised questions about a recent agreement in which the Justice Department and the FTC divvied up jurisdiction of major tech companies, laying the groundwork for potential DOJ probes into whether Google or Apple constitute monopolies and FTC investigations into the same for Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>The newly announced investigation appears to be an even broader review of the competitive impact of the country's biggest tech companies. The review raises the stakes for the companies, especially Facebook and Amazon, because the FTC's claim of jurisdiction over monopolization concerns could result in dual federal antitrust probes for those two firms.</p><p>The House Judiciary Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee also has its own antitrust investigation into the country's largest tech companies. After a hearing in the panel last week, subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) kept the heat on Tuesday by questioning the truthfulness of the testimony from the Google, Facebook and Amazon witnesses.</p><p>Facebook and Amazon representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the DOJ's announcement.</p><p>A Google spokesperson referred a request for comment to testimony by Adam Cohen, Google director of economic policy, at last week's House hearing.</p><p>\"We have helped reduce prices and expand choice for consumers and merchants in the U.S. and around the world,\" Cohen said in his testimony. \"We have created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals.\"</p><p>The DOJ's announcement was unusual in that the department announced it, in contrast to the agency's usual practice of not publicizing investigations when they're launched, said Charlotte Slaiman, the competition policy counsel for the watchdog group Public Knowledge.</p><p>\"The fact that he's making this statement I think probably indicated they're planning to take it seriously,\" Slaiman said. \"You'd be hard pressed, once you make a statement like this, to not do a thorough job.\"</p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-1428175</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMX-JSV1-F118-93T9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1004\"/><timeReceived>7:45 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 23, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And President Donald Trump pushed his campaign against Big Tech on Wednesday, touting curbs on legal protections for social media platforms he denounces as biased against conservative views.   \"In recent years, a small group of technology platforms have tightened their grip over commerce and communications in America,\" Trump declared at a White House event with Attorney General William Barr and Republican attorneys general from several states. \"They've used this power to engage in unscrupulous business practices while simultaneously waging war on free enterprise and free expression.\"   The anticipated lawsuit against Google by the Justice Department could be the government's biggest legal offensive to protect competition since the ground-breaking case against Microsoft almost 20 years ago.   Lawmakers and consumer advocates accuse Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and boost its profits.   For over a year, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have pursued sweeping antitrust investigations of big tech companies, looking at whether Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have hurt competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google's business practices. They cited \"potential monopolistic behavior.\"   Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.   Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump's drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.   Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.   The White House said Wednesday the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Barr said, the government will provide individuals the ability to pursue legal claims against online platforms for \"bad-faith censorship.\"   Social media platforms can abuse consumers' trust \"by deciding which voices they are going to amplify and which they are going to throttle, and by improperly tracking, collecting user data and even facilitating criminal activity,\" Barr said.   Separately, the Justice Department's antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday.   \"Big Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\" Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Any effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\"  State support  Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department's case against Google. It's a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action \u2013 and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.   Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.   The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.   The company, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.   A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech's market dominance. The panel's chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.   Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices.   Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft's Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.   Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world's largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system.

And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google's business practices. They cited \"potential monopolistic behavior.\"</p><p> Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.</p><p> Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump's drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p> Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p> The White House said Wednesday the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Barr said, the government will provide individuals the ability to pursue legal claims against online platforms for \"bad-faith censorship.\"</p><p> Social media platforms can abuse consumers' trust \"by deciding which voices they are going to amplify and which they are going to throttle, and by improperly tracking, collecting user data and even facilitating criminal activity,\" Barr said.</p><p> Separately, the Justice Department's antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday.</p><p> \"Big Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\" state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Any effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\"</p><p> Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department's case against Google. It's a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action \u2014 and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.</p><p> Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.</p><p> The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.</p><p> The company, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.</p><p> A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech's market dominance. The panel's chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.</p><p> Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices.</p><p>Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90 percent of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft's Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favouring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.</p><p>Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world's largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKWA-bd1a1e2ce07fd7519f1b10f9291ffda4b55e47e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28975C0D3EEFA4 NWBKWA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XN-68J1-JBCN-42GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1069\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Sound Publishing Inc., Peninsula Daily News<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

And President Donald Trump is pushing his campaign against Big Tech on Wednesday, touting curbs on legal protections for social media platforms he denounces as biased against conservative views.  The anticipated lawsuit against Google by the Justice Department could be the government's biggest legal offensive to protect competition since the ground-breaking case against Microsoft almost 20 years ago.  Lawmakers and consumer advocates accuse Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and boost its profits.  For over a year, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have pursued sweeping antitrust investigations of big tech companies, looking at whether Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have hurt competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google's business practices. They cited 'potential monopolistic behavior.' Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley. Trump is meeting with a group of Republican attorneys general at the White House on Wednesday to discuss 'protecting consumers from social media abuses.'  Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump's drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms. (Ad) Three of the world's smartest hedge fund managers are stumped! And now there's ONE new stock that could see gains of 357.53% even this week. See the ONE stock that's likely to be making headlines. Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet. Separately, the Justice Department's antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday. 'Big Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,' Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. 'Any effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.' Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department's case against Google. It's a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action \u2014 and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.  Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions. The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.  The company based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.  A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech's market dominance. The panel's chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.  Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices. Among other things, the regulators found that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones. Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft's Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world's largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system. GPS navigation system Waze and Nest, offering 'smart home' devices, also are in the Google stable. Most of the money comes from a digital ad market that Google dominates along with rival Facebook. Google is the bigger of the two online ad giants, thanks mostly to the ubiquitous search platform. Many smaller advertisers have complained that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it's become a system of whatever Google says, goes \u2014 because the alternative could be not reaching customers. __ Associated Press Writer Eugene Johnson in Seattle contributed to this report. __ Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/mgordonap\">https://twitter.com/mgordonap</url> Companies Mentioned in This Article Compare These Stocks[1] Add These Stocks to My Watchlist[2] Best Growth Stocks - Best Stocks to Buy Now[3]The stock market has been growing since the New York Stock Exchange opened its doors in 1817. Sometimes, a stock will outpace the rest of the market in terms of growth. These skyrocketing securities\u2014or the ones that analysts expect to skyrocket\u2014are called growth stocks.What Every Investor Needs to Know About Growth Stocks Growth stocks are a great opportunity for an investor to make money in the stock market, but you've got to know what you're going to buy or sell. A good understanding of growth stocks will help you get there. At the beginning of a bull market, you can almost choose stocks randomly and find yourself a winner. Now that we are entering the ninth year of the current bull market, growth stocks have appreciated considerably and it's becoming far more challenging to find stocks with real opportunities for appreciation.Growth companies are still largely outperforming their value counterparts in the United States and the rest of the world largely because of low interest rates, improved corporate earnings and global economic growth. Over the last five years, the S&amp;#38;P 500 Growth Index has returned 14.22% per year. During the same time, the S&amp;#38;P 500 Value Index returned just 12.94%.Now that the bull market is now nearly a decade old, stocks have become very expensive. Value investors are largely sitting on the sidelines and growth investors are having a hard time figuring out where the remaining growth opportunities exist.If you are looking for growth stocks in an increasingly small field, we have identified the 10 best growth stocks to buy right now based on their expected earnings growth over the next several years.

And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google\u2019s business practices. They cited \u201cpotential monopolistic behavior.\u201d</p><p> Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.</p><p> Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump\u2019s drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p> Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p> The White House said Wednesday the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Barr said, the government will provide individuals the ability to pursue legal claims against online platforms for \u201cbad-faith censorship.\u201d</p><p> Social media platforms can abuse consumers\u2019 trust \u201cby deciding which voices they are going to amplify and which they are going to throttle, and by improperly tracking, collecting user data and even facilitating criminal activity,\u201d Barr said.</p><p> Separately, the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday.</p><p> \u201cBig Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\u201d Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cAny effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\u201d</p><p> Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department\u2019s case against Google. It\u2019s a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action \u2014 and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.</p><p> Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.</p><p> The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.</p><p> The company, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.</p><p> A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance. The panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.</p><p> Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices.</p><p>Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.</p><p>Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world\u2019s largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system.</p><p>Associated Press Writers Eugene Johnson in Seattle and Kevin Freking in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-17DB85D10B230AFB</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289855AE9253E4 NWBKCA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XG-J9T1-DXVP-V3GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1080\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Santa Monica Daily Press<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google's business practices. They cited \"potential monopolistic behavior.\"</p><p>Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.</p><p>Trump is meeting with a group of Republican attorneys general at the White House on Wednesday to discuss \"protecting consumers from social media abuses.\" </p><p>Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump's drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p>Separately, the Justice Department's antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday.</p><p>\"Big Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\" Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Any effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department's case against Google. It's a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action - and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers. </p><p>Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.</p><p>The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon. </p><p>The company based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads. </p><p>A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech's market dominance. The panel's chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits. </p><p>Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices. Among other things, the regulators found that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.</p><p>Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft's Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.</p><p>Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world's largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system. GPS navigation system Waze and Nest, offering \"smart home\" devices, also are in the Google stable.</p><p>Most of the money comes from a digital ad market that Google dominates along with rival Facebook. Google is the bigger of the two online ad giants, thanks mostly to the ubiquitous search platform. Many smaller advertisers have complained that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it's become a system of whatever Google says, goes - because the alternative could be not reaching customers.</p><p>__</p><p>Associated Press Writer Eugene Johnson in Seattle contributed to this report.</p><p>__</p><p>Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/mgordonap\">https://twitter.com/mgordonap</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-66222649</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X2-M831-DY4H-K4RP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1077\"/><timeReceived>8:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 23, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google\u2019s business practices. They cited \u201cpotential monopolistic behavior.\u201d</p><p>Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.</p><p>Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump\u2019s drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p>The White House said Wednesday the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Barr said, the government will provide individuals the ability to pursue legal claims against online platforms for \u201cbad-faith censorship.\"</p><p>Social media platforms can abuse consumers' trust \u201cby deciding which voices they are going to amplify and which they are going to throttle, and by improperly tracking, collecting user data and even facilitating criminal activity,\" Barr said.</p><p>Separately, the Justice Department's antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday.</p><p>\u201cBig Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\u201d Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cAny effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\u201d</p><p>Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department\u2019s case against Google. It\u2019s a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action \u2014 and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.</p><p>Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.</p><p>The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.</p><p>The company, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.</p><p>A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance. The panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.</p><p>Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices.</p><p>Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.</p><p>Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world\u2019s largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system.</p><p>__</p><p>Associated Press Writers Eugene Johnson in Seattle and Kevin Freking in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.</p><p>__</p><p>Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/mgordonap\">https://twitter.com/mgordonap</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-2b1e91fa4387dacf864046e0632ed81320200923</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X2-HCW1-JC5B-G44C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1089\"/><timeReceived>9:18 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 23, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google\u2019s business practices. They cited \u201cpotential monopolistic behavior.\u201d</p><p>Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.</p><p>Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump\u2019s drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p>The White House said Wednesday the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Barr said, the government will provide individuals the ability to pursue legal claims against online platforms for \u201cbad-faith censorship.\"</p><p>Social media platforms can abuse consumers' trust \u201cby deciding which voices they are going to amplify and which they are going to throttle, and by improperly tracking, collecting user data and even facilitating criminal activity,\" Barr said.</p><p>Separately, the Justice Department's antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday.</p><p>\u201cBig Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\u201d Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cAny effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\u201d</p><p>Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department\u2019s case against Google. It\u2019s a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action \u2014 and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.</p><p>Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.</p><p>The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.</p><p>The company, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.</p><p>A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance. The panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.</p><p>Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices.</p><p>Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.</p><p>Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world\u2019s largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system.</p><p>__</p><p>Associated Press Writers Eugene Johnson in Seattle and Kevin Freking in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.</p><p>__</p><p>Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/mgordonap\">https://twitter.com/mgordonap</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-2b1e91fa4387dacf864046e0632ed81320200923</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X2-HCV1-JC5B-G445-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><timeReceived>9:18 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 23, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google\u2019s business practices. They cited \u201cpotential monopolistic behavior.\u201d</p><p>Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.</p><p>Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump\u2019s drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p>The White House said Wednesday the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Barr said, the government will provide individuals the ability to pursue legal claims against online platforms for \u201cbad-faith censorship.\"</p><p>Social media platforms can abuse consumers' trust \u201cby deciding which voices they are going to amplify and which they are going to throttle, and by improperly tracking, collecting user data and even facilitating criminal activity,\" Barr said.</p><p>Separately, the Justice Department's antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday.</p><p>\u201cBig Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\u201d Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cAny effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\u201d</p><p>Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department\u2019s case against Google. It\u2019s a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action \u2014 and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.</p><p>Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.</p><p>The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.</p><p>The company, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.</p><p>A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance. The panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.</p><p>Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices.</p><p>Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.</p><p>Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world\u2019s largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system.</p><p>__</p><p>Associated Press Writers Eugene Johnson in Seattle and Kevin Freking in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.</p><p>__</p><p>Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/mgordonap\">https://twitter.com/mgordonap</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-2b1e91fa4387dacf864046e0632ed81320200923</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X2-HD21-JC5B-G457-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><timeReceived>9:18 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google\u2019s business practices. They cited \u201cpotential monopolistic behavior.\u201d</p><p>Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.</p><p>Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump\u2019s drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p>The White House said Wednesday the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Barr said, the government will provide individuals the ability to pursue legal claims against online platforms for \u201cbad-faith censorship.\"</p><p>Social media platforms can abuse consumers' trust \u201cby deciding which voices they are going to amplify and which they are going to throttle, and by improperly tracking, collecting user data and even facilitating criminal activity,\" Barr said.</p><p>Separately, the Justice Department's antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday.</p><p>\u201cBig Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\u201d Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cAny effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\u201d</p><p>Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department\u2019s case against Google. It\u2019s a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action \u2014 and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.</p><p>Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.</p><p>The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.</p><p>The company, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.</p><p>A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance. The panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.</p><p>Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices.</p><p>Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.

And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google's business practices. They cited \"potential monopolistic behaviour.\"</p><p>Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.</p><p>Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump's drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p>The White House said Wednesday the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Barr said, the government will provide individuals the ability to pursue legal claims against online platforms for \"bad-faith censorship.\"</p><p>Social media platforms can abuse consumers' trust \"by deciding which voices they are going to amplify and which they are going to throttle, and by improperly tracking, collecting user data and even facilitating criminal activity,\" Barr said.</p><p>Separately, the Justice Department's antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday.</p><p>\"Big Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\" Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Any effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department's case against Google. It's a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action - and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.</p><p>Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.</p><p>The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.</p><p>The company, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.</p><p>A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech's market dominance. The panel's chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.</p><p>Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices.</p><p>Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft's Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favouring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.</p><p>Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world's largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system.</p><p>__</p><p>Associated Press Writers Eugene Johnson in Seattle and Kevin Freking in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.</p><p>__</p><p>Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/mgordonap\">https://twitter.com/mgordonap</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-2b1e91fa4387dacf864046e0632ed813</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X7-BMH1-JBVR-30CG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><timeReceived>05:19 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 23, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And President Donald Trump pushed his campaign against Big Tech on Wednesday, touting curbs on legal protections for social media platforms he denounces as biased against conservative views.    \u201cIn recent years, a small group of technology platforms have tightened their grip over commerce and communications in America,\u201d Trump declared at a White House event with Attorney General William Barr and Republican attorneys general from several states. \u201cThey\u2019ve used this power to engage in unscrupulous business practices while simultaneously waging war on free enterprise and free expression.\u201d    The anticipated lawsuit against Google by the US Justice Department could be the government\u2019s biggest legal offensive to protect competition since the ground-breaking case against Microsoft almost 20 years ago.    Lawmakers and consumer advocates accuse Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and boost its profits.    For over a year, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have pursued sweeping antitrust investigations of big tech companies, looking at whether Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have hurt competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. And a bipartisan coalition of 50 US states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google\u2019s business practices. They cited \u201cpotential monopolistic behaviour\u201d.    Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.    Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump\u2019s drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.    Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.    The White House said Wednesday the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Barr said, the government will provide individuals the ability to pursue legal claims against online platforms for \u201cbad-faith censorship\u201d.    Social media platforms can abuse consumers\u2019 trust \u201cby deciding which voices they are going to amplify and which they are going to throttle, and by improperly tracking, collecting user data and even facilitating criminal activity\u201d, Barr said.    Separately, the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday.    \u201cBig Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\u201d Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cAny effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\u201d    Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department\u2019s case against Google. It\u2019s a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action \u2013 and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.    Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.    The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with USelections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.    The company, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.    A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance. The panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.    Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices.    Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc, controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.    Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome , the world\u2019s largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system. \u2013

And President Donald Trump is pushing his campaign against Big Tech on Wednesday, touting curbs on legal protections for social media platforms he denounces as biased against conservative views.    The anticipated lawsuit against Google by the Justice Department could be the government\u2019s biggest legal offensive to protect competition since the ground-breaking case against Microsoft almost 20 years ago.    Lawmakers and consumer advocates accuse Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and boost its profits.    For over a year, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have pursued sweeping antitrust investigations of big tech companies, looking at whether Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have hurt competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google\u2019s business practices. They cited \u201cpotential monopolistic behavior.\u201d    Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.    Trump was meeting with a group of Republican attorneys general at the White House on Wednesday to discuss \u201cprotecting consumers from social media abuses.\u201d    Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump\u2019s drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.    Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.    Separately, the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday.    \u201cBig Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\u201d Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cAny effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\u201d    Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department\u2019s case against Google. It\u2019s a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action \u2014 and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.    Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.    The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.    The company based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.    A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance. The panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.    Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices. Among other things, the regulators found that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.    Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.    Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world\u2019s largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system. GPS navigation system Waze and Nest, offering \u201csmart home\u201d devices, also are in the Google stable.    Most of the money comes from a digital ad market that Google dominates along with rival Facebook. Google is the bigger of the two online ad giants, thanks mostly to the ubiquitous search platform. Many smaller advertisers have complained that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it\u2019s become a system of whatever Google says, goes \u2014 because the alternative could be not reaching customers.    \u00a9</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

And President Donald Trump pushed his campaign against Big Tech on Wednesday, touting curbs on legal protections for social media platforms he denounces as biased against conservative views. \"In recent years, a small group of technology platforms have tightened their grip over commerce and communications in America,\" Trump declared at a White House event with Attorney General William Barr and Republican attorneys general from several states. \"They've used this power to engage in unscrupulous business practices while simultaneously waging war on free enterprise and free expression.\" </p><p>The anticipated lawsuit against Google by the Justice Department could be the government's biggest legal offensive to protect competition since the ground-breaking case against Microsoft almost 20 years ago. Lawmakers and consumer advocates accuse Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and boost its profits. For over a year, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have pursued sweeping antitrust investigations of big tech companies, looking at whether Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have hurt competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google's business practices. They cited \"potential monopolistic behavior.\" Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley. Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump's drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms. Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet. The White House said Wednesday the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Barr said, the government will provide individuals the ability to pursue legal claims against online platforms for \"bad-faith censorship.\" Social media platforms can abuse consumers' trust \"by deciding which voices they are going to amplify and which they are going to throttle, and by improperly tracking, collecting user data and even facilitating criminal activity,\" Barr said. Separately, the Justice Department's antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday. \"Big Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\" Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Any effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\" Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department's case against Google. It's a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action \u2014 and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers. Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions. The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon. The company, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads. A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech's market dominance. The panel's chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits. Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices. Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft's Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world's largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Associated Press/Jan. 3, 2013 Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.

And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google's business practices. They cited \"potential monopolistic behavior.\"</p><p>Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.</p><p>Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump's drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post.</p><p>Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p>The White House said Wednesday the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. Barr said the government will provide individuals the ability to pursue legal claims against online platforms for \"bad-faith censorship.\"</p><p>Social media platforms can abuse consumers' trust \"by deciding which voices they are going to amplify and which they are going to throttle, and by improperly tracking, collecting user data and even facilitating criminal activity,\" Barr said.</p><p>The Justice Department's antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google with the state attorneys general today.</p><p>\"Big Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\" Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Any effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department's case against Google. It's a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action - and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.</p><p>Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.</p><p>The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.</p><p>The company, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.</p><p>A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech's market dominance. The panel's chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.</p><p>Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices.</p><p>Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.

The DOJ announcement explains: 'Review Focuses on Practices that Create or Maintain Structural Impediments to Greater Competition and User Benefits.' </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/barr-2.jpgAccording\">https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/barr-2.jpgAccording</url> to the Wall Street Journal[2], 'The new antitrust inquiry could ratchet up the already considerable regulatory pressures facing the top U.S. tech firms. The review is designed to go above and beyond recent plans for scrutinizing the tech sector that were crafted by the department and the Federal Trade Commission.' Full Press Release[3]: The Department of Justice announced today that the Department's Antitrust Division is reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers. The Department's review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online. The Department's Antitrust Division is conferring with and seeking information from the public, including industry participants who have direct insight into competition in online platforms, as well as others. 'Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,' said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division. 'The Department's antitrust review will explore these important issues.' The goal of the Department's review is to assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace in an objective and fair-minded manner and to ensure Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want. If violations of law are identified, the Department will proceed appropriately to seek redress.

Under FTC pressure,Googleagreed to end the practice of 'scraping' reviews and other data from rivals' websites for its own products, and to let advertisers export data to independently assess campaigns.Google's search, YouTube, reviews, maps and other businesses, which are largely free to consumers but financed through advertising, have catapulted it from a start-up to one of the world's richest companies in just two decades.Along the way, it has made enemies in both the tech world, who have complained to law enforcers about its market dominance, and in Washington, where lawmakers have complained about issues from its alleged political bias to its plans for China.TripAdvisor chief executive and co-founder Stephen Kaufer welcomed news thatGooglecould face Justice Department antitrust scrutiny.'TripAdvisor remains concerned aboutGoogle's practices in the United States, the EU and throughout the world,' Kaufer said in a statement.'For the good of consumers and competition on the internet, we welcome any renewed interest by U.S. regulators intoGoogle's anticompetitive behavior.'Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has pushed for action to break upGoogle, as well as other big tech companies. </p><p>Senator Kamala Harris, who is also running for president on the Democratic ticket, has agreed.'This is very big news, and overdue,' Sen. Josh Hawley, a RepublicanGooglecritic, said on Twitter, regarding the investigation.Googlehas faced a plethora of overseas probes.Europe's competition authority, for one, hitGooglewith a 2.4-billion-euro ($2.7-billion) EU fine two years ago for unfairly promoting its own comparison shopping service.Googlehas since offered to allow competitors to bid for advertising space at the top of a search page, giving them the chance to compete on equal terms.

Facebook Inc. (FB[4]) is the leader in social media, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN[5]) is the preeminent online retailer, and the Google division of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL[6]) is by far the dominant search engine. Apple Inc. (AAPL[7]), meanwhile, has been mentioned in various press report as another likely target. Double Trouble  The DOJ already has been partnering with Federal Trade Commission (FTC)[8] in reviewing competitive practices in the tech industry, with an eye towards possible antitrust violations, per an earlier report in Barron's[9]. According to that article, the FTC is taking the lead on Amazon.com and Facebook, while the DOJ leads on Apple and Alphabet.However, the current announcement from the DOJ seems to be ratcheting up the pressure on the tech giants, The Wall Street Journal[10] reports. It now seems possible that a given company may face antitrust actions launched by both the DOJ and the FTC, greatly increasing the potential penalties. Meanwhile, executives from these same tech giants testified last week before a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee on antitrust matters. Calls For Breakup  All four FAANG members mentioned above have been under fire from various quarters for allegedly monopolistic practices. In a recent \"private presentation\" to the DOJ, critics of Facebook that included some academics, reportedly argued that the company should be broken up, per the Journal. Google and Amazon also have faced calls for breakup at various times in recent years, from various constituencies.\"I don't think big is necessarily bad, but I think a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley[11] have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers,\" U.S. Attorney General William Barr testified during his confirmation hearings in January, per the Journal.

Section 230 reform will reverse this and make the platforms legal gatekeepers of speech. Conservatives won\u2019t like the results.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEI Vice President for Policy </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wayne Crews</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> said: </emphasis><br/>\"While there are lots of problems with changing the rules of the game for Section 230 now, a key one is that changes of the type Attorney General Barr proposes will backfire. Barr is asking Congress to prevent bias, when it is in fact Congress' job to protect the right to bias in the marketplace of ideas. Large tech companies were never required to be neutral by Sec. 230. If the concern, by this same Justice Department, is that big tech is too big, it should realize that the same Sec. 230 shield that allowed Google, Facebook, and Twitter to flourish is also what will allow successor firms to flourish. Messing with it now will ironically strengthen the biggest tech companies with respect to potential future upstarts if they are denied the same Section 230 protection. Furthermore, the bureaucracy eventually put in place to monitor this new law is unlikely to be controlled by conservatives.\u201d<br/>Read more:<br/>Murray for Fox Business: Big Tech vs. Free Speech?

a move which follows Donald Trump's accusations of conservatives being 'censored' by web giants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The proposals from Attorney General Bill Barr's department would dilute the ability of internet platforms such as Google, Facebook, or Twitter to declare content 'objectionable' and remove or downplay it at will.</p><p>Conservatives claim that the platforms have used that protection to censor their views, including those of Trump, in an escalating row over what they say is an attempt to stifle their point of view.</p><p>But web giants say the sweeping immunities - which are encapsulated in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 are essential to the existence of the modern internet and deny anti-conservative bias. </p><p>The plans are outlined in a document which seeks to amend the act, meaning it is subject to both the House and the Senate taking up the proposals. </p><p>The Democratic-controlled House is unlikely to take up a Republican proposal and in the Senate it would need either to be tabled by Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader or forced on to the agenda with 60 votes, neither of which seem likely in an election year. </p><p>But pushing for reform is a key part of Trump and his administration's appeal to conservatives and would be used as a campaign pitch to vote for Republicans in House elections too. </p><p>Currently Section 230 protects internet platforms from being sued for virtually any content posted on them.</p><p>It also allows the platforms to freely remove or moderate content they declare 'objectionable' without any ability for those affected to seek redress. </p><p>There are no limits on what Google or others can call 'objectionable,' or requirement to explain in advance what they might define that way, or how.</p><p>In recent weeks platforms have used that power to remove posts about coronavirus and protests in the wake of George Floyd's deaths which they say spread false claims or fomented violence and racial division. </p><p>The DOJ's proposals would change the law to redefine 'objectionable' far more narrowly as material which is 'unlawful' or 'promotes terrorism.'</p><p>The DOJ said in its discussion document that this would end 'a platform's ability to remove content arbitrarily or in ways inconsistent with its terms or service simply by deeming it \"objectionable.\"'</p><p>The second part of the change would say that removal or moderation of posts has to be in 'good faith,' meaning that any censorship was 'in accordance with plain and particular terms of service and accompanied by a reasonable explanation.'</p><p>The DOJ in its plan said: 'Unconstrained discretion is particularly concerning in the hands of the biggest platforms, which today effectively own and operate digital public squares. </p><p>'This is even more salient today where social distancing requirements have driven more speech and interaction online.</p><p>'The vagueness of the term \"otherwise objectionable\" risks giving every platform a free pass for removing any and all speech that it dislikes, without any potential for recourse by the user.'</p><p>Taken together the changes would answer many of the conservative critiques of platforms including Facebook and Twitter, which they claim have removed, downplayed or tried to censor conservative posts and accounts without explanation.</p><p>Among their complaints have been a Trump tweet saying 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts' being made less visible because, Twitter said, it 'glorified violence' </p><p>But the changes would leave in place the critical immunity web giants have from being sued for the content of what is posted on their platforms, and also make clear that moderating content does not make them liable to being sued.</p><p>Other changes in the proposals would remove any Section 230 protection from being sued from a platform which 'purposefully facilitates or solicits third-party content or activity that would violate federal criminal law.' </p><p>That would not affect big names like Google but would prevent - for example - a platform being set up specifically for racists to post hate.</p><p>People would also be able to sue platforms if they are victims of child abuse, terrorism or cyber-stalking and the crimes were perpetrated in part through the use of a particular platform.</p><p>And for the first time tech giants would not be immune if they hosted posts which they knew were already in breach of federal law - which could include removing versions of so-called terrorists' handbooks. </p><p>The move is the next step in the administration's war on big tech over claims of anti-conservative bias, and comes after President Trump signed an executive order at the end of May that sought to limit the companies' legal protections.</p><p>But legal experts said the president's order would likely have little effect on tech companies. It was immediately challenged in court. </p><p>A change in law pushed by the Justice Department would have greater impact but only if it was taken up. </p><p>In fact, Democrats and Republicans have found rare common ground in attacking Section 230. </p><p>Democrats complain the law allows social media companies to spread political falsehoods, disinformation, and hate speech while Republicans claim it allows the stifling of conservative voices. </p><p>Joe Biden explicitly called for its abolition, a far more radical move than the DOJ proposal. </p><p>The president has been one of big tech's biggest critics on the matter, claiming the companies silence conservative voices. </p><p>'We're here today to defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in American history, frankly,' Trump said in the Oval Office on May 28 when he signed the order. 'A small handful of powerful social media monopolies control the vast portion of all private and public communications in the United States.' </p><p>That order came after Twitter marked some of tweets as needing more information, a move that infuriated the president. </p><p>READ THE WHOLE DOCUMENT </p><p>'Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices,' Trump tweeted after the fact checking took place. 'We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can't let a more sophisticated version of that.... happen again.' </p><p>Twitter later red-flagged another Trump tweet, one he wrote about the Minneapolis riots in the wake of George Floyd's death, claiming that it 'glorifies violence'. </p><p>His tweet saying that 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts' was hidden by a warning that it violated Twitter's rules - but the message can be bypassed and the tweet remains live. </p><p>Trump has a large online presence. His Facebook page has more than 28 million followers and he has more than 82 million followers on Twitter.</p><p>The Justice Department's proposal also comes as NBC News is under fire for appearing to influence Google to punish two conservative news sites over what was deemed offensive coverage of the protests that sprung up after Floyd's death.</p><p>The network reported on Tuesday that Google 'banned' The Federalist and ZeroHedge from Google Ads for 'pushing unsubstantiated claims' about the Black Lives Matter movement. </p><p>Google, however, said The Federalist 'was never demonetized.' </p><p>'We worked with them to address issues on their site related to the comments section,' the company said.</p><p>However, it appears it was NBC News' inquiry that led to Google's action with The Federalist, an American conservative online magazine run by Meghan McCain's husband.</p><p>NBC was reporting on a study about online hate done by a British non-profit and noted in its report: 'Google blocked The Federalist from its advertising platform after the NBC News Verification Unit brought the project to its attention. ZeroHedge had already been demonetized prior to NBC News' inquiry, Google said.' </p><p>Conservatives jumped on Google, accusing it of bias.</p><p>Meghan McCain tweeted: 'Google is now trafficking in digital fascism. How soon until all conservative speech and publications are completely banned?' </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-63743409</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605C-99Y1-F021-605X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1488\"/><timeReceived>2:22 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Both Republicans and Democrats applauded this move and hope the Department of Justice\u2019s investigations will stifle Silicon Valley\u2019s many monopolies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Barr\u2019s announcement signals that he and his department are serious about this matter. The DOJ is expected to file an antitrust lawsuit against Google this year. It could be the first of many actions it takes against these corporate behemoths. Action from the DOJ against Google would provide greater legal standing for the investigation that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is leading on behalf of 48 states into the tech giant.</p><p>Yet as Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general and head of the DOJ's Antitrust Division, continues to consider weakening or repealing anti-monopoly protections in other industries, there are questions about whether he will undercut the efforts of the department and of state attorneys general altogether.</p><p>Granted, Delrahim\u2019s ties to Google made him recuse himself from investigations into Big Tech. His previous role as a prominent lobbyist for Google, where he helped the company acquire DoubleClick, a key component to its monopolistic ad business, represented too significant a conflict of interest for him to investigate Silicon Valley impartially. That said, Delrahim\u2019s focus on relaxing anti-competitive restraints on monopolists within the music industry could provide more fodder for Big Tech\u2019s legal defense.</p><p>The Antitrust Division is currently reviewing long-held consent decrees against the music industry duopoly operated by the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers and Broadcast Music Inc. Combined, ASCAP and BMI control 90% of the music industry\u2019s public performance rights. All businesses that play recorded music, including bars, restaurants, radio stations, and concert halls, must deal with this duopoly to obtain the music licensing they need.</p><p>Independent music publishers ostensibly formed the ASCAP and BMI music giants to combine their market power so they could increase prices on businesses. Absent checks on their power, these two conglomerates could easily price gouge and abuse the market with impunity. That\u2019s why, back in the 1940s, the DOJ had ASCAP and BMI agree to sign antitrust consent decrees to protect the public. </p><p>Under these antitrust settlements, the two music giants agreed to license all of their music under one affordable license to every business that asks for the playing rights. The decrees allow ASCAP and BMI to maintain their market dominance while imposing reasonable safeguards to prevent price gouging. </p><p>Many political and legal analysts have considered DOJ\u2019s handling of the music monopolies a blueprint for how the Trump administration should handle Big Tech\u2019s consumer abuses. The music agreements have received the respect of experts for their light-touch approach that respects the free market while setting clear, transparent rules for the monopolies to follow. ASCAP and BMI are left alone by the federal government so long as they respect the terms they signed onto with the DOJ \u2014 but when they don\u2019t, they incur heavy monetary fines that severely discourage them from doing so again in the future.</p><p>The music decrees have allowed the music industry not only to function but to flourish for the past 70 years. Nevertheless, ASCAP and BMI predictably want to scrap the longstanding agreements, and Delrahim has been all ears. </p><p>This month, his Antitrust Division hosted panels that discussed the issue at length. The division invited famous artists like Jon Bon Jovi, who in a virtual keynote address advocated making no changes to the decrees. Directly comparing ASCAP and BMI to Big Tech, the rock star said that these DOJ agreements serve the public\u2019s interest and that the DOJ should ignore the special interests who demand weakening or eliminating them. And yet, the investigation continues. </p><p>Delrahim doesn\u2019t appear to be just checking a box by opening the investigation either. In a speech delivered to the National Music Publishers Association, he signaled being open to revising the consent decrees or eliminating them altogether. He made a point to say that the division hasn\u2019t decided whether the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees are the best for current business, going so far as to positively cite court decisions challenging the consent decrees in his speech. </p><p>ASCAP and BMI are not worthy of any form of regulatory relaxation whatsoever. They wield as much power over the market as they did back in the 1940s. One of them even paid a $1.75 million fine to the department less than five years ago for seemingly violating the term. </p><p>While likely not intentional, Delrahim\u2019s relaxing of antitrust rules that govern the music industry would blow up the very antitrust model that many believe the DOJ should follow to tackle Big Tech. This is extremely troubling. Monopolies, whether in music or Big Tech, hurt consumers and businesses and make a mockery of the free market principles that have made this nation great.</p><p>The Antitrust Division must keep these principles in mind before it sets precedents that can impact the market across all industries for the decades to come.</p><p>Matt Mackowiak is president of Potomac Strategy Group, LLC.

Alexa will only hand you one. It is not going to send you ten pages with 100 search results.\"</p><p>Delrahim suggested that\u00a0an analysis of that product is going to be important, as virtual assistants are going to be \"much more powerful\" products. \"Are they only going to direct [customer] to their own product in that type of search? Should that be a violation of antitrust or is that just innovation, where someone else can compete? I don't know the answers, but that is going to be even more important than a search result on a page.\"</p><p>Sally Hubbard, the senior editor of Tech Antitrust Enforcement, The Capitol Forum, suggested in an interview on the sidelines of the conference that the power of Amazon.com is \"certainly something\" regulators will need to keep a watchful eye on as home assistants proliferate and get \"more and more integrated into our cars and our refrigerators.\" She added that Amazon has a strong lead in\u00a0the search by voice virtual assistance sector, adding that it means we should focus more heavily on them.\u00a0</p><p>Hubbard compared Amazon and its Alexa with the circumstances that led to the Justice Department's landmark move in 1998 to hit Microsoft (MSFT) with antitrust charges.\u00a0</p><p>\"Microsoft controlled the desktop computer, so they wanted to control the browser,\" Hubbard said. \"If Amazon starts controlling the way people search for products in a way that is more severe than it is now, then there is going to be a lot of risk there to abuse.\"</p><p>Activist investor Nelson Peltz of Trian Fund Management <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/14443980/index.dl|brought\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/14443980/index.dl|brought</url> up the issue in January as part of a broader commentary about his Amazon antitrust concerns at an event hosted by Reuters, arguing that Amazon's Alexa would only offer Amazon batteries until Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at\u00a0New York University\u00a0Stern School of Business       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.l2inc.com/daily-insights/no-mercy-no-malice/alexa-how-can-we-kill-brands|raised\">https://www.l2inc.com/daily-insights/no-mercy-no-malice/alexa-how-can-we-kill-brands|raised</url>\u00a0the issue in an article.\u00a0</p><p>\"There was an interesting piece by Professor Galloway who talked about Alexa,\" Peltz said. \"If you go to Alexa and say \"Alexa I want batteries, she would offer Amazon batteries.

The study asked whether regulators should focus more attention on large firms that acquire smaller ones before they can become large rivals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Federico Diez, an economist in the IMF's Research department, noted that when a large firm acquires a smaller one, the merger will typically fall under the radar screen of antitrust authorities. However, it is possible--even likely in some cases--that the acquired business could have become a serious competitor for the buyer.</p><p>\"If this were the case, then the acquisition would be preventing competition in the future so maybe it would have been better for the acquisition not to take place from a competition standpoint,\" Diez wrote in an emailed response to an interview request.\u00a0\u00a0\"Of course, the really hard part is to determine the counterfactual that is, we don't what would have happened with the tiny firm had it not been acquired-this uncertainty is why we call for caution and we think of this as an open question.\"</p><p>The technology sector is clearly the most obvious industry where acquisitions appear to be killing off rivals--the biggest tech companies have made a spate of acquisitions in recent years.

(GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Facebook Inc. (FB), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Amazon.com Inc.

It looks at quality, innovation. Consumer welfare means, 'does the consumer actually win from this conduct,'\" he said.</p><p>Yet Delrahim\u00a0also suggested that the DOJ couldn't just block a big acquisition of a smaller company without finding first that it was an anticompetitive deal. \"Most people don't fully appreciate that it is Congress that writes the laws,\" Delrahim said. \"We have prosecutorial jurisdiction but we don't write the laws.\"</p><p>He said antitrust rules look at whether a combination would substantially lessen competition. \"Are they competitors? Now sometimes, when you make an acquisition, the synergies of those two could actually make a better product that benefits consumers that otherwise would not be there,\" Delrahim said.\u00a0</p><p>Delrahim countered that some observers have argued that Snap Inc. (SNAP), the company behind the SnapChat app, could have been a better competitor had a big company acquired them and provided \"funding and technical capabilities.\"\u00a0</p><p>In contrast, activist Nelson Peltz of Trian Fund Management and others have raised concerns about Amazon's mpact on Diapers.com, before the company was acquired and later shut down by the e-commerce giant. Peltz also said that he thought that at one point the government would step in and do something about Amazon's size.</p><p>\"Until there is a real competitor to Amazon I am concerned and I think that at one point in time the government will step in and do something about it. I am concerned that they control prices,\" Peltz <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/14443980/index.dl|said\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/14443980/index.dl|said</url>\u00a0at a Reuters\u00a0event last year. \"Amazon does disturb me, until there is a real competitor I am concerned.\"</p><p>DOJ's Delrahim declined to comment on Amazon but noted that the agency has power to take action to block \"predatory pricing.\"</p><p>\"The issue of what's called 'predatory pricing' is certainly a recognized theory in antitrust law,\" Delrahim said. \"Are you doing something where you are making the pricing practice below the market to drive out a competitor in order to then replace them and raise prices. If the evidence is there\u00a0that is something that\u00a0is actionable.\"</p><p>Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, an advocacy organization focused on corporate concentration issues, contends that the Facebook's $19 billion 2014 purchase of WhatsApp, a phone messaging and web service, should have been rejected and should be unwound.</p><p>\"WhatsApp is a direct competitor to Facebook messenger,\" Hubbard said in a telephone interview.\"Whenever there is a critical mass of users communicating on one platform there's a good chance it's a competitive threat to Facebook.\"</p><p>Delrahim noted that the Federal Trade Commission reviewed and approved the Facebook-WhatsApp deal, suggesting that regulators took the issues raised by critics under consideration.</p><p>\"If there was evidence [suggesting a deal would] lessen competition, or forestall competition or maintain somehow a market position, a monopoly position--that someone would acquire a business out of fear that the rival was going to erode that market position; those are all actionable under antitrust laws,\" Delrahim said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">For more coverage like this</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://thedeal.com/preferencesform|sign\">http://thedeal.com/preferencesform|sign</url> up for the Activist Daily.</emphasis></p><h>DEAL SIZE</h><p>$ 50 Billion and Up</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DADEAL-14941958</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DADEAL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W23-4W91-JBSN-100K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244689</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1071\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Deal, L.L.C.

It has the dominant search engine, the world's biggest web browser - Chrome - the most popular mobile operating system, Android, and the top mapping operation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, the DoJ's suit - the biggest against a tech company since it filed an antimonopoly case against Microsoft in 1998 - is expected to focus on Google's dominance of search, and the ads that power it.</p><p>The case is part of a sweeping crackdown on tech giants, including Apple and Facebook, which rivals and regulators claim use their immense power to tilt the market in their favour, suffocate competitors, distort society and limit free speech.</p><p>In addition to the impending action, William Barr, the US attorney general, last week sent a draft law to Congress that would shrink an immunity shield that frees social media giants like Facebook and YouTube of liability for content posted by users. The law, called Section 230, is shaping up to be a key battleground for Donald Trump's administration, which claims the tech behemoths censor conservative voices.</p><p>A group of Republican senators has called for a vote this week on whether to subpoena the bosses of Alphabet, Facebook and Twitter for a hearing on Section 230. Trump met Republican state attorneys general to discuss the issue.</p><p>The pressure is coming from customers and rivals as well. Barry Diller, the billionaire head of IAC, a tech holding firm that includes Expedia and dating app Match, last week dubbed Google an \"absolute monopoly\". He told The Washington Post that Expedia spent up to $5bn ((EURO)4.3bn) a year on ads with Google, but since the search giant started to build its travel business, Expedia's ads received less prominent placement.</p><p>\"Google is essentially competing with our services while taking our money,\" Diller said. \"I've said to most senior leaders at Google, 'We all are serfs in your universe, in your land. But it's wise to treat your serfs well, which I think you are increasingly not doing. Because if you let that go on for too long, the serfs tend to rise up and attack in hordes.' \" Google has denied any wrongdoing, claiming its products, which are offered for free, benefit consumers and support innovation. But Diller's critique is at the heart of the government's case against Google, and is what legal experts say is a vulnerability also for Apple.</p><p>Both companies are gatekeepers through which others must pass to reach billions of customers. Google, for example, handles 90% of all internet searches. The App Store and Google's Play store are the new shop windows. Apple estimated that in 2019, the App Store facilitated more than $500bn in sales.</p><p>To operate these marketplaces, the tech giants charge vast sums. However, they also sell their own products through those marketplaces, and set up the rules to favour their own.</p><p>Apple's App Store is ground zero. A group of tech firms last week announced the formation of a lobbying organisation called the Coalition for App Fairness. It includes the likes of Spotify, Diller's Match Group, and Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite that last month sued Apple over its App Store rules.</p><p>The group claims the 30% cut Apple takes on any purchase made through the store is unfair, not least because its own services, such as Spotify rival Apple Music or Arcade - a competitor to Epic - are not subject to the fee.</p><p>Diller said Apple's 30% fee was \"egregious\" , calling it a \"hostage payment.\"</p><p>Apple brings in an estimated $15bn a year from App Store fees and rules the marketplace with an iron fist, kicking out any developer that falls foul of the rules, such as requiring that all transactions go through Apple's payment system.</p><p>It is Google, however, that will be first in the firing line. The DoJ suit is expected to focus on search, the way the company operates its online ads system - the world's largest - and Android, where it forces licensees to preinstall the Chrome browser and other Google services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Rising up: Barry Diller, with Diane von Furstenberg</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-163481724</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XV-1NV1-DYTY-C153-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 27, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>CC0002E8D</classCode><className>EXPEDIA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
