The European Union's top court Wednesday ruled Uber Technologies Inc. must be regulated as a transportation service, a blow to the company's attempts to avoid taxi rules and licensing requirements.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ruling followed hard-hitting statements Tuesday by German and French regulators. Andreas Mundt, Germany's leading competition regulator who built a career on tackling beer and sausage cartels, attacked Facebook Inc. over its alleged misuse of user data. Across the border, France's privacy watchdog gave Facebook another headache, giving its Whats-App messaging app one month to stop sharing data with its parent.</p><p>And even last Friday, Italian authorities were ordering Amazon.com Inc. to pay $118 million (U.S.) to end a fiscal probe into tax evasion.</p><p>The announcements cap a year in which European authorities have battled with Silicon Valley's biggest technology companies.</p><p>Notable clashes include Apple falling out with Ireland over a 2016 decision to pay $15 billion in back taxes, Alphabet Inc.'s Google being hit with a record $2.8-billion fine over shopping ads and Facebook, Twitter Inc. and YouTube facing inquiries for the spread of extremist content and hate speech.</p><p>Perhaps the most poignant example of Europe's growing distrust of Big Tech came in September.</p><p>EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova branded Facebook's social network \"a highway for hatred\" and revealed how she deleted her own account on the social network.</p><p>There is little evidence to suspect 2018 will get any easier. Here are some of next year's looming battlegrounds: Google is facing more antitrust punishments related to its Android phone software and dominance in online advertising. A court will decide whether Uber should lose its taxi licence in London, the company's biggest European market. Facebook, in addition to the added antitrust scrutiny, will face increased pressure to crack down on misinformation and other harmful content on its platform, as will Twitter and YouTube.</p><p>New privacy rules going into effect in 2018 will give regulators in each European country more authority to fine technology companies for improperly collecting or sharing data on users. While proponents of the regulation say Europe is providing a much-needed check against the power of global tech companies, advocates for the industry say it undercuts the region's attempts to produce its own globally influential tech companies.</p><p>\"This is a blow to the EU's ambition of building an integrated digital single market,\" the Computer Communications Industry Association, an industry trade group, said, following the Uber decision.</p><p>What's unclear is the impact Europe's actions are having. Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all reported record results in 2017, showing the companies' business models are as healthy as ever - despite new fines and regulations.</p><p>While the U.S. has largely taken a hands-off approach to regulating the tech industry, that could change as its power grows. \"There is rising pressure in the U.S. to treat Big Tech more aggressively, but it is unclear if that effort will have success,\" said Michael Carrier, co-director of the Rutgers Institute for Information Policy and Law in New Jersey.</p><p>The biggest risk for Silicon Valley may be if Europe's approach is emulated. \"The rest of the world will look to the U.S. and Europe as the two pole stars guiding their analysis of Big Tech,\" Carrier said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2017122144517778</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R78-BFB1-JBTY-W0CD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"600\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 21, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00031BS</classCode><className>COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>AMZN (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>TWTR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813910MM</classCode><className>BUSINESS &amp;

As the pandemic forces millions of people to stay home to slow the spread of the disease, technology companies are seeing a surge in popularity that has the potential to reshape public opinion about Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With many offices and schools now closed, people are seeking out human connection using the same online tools that have been widely criticized for fostering digital addiction and loneliness. Employees have turned to video chats for workplace meetings and online happy hours. Parents who once fretted about how much time their children were spending on the internet are sourcing the best e-learning tools and organizing virtual play dates. Apple's FaceTime and Facebook's WhatsApp have suddenly become vital tools for families separated by travel restrictions and border closures. Amazon has become a go-to source for necessities such as groceries, toilet paper and diapers.</p><p>Tech companies have seized the moment to build goodwill, offering their vast computing resources and reams of data to hospitals, researchers and governments to help fight the pandemic. Earlier this week, Apple chief executive Tim Cook announced the company had used its global supply chain to source 10 million face masks to address shortages in the hardest-hit parts of the United States and Europe.</p><p>In an era of social distancing, tech platforms have suddenly become lifelines to the outside world in ways that are quickly recasting the debate about the perils posed by Big Tech. The shifting sentiment comes at an opportune time for major technology firms, which are facing a raft of regulatory investigations and have drawn bipartisan political scrutiny in the U.S. heading into a presidential election.</p><p>\"It's been really interesting to see the sea change in opinions and how people are saying: 'We have to turn to all of these digital ways to communicate now to stay connected,'\" said Jenna Clark, a senior behavioural researcher at Duke University's Center for Advanced Hindsight. \"What we should have been doing all along really is using these things properly.\"</p><p>By forcing people to use social media and other online platforms to remain in constant contact with friends, family and coworkers, the pandemic is actually encouraging people to use the technology in ways that are most likely to make us feel better, Dr. Clark said. That could sway the opinion of some digital skeptics. \"I do think we're going to come out of this generally as a society with a more positive attitude toward these sorts of companies.\"</p><p>Texas Christian University communications professor Andrew Ledbetter has spent a career studying how people use technology to maintain close relationships. But even he was shocked when a colleague he knew to be a tech skeptic signed up this week for a Facebook account. \"I kind of felt like the world was ending when I saw his name pop up as somebody that had sent me a friend request on Facebook,\" Prof. Ledbetter said. \"In a world where the pandemic didn't happen, that probably wouldn't happen.\"</p><p>The sudden rise in the number of people heading online has not erased all the problems of tech platforms, which have struggled to contain the spread of misleading posts about the novel coronavirus and ads pushing goods such as face masks and hand sanitizer at inflated prices. But with major tech firms facing multiple antitrust investigations in the U.S., the pandemic has given the industry a badly needed opportunity to build trust with lawmakers.</p><p>Changing public opinion about Big Tech could hold some sway with regulators, even if it's unlikely to alter the outcome of antitrust investigations, said Stanford University law professor Douglas Melamed. \"It would help their lawyers be trusted, their executives may be believed, but it's not going to change the views of the government as to whether their conduct violated the law.\"</p><p>At the same time, the growing centrality of tech companies as lifelines to people forced into physical isolation could end up working against the industry if companies fail to live up to their promises.</p><p>Already, tech firms are showing signs of faltering under the strain of increased demand. Amazon has said it would not accept new shipments of non-essential goods for several weeks as it struggles to meet a sharp rise in orders, drawing criticism from the third-party suppliers who rely on its distribution network.</p><p>\"To the extent that people start having problems with the tech platforms - or if Amazon starts becoming more and more disabled in terms of becoming the supplier to all of us - then sentiment could turn against them,\" Prof. Melamed said.</p><p>Thorny issues such as whether tech companies should have the power to ban people from their platforms take on added significance when social media becomes critical for work and daily life, said Dariusz Jemielniak, a professor of organization studies at Kozminski University in Poland and a visiting scholar at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. \"It's amazing that they're supporting society at this time of need. But I think it is showing very clearly that they are so big that there's no alternative.\"</p><p>Still, Prof. Jemielniak and others say tech platforms can learn from how people use their technologies amid the pandemic to develop new tools that can help people stay connected in more positive ways.</p><p>For lawmakers, the lessons from the pandemic may clarify exactly which technologies and business practices are most harmful to society and must be regulated and which ones may actually be beneficial. \"I think we can both appreciate Facebook or Instagram for how it connects us to other people while also questioning some of the privacy policies or surveillance policies or use of information that can occur through those technologies,\" Prof. Ledbetter said.</p><p>The experience may also help clarify when we can use technology to foster real-life relationships and when it simply falls short, he said. \"We still can't give somebody a hug online. That's still something you've got to be face to face to do.\"</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-silicon-valley-gets-used-to-its-new-role-as-digital-saviour-as/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-silicon-valley-gets-used-to-its-new-role-as-digital-saviour-as/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20200327composer_VCIBLSHXBRCWBFBDGKWHFGEBN4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605J-7PH1-F072-J15S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1071\"/><timeReceived>8:14 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Employees have turned to video chats for workplace meetings and online happy hours. Parents who once fretted about how much time their children were spending on the internet are sourcing the best e-learning tools and organizing virtual play dates.</p><p>Apple's FaceTime and Facebook's WhatsApp have suddenly become vital tools for families separated by travel restrictions and border closures. Amazon has become a go-to source for necessities such as groceries, toilet paper and diapers.</p><p>Tech companies have seized the moment to build goodwill, offering their vast computing resources and reams of data to hospitals, researchers and governments to help fight the pandemic. Earlier this week, Apple chief executive Tim Cook announced the company had used its global supply chain to source 10 million face masks to address shortages in the hardest-hit parts of the United States and Europe.</p><p>In an era of social distancing, tech platforms have suddenly become lifelines to the outside world in ways that are quickly recasting the debate about the perils posed by Big Tech. The shifting sentiment comes at an opportune time for major technology firms, which are facing a raft of regulatory investigations and have drawn bipartisan political scrutiny in the U.S. heading into a presidential election.</p><p>\"It's been really interesting to see the sea change in opinions and how people are saying: 'We have to turn to all of these digital ways to communicate now to stay connected,' \" said Jenna Clark, a senior behavioural researcher at Duke University's Center for Advanced Hindsight.</p><p>\"What we should have been doing all along really is using these things properly.\"</p><p>By forcing people to use social media and other online platforms to remain in constant contact with friends, family and coworkers, the pandemic is actually encouraging people to use the technology in ways that are most likely to make us feel better, Dr.</p><p>Clark said. That could sway the opinion of some digital skeptics.</p><p>\"I do think we're going to come out of this generally as a society with a more positive attitude toward these sorts of companies.\"</p><p>Texas Christian University communications professor Andrew Ledbetter has spent a career studying how people use technology to maintain close relationships. But even he was shocked when a colleague he knew to be a tech skeptic signed up this week for a Facebook account. \"I kind of felt like the world was ending when I saw his name pop up as somebody that had sent me a friend request on Facebook,\" Prof. Ledbetter said.</p><p>\"In a world where the pandemic didn't happen, that probably wouldn't happen.\"</p><p>The sudden rise in the number of people heading online has not erased all the problems of tech platforms, which have struggled to contain the spread of misleading posts about the novel coronavirus and ads pushing goods such as face masks and hand sanitizer at inflated prices. But with major tech firms facing multiple antitrust investigations in the U.S., the pandemic has given the industry a badly needed opportunity to build trust with lawmakers.</p><p>Changing public opinion about Big Tech could hold some sway with regulators, even if it's unlikely to alter the outcome of antitrust investigations, said Stanford University law professor Douglas Melamed. \"It would help their lawyers be trusted, their executives may be believed, but it's not going to change the views of the government as to whether their conduct violated the law.\"</p><p>At the same time, the growing centrality of tech companies as lifelines to people forced into physical isolation could end up working against the industry if companies fail to live up to their promises.</p><p>Already, tech firms are showing signs of faltering under the strain of increased demand.</p><p>Amazon has said it would not accept new shipments of non-essential goods for several weeks as it struggles to meet a sharp rise in orders, drawing criticism from the third-party suppliers who rely on its distribution network.</p><p>\"To the extent that people start having problems with the tech platforms - or if Amazon starts becoming more and more disabled in terms of becoming the supplier to all of us - then sentiment could turn against them,\" Prof. Melamed said.</p><p>Thorny issues such as whether tech companies should have the power to ban people from their platforms take on added significance when social media becomes critical for work and daily life, said Dariusz Jemielniak, a professor of organization studies at Kozminski University in Poland and a visiting scholar at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. \"It's amazing that they're supporting society at this time of need. But I think it is showing very clearly that they are so big that there's no alternative.\"</p><p>Still, Prof. Jemielniak and others say tech platforms can learn from how people use their technologies amid the pandemic to develop new tools that can help people stay connected in more positive ways.</p><p>For lawmakers, the lessons from the pandemic may clarify exactly which technologies and business practices are most harmful to society and must be regulated and which ones may actually be beneficial. \"I think we can both appreciate Facebook or Instagram for how it connects us to other people while also questioning some of the privacy policies or surveillance policies or use of information that can occur through those technologies,\" Prof. Ledbetter said.</p><p>The experience may also help clarify when we can use technology to foster real-life relationships and when it simply falls short, he said. \"We still can't give somebody a hug online. That's still something you've got to be face to face to do.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20200328nwwocoronavirusbigtech</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6059-3X71-F06S-31CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1020\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

It also states that is it hard to figure out how much the human-level AI could benefit society as it is hard to imagine how much damage could be brought by it to the society in case it is used in a wrong way.</p><p>Later in the interview, Musk said that he would formally announce a Mars colonization mission plan next year, now under the name of the Mars Colonisation Transport program.

He stressed that the focus was on developing technologies that augment humans rather than replace them.</p><p>Elon Musk and other wealthy technologists are pouring $1 billion into a new project called OpenAI that will be tasked with advancing artificial intelligence for the sake of benefiting humanity. At Google, Sutskever's work included research into the technology that became Smart Reply, the auto e-mail-writing feature, as well as systems that can learn to write their own algorithms. In their introductory blog post, OpenAI also describes themselves as an \"extension of individual human wills\" and \"in the spirit of liberty\", perhaps suggesting that the organisation has politically libertarian values.</p><p>The New York Times reports that the chief technology officer of OpenAI will be Greg Brockman, the former chief technology officer of Stripe. The research director will be Google's machine expert Ilya Sutskever. It has accomplished AI researchers from NYU, UC Berkeley and Stanford. The letter said that the arms race of the future could be run by these affordable autonomous weapons if they were to fall into the wrong hands and could cause a number of atrocities. They have expressed their concerns about mismanagement of technology, but doubt that it would ever be as serious as a \"Terminator\" like future.</p><p>Elon Musk and other prominent tech industry executives are backing a non-profit AI research company with funding of $1 billion.</p><p>But OpenAI isn't the first nonprofit with big tech ties aimed at finding positive uses for artificial intelligence. 2015 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FISVMW-63313381</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FISVMW2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HNM-XYK1-F11P-X3SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"405\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">Syndigate.info</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Financial Services Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35457\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"12\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>December 22, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000CTM6</classCode><className>LINKEDIN CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>LNKD (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001220</classCode><className>NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

growing advocacy group is quietly organizing a right-leaning coalition of the nation's tech elite to wield greater influence in Silicon Valley, amid growing concerns that Big Tech has turned on conservatives.</p><p>The Lincoln Network's invitation-only  gathering meets quarterly in Menlo Park, California, which is also home  to Facebook's headquarters, bringing together dozens of computer  engineers, software developers, and activists from every corner of the  tech universe.</p><p> Garrett Johnson, a co-founder of Lincoln  Network, said the effort was a first of its kind and already making  waves in a region famous for rocking the status quo.</p><p> \"We think it's really important to try to  bring people together who believe in free markets and a light-touch  approach,\" Mr. Johnson said.</p><p> The closed-door meetings' existence has not previously been made public.</p><p> The Lincoln Network, which first added  full-time employees in 2016, bills itself as the \"largest community of  tech professionals devoted to building an alliance of liberty and  technology.\"</p><p> Among the tech policy issues the group  aims to address are government regulation, civil liberties and problems  surrounding the cost of living and housing.</p><p> Mr. Johnson noted that Silicon Valley  faces challenges from both the federal government in Washington and the  state government in Sacramento, such as the recently passed labor law AB  5 that codified criteria on who qualifies as contractors as opposed to  employees.</p><p> The group's first meeting of 2020 will be  held next month and feature a briefing from Club for Growth President  David McIntosh about his group's priorities in the 2020 elections.</p><p> Mr. McIntosh praised the Lincoln  Network's entrepreneurs, who he described as creating products, value  and jobs necessary to drive economic growth.</p><p> \"I'm looking forward to discussing the  policy and political challenges that conservatives face in creating  opportunities for all Americans, growing their businesses, and becoming  more politically active,\" he said in a statement. \"More and more,  conservatives think big tech is working against them, but it is the  Liberty Movement that will work to ensure the tech industry continues to  be an engine of innovation and prosperity for our country.\"</p><p> As the Lincoln Network aims to build  in-roads in the tech community and between Silicon Valley and  Washington, others are looking to drive a wedge between the political  right and tech leaders.</p><p> The liberal media relations firm  Unbendable Media helped organize an anti-Facebook campaign late last  year with groups such as liberal media watchdog group Media Matters and  Demand Justice, a liberal activist group focused on the judiciary.</p><p> The campaign was primarily concerned with  Facebook's interaction with right-leaning media figures, its  willingness to allow conservatives on its platform, and its sponsorship  of an event with the Federalist Society, an organization of  conservatives and libertarians that advocates for an originalist  interpretation of the Constitution.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

However, I don't believe this is a problem the government is equipped to fix. Silicon Valley is steeped in a grow-at-any-cost culture, which the government will find challenging to overcome due to its own flawed culture.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's begin with Silicon Valley. For years people were confused because Amazon's stock was soaring, but the company had yet to turn a profit. The rules had changed. Stock prices weren't based on price-to-earnings ratios, but instead what Peter Thiel refers to as \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/reidhoffman/status/928671227534745600?lang=en\">escape velocity</url>,\" when companies grow so big, so fast, that others in their competitive set can't keep up and eventually fall away.</p><p>However, we have rules in the US specifically to prevent companies from growing so big that competition is no longer promoted or protected, namely the <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act_of_1890\">Sherman Anti-Trust Act</url>. The Silicon Valley cultural obsession with achieving escape velocity and obliterating the competition is permanent, though. It's not an obsession that is present during the early years of a startup but then fades. It's an obsession that is part of these companies' cultures forever.</p><p>It's often thought that Silicon Valley's legend began at <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)\">Xerox PARC</url>, where the best and brightest cranked out numerous inventions we still appreciate today. While the legend may have begun at Xerox, I believe the culture began when Apple visited Xerox and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2017/01/15/steve-jobs-steals-from-xerox-to-battle-big-brother-ibm/#46a517ea12e0\">borrowed/stole</url> (depending on who you believe) the idea of the computer mouse for Apple's newest computer.</p><p>These questionable ethics continued when Bill Gates and Steve Jobs met, and Microsoft later used a graphical user interface eerily similar to what Jobs had shown him. Too coincidental, Jobs alleged in <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Microsoft_Corp.\">court filings</url> years later.</p><p>These weren't one-offs or extreme examples, though. This <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">is</emphasis> Silicon Valley's culture. Do we remember when Google was mapping its Street View product, only to be found <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/may/15/google-admits-storing-private-data\">stealing mountains of people's personal emails and documents</url> from their home Wi-Fi networks and called it a \"mistake?\" Or when Amazon \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://qz.com/1080389/a-dot-com-era-deal-with-amazon-marked-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-toys-r-us/\">partnered</url>\" with Toys 'R' Us to bring toys to the fledgling e-commerce site, only to make this a decision that later contributed toward their bankruptcy? Perhaps the worst example of growing at any cost is Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal. Here, another nation likely influenced the outcome of the US's 2016 presidential election - surely one of the nation's most sacred representations of freedom.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Read more: Let's stop glorifying managers who brag about their stress and exhaustion. Workaholic behavior should not be the norm.</emphasis></p><h>What has prevented the US government from acting and taming this behavior?</h><p>The US ranks <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index\">22nd on the Corruption Perception Index</url>, which is surprising to many. This is important because Washington will certainly think twice before biting the hand that donates to them before regulating big business. But other nations might not fear regulating. For example, Australia, ranked 13th in the CPI, recently       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/australia-to-set-out-proposals-to-rein-in-facebook-google-2019-7?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">announced plans</url> to rein in Facebook. The EU, with a number of countries like the UK and Germany ranking higher on the CPI, has also been far more aggressive in fining the U.S.'s largest tech companies with Margaret Vestager at the helm.</p><p>A primary example of the way this Washington culture manifests to (in)action is the $5 billion fine Facebook recently received. While the sum is more than their Q1 2019 earnings, the fine doesn't leave a lasting mark. Buried in the fine print, this fine <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ashk4n/status/1154027557055975424\">indemnifies Facebook</url> for any and all claims prior to June 12, 2019.</p><p>A $5 billion fine will not change the culture of Silicon Valley. It would take a fine more in the range of $100 billion, given to multiple companies, to force a change like this.</p><p>Recently, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.sg/business-roundtable-ceos-say-companies-must-serve-more-than-shareholders-2019-8/\">Business Roundtable convened</url> to try to push back against shareholder primacy and declare their company's purpose is to serve all stakeholders including customers and employees. Will this really be the case in Silicon Valley, though? The root issue here persists until Silicon Valley and Washington can both make a fundamental change. I don't see either, much less both, happening any time soon.</p><p>NOW WATCH: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ultimate-cross-country-us-road-trip-every-state-2015-5?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">This is the shortest route for a road trip across the US to see 50 national landmarks</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Also:</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/a-psychologist-shares-the-10-qualities-of-the-most-authentic-people-2016-9?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">10 qualities the most authentic and truly successful people share, according to a psychologist</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/airbus-a380-superjumbo-history-boeing-747-emirates-2017-11?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">The end is near for the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet.

First, I thought I'd been hacked. Then I discovered my 10-year-old son had racked up these charges buying virtual footballers to play in online games.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His devices have since been confiscated and passwords revoked, but according to Tristan Harris, a former Googler who has become an evangelist against the power of Big Tech, my son is not the only one who deserves time on the naughty stool.</p><p>Mr Harris is a graduate of Stanford's Persuasive Tech Lab who once engineered the kind of behaviour modification software that keeps people clicking on everything from games to Tinder dates to fake news. He believes we have reached a tipping point in which the interests of the largest tech firms - from Googleto Facebook - and the customers they supposedly serve are no longer aligned.</p><p>\"There's a reason why culture and politics are being turned inside out to become more ego-driven,\" he says. \"There's an entire army of engineers at all these firms working to get you to spend more time and money online. Their goals are not your goals.\"</p><p>Mr Harris has started a movement, called Time Well Spent, to try and push tech companies to change their business model, having left Googleafter deciding it was \"impossible to change the system from within\".</p><p>He's not the only techie in an existential crisis over the fact that software is being used to reshape election results or lure poor people into predatory loans.</p><p>Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist with Elevation Partners who was an early stage investor in Facebook (he still owns shares in the stock) as well as Amazon and Google, has also taken up the battle cry. He wants Big Tech to offer customers broad based opt-in and opt-out contracts around the tracking of data. He is also lobbying for government to create a kind of Food and Drug Administration-style regulatory body for \"highly manipulative, highly addictive technology\", to ensure that as with drugs, customers are not being sold things that actually hurt them.</p><p>It is all part of the increasing scrutiny around the economic and political power of Silicon Valley, which now controls the largest single chunk of corporate wealth. Recently, a number of politicians on both sides of the aisle have begun looking at whether such companies need to be regulated differently or even broken up.</p><p>While the concentration of market power has been rising in numerous industries over the past few decades, technology is a particularly stark example - Googlehas an 88 per cent market share in search advertising. Facebook (including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp) controls more than 70 per cent of media on mobile devices. Amazon has a 70 per cent share of the ebook market.</p><p>Thanks to online networks these dominant players can scale up faster than new entrants can add users. As a senior staffer for one high-ranking Democrat in Washington notes, their power is set to become \"the signature economic issue [for lawmakers] over the next five years, especially as automation increases and they make investments into other areas of the economy, like transportation and health\". Think not just of automated cars, but also of Google's collaboration with the UK's National Health Service, which allows the company access to sensitive medical records.</p><p>There is already a conversation in Washington about whether monopoly and antitrust law needs to be rethought for the digital age. In recent decades, falling consumer prices have been thought of as a sign of \"efficient\" markets; this plays to the strengths of tech groups that cut prices and give away products for free. But as University of Chicago Booth School professor Luigi Zingales points out: \"It's not that we don't pay for digital services - we do pay dearly, with our data, and our attention.\"</p><p>He and others believe we should go back to the original, broader interpretations of laws such as the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, which were essentially about limiting political power, and in particular, the ability of rich companies and people in coastal areas to control everyone and everything else. This is a theme that is becoming more familiar as Silicon Valley vies with Wall Street and Big Pharma as the top spender on political lobbying, which has so far been subject to extremely light-touch regulation.</p><p>While the EU, which has always been more proactive about protecting digital rights than the US, will probably continue to expand its thinking in this area, activists like Mr Harris believe that companies can and should get ahead of regulators, since they can effect change immediately by re-engineering their products.</p><p>Apple and Google, for example, could make any number of small tweaks to handsets that would allow consumers to better control their online experience, and set preferences rather than being unconsciously influenced to speed date, gobble false headlines or addictively kick a virtual ball. It is good advice to companies that are increasingly being seen not just as business threats, but moral hazards as well.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6uxt9i56awhwebh0jvw</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NJC-FSC1-F0J6-J45H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The show about data compression and venture-capital funding is a comedic take on the tech world. Showrunner, Mike Judge, consults startups and tech sites to make sure he's portraying all things tech in an accurate way.So, how much would CEO and founder of PiedPiper \u2014 a data compression startup \u2014 Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch) make if the HBO version of Silicon Valley[2] were true to life?  'Silicon Valley' Season 6 reveals how deep tech alliances runJimmy O. Yang, Amanda Crew, Martin Starr, T.J. Miller, Thomas Middleditch and Josh Brener | Gabriel Olsen/Getty Images While Middleditch isn't the founder [3]of a data compression startup, he plays one well. </p><p>His other roles in Godzilla: King of the Monsters, The Wolf of Wall Street, or any of the dozens before that stem back to 2008 couldn't have prepared him to play the anxiety-ridden tech wiz in the Bay's famed Silicon Valley.With the final season almost at its end, Middleditch's character Richard[4] has gone public with his intent to de-centralize the internet which he described as a 'peer-to-peer network of websites with no firewalls, no tolls, no government regulation, no spying.'

The final season begins 10/27.[5] A post shared by Silicon Valley[6] (@siliconhbo) on Oct 20, 2019 at 5:59pm PDT Along with that, he's taken the app, Foxhole, which is a platform for military personnel to solicit sex workers. The app is likened to Ashley Madison (remember that mess?), and it's a PR nightmare but the group forges on.This is after Maximo Reyes (Arturo Castro), a wealthy Chilean businessman and foreign national, attempted to gain control over PiedPiper when Richard rejected a $1 billion offer.Things likely won't play out the way Richard hopes (they rarely do), but even as a semi-incapable CEO, he surrounds himself with smart people who step up while he's vomiting from nerves.  Here's how much Richard Hendricks would make on 'Silicon Valley' View this post on Instagram       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B4k7dhfhXbA/?utm_source=ig_embed..._campaign=loading\">https://www.instagram.com/p/B4k7dhfhXbA/?utm_source=ig_embed..._campaign=loading</url> Blood Money Problems[7] A post shared by Silicon Valley[8] (@siliconhbo) on Nov 7, 2019 at 12:11pm PST;; When PiedPiper was a small startup (and before they obtained Hooli and the mega space for all the employees), Richard would've likely made a salary of around $50,000 a year, according to Business Insider[9]. They note that a lot of startup founders don't take a salary and instead put that money back into the business. Richard's role changed throughout the seasons. When he reached Chief Technology Officer status, his pay could've been upwards of $150,000.Because PiedPiper is based on a 'proprietary universal compression algorithm,' it's worth quite a bit, even when the business pivoted to a new business model with new tech.Some of the real-life companies HBO producers consulted with,Tsachy Weissman and Vinith Misra, and laterDmitri Pavlichin helped the discussions seen on Silicon Valley. Weissman even developed the Weissman Score, a new compression metric, for the show but real-life researchers began using it. Talk about a Hollywood dream come true; this PiedPiper website[10] is proof. How does Richard's pay compare to the rest of the characters' salaries?

His role is to grow the business through sales and opportunities and he was good at it. This is of course before he left Richard for Gwart.Dinesh Chugtai (Kumail Nanjiani) is a senior programmer. He's an integral part of building the main tech. His role pays around $94,000 a year outside of the Bay area. Inside the real Silicon Valley could garner him even more.

He brings home around $106,000 annually.Monica Hall (Amanda Crew)[17] was an associate partner with Raviga Capital before working for Richard. She likely made around $110,000 a year, plus performance bonuses. However, some fans on Reddit[18] say a successful venture capitalist (or associate) in Silicon Valley would likely make upwards of $300,000 to $400,000.As far as former CEO of Hooli, Belson, made, the show used Salesforce CEO, Marc Benioff as inspiration. Benioff's base salary is $1,550,000 a year, plus $3.9 billion in stock and other investments.

He spoke to TOI about why he's bullish on India, the ever-increasing power of big tech companies, regulation around cryptocurrency and his involvement in bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and the rest of America. Edited excerpts:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">YC's 2017 India intake numbers are the highest in any year. How's that happened?</p><p>We have been going to India for the last few years. We've been fortunate enough to be an investor in a few of the successful companies in India. These founders talk to the startup community there about us. We see this in all the markets across the world: Once we can get the first few wins in a new geography , that perpetuates in the local community and then people say , 'Oh, we've heard of them, founders said they were great'.</p><p>Will you look at setting up an India outpost?</p><p>Our goal is to take the 18 intakes in 2017 and keep increasing that number. We have no current plan to open an outpost, but I bet someday we would. That may be a few years off though.</p><p>Why are you bullish on the Indian startup ecosystem amid uncertainties?</p><p>I like to be bullish when everyone else is bearish.There are very few longterm investors, I think it is a big advantage for us that we are one. Most are chasing fashion or trying to make their LPs (limited partners) happy.</p><p>So what's wrong with the tech investing class?</p><p>It is not only about the way funds are structured but also about what they are expected to do that particular year. So if India is hot, they'd be in India. If India is cold, you don't want to be there. But we are excited and will happily make a lot of money in their absence.</p><p>When we met in 2015, a slug of money was coming into India. It's been tougher for startups to raise capital since then...</p><p>We try and not get caught up in what other investors do.The way I look at investing is that, on any given day , what the stock market or any other investor is doing is a random number generator. But over time it does converge to reality . We continue to believe that there is something real happening in India. Like any exciting new thing, there will be ups and downs, there will be bubbles and busts, but we try and take a very long-term view here and not get too distracted by the ups and downs.</p><p>You told me during the heady days that you were not as much worried about the eye-popping valuations as you were about the cash-burn across startups. Is it looking different now?</p><p>I don't know the current cash-burn situation at Indian startups. But in the US, in general it feels okay. There are plenty that are burning too much and will die.But on the whole, the burn is relative to the cash on hand, it's reasonable.</p><p>So, are we out of the bubble territory?</p><p>Bubblesare an interesting phenomenon -for bubbles to happen, there has to be something real for people to get too excited about. So, smart people get tricked by bubbles, very famously Isaac Newton fell for the South Sea bubble. Similarly , in India, there was something real going on, people got too excited and then they stopped. It's likely they will get excited again and then stop again. What's important here is that, in the next 20 years, is India a country that supports huge and important technology startups? And the answer is definitely `Yes'.So we will just ride the waves.</p><p>In India, e-commerce and some other consumer internet sectors are still cash-guzzling. Fighting Amazon needs capital...</p><p>Or, you don't have to fight them. There are plenty of other businesses to start where you don't have to burn $50 million per month. There are people who are experts in these businesses where you burn huge amounts of cash, and I'm not one of them. But there are many good companies that can be started that I understand, I just don't have instincts for e-commerce.</p><p>Which companies are you picking from India from the YC batches as the ones becoming big?</p><p>It takes 10 years to find that out, so I'll tell you after seven years.One of the things that has really surprised me about this business is that it takes really long to see results. We invested in Dropbox in 2007 -it is 2017 now and it's still a private company .</p><p>Away from startup investing, you've been very vocal about tech and politics. Tell us why?</p><p>One thing that's clear is how different the Bay Area and the rest of the country are -it's not a unique insight, but one that's extremely striking. So how do we make the tech industry benefit everyone? Poli tically, I think we need to get a bunch of new candidates. The approval ratings of the present government is really low and that of career politicians is even lower. My big effort is to find a lot of new candidates with new ideas and support these people because the world has changed so much with technology that we need</p><p>SoftBank. How's it impacting tech investing?</p><p>I expect it will change the dynamics of investing, but I don't know how yet!</p><p>What's your take on what happened over at Uber?</p><p>That is a mess of a situation and very complicated all around. I think, in general, this a government that can act very differently with a different set of laws.</p><p>You've also been supporting groups like Tech for Campaigns financially.Would you look to run for office or take up politics yourself?</p><p>I expect to fund candidates and organisations but do not want to take an active role. It's a side gig for me, not my main job. However, I did an interesting thought experiment. In the 1900s, Henry Ford created Model T and, say , a million jobs came as a result of it and these employees had enough money to buy a car. In 2005, Facebook created 10,000 jobs, each of these became millionaires here.</p><p>In 2010, WhatsApp created 36 jobs and was sold for $19 billion. I believe in 2017 there will be some startup that will create five jobs. You have this effect with technology -we are still building companies that are valuable, but it is concentrated into fewer and fewer jobs. This trend will keep going and our current politicians don't have any good ideas on how to remake the government structure. Tell us what you think of idea that there will be these very late-stage investors that will provide liquidity to earlier-stage investors is a good thing and it will happen.</p><p>You haven't been a fan of going public. Anything's changed?</p><p>I'm not a fan of going pub I'm not a fan of going public before you're ready as you have the pressure to do these short-term optimisations that are bad. I definitely think you should go public at some point, just not until your business model is mature.</p><p>When is a startup mature enough to go public? Is Airbnb good for an IPO?</p><p>They could go public. I don't know when they want to but they are at a stage that if they wanted to, they would.They know what they are doing, they have a solid revenue stream. Of course, they will keep innovating, but they have a nice competitive moat built up.</p><p>How do you see the impact of tech giants Amazon, Facebook and Google on young startups?</p><p>That is one of the new and interesting problems in the tech industry -you have these hyper caps that are so powerful. It won't last forever, the ecosystem would shift and new companies will emerge, but at the moment it is tough. That is something we think about at YC when we are inducting companies: Would this startup get crushed by Facebook? As a general rule, we like companies doing new things and not the ones with a derivative idea which Facebook can copy in one click. It's hard to build a business there. On the other hand, there are times when it's worked, like it did for Snapchat.</p><p>But Facebook's got it right with their acquisitions...</p><p>You could argue that Facebook has slipped up by letting WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat emerge. But on the other hand, you can say it's pretty impressive how right they have been about identifying the really big new social media platforms and buying them. At the time, everyone thought it was crazy .I remember when they were acquiring Instagram for $1 billion, everyone was shocked.But now it looks like the most brilliant move in the history of Facebook.</p><p>What are your views on these powerful tech majors being regulated by Washington?</p><p>I don't know exactly when Washington should regulate a company , it's a hard question. But at some point it has to and that's why there are antitrust laws, it's for a reason. So I wouldn't pretend to be an expert on that. It's the job of the company to be as big and successful as it can and it's the job of the government to say , 'Oh, that's too much'.</p><p>What about the issue of Russia meddling with the US elections and the heat on Google, Facebook and Twitter?</p><p>Who knows what happened, but in general there would be more of that. The internet is going to be the central battle ground for influencing hearts and minds, so we do regulation there.</p><p>For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTMS-61541133</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTMS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PYY-X1B1-DXJR-H51S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362627</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1547\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

He spoke to TOI about why he's bullish on India, the ever-increasing power of big tech companies, regulation around cryptocurrency and his involvement in bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and the rest of America. Edited excerpts:<br/> YC's 2017 India intake numbers are the highest in any year. How's that happened? We have been going to India for the last few years. We've been fortunate enough to be an investor in a few of the successful companies in India. These founders talk to the startup community there about us. We see this in all the markets across the world: Once we can get the first few wins in a new geography , that perpetuates in the local community and then people say , 'Oh, we've heard of them, founders said they were great'.<br/> Will you look at setting up an India outpost? Our goal is to take the 18 intakes in 2017 and keep increasing that number. We have no current plan to open an outpost, but I bet someday we would. That may be a few years off though.<br/> Why are you bullish on the Indian startup ecosystem amid uncertainties? I like to be bullish when everyone else is bearish.There are very few longterm investors, I think it is a big advantage for us that we are one. Most are chasing fashion or trying to make their LPs (limited partners) happy.<br/> So what's wrong with the tech investing class? It is not only about the way funds are structured but also about what they are expected to do that particular year. So if India is hot, they'd be in India. If India is cold, you don't want to be there. But we are excited and will happily make a lot of money in their absence.<br/> When we met in 2015, a slug of money was coming into India. It's been tougher for startups to raise capital since then... We try and not get caught up in what other investors do.The way I look at investing is that, on any given day , what the stock market or any other investor is doing is a random number generator. But over time it does converge to reality . We continue to believe that there is something real happening in India. Like any exciting new thing, there will be ups and downs, there will be bubbles and busts, but we try and take a very long-term view here and not get too distracted by the ups and downs.<br/> You told me during the heady days that you were not as much worried about the eye-popping valuations as you were about the cash-burn across startups. Is it looking different now? I don't know the current cash-burn situation at Indian startups. But in the US, in general it feels okay. There are plenty that are burning too much and will die.But on the whole, the burn is relative to the cash on hand, it's reasonable.<br/> So, are we out of the bubble territory? Bubblesare an interesting phenomenon -for bubbles to happen, there has to be something real for people to get too excited about. So, smart people get tricked by bubbles, very famously Isaac Newton fell for the South Sea bubble. Similarly , in India, there was something real going on, people got too excited and then they stopped. It's likely they will get excited again and then stop again. What's important here is that, in the next 20 years, is India a country that supports huge and important technology startups? And the answer is definitely `Yes'.So we will just ride the waves.<br/> In India, e-commerce and some other consumer internet sectors are still cash-guzzling. Fighting Amazon needs capital... Or, you don't have to fight them. There are plenty of other businesses to start where you don't have to burn $50 million per month. There are people who are experts in these businesses where you burn huge amounts of cash, and I'm not one of them. But there are many good companies that can be started that I understand, I just don't have instincts for e-commerce.<br/> Which companies are you picking from India from the YC batches as the ones becoming big? It takes 10 years to find that out, so I'll tell you after seven years.One of the things that has really surprised me about this business is that it takes really long to see results. We invested in Dropbox in 2007 -it is 2017 now and it's still a private company .<br/> Away from startup investing, you've been very vocal about tech and politics. Tell us why? One thing that's clear is how different the Bay Area and the rest of the country are -it's not a unique insight, but one that's extremely striking. So how do we make the tech industry benefit everyone? Poli tically, I think we need to get a bunch of new candidates. The approval ratings of the present government is really low and that of career politicians is even lower. My big effort is to find a lot of new candidates with new ideas and support these people because the world has changed so much with technology that we need<br/>SoftBank. How's it impacting tech investing? I expect it will change the dynamics of investing, but I don't know how yet!<br/> What's your take on what happened over at Uber? That is a mess of a situation and very complicated all around. I think, in general, this a government that can act very differently with a different set of laws.<br/> You've also been supporting groups like Tech for Campaigns financially.Would you look to run for office or take up politics yourself? I expect to fund candidates and organisations but do not want to take an active role. It's a side gig for me, not my main job. However, I did an interesting thought experiment. In the 1900s, Henry Ford created Model T and, say , a million jobs came as a result of it and these employees had enough money to buy a car. In 2005, Facebook created 10,000 jobs, each of these became millionaires here.<br/> In 2010, WhatsApp created 36 jobs and was sold for $19 billion. I believe in 2017 there will be some startup that will create five jobs. You have this effect with technology -we are still building companies that are valuable, but it is concentrated into fewer and fewer jobs. This trend will keep going and our current politicians don't have any good ideas on how to remake the government structure. Tell us what you think of idea that there will be these very late-stage investors that will provide liquidity to earlier-stage investors is a good thing and it will happen.<br/> You haven't been a fan of going public. Anything's changed? I'm not a fan of going pub I'm not a fan of going public before you're ready as you have the pressure to do these short-term optimisations that are bad. I definitely think you should go public at some point, just not until your business model is mature.<br/> When is a startup mature enough to go public? Is Airbnb good for an IPO? They could go public. I don't know when they want to but they are at a stage that if they wanted to, they would.They know what they are doing, they have a solid revenue stream. Of course, they will keep innovating, but they have a nice competitive moat built up.<br/> How do you see the impact of tech giants Amazon, Facebook and Google on young startups? That is one of the new and interesting problems in the tech industry -you have these hyper caps that are so powerful. It won't last forever, the ecosystem would shift and new companies will emerge, but at the moment it is tough. That is something we think about at YC when we are inducting companies: Would this startup get crushed by Facebook? As a general rule, we like companies doing new things and not the ones with a derivative idea which Facebook can copy in one click. It's hard to build a business there. On the other hand, there are times when it's worked, like it did for Snapchat.<br/>  But Facebook's got it right with their acquisitions...<br/> You could argue that Facebook has slipped up by letting WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat emerge. But on the other hand, you can say it's pretty impressive how right they have been about identifying the really big new social media platforms and buying them. At the time, everyone thought it was crazy .I remember when they were acquiring Instagram for $1 billion, everyone was shocked.But now it looks like the most brilliant move in the history of Facebook.<br/>  What are your views on these powerful tech majors being regulated by Washington?<br/> I don't know exactly when Washington should regulate a company , it's a hard question. But at some point it has to and that's why there are antitrust laws, it's for a reason. So I wouldn't pretend to be an expert on that. It's the job of the company to be as big and successful as it can and it's the job of the government to say , 'Oh, that's too much'.<br/>  What about the issue of Russia meddling with the US elections and the heat on Google, Facebook and Twitter? Who knows what happened, but in general there would be more of that. The internet is going to be the central battle ground for influencing hearts and minds, so we do regulation there.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10251600</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PXS-WJ81-DYDW-73SD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1549\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 FFC Information Solution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 9, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIF8</classCode><className>BUSINESS INCUBATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001624</classCode><className>STARTUPS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0008X09</classCode><className>LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDFEQjUyNDAyMzQ0NDQyNUE5RjNGOEZEMzNBRDA1RUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjA4OEVGODBENzY4NDcxM0IyQzA1OTEwQzVDODRBOUE</classCode><className>Limited Partnerships</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DEW4</classCode><className>DIGITAL CURRENCY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIF8</classCode><className>BUSINESS INCUBATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN5F</classCode><className>ON DEMAND SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DEW4</classCode><className>DIGITAL CURRENCY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DKQR</classCode><className>SAM ALTMAN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000D25Y</classCode><className>SILICON VALLEY, CA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX142</classCode><className>NEW DELHI, INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GC304</classCode><className>INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The tax is unusual in that it impacts revenue, not profit. The 3% on French sales will impact about 30, mostly US-based companies with revenues of more than \u20ac750 million ($831 million), France's finance minister said. Trump ordered an investigation into the tax in July, which could result in retaliatory tariffs on France, including taxing the country's wine[1]. Several US tech companies have chimed in by submitting written evidence to support the US government investigation. </p><p>Some of these companies will testify at a government hearing on Monday. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[2]. Silicon Valley's leading players are gearing up to testify against France's new tax on tech at a US government hearing on Monday. Representatives from Google, Amazon, Facebook are set to make their case against the tax at the hearing, held by the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) in Washington. A lawyer representing Airbnb, Expedia, Salesforce, Microsoft, Stripe, and Twitter, as well as Google, Amazon, and Facebook will also appear. They are among the US tech companies that will be stung by the new, so-called digital services tax (DST), which would require companies with a revenue of more than \u20ac750 million ($831 million) to pay a 3% tax on sales of at least \u20ac25 million ($28 million) in France. The tax was approved by the French Senate in July[3] and will retroactively apply from 1 January 2019. France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has said that about 30, mostly US-based companies, will be hit by the tax and that it could raise more than \u20ac500 million[4] ($554 million) annually. This would amount to \"justice,\" he said[5]. Global tech companies are often accused of finding ways to avoid tax and critics say that they do so by paying most of their taxes in low-tax countries where they have their headquarters. Amazon's European headquarters are in Luxembourg, while Google's headquarters are in Ireland, but this doesn't necessarily reflect where these firms make the bulk of their European sales. Read more: Trump on course for new trade war with France over plans to slam US tech firms with giant new taxes[6] In July[7], Trump ordered an investigation into the proposed tax, which could result in retaliatory tariffs against France, including taxing the country's wine[8]. In a public notice, the USTR said France's tax was \"unreasonable\" and differs from the norms of the US tax system. It called out the proposal to tax revenue and not profit and the specific targeting of US tech firms. Facebook, Amazon, and Google are among the companies to have chimed in by submitting evidence[9] to support the US government's investigation. Peter Hiltz, Amazon's director of international tax policy and planning, said that the new tax is \"harmful\" and \"discriminatory\" in that it will apply to a \"small number of almost entirely non-French companies\" as it only captures firms with revenues of \u20ac750 million ($831 million) or more. He also said that it will have a knock-on effect on third-party sellers in France, which will now see their fees increase by 3%. \"The tax has the potential to impede the efforts of U.S. SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses) to grow and sell into France because it increases their cost of doing business. Selling partners may be forced to choose between increasing their prices, reducing their own costs, or stop selling entirely. The additional tax could result in lost sales, reductions in investment and output, and potentially even job losses,\" he wrote. Facebook's head of global tax policy Alan Lee said the firm \"strongly\" supports the US government's decision to investigate the plans in France and said that it will also be complicated for Facebook to comply with the new laws.NOW WATCH: I cleaned my entire apartment with 4 of Amazon's highest-rated cleaning robots, but I could've done a much better job myself[10]See Also: 9 visionary predictions tech execs like Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs made before 2000 that came true[11]This New York tech founder's startup raised $52 million to save small businesses from nightmare Yelp reviews.

The article was written by Tom Braithwaite[2]. Tom Braithwaite is the companies editor, managing the FT's business coverage. Based in London, he was previously a Lex columnist in San Francisco. Prior roles include US banking editor in New York and reporting positions in Washington, London and Paris. As I read it, I almost choked on my cappuccino as it was such a weird view for the FT to publish. </p><p>First, it was saying that banks are going through a Kodak moment[3] and I don't believe that banks will ever experience a Kodak moment, as banking is regulated far more tightly than photographs. It states that Apple Card is storming the markets, even though it's just been launched and is run by a bank (Goldman Sachs). And it reckons that Monzo, Revolut and N26 will transform the American consumer space, even though they are yet to arrive from Europe and have nothing to do with Silicon Valley. I hated the article. However, before I could write something, good friend Ron Shevlin wrote his view on Forbes. In a drop the microphone take-down, he ripped the article by Tom to pieces and has been kind enough to allow me to reproduce his column here. Enjoy and take note FT, you should be better than this. Silicon Valley Is Eating The Crumbs From The Banks' Lunch[4]by Ron Shevlin OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FINTECH SNARK TANK A recent Financial Times article titledSilicon Valley is eating the banks' lunch[5]claimed (among other things) that 'traditional lenders risk having their Kodak moment.' The article makes a number of assertions about the impact fintech startups and Big Tech firms are having on the banking industry-and some of the claims are just flat out wrong. The Apple Card The Financial Times article states: Back in 2014, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon warned that Silicon Valley was coming to eat the banks' lunch. The technology companies are now starting to chow down.The clearest example is the just-launched Apple Card, a virtual interface on the iPhone to help keep track of spending and a physical titanium card for fashion victims.The damning thing for traditional banks is not that they can be outgunned by Apple but that\u2014despite all their resources and expertise\u2014they can still be outclassed by a few kids with a nicely designed app.' My take:It's a bit early-and misguided-to say that the Apple Card is 'chowing down' on traditional banks. First off, the card soft-launchedlast week, with Apple sending invites to apply to people who had pre-registered.Second, it's not even clear that all these people will actually apply and get approved. According to research conducted byCornerstone Advisors[6], almost a quarter of Millennials intend to apply for the new card. Interest in the card drops off sharply among the older generations, however: just 14% of Gen Xers and 7% of Boomers intend to apply for the card. If the Millennials who said they'll apply for the Apple Card actually do (and are approved),Apple will have the second-highest market share among 20-something Millennials behind Capital One, and third-highest market share among 30-something Millennials, tied with American Express behind Capital One and Bank of America. But Will AppleAttractGoodCustomers? Of the consumers who expect to apply for an Apple Card, about one in five don't currently have any credit cards-the Apple Card would be their first. The majority (54%) of these potential first-time credit cardholders are sub-prime consumers with a self-reported credit score below 680. In addition, among the expected Apple Card applicants who currently have a credit card, a quarter of them have a credit score below 680.Withcredit card charge-offs[7]at a seven-year high, this might not be a goodtime for Apple to issue credit cards to subprime consumers. The Apple Card Still Has a Rewards Hurdle To Overcome For all of its innovation in the application and activation processes, the Apple Card still has one bigweakness: Inferior rewards. Generally speaking, successful credit cards address one of three consumer segments: Those looking for rewards, those looking for a low interest rate, or those choosing a card based on an affinity. It could be argued that the Apple card is an affinity play, appealing to Apple fanboys (and girls). But if that were the case, then Apple's Barclaycard would be the card of choice for many of them. I haven't seen any numbers reflecting the uptake of that card. The cynic in me says that means it hasn't been very successful. As with other retailers' card offerings, consumers making Apple purchases are good candidates for the cards. But increasingly, they have other options to finance their purchases, like Apple's POS financing option through Citizens Bank. So, if it's not an affinity card, the new Apple card will compete in the rewards space. Good luck with that. There are a ton of 2% cash back cards already on the market, and a slew that do a whole lot better than that. Bottom line:It's way to early to claim that Apple is eating traditional banks' lunches with its new credit card. Even if it does succeed at stealing market share, let's not forget that there's a traditional bank-Goldman Sachs-behind the scenes doing the issuing and risk management work. TheNeobanks The Financial Times article states: The damning thing for traditional banks is not that they can be outgunned by Apple but that\u2014despite all their resources and expertise\u2014they can still be outclassed by a few kids with a nicely designed app. N26, a Berlin-based digital bank founded in 2015, has signed up 3.5m clients in 24 countries, launched in the US last month and has attracted a $3.5bn valuation.Revolut, a UK-based fintech founded the same year, has amassed 6m customers and a $1.7bn valuation.Monzo, a UK fintech that started by offering a pre-paid debit card, then a current account, this week moved into short-term loans.' My take:Congrats to the Euro neobanks-who don't really qualify as 'Silicon Valley' firms-on their valuations. Sustaining those levels may be difficult, however, as they launch their invasions into the United States. Tenyears after the launch of neobanks in the US, just 3% of Millennials have their primary checking account at a digital bank like Simple, Chime, or Moven according to Cornerstone Advisors. And not surprisingly, that percentage drops to 1.5% ofGen Xers, and 0.8% of Baby Boomers. Just as important, deposits held at seven of the leading neobanks total $1.68 billion, about 0.014% of all deposits held in US banks. Consumers open accounts at digital banks for three predominant reasons: Q2 2019 survey of 2,506 US consumers CORNERSTONE ADVISORS 20-something Millennials predominantly look for better financial management tools than they get with their primary bank. 30-something Millennials are nearly equally split between those looking for better debit card rewards, better interest rates, and better financial management tools. Gen Xers and Baby Boomers seek better interest rates than they get from their primary bank. Bottom line:The numbers don't add up to banks getting their lunch eaten. And it's not a given that the neobanks-even if they do have nicely designed apps developed by kids-can attract and keep real business (i.e., not just email signups and app downloads) with superior rates, rewards, and tools. Chase's Canadian Retreat The Financial Times article states: Last week JPMorgan Chase [came] up with something that was genuinely compelling. The largest US bank, which is closing a credit card business in Canada, simply wiped the balances of remaining customers. 'It is hardly a sustainable perk\u2014and it shows the largest US bank on the retreat. It also offers another opportunity for the insurgents, fueled with billions in venture capital funding, to take on the lumbering incumbents.' My take:What Chase did in Canada isn't 'genuinely compelling' and is hardly an example of a 'lumbering incumbent' in 'retreat.' Last year the 'lumbering' giant launched it's own digital bank, Finn. But it wasn't successful. Wanna know why? Because the parent's firm mobile banking capabilities is one of the best in the business. It's also important to note that many of the 'insurgents'-with their billions in funding-actually look to the 'lumbering incumbents' as potential clients and partners, not enemies. Bottom line:What Chase did in Canada was a bit surprising-most firms in their situation would just sell the portfolio to someone else. I don't know why Chase didn't do that-but it's hardly an example of a Silicon Valley firm eating the bank's lunch. The Financial Times Contradicts Itself? The Financial Times article states: There is little particularly revolutionary in most of the challengers' technology. The embarrassing fact for the entire fintech industry is that it has failed to take significant share of core banking activities despite a decade of a benign credit environment with banks hampered by theirrecovery efforts after the 2008 crisis.Many of the newcomers are plagued by poor customer service and attract the attention of regulators for weak controls.' My take:Finally, something I agree with. Despite this admission of fintech weakness, the article still goes on to assert: But like the analogue film manufacturers who had the ability to switch to digital but failed to invest, the banks seem to be having their Kodak moment.' This isn't an accurate assessment of the situation. Wade Coleman, Director of Content Strategy and Thought Leadership at Fiserv, reminded me on Twitter that: It's a myth that Kodak didn't invest in digital. They invested billions in digital photos early on. They just didn't see how far digital was going to eat into their core film business and got crushed under the weight of that old infrastructure.' Bottom line:It's somewhat astounding that after making all these claims about fintech and Big Tech firms eating the banks' lunch, the Financial Times would state that the insurgents have made little ground-in effect, disproving its own assertions. Someday, maybe those assertions will become truths. But it's not happening yet. Yes, it's true that Jamie Dimon did warnthat Silicon Valley was coming to eat the banks' lunch.

Over the past two years, residents have been advised to stay indoors on some days because of smoke from nearby wildfires. Another burning season is about to start in earnest. California\u2019s state government says climate change \u201chas created a new wildfire reality\u201d.</p><p>In the long term, many Silicon Valley offices could be flooded if \u2014 or when \u2014 sea levels rise by two metres. Protecting the Bay Area against floods and storms would cost <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-california-coast-storm-damage-20190313-story.html\"> an estimated $450bn</url>. Water shortages are also expected to worsen.</p><p>Yet few of Silicon Valley\u2019s amazing achievements have had a bearing on climate change. The world\u2019s most innovative place lacks answers to the world\u2019s existential problem. The contrast is striking, given that many tech employees worry about the issue.</p><p>The biggest companies act as if climate change is tangential. Although Google and Facebook power some or all of their data centres with renewable electricity, they rarely engage more broadly with their role in increasing global energy use.</p><p>Perhaps it\u2019s a clever ruse by Big Tech to demonstrate it isn\u2019t as powerful as politicians think: like a modern King Canute, it can\u2019t control the waves. More plausibly, it points to an underlying failure of the Valley.</p><p>Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal, liked to say, \u201c <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/founders-fund-the-future-2011-7?r=US&amp;IR=T\"> We wanted flying cars</url>, instead we got 140 characters.\u201d Actually we wanted clean energy; we got cryptocurrencies that use as much electricity as Argentina. We wanted sustainable transport, instead we got millions of car-hire drivers.</p><p>Where are the tech products that help us slow global warming, and adapt to a warmer world? At this rate, parts of the world will gain access to multiple food-delivery apps just as they lose access to clean water. Alexa, tell me why it\u2019s 100 degrees outside.</p><p>One problem is that Silicon Valley\u2019s model of venture capital \u2014 which works so well on some problems \u2014 cannot easily address climate change. It excels in developing software for the US market and then spreads globally.</p><p>Clean technologies require much more capital and engineering, and often the low-hanging fruit \u2014 such as retrofitting dirty factories \u2014 lies outside of the US. The best green tech start-ups are not concentrated in California, undermining the network effect on which the Valley is built.</p><p>After Al Gore\u2019s 2006 film <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">An Inconvenient Truth</emphasis>, one major venture capital fund, Kleiner Perkins, did bet heavily on clean tech \u2014 and fell from grace partly as a result. It didn\u2019t help that the US government failed to accelerate environmental regulation.</p><p>For years, this disengagement with climate change had one high-profile exception: Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk. Like Tom Cruise\u2019s character in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Top Gun</emphasis>, the electric car pioneer was a mixed blessing. You could replace fossil fuels \u2014 but only if you were as unique and as rich as he was.</p><p>There are a couple more examples now: Impossible Foods and Los Angeles-based Beyond Meat have started selling meat alternatives with lower carbon footprints. But Kleiner\u2019s John Doerr says much of the investment in environmental technology still comes from family offices, rather than conventional venture firms. A lot is riding on Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the $1bn clean tech fund led by Bill Gates.</p><p>The first generation of Valley entrepreneurs \u2014 William Hewlett, David Packard and Intel\u2019s Gordon Moore \u2014 spawned foundations with a strong environmental bent; the current generation has directed its giving elsewhere.</p><p>Of course the hard choices involved in stopping global warming don\u2019t fit well within the tech industry\u2019s usual optimistic, convenience-focused rhetoric. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai hardly mention climate change in speeches. Apple has hired a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa Jackson, to head its efforts, which include making suppliers use renewable energy. But the focus is still on mitigating the company\u2019s impact, rather than broader change.</p><p>Silicon Valley promises to tackle the world\u2019s biggest problems. When historians look back at our era, they may ask why the people with the most ambition, capital and appetite for risk failed to aim a little higher.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-16d3a9c4aebd11e98030530adfa879c2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN6-KG71-DXP9-93F4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"726\"/><timeReceived>12:56 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The company, he said, will now focus on private messaging, unifying its disparate messaging services. It was a remarkable statement from a company notorious for pushing the idea of sharing - and for committing no small number of privacy snafus in the name of that mission.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet, Mr. Zuckerberg's post also contained an unnerving truth. Here was a chief executive with an unprecedented amount of power talking about essential changes to the messaging infrastructure for a couple billion of people. Such is the scale of the digital revolution: Decisions made by an alarmingly small number of people on the U.S. West Coast have global implications.</p><p>Companies such as Google, Facebook, and Apple have userbases in the billions. Not only is this historically unprecedented, it's also more people than live in any single country. This - along with Big Tech's sheer scale, with profits in the billions and with margins dwarfing similarly sized companies - gives them incredible power, which has collided with politics as we understand it, and democratic life itself. That has been further exacerbated by its impetuous \"break things\" culture: It has expanded its lobbying efforts to influence and guide policy, to the extent that some critics feel they've exceeded the definition of traditional lobbying, and now have political jurisdictions at their mercy.</p><p>Consider the past 12 months alone. Amazon's highly public, reality-show-style process to select a new site for a second headquarters prompted cities across North America to prostrate themselves at its feet. Mayors humiliated themselves with Pollyanna boasts about their cities' benefits, as they cajoled Amazon with big tax breaks and incentives. When the company finally chose to build the headquarters in Virginia and Queens, N.Y., the latter deal faced an uprising from the neighbourhood, and Amazon simply took its ball and left, leaving the city and state's politicians bereft. This is part of a trend: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/technology/amazon-new-york-politics-jobs.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/technology/amazon-new-york-politics-jobs.html</url>, Amazon has applied its huge weight to jurisdictions across the United States, getting its way by threatening to pull up stakes and take jobs with them. South Carolina, Texas and even Seattle have eventually caved to Amazon's demands to avoid sales taxes in exchange for opening or maintaining facilities in those areas.</p><p>If Amazon wields jobs as a kind of cudgel, Facebook's influence is less concrete. Its role as a kind of communication infrastructure means it is less directly responsible for the economic welfare of a given place than part of its social health. The manner in which the company plays home to discourse of all sorts makes it an arena for connection, but also a place for political subterfuge, anti-vaccine or conspiracy theories, and bigotry of all shades. The social network has played a role in violence in Myanmar, and in communal tensions in India through its WhatsApp messaging service. But while a 2018 post-Cambridge Analytica reckoning made the spectre of social-media regulation and privacy enforcement a real threat, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/02/facebook-global-lobbying-campaign-against-data-privacy-laws-investment\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/02/facebook-global-lobbying-campaign-against-data-privacy-laws-investment</url> to pre-empt this, using data centres as a lure in places such as Malaysia and Canada. Mr. Zuckerberg may be earnest about his desire for a new approach for Facebook, but the reported actions of his company should make us skeptical about its motives.</p><p>A concentration of powerful companies is nothing new. The idea of petro-states is firmly in our political-science lexicon, and multinational companies in industries such as aerospace, pharma and telecom have long lobbied governments for sweetheart deals. But with Big Tech, the scale is far vaster, and the sociological impacts far deeper. So is it time to worry about not just a so-called technostate, but a tech supra-state, where companies supersede the state altogether?</p><p>Tech is not merely a business sector, but an increasingly powerful player in the way in which states are run, organized and experienced by citizens. Beyond Facebook and Amazon, there is of course Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which is currently embroiled in a bitter public-relations war with activists who oppose a project by its subsidiary Sidewalk Labs to redevelop Toronto's Quayside neighbourhood. Sidewalk Labs is being accused not simply of using the project as a data-mining operation, but also as a Trojan horse to have private companies become part and parcel of modern urban development, sharing a percentage of taxes and other revenue as it also profits from the running of a city.</p><p>We are faced with a remarkable situation in which a conglomeration of private companies both own a significant part of modern social infrastructure, but are also lobbying to extend that power into other spheres: urbanism, education, governance and more. Tech has already placed new demands on state infrastructure itself. At its peak, cryptocurrency consumed an enormous amount of power, almost as much as the entire country of Ireland. Autonomous cars will force cities to adapt their design, while the advent of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, gene editing and other technologies all pose enormous challenges - and each will come with its own army of well-funded lobbyists, pockets full of Silicon Valley cash and with the best interests of societies not necessarily at the forefront of their minds.</p><p>In one way, of course, these changes are just part of how technology and societies typically adapt through what people feel, in the moment, are extraordinary times. Electricity, for example, went from a revolutionary private concern in which individual factories produced their own power, to more centralized, nationalized systems.</p><p>But if these are indeed extraordinary times, then they at least require similarly expansive, novel thinking. One such shift: It is necessary to understand tech's influence as far more sociocultural than it is material. The shift to digital has produced an array of new forms of culture, not just new forms of technology. The production of a public self through social networking, or persistent forms of connection, or new modes or formats of media - these are all akin to the changes wrought by the printing press, an invention that influenced far more than merely the distribution of information.</p><p>The question that lies ahead of us now: Since these changes are occurring, for whom and to whose benefit will they be directed? Modernity has, since its inception, been a back-and-forth between the needs of capital and those of the state. It was the amassing of vast amounts of wealth through colonialism that first posed a threat to Europe's monarchical tradition, leading to the rise of mercantilism and then capitalism. In subsequent centuries, similar patterns emerged: When power invariably consolidated around large, private stores of wealth or power, whether the Rockefellers or big telecom, the state would react in kind through regulation or nationalization.</p><p>But as we go through one of those pendulum swings again, a weakened state threatens the typical process. Successive U.S. governments have been reluctant to regulate digital companies for fear of stifling innovation, and both the Trump administration and FCC chair Ajit Pai are strident free-market boosters. That attitude is historical, part of a post-Reaganite shift toward neoliberalism that sees markets as both self-correcting and inherently good.</p><p>But a laissez-faire reliance on the wisdom of markets seems, in this instance, naive. Facebook's plan to sell itself as a privacy-focused company, for example, was potentially an act of subterfuge. In adding encrypted, private messaging to its repertoire, while also merging its WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger platforms, it has potentially headed off regulators who might seek to break the company apart or encourage citizens to consider some public or state-led role in digital social infrastructure. It would be a classic Facebook move: publicly state that it is doing something in the interest of its users, while carefully cementing its position as the world's most dominant social platform.</p><p>This is what should give us the most cause for concern: that this is not an issue related to a single country or a single company, but the globe itself. How individual states such as Canada deal with multinational companies that not only operate internationally but, in their very functioning, challenge the notion of physical borders, is a test that the current regulatory framework is ill-equipped to address. And as these companies poke and prod at the limits of the nation-state, with their truly global and active constituency of users, these companies will only be emboldened to push those limits further - and potentially disrupt governance altogether.</p><p>In the face of such a historic situation, a first step might be to view each of tech's moves with deep skepticism. A useful second one might be to fight back.</p><p>Fortunately, signs of revolt are appearing. This week, U.S. Senator and Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren put forth a plan for breaking up the tech giants. It is far from certain to succeed, but the mere fact that we must rely on a U.S. senator for salvation should force a recognition of what it is at stake. In the back and forth between the needs of companies and society, it's time to push back and defend our own interests. The pendulum, after all, doesn't swing on its own.</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-silicon-valley-isnt-just-a-technostate-its-something-much-bigger/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-silicon-valley-isnt-just-a-technostate-its-something-much-bigger/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20190308ellipsis_UPWUPT6MRNDWXKR5GWT6C3UX4I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKK-J1R1-F072-J2YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1663\"/><timeReceived>6:43 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Time magazine named Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg their person of the year in 2010, after Aaron Sorkin's film \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2010/10/04/real_lessons_social_network/\">The Social Network</url>\" became a blockbuster hit. In part due to the popularity of the iPhone 4, 2010 was also the beginning of the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2011/05/12/angry_birds_google_chrome/\">mobile app boom</url>. App developers were       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/business/as-boom-lures-app-creators-tough-part-is-making-a-living.html\">becoming overnight millionaires</url>. And Uber was then known as \"UberCab,\" a small San Francisco startup trying to get its       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/sf-appshow-gives-developers-leg-up-on-competition/\">rideshare app to stand out from the noise.</url> Startups were still considered a desirable place to work, and the general public was enamored by quirky tech office perks like ball pits and office kegs.</p><p>Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Unless Zuckerberg repents and becomes a Luddite, it is unlikely he will ever be perceived as anything more than a robotic boy-CEO. Sorkin, who was once captivated by Zuckerberg's story enough to make a movie out of it, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/opinion/aaron-sorkin-mark-zuckerberg-facebook.html\">described</url>Facebook's policy on allowing politicians to lie on its platform as \"assaulting the truth.\" Uber is now a multi-billion company whose rise has been tainted by sexism scandals, sexual assaults, and obscene exploitation of their workers. Working at a startup is no longer as novel as it used to be. Rather, workers at Silicon Valley companies, big and small, white collar and blue collar, have started to feel less coddled and more exploited, an energy they have channeled into an uprising - and one that has only just begun.</p><p>\"Major tech companies lost their positive sheen and tech workers found their voice\" in the 2010s, Ken Jacobs, the chair UC Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education Institute, told Salon in an email. \"Tech workers discovered that their companies were engaged in business activities that conflicted with their expressed values.\"</p><p>As my colleague Keith A. Spencer and I <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/04/11/silicon-valley-once-a-bastion-of-libertarianism-sees-a-budding-socialist-movement/\">wrote in 2019</url>, that shift in Silicon Valley really gained steam at the end of the decade. The industry, once a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2014/06/06/techs_toxic_political_culture_the_stealth_libertarianism_of_silicon_valley_bigwigs/\">bastion of corporate-friendly libertarianism</url>, has seen its politics change as tech workers become cognizant of the often subtle ways that their employers take advantage of them. Meanwhile, many tech companies took contracts from the defense industry and oil and gas, industries that most in the Valley see as irredeemable. In the case of Google parent company Alphabet, Jacobs notes that the company belied its motto, \"do no evil,\" by \"working on robotic military systems, assisting censorship in China and ignoring sexual harassment by executives - all of which became the focus of worker protests.\"</p><p>In 2018, after the New York Times published a report claiming that Google paid out $90 million to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/10/26/google-rewards-abusive-executive-with-8-figure-exit-package/\">one of its executives</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">after</emphasis> he faced sexual assault allegations, workers organized a massive walkout. An estimated 20,000 Google employees walked off the job in protest in November 2018. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, tech workers helped organize for Proposition C which would       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/10/29/tech-companies-spending-millions-to-oppose-san-franciscos-homelessness-tax/\">raise the gross receipts tax</url> by an average of 0.5 percent for businesses that earn more than $50 million a year. As a result, nearly $300 million would go toward homelessness initiatives. Many supporters of the proposition worked at companies whose top executives       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/11/02/defying-their-overlords-more-techies-are-organizing-for-affordable-housing/\">opposed the measure</url>, signaling tensions between the average worker and the C-suite. At the time, one tech worker told Salon she was supporting the proposition despite working at a company that was advocating against it. \"I'm being well compensated now, but how long will that last?\" she       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/11/13/instacart-cut-bonuses-after-a-strike-workers-suspect-its-retaliation/\">said</url>. \"I have a sense I'm closer to homelessness than a jackpot liquidation.\"</p><p>Jacobs added that wealth accumulated by a small number of investors and owners of tech companies contrasts sharply with growing homelessness in places like the Bay Area. Even well-heeled tech workers felt distanced from being part of such wealth, in part thanks to the high cost of living in the Bay Area.</p><p>\"We also saw growing solidarity across the tech companies' workforce,\" Jacobs said of the labor pains of the 2010s. \"Highly paid engineers supported the successful efforts by contracted cafeteria workers, janitors and bus drivers to organize into unions and push the tech companies to agree to higher wages.\"</p><p>The popularity of social media platform Facebook has declined in part due to its role in serving as unwitting propagandist in grave political and economic matters. To wit: Facebook ennobling <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/06/12/does-far-right-group-project-veritas-violate-facebooks-policies_partner/\">far-right groups</url> promoting violence; being complicit in spreading conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook massacre, which resulted in some       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/04/17/sandy-hook-families-sue-infowars-conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones-for-defamation/\">parents of Sandy Hook victims</url> receiving death threats; the platform's role in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/12/20/were-black-voters-bamboozled-by-russia-its-nowhere-near-that-simple/\">foreign manipulation of the 2016 U.S. election;</url> and Myanmar military personnel who used the social network to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2017/11/05/tragedy-of-the-rohingya-the-burmese-crisis-and-the-nation-state/\">incite genocide,</url> to name a few. Many Facebook workers have felt ethically compromised by their company's wrongdoing, leading       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/02/facebook-employees-calling-former-colleagues-to-look-for-jobs-outside.html\">some to execute exit strategies.</url></p><p>\"Social media went from democratizing information to become a major channel for disinformation from autocratic regimes, and the 'sharing economy' turned out to be a strategy to avoid labor rights and evade taxes,\" Jacobs told Salon.</p><p>This is all to say the next decade is primed for a vast uprising among tech workers, nearly all of whom are not unionized and ripe for organizing. Many historic unionization efforts were just getting started at the end of the 2010s. In September 2019, a group of 73 contract tech workers for Google in Pittsburgh <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/09/25/in-historic-first-tech-contractors-for-google-vote-to-unionize/\">voted to join the United Steelworkers.</url> That marked one of the few cases of white collar tech employees organizing and winning the right to bargain collectively. Employees at Kickstarter, a crowdfunding platform, signed union cards but are still working toward reognition, an effort that has not been       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9ken8v/kickstarter-workers-just-asked-for-union-recognition-despite-pushback-from-ceo\">free of tension</url> or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20863149/kickstarter-union-organizer-fired-retaliation-opeiu\">retaliation from the company.</url> Instacart workers ended the year with a series of actions and a strike to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/11/13/instacart-cut-bonuses-after-a-strike-workers-suspect-its-retaliation/\">demand higher wages.</url>California will be the first state to classify gig workers as full-time employees.

David McCabe, who covers tech policy in Washington, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What tech is most important for doing your job?</p><p>One element of covering policy is understanding what forces are pushing certain ideas forward in Washington. I often turn to government and private disclosure databases to help answer that question.</p><p>There\u2019s a lot of information a few clicks away: Congress<url normalizedValue=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=selectfields\">maintains</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=selectfields\">databases</url> of whom companies are paying to lobby on their behalf. The Justice Department       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=selectfields\">tracks which operatives</url> are registered to work for foreign firms. The service Guidestar collects the forms that influential nonprofits file with the I.R.S. describing their finances, and many prominent foundations list their grants online.</p><p>These records don\u2019t tell the full story, but they can be a source of valuable context when you\u2019re chasing a tip or trying to understand the landscape around a new issue.</p><p>I try to speak with sources where they are most comfortable. That can be on the phone, by text or encrypted message, or in person. Twitter\u2019s and LinkedIn\u2019s direct message features can be great ways to reach out to people.</p><p>For on-the-record interviews, I\u2019ve recently started using the automated transcription app Otter at the recommendation of other reporters. If I\u2019m doing an interview by phone, I use an Olympus earpiece that plugs into my recorder to capture the conversation.</p><p>How is Silicon Valley having an impact on Washington?</p><p>Washington has become intertwined with the Valley in lots of different ways.</p><p>Every major tech company has ramped up its presence here. Small armies of lobbyists work Capitol Hill and a vast swath of the administration to fight attempts to regulate the industry or to shape the rules when they become inevitable.</p><p>The revolving door between tech and Washington may have lost some of its luster \u2014 a job at Google or Facebook isn\u2019t as shiny as it used to be \u2014 but it is still functioning just fine. For example, Google just hired the chief of staff to Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, to lead its Washington office.</p><p>How do Washington folks use tech differently, compared with other parts of the country?</p><p>My unscientific conclusion is that the Washington metro area has the highest per-capita concentration of Twitter users whose profile photo is a shot of them appearing on cable news. Some of those people are my friends, and I would like to take this opportunity to urge them to reconsider.</p><p>How has the tech fluency among lawmakers changed, or not, over time?</p><p>Many lawmakers have become more fluent in tech \u2014 or at least more conversant \u2014 since the infamous <url normalizedValue=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=selectfields\">Mark Zuckerberg hearings in 2018</url>. There\u2019s an understanding that before they became giants, Capitol Hill didn\u2019t pay enough attention to the platforms that now account for a large share of the economy. In both the House and the Senate, lawmakers are often asking sharper questions than they used to and doing a better job of diving into the specifics.</p><p>There\u2019s a related issue: For years, \u201ctech policy\u201d largely meant communications policy. It was about regulating the infrastructure that allows us to share information with one another. That has much wider implications than it used to.</p><p>If you oversee banking, you have to grok <url normalizedValue=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=selectfields\">Facebook\u2019s attempt to build a cryptocurrency</url>.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=selectfields\">Google\u2019s use of patient records</url> is a health policy question as much as it\u2019s a tech policy one. I\u2019m interested in how lawmakers and their staff members adapt to this moment, when major tech companies are trying to play in more and more parts of modern life even as they face scrutiny for the business models that made them successful.</p><p>And what is the tech industry like in Washington?</p><p>All eyes are on Amazon and, more specifically, on its <url normalizedValue=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=selectfields\">second headquarters</url> in Northern Virginia. Its arrival has prompted a lot of questions about whether it will trigger even more gentrification in an       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=selectfields\">already gentrifying</url> city.</p><p>Amazon has been aggressive in building relationships with local educational institutions. In October, its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, visited a class at Dunbar High School in Washington, and the company is counting on local universities to help build the work force for its new offices.</p><p>The efforts have been met with resistance that is emblematic of the wider reckoning tech faces around its impact on society. Jay Carney, the former White House press secretary who leads Amazon\u2019s policy apparatus, visited Trinity Washington University this fall. While he was there, an undocumented student raised concerns about Amazon\u2019s work with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and he was met by anti-Amazon activists outside during his visit.</p><p>Outside of work, what tech are you personally obsessed with?</p><p>I\u2019m a heavy Spotify user and find that <url normalizedValue=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=selectfields\">music streaming</url> has broadened my musical horizons. I listen to more artists than I did before and pay more attention to new releases.</p><p>I am also one of those people who fell hard for AirPods. They look silly, but they work very well. Contrary to my expectations, I haven\u2019t lost one of the earbuds yet. That said: Buying the new, pricey AirPods Pro seems like tempting the earbud-losing fates. I\u2019m staying away and saving my money.</p><p>Frankly, I spend more of my personal time trying to disconnect. I delete Twitter from my phone on vacation and on weekends when I\u2019m being especially disciplined. I have been far less successful in cutting down on my Instagram use, but hope springs eternal.</p><p>PHOTOS: Congress keeps databases of lobbyists and the companies that hired them. \u201cEvery major tech company has ramped up its presence here,\u201d David McCabe said.

Tech start-ups have stormed the business world in recent years, and we're starting to see the impact on the Big Screen. Hollywood is starting to notice what's happening on computer screens around the world.</p><p><br/> I thought this would be a fitting time to check in with a tech person on the frontlines of these cultural changes. John McLaughlin, a growth engineer who has most recently been working with Shutterstock to grow its new educational platform Skillfeed[1], has worked for mobile technology start-ups in the past. McLaughlin responded to my questions via email about the intersection of tech and film:<br/> A popular Tumblr \"MovieCode[2]\" depicts the computer screens that programmers pull up in pop culture. How much of what is depicted on film is true to what you see on your screen every day?<br/> McLaughlin: Most of what you see in films is just open source code pulled from the Internet. It's usually completely arbitrary and has no relevance to the narrative of the film. For instance, in Iron Man II, Mickey Rourke's character looks to be controlling robots from his computer, but the code he's typing is really just basic HTML. There are actually companies that create custom interfaces and technology platforms for the purposes of TV and movies, like criminal databases or spy-style software created purely for theatrical effect.<br/> Are there any movies that you can recall that get tech and programming culture 'right'? Do you see the tide turning at all?<br/> McLaughlin: From what I hear, The Internship did a pretty good job at representing Google's campus in Mountain View and the cool perks and amenities they have there. As for the realities of life as a programmer, I don't think any movie has really hit the nail on the head yet. That's probably because the day-to-day life of a programmer would likely be boring to watch!<br/> What has The Social Network done for the way that the business world views techies? Did it make things easier, or perhaps more difficult?<br/> McLaughlin: It's gotten a lot of people excited about start-ups and technology, which is definitely a good thing because there aren't enough great coders out there to keep up with new ideas. Computer programmers are no longer Dungeons Dragons and Magic the Gathering geeks. This is big business. It's about venture funding and trying to be acquired for millions (or possibly billions). It's inspiring for people to see what can be achieved with a small team and a few laptops. At the moment, computer science graduates do not come close to filling the jobs available in the tech world, so if the movie inspires some more people to get into coding, then that's fantastic.<br/> What start-ups would you like to see a movie about?<br/> McLaughlin: Paypal, definitely. The book \"Paypal Wars[3]\" is one of my favorites. It's a fascinating look into how the company was started. They had to overcome a whole bunch of regulatory problems and fraud problems early on. Just imagine being in a room with founders like Peter Thiel, who later invested in Facebook, and Elon Musk, the now CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. It's like the answer to one of those 'who would you invite to your fantasy dinner party?' questions.<br/> What's the New York tech scene like? Is the momentum shifting to make an East Coast version of the 'cool tech scene'?<br/> McLaughlin: It's amazing how quickly the New York tech scene has gained momentum in the last couple of years. Every big tech company now has offices in New York and the city has been heading up major incentive programs to help start-ups get cheap space and faster internet. Google now has a huge presence here. It spent $1.8 billion on a headquarters in Chelsea a few years ago and it's really been transforming the area. It's truly an exciting time to be here.<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skillfeed.com\">https://www.skillfeed.com</url>/ [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://moviecode.tumblr.com\">http://moviecode.tumblr.com</url>/ [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-PayPal-Wars-Battles-Planet/dp/1936488590\">http://www.amazon.com/The-PayPal-Wars-Battles-Planet/dp/1936488590</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AOLB12472113958671173140701600</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AOLB-124721</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BV2-94M1-JCMN-Y3JM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"690\"/><timeReceived>8:51 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Huffington Post</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>March 26, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000D7EQ</classCode><className>SHUTTERSTOCK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Amazon pledged $1 billion in January, Facebook invested nearly $6 billion in late April and Google topped them all last week with a $10 billion commitment. They\u2019re part of a wave of investment into India\u2019s tech industry this year that\u2019s now well over $20 billion, with most of it coming from the United States.    The magnitude and sources of those investments would have seemed highly unlikely just months ago when all those technology companies were on a collision course with Indian regulators and tech CEOs were getting the cold shoulder on visits to New Delhi.    A lot has changed since then. The coronavirus has ripped through the global economy, hitting India particularly hard. India\u2019s diplomatic spat with China has spilled over into tech, aligning it with the Trump administration\u2019s own distrust of Chinese companies. And, while India has always been a big draw for U.S. tech firms, the diminishing scope for technology cooperation with China and new threats to their foothold in places such as Hong Kong are giving new importance to the Indian market.    The flood of investment also highlights something that has been true for years: India\u2019s digital economy \u2014 with more than 700 million Internet users and roughly half a billion yet to come online \u2014 is simply too big a prize for Big Tech to ignore for long.    \u201cPeople have confidence that, longterm, India is going to be a good market, that longterm, its regulations are going to be fair and transparent enough,\u201d said Jay Gullish, who heads tech policy at the advocacy group U.S.-India Business Council. \u201cI think these are just \u2026 deepening roots that already exist.\u201d    The China factor    Leading Silicon Valley Internet companies have been largely shut out of China for years, thanks in part to the country\u2019s massive censorship mechanism dubbed the Great Firewall. And a controversial new national security law imposed in Hong Kong, where Google and Facebook\u2019s services are still accessible due to its relatively unfettered Internet, could push them farther away.    The law gives Hong Kong authorities sweeping power to regulate tech platforms, including ordering them to take down posts that threaten China\u2019s national security or restricting access to their services. Facebook, Google and Twitter have said they will stop sharing data with the Hong Kong government, while the hugely popular short-form video app TikTok has exited the city completely.    \u201cIt is harder and harder to do business with China,\u201d said Mark Lemley, director of Stanford University\u2019s program in law, science and technology. \u201cThere is also a growing sense that doing business with China involves troubling moral compromises.\u201d    U.S. distrust of Chinese tech continues to grow. President Donald Trump last week claimed credit for thwarting the expansion plans of Chinese tech company Huawei and his administration has said it is \u201clooking at\u201d banning TikTok, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance.    It\u2019s a step that would only further align the U.S. with India. The Indian government banned TikTok and dozens of Chinese apps last month after a border clash between the two countries that left 20 Indian soldiers dead led to calls for a boycott of Chinese products. And, though India\u2019s tech relationship with China still runs deep \u2014 Chinese smartphones dominate the Indian market and most of India\u2019s biggest startups have sizable Chinese investment \u2014 the recent tensions could strengthen India\u2019s long-standing tech ties with the U.S.    \u201cIndia and its Southeast Asian neighbors have tried to balance the two powers by forging greater economic ties with China while holding on to the security umbrella provided by the United States,\u201d said Ravi Shankar Chaturvedi, research director at Tufts University\u2019s Institute for Business in the Global Context. \u201cChina, through recent actions, has effectively delivered the U.S. to India for a generation.\u201d    Chaturvedi and other experts point out that India and the U.S. have had a long-standing tech relationship, with thousands of Indian engineers working across Silicon Valley and Indians currently at the helm of Google, Microsoft, Adobe and several other U.S. companies.    \u201cThere\u2019s natural synergy between India and the United States in the digital realm,\u201d said Gullish, adding that the boost to Internet usage from Indian households socializing and working more from their homes during the coronavirus pandemic may further enhance India\u2019s appeal as a market. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for American companies to look to India for opportunities,\u201d he said.    The richest gets richer    At the same time that U.S. tech companies were eying India\u2019s market, Asia\u2019s wealthiest man appeared to position himself as a willing gatekeeper.    Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella (right) shakes hands with Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, during the Microsoft Future Decoded Summit Feb. 24, 2020 in Mumbai.  (Anshuman Poyrekar via )    Most of the tech investment into India this year \u2014 including all of Facebook\u2019s and nearly half of Google\u2019s \u2014 has gone into the coffers of companies controlled by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani. Jio Platforms, the digital subsidiary of Ambani\u2019s conglomerate Reliance, has raised more than $20 billion since late April from companies, venture capitalists and sovereign wealth funds looking to use it as a quick conduit to India\u2019s massive digital economy.    Jio launched as a mobile network in 2016 and has quickly amassed nearly 400 million subscribers. With recent forays into e-commerce, digital payments, streaming services and even a Zoom-like video conference platform called JioMeet, Ambani appears to be looking to turn the company into an all-encompassing Indian ecosystem.    And Silicon Valley clearly wants in.    \u201cU.S. tech hasn\u2019t been able to penetrate the \u2018Great Firewall of China\u2019 but it has been easier for it to enter the \u2018Great Paywall of India\u2019 created by Jio; all it had to do was pay Reliance the toll fees to enter,\u201d said Chaturvedi.    As one of India\u2019s biggest companies run by the country\u2019s richest man, Reliance has an enormous amount of local influence and is unencumbered by many of the regulations on data storage and e-commerce that have been roadblocks for Facebook, Google and Amazon.    \u201cNo global entrant could have managed this as successfully and as quickly on their own as Reliance has,\u201d Chaturvedi said. \u201cMuch of the e-commerce regulation and data localization laws have been influenced by Reliance.\u201d    As the Trump administration increasingly closes the U.S. economy off from the rest of the world, Silicon Valley will look afield to expand its reach, according to Lemley. And India is ripe for the picking.    \u201cMuch as it pains me to say it, the U.S. isn\u2019t nearly as attractive a place for innovation as it was five years ago,\u201d Lemley said. \u201cAs the Trump administration makes it harder and harder to bring the best and brightest people from around the world to Silicon Valley, I think tech companies may be looking towards a world where we are no longer the center of innovation.\u201d    \u00a9</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42628304465</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CR-S8S1-JCSC-J3S9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1235\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CBS San Francisco</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 18, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

On its site, it touts the fact that Forbes called it \"the hottest startup of the year.\"\u00a0And, on Monday, it shocked the startup world on Monday night by announcing that its founding CEO had resigned over \"compliance failures.\"\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEE ALSO: Yes, tech startups, this stock market will cut you too</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  As far as these things go, it was a spectacular exit: to fix its image quickly and thoroughly, the company appointed no less a Silicon Valley patriarch than <person><nameText>Peter Thiel, </nameText></person>one of the most respected people in technology. (As a rule: the more famous the new board member, the bigger the scandal they're being sent in to fix.)Conrad's sudden departure was not due to a lack of innovation or rocket-powered sales growth, the usual benchmarks of startup success and failure.\u00a0Instead, it was the result of a far less sexy consideration that is quickly becoming the new gospel of Silicon Valley:\u00a0play by the rules.\u00a0</p><p> \"Without it, we die\" For months, the young startup had been under mounting scrutiny for skirting insurance laws by reportedly allowing unlicensed salespeople to sell health insurance in various states.\u00a0To do otherwise would have meant slowing down long enough to receive brokers licenses.\u00a0And slowing down has long been viewed as kind of heresy among ambitious startups \u2014 at least until recently.\"We sell insurance in a\u00a0highly regulated industry. In order to do that, we must be properly licensed,\" David Sacks, the newly named CEO of Zenefits and former CEO of Yammer, wrote in an email to all Zenefits employees, a copy of which was provided to Mashable. \"For us, compliance is like\u00a0oxygen. Without it, we die.\"\"Our culture and tone,\" Sacks added in the email, \"have been inappropriate for a highly\u00a0regulated company.\"</p><p> SEE ALSO: Snapchat's valuation falls by 25%, and more big tech companies will follow</p><p>  Sacks' remarks may have been intended strictly as a repudiation of Zenefits, but it crystalizes a growing sentiment among some of Silicon Valley's biggest (and newly chastened) billion-dollar startups to play by the rules earlier and with bold gestures, or risk being torn apart by the regulated industries they hoped to upend.</p><p>  img class=\"\" data-credit-name=' TechcRUNCH/FLICKR' data-credit-provider=\"custom type\" data-caption=\"<person><nameText>Travis Kalanick, </nameText></person>cofounder and CEO of Uber\" src=\"<url normalizedValue=\"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzAyLzA5L2RiL1NjcmVlbl9TaG90LjFhMDRiLnBuZwpwCXRodW1iCTU3NXg0MDk2Pg/a95f6838/02f/Screen_Shot_2016-02-09_at_1.47.54_PM.png\">http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzAyLzA5L2RiL1NjcmVlbl9TaG90LjFhMDRiLnBuZwpwCXRodW1iCTU3NXg0MDk2Pg/a95f6838/02f/Screen_Shot_2016-02-09_at_1.47.54_PM.png</url>\" data-width=\"693\" data-fragment=\"m!4cb9\" data-image=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzAyLzA5L2RiL1NjcmVlbl9TaG90LjFhMDRiLnBuZwpwCXRodW1iCTU3NXg0MDk2Pg/a95f6838/02f/Screen_Shot_2016-02-09_at_1.47.54_PM.png\">http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzAyLzA5L2RiL1NjcmVlbl9TaG90LjFhMDRiLnBuZwpwCXRodW1iCTU3NXg0MDk2Pg/a95f6838/02f/Screen_Shot_2016-02-09_at_1.47.54_PM.png</url>\"</p><p><person><nameText>Travis Kalanick, </nameText></person>cofounder and CEO of Uber</p><p> Image: TechcRUNCH/FLICKR</p><p> The new gospel: Move fast (but not too fast), break things (just kidding!) For years, Facebook's motto \u2014 and the de facto ethos of Silicon Valley \u2014 was to \"move fast and break things.\"It may work when the things that \"break\" are code rather than people.\u00a0It is much riskier to follow that approach when you are a business like Zenefits or Uber, with a fleet of salespeople or drivers, respectively, taking on entire industries \u2014 and what you're breaking is the labor system that protects workers.\u00a0Make no mistake: Silicon Valley thinks the labor system is due for an upgrade. Techies believe they're just not fast enough or powerful enough yet to force change.\u00a0\"Yet\" is a crucial word.\u00a0The \"entrenched interests\" are \"getting to regulators and politicians sooner to try to slow things down,\" says Bradley Tusk, the founder and CEO of Tusk Holdings who has advised startups like Uber on their regulatory battles.\u00a0 The startups are taking it into account, however, as they grow big enough to draw plenty of attention.\u00a0\"Investors are more aware of regulatory risk and pressing founders to address it sooner,\" Tusk says.\u00a0The consequence of ignoring those problems: regulatory threats.\u00a0Prominent startups have all been threatened with shutdowns, including FanDuel, DraftKings, Uber and Airbnb.\u00a0 No one wants that, Tusk says.

He was fervently fixated on going fast, for fear of failure.\"Now is the time to keep the gas pedal firmly pressed against the floor,\" Conrad told me in a conversation after raising $500 million in funding last year and securing the $4.5 billion valuation. \"I'm out to try to grab as much of that market as I can.\"As it turns out, in today's Silicon Valley, going fast can lead to failure too.</p><p> Have something to add to this story?

The building's $49 million penthouse would be the most expensive in San Francisco. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''Just in time for the coming wave of I.P.O. millionaires in San Francisco,'' the Four Seasons said, promising ''an elevated sales experience'' to cater to ''this new class of buyers.'' </p><p>  But then the wave of tech initial public offerings -- the one that was supposed to mint San Francisco's new ultra rich -- fizzled. The stock of Uber, the ride-hailing giant, has dropped nearly 30 percent since the company went public in May. Lyft shares are down nearly 40 percent. Pinterest and Slack have declined, too. </p><p>  San Francisco has been left as a slightly more normal town of tech workers who got rich-ish, maybe making a few hundred thousand dollars. But that doesn't go far in a city where the median cost of a single family home is about $1.6 million. </p><p>  ''Everyone that came back post-I.P.O. seemed to be the same person. I didn't see any Louis Vuitton MacBook case covers or champagne in their Yeti thermos,'' said J.T. Forbus, a tax manager at Bogdan &amp; Frasco in San Francisco.</p><p>  Private wealth managers are now meeting with a chastened clientele. Developers are having to cut home prices -- unheard-of a year ago. Party planners are signing nondisclosure agreements to stage secret parties where hosts can privately enjoy their wealth. Union organizers are finding an opportunity. </p><p>  Everyone had gotten too excited, and who could blame them? The money was once so close: A start-up that coordinated dog walkers raised $300 million. The valuations of the already giant ride-hailing behemoths had nearly doubled again.  WeWork, a commercial real estate management start-up that owned very little of its own real estate, was valued at $47 billion. </p><p>  City of Towers</p><p>  Towers rose across San Francisco to house the money. The marble was polished. The bathroom floors were warm. The private pools were being filled.</p><p>  ''The world has changed in a year,'' said Herman Chan, a real estate broker with Sotheby's International. ''We expected an upward trajectory at least, and it really kind of deflated. These companies aren't dying but the cultural zeitgeist, that momentum of I.P.O.s, is gone. You don't even hear anyone talking about it anymore.''</p><p>  The developers who had fought the odds of regulation and zoning to build their glass residences in the sky had timed their units to the I.P.O.s. But on a recent visit with the Four Seasons sales team, they acknowledged that techie wealth was not what they were seeing. Interest was mostly coming from overseas buyers, young heirs to foreign fortunes and older executives looking for city pieds-\u00e0-terre, they said. </p><p>  Also in time for the wave that was not a wave are more luxury towers: The Avery, The Harrison, 181 Fremont, The Mira. </p><p>  ''The definition of luxury is scarcity, and there's so many now,'' Mr. Chan said. ''Nowadays, my buyers are getting a contingency period and inspectors. Things you would never ask for before. There's not 10 offers on a house anymore.''</p><p>  Case in point: A full-floor apartment in San Francisco's poshest neighborhood of Pacific Heights was listed at $21.6 million and advertised that ''a sommelier-worthy wine cellar awaits 1,500 of your most prized bottles.'' But more than a year later and after a $5 million price cut, it is still on the market. </p><p>  Prices for the top 5 percent of San Francisco area real estate listings -- the cream of the crop -- rose 7 percent between 2017 and 2018. This year, they have fallen more than 1 percent, according to data prepared for The New York Times by the real estate listing service Zillow. </p><p>  The malaise has spread south into Silicon Valley. A $10.8 million home listing in the town of Portola Valley, Calif., was slashed to $5.7 million. The median sale price for a nearby home in San Jose, Calif., has dropped 10 percent in a year to just under $1 million, according to data from Zillow. </p><p>  Before the tech I.P.O.s, Deniz Kahramaner, then a real estate data analyst with the property brokerage Compass, had rallied packed rooms of real estate agents and investors about the bonanza that lay ahead. He had charts and estimates of thousands of new millionaires raising the average price of single family homes in San Francisco above $5 million.</p><p>  Now, he is more muted. ''The I.P.O. cash-out hasn't played out as I mentioned in my original presentation,'' he said. </p><p>  Mr. Kahramaner added, hopefully, that it was still early. ''People need more time,'' he said. </p><p>  Wealth and Unions</p><p>  Instead of yachts, tech workers are funding more mundane ventures like college savings plans. </p><p>  ''This year brought a lot of people back to reality,'' said Ryan S. Cole, a private wealth adviser at Citrine Capital, a wealth management firm in San Francisco. ''We've had a lot of people fund 529 plans for their kids. Pretty boring stuff.''</p><p>  Some private wealth managers said they were actually somewhat relieved. </p><p>  ''At the end of the day, it's funny money until it's realized,\" said Jonathan DeYoe, another private wealth adviser. ''I've got Uber and Lyft clients that are disappointed. It's a different house now. It's a different school situation for the kids. But they're still by and large in good places. No one's impoverished.''</p><p>  And so workers who thought they would upgrade from Allbirds to Berluti shoes are remaining, after all, in the Allbirds.</p><p>  As some rank-and-file tech workers realize they might not get rich from company stock, the allure of working long hours without comparable real money pay is also wearing thin, said labor organizers. They have found traction this year in an industry long resistant to unions. </p><p>  ''The incentives to take the licks that you do are in the hope of some sort of big payoff down the road,'' said Paul Thurston, who focuses on unionizing San Francisco tech workers and is the organizing director at the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers. </p><p>  Now, ''the engineers and the app designer and the developers are going to be treated a lot more like the employees that they are rather than like partners, which is what they're told pre-I. P. O.,'' he said.</p><p>  Jonathan Wright, the organizing director of Engineers and Scientists of California, said he was in talks to unionize the workers of several big tech companies. </p><p>  ''There's a promise: you work 100 hours a week, you sleep under your desk, and then you'll be rewarded with the wealth of Bezos,'' Mr. Wright said. ''That mythology has been fading for years. The day of the unicorn is over.''</p><p>  Where there is new wealth, it's coming from the older tech companies like Apple and Alphabet, whose stocks this year have soared. And some fortunes are still being made from the I.P.O.s. While Uber's shares have fallen, the company's co-founder, Travis Kalanick, has sold off more than $2 billion in stock, according to securities filings. </p><p>  ''Especially with things like Uber, almost all the I.P.O. wealth was going to a couple of people,'' said Kalena Masching, a Redfin agent in San Jose. ''They are not looking to buy a standard house here.''</p><p>  Another bright spot: female-led companies, with more becoming unicorns in 2019 than any other year, according to Aileen Lee, the venture capitalist who coined the phrase ''unicorn'' to refer to a private company valued at $1 billion or more.</p><p>  And post-I.P.O. parties are happening. They are just secret -- and phone-free. </p><p>  ''We're signing a lot more nondisclosures,'' said Jay Siegan, who curates party entertainment for corporate tech clients. ''A year ago, people would set up social media stations at the party, signs with the hashtag for Instagram. Now we have clients asking guests to check their phones at the door or using those Yondr bags.''</p><p>  These are pouches used to lock phones en masse at concerts and events where someone might be tempted to record. </p><p>  Self Reflection</p><p>  However, in public, the tech world is all about reflection and self-critiquing after the year that was. </p><p>  The I.P.O. disappointment has gotten so extreme that two Silicon Valley techies are setting out to do what few have done before: Make fun of themselves. </p><p>  David Cowan, a venture capitalist with Bessemer Venture Partners, and Michael Fertik, the founder of Reputation.com, are launching an online talk show called ''The Bubble Report.'' It will feature interviews with other tech executives. The point, they hope, is to poke fun at Silicon Valley from within Silicon Valley.</p><p>  Mr. Cowan, either in character or just being very honest, decried the falling stock prices of newly public tech companies as victims of cruel Wall Street analysts.</p><p>  ''It should be against the law for unscrupulous analysts to assess stocks based on cash flow and profit, to impugn a company based on eight lines of a financial report,'' he joked.

But his call for ending some deductions drew negative reaction from groups representing tech and other industries, which argue that the changes would make it more difficult for U.S. companies to compete abroad.</p><p>\"This is a $60 billion hit on American employers that their foreign competitors won't feel,\" said Carl Guardino, CEO of the business-oriented Silicon Valley Leadership Group, referring Leadership Group, referring to one of the president's proposals. Many big tech companies in the valley, such as Hewlett-Packard, Oracle and Cisco, report that half or more of their revenue comes from overseas.</p><p>Obama, echoing statements he made in last year's campaign, said he is attempting to overhaul a tax system that he described as \"full of corporate loopholes\" and excessive rewards for U.S. companies that create jobs in other countries.</p><p>\"One of the strengths of our economy is the global reach of our businesses. And I want to see our companies remain the most competitive in the world,\" Obama told a White House audience on Monday.</p><p>But he cited a 2004 study that found U.S. multinationals paid $16 billion in taxes on $700 billion of foreign earnings. He added: \"The way we make our businesses competitive is not to reward American companies operating overseas with a roughly 2 percent tax rate on foreign profits, a rate that costs taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year.\"</p><p>The president said his combined proposals would raise $210 billion over 10 years, which he said would help with efforts to reduce taxes for middle-income individuals and others. He said nearly $75 billion would go to permanently extend the current tax credit for companies that do research and experimentation in the United States, which is set to expire this year.</p><p>The proposals will require legislative approval, however, and reaction in Congress was mixed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, said in a statement that she will work to advance the president's proposals, which she said would \"restore fairness to the tax code.\"</p><p>Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, however, said Obama's plan amounts to a tax increase on U.S. companies and \"seems particularly harmful to our shared goal of creating more American jobs.\"</p><p>Obama's proposals focus on two areas: curbing tax breaks for U.S. companies that operate in other countries, and cracking down on abuse of overseas tax havens by some companies and wealthy individuals.</p><p>The first area is of particular concern to big tech and pharmaceutical companies, which tend to have large multinational operations. Currently, they can defer paying U.S. income taxes on revenue from overseas subsidiaries for as long as they reinvest the money abroad.</p><p>Companies may still pay taxes to foreign countries where they do business, but those rates tend to be lower than the U.S. tax rate. Through \"deferral,\" big tech companies have avoided paying U.S. taxes on billions in overseas revenue.</p><p>Without \"deferral,\" for example, Google might have been required to pay an additional $1 billion last year on a tax bill that amounted to roughly $1.6 billion, according to a regulatory filing.</p><p>Google said Monday that \"it is too early to evaluate\" Obama's proposals.</p><p>While not eliminating deferral, Obama would change the law that lets companies take an immediate deduction on their U.S. income tax for business expenses tied to overseas operations, such as interest on a loan to build a foreign factory. According to a White House fact sheet, the proposal would raise $60 billion over nine years by requiring companies to defer those deductions until they pay U.S. taxes on the income from those operations.</p><p>A second proposal would raise another $40 billion over nine years by eliminating foreign tax credit loopholes. It would bar companies from deducting foreign tax payments on overseas income unless they are paying U.S. taxes on that revenue.</p><p>Representatives for Oracle and Cisco had no comment Monday. HP issued a statement saying that any tax reforms should be \"fair and encourage innovation and economic growth.\" A Cisco spokesman previously said abolishing deferral would be unfair. </p><p>In the second category of changes, the administration said it would raise $86.5 billion by eliminating loopholes that make it easier for companies to avoid taxes by shifting income from one subsidiary to another. Obama also proposed measures to crack down on individuals who try to hide money overseas, and the hiring of 800 new IRS employees to focus on international enforcement.</p><p>Contact Brandon Bailey at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bbailey@mercurynews.com\">bbailey@mercurynews.com</email> or 408-920-5022. Infobox1<br/>OBAMA\"S TAX PROPOSALS<br/>President Obama outlined six proposals for overhauling the tax system, most aimed at changing how the tax code treats foreign income and investments. The revenue estimates are for the period of 2011 to 2019.<list><listItem><bodyText><p>Ending deductions for expenses tied to overseas expansion, unless companies are paying income tax on revenue from those operations; would raise $60 billion in tax revenue. Allowing deductions for foreign tax payments only if the income is subject to U.S. taxes; would raise $43 billion. Establishing a permanent tax credit for spending on research and experimentation in the United States; would cost $74.5 billion. Eliminating loopholes that let U.S. corporations avoid taxes by shifting income from one subsidiary to another in a low-tax or no-tax country; would raise $86.5 billion. Increasing enforcement and reporting requirements for overseas financial institutions and wealthy individuals who deposit money overseas; would raise $8.7 billion. Hiring 800 IRS employees to focus on international enforcement; the White House says this will raise more revenue than it costs, but no dollar figures were provided.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNTRCT-12300797</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONTRACMNG</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VM9-X991-2R6B-04RN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Contra Costa Times (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>May 5, 2009 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS334118 COMPUTER TERMINAL &amp;

Along with the weekly massages, travel stipends, unlimited organic snacks, and casino-themed happy hours are stories of women who are stigmatized and punished for having children, overworked employees who feel they will never be able to balance family and a career, and entrepreneurs who are told by their advisors not to hire women of childbearing age. The dichotomy is stark and puzzling.</p><p><br/><br/>The U.S. is one of only four countries in the world-<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/labor/news/2013/03/08/55683/the-united-states-needs-to-guarantee-paid-maternity-leave/\">along with Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Papua New Guinea</url>-that does not guarantee the right to paid maternity leave. While       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-family-and-medical-leave-laws.aspx\">a few states offer taxpayer-funded family and medical leave</url>, and while       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-economic-benefits-of-paid-parental-leave.html?abt=0002&amp;abg=1\">President Obama is pushing for a national paid parental-leave policy</url>, the responsibility of creating these policies remains at the discretion of each employer.<br/>Supportive parental-leave policies are a critical part of keeping women in the workforce and in leadership positions. Considering that women today hold less than 20 percent of leadership positions in corporate America, according to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.womenscollege.du.edu/media/documents/BenchmarkingWomensLeadershipintheUS.pdf\">a 2015 report</url> by Colorado Women's College, and just 5 percent of CEOs at Fortune 500 companies are women-all while       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/24/business/women-leave-their-careers-in-peak-years.html\">job participation by women during peak earning years is sharply dropping</url>-the need for widespread change is dire. Tech companies serve as a role model for the rest of the country when it comes to corporate culture. Thus the dichotomy that exists in how the tech industry has ramifications that extend far beyond Silicon Valley.<br/>\"We find ourselves at a crossroads, where our workforce demographics, family demographics, and population dynamics are changing,\" said Vicki Shabo, vice president of the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nationalpartnership.org/\">National Partnership for Women and Families</url>. \"Big tech companies are on the leading edge of supporting families and some tech leaders are speaking out, but by and large, companies don't necessarily see their own interest or the public interest in creating these policies.\"<br/>To better understand the disparities that exist in the tech industry when it comes to supporting employees with families, I examined parental-leave policies at 15 different tech companies across sizes, verticals, and locations.<br/>Leading tech companies like       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.apple.com/\">Apple</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.google.com/\">Google</url>, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo</url> offer some of the most generous parental leave policies in the U.S. Among this group, Facebook is the only company to offer equal time off for all parents, whether they are the birth mother, father, or adopted parents. All new parents at Facebook receive four months of paid leave, as well as $4,000 in \"baby cash.\" In the past year, Facebook introduced designated breast-feeding rooms at its Menlo Park location. In addition, it offers financial and logistical assistance with adoption and fertility services,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/10/17/356765423/silicon-valley-companies-add-new-benefit-for-women-egg-freezing\">including the controversial coverage of egg-freezing costs</url>, which Apple also offers.<br/>Apple's paid family-leave policy gives expectant mothers up to four weeks before a delivery and 14 weeks after. Expectant fathers and other non-birth parents can take six-week paid parental leaves.  <br/>At Google, biological mothers are given 18 weeks of paid maternity leave and 22 if there are complications. New parents, regardless of gender, can receive up to 12 weeks of paid baby bonding time, including adoptive or surrogate caregivers. Non-primary caregivers are eligible for 7 weeks paid leave.<br/>\"We formerly had a maternity-leave policy of 12 weeks of fully paid and vested leave, but science better informed our decision-making in 2007,\" said Google spokesperson Roya Soleimani. \"Twelve-week-olds are at a very different place developmentally than are 18-week olds, so we changed our maternity leave to 18 weeks. It just felt like the right thing to do. After our policy change, we also found that returning moms left at half the rate they were leaving at previously.\"  <br/>Google also offers a number of caregiving benefits, including consultations for parents searching for childcare, discounts for nanny-placement agencies, and \"mother's rooms\" equipped with hospital-grade sterilization tools in all Google buildings, and $500 towards baby supplies. These benefits not only aim to make life easier for working parents, but also to promote a family-friendly atmosphere. According to Shabo, culture can play just as significant a role as the actual policy in supporting new parents, and culture trickles down from the top.<br/>\"We've seen that upper income, well-educated workers don't take leave because they think they will be viewed negatively, won't be taken as seriously, their commitment will be questioned, and they will lose out on opportunities for advancement,\" she said. \"A lot of research shows that this is true, so leaders have to create a culture where the policies aren't just something that is on paper, but are encouraged. Culture relies heavily on initial groundbreaking people who take leave and come back.\"   <br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com/\">YouTube</url> CEO Susan Wojicki was Google's first-ever employee to go on maternity leave when the company was new. Last year, she went on maternity leave for the fifth time.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/susan-wojcicki-paid-maternity-leave-is-good-for-business-1418773756\">In a recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal</url>, Wojicki wrote that nearly 5,000 women at Google have gone on maternity leave and that paid maternity leave is \"good for business.\" Another high-profile female leader to take maternity leave is Marissa Mayer, who was pregnant with her first child when she became the CEO of Yahoo. Mayer actually took      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/should-yahoo-ceo-marissa-mayer-take-maternity-leave-2012-7\">some flak for not taking enough maternity leave</url>, as well as for her decision to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-02-28/the-excessive-uproar-over-marissa-mayers-telecommuting-ban\">end Yahoo's telecommuting policy</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/marissa-mayer-who-just-banned-working-from-home-paid-to-have-a-nursery-built-at-her-office-2013-2\">install a nursery next to her office.</url> However, she also made significant upgrades to Yahoo's parental-leave program.<br/>Before Mayer, Yahoo's policy included disability and maternity benefits that were in line with California's regulations (six weeks), but provided no paternity leave. In April 2013, Yahoo extended its parental-leave policy to offer 16 weeks of paid maternity leave and 8 weeks of paid time off to fathers and parents of foster, adopted, or surrogate children. Yahoo's Director of Global Benefits Joe Gracey said this time can be taken anytime within one year of the birth, adoption, or foster-care placement. In addition, Yahoo offers $500 for baby-related expenses, and $5,000 towards adoption. In its larger locations, the company holds periodic \"new child showers\" with food, games, and decorations for people who have had a child, are expecting, or are thinking of having one. At these events, Yahoo's benefits teams provides more information about all the various programs and policies.<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/?lang=en\">Twitter's</url> vice president of diversity and inclusion, Janet Van Huysse, said Twitter provides 20 weeks of paid maternity leave for birth mothers and 10 paid weeks for paternity leave or adoptive parents. It also holds \"New Moms and Moms-to-Be\" roundtables every quarter where women who are leaving for or returning from parental leave can get together to share questions, concerns, and best practices. This initiative has led to others, including a \"Mommy Mentor\" program, Working Moms monthly lunches, and the new \"Dads On Leave\" roundtables.<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://instagram.com/\">Instagram</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reddit.com/\">Reddit</url> both offer 17 weeks of paid leave for new moms and dads, making them among the most generous equal-leave policies in the industry. Last fall,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.change.org/\">Change.org</url> announced that it would offer 18 weeks of fully-paid parental leave to every employee who becomes a parent, biological or otherwise. \"Equal leave is particularly important for reducing stereotypes that exist in the workplace because non-equal policies encourage hidden biases that women will be away from work longer, and thus get fewer raises and promotions,\" said the Change.org COO Jennifer Dulski, who spearheaded the effort behind the expanded program. \"Our view is if you provide equal leave to all parents, you reduce that bias.\"<br/>In addition to announcing its own policy, Change.org also initiated a campaign on its petition platform and across social media where employees could put pressure on their employers to do \"the right thing.\" When employers realize that parental leave is essential to recruiting top talent, Dulski expects this will cause a \"sea change\" among the tech companies who still lag behind.<br/>And there are many, many companies that lag behind. A majority of tech companies are nowhere near as generous as Change.org, Instagram, Reddit, and its peers, offering the bare minimum or a modicum above it. In 2014, the ad startup       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.slideshare.net/paperg/paper-g-maternitysurvey430-34148498\">PaperG conducted a survey of 97 tech companies</url> ranging from seed stage to post-IPO about their policies. One-quarter of the companies surveyed offer less than a month of paid maternity leave and 43 percent offer less than a month of paid paternity leave. While 100 percent of later stage companies (Series D, post-IPO) offer paid maternity and paternity leave, no seed-stage startups offer family leave policies at all. (By the Series A funding round, this number bumps up to 50 percent.)  <br/><br/>Stage of Funding vs. Paid Maternity and Paternity Leave Offering<br/>Red bars show the percent of companies that offer paid maternity leave, while blue bars show the percent of companies that offer paid paternity leave. (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.slideshare.net/paperg/paper-g-maternitysurvey430-34148498\">PaperG</url>)<br/>This is understandable. Large, well-funded companies have more resources to allocate to parental leave and are more able than a small team to compensate for an employee who is out. Startups at the seed stage generally don't have human resources infrastructure in place, or even employees for whom paid parental leave is an issue. (This hints at another cultural issue in Silicon Valley-bias against hiring older workers and parents.) Many of the companies interviewed for this article said they started thinking about paid family leave once they had employees that needed it.<br/>\"A lot of companies are started by young founders who learn so much on the job,\" said Andy Sparks, the COO and cofounder of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://mattermark.com/\">Mattermark</url>. \"They don't really know what they are doing and blinders are up to anything that is not right in front of them. At Mattermark, we realized we needed to be conscious of family leave if we wanted to respect people's lives outside of work, even if no one had kids yet.\"<br/>Mattermark offers up to 12 weeks of paid maternity leave, which is on par with what       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pinterest.com/\">Pinterest</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/\">Kickstarter</url> offer (that's also what mothers at The Atlantic get, for what it's worth), as well as 12 weeks of paid paternity leave, which is more generous than Apple or Yahoo.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.salesforce.com/\">Salesforce</url>, on the other hand, offers just four weeks of paid maternity and paternity leave. These findings corroborate those of PaperG, which found that while there is a relationship between the size or funding stage of a company and whether or not they have a parental-leave policy, there is no relationship between the size or funding stage and the amount of paid maternity or paternity leave they offer. The stronger correlations actually relate to female representation in a company.  <br/>The fact that companies with more female employees and leaders are more likely to offer strong parental-leave policies is confirmed by both data and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/women-silicon-valley-parental-leave-policies/\">anecdotal evidence, from companies including Rent The Runway, Mattermark, Wildflower Health</url>, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3041106/most-creative-people/the-women-leaders-driving-lyfts-impressive-growth\">Lyft</url>. These companies are more likely to cultivate an atmosphere that supports work-life balance and does not stigmatize parenthood, according to the PaperG study.   <br/>\"Rent the Runway is a really family- and mother-friendly company,\" said       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.renttherunway.com/\">Rent the Runway's</url> UX Lead Jess Brown. \"The maternity policies are well laid out, senior leadership has kids, people have been pregnant, taken maternity leave, come back, and hasn't impacted their career here at all. It is really empowering and positive to see. I definitely think female founders are a factor in the flexibility because if there are no women around to speak up, it can be intimidating.\"<br/>However, across Silicon Valley, women are often not around to speak up, given that they represent a severe minority in the tech workforce and leadership.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/04/04/3422975/women-tech-outnumbered/\">Men outnumber women 7 to 3</url> in the tech industry.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://blog.pitchbook.com/women-taking-a-growing-share-of-venture-capital/\">Just 13 percent of venture-backed companies have at least one female co-founder</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://qz.com/143967/the-tech-industrys-woman-problem-statistics-show-its-worse-than-you-think/\">tech companies employ an average of 12 percent women engineers.</url> These appalling numbers are often delivered with a cacophony of claims about       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2014/08/08/theresia-gouw-no-more-pipeline-excuses/%27\">\"pipeline problems\"</url> that do little more than absolve the tech industry of its culpability,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://fortune.com/2015/02/17/a-female-computer-science-major-at-stanford-floored-by-the-sexism/\">especially considering sexism is a major contributor to pipeline problems.</url> Large, well-funded companies, like those examined above, have entire departments dedicated to \"culture\" and human resources teams that focus on supporting women and families, but in the wild west of male-dominated startups, gender prejudice still runs rampant. \"When I was starting out, I went to older men COOs for advice and a couple of them told me to be wary of hiring too many women, because if you have a bunch of women on your team, they all get pregnant and leave,\" said Sparks, the Mattermark executive. \"That happened a couple times, and it just made my skin crawl. If other men get this advice from older men, then it will only be perpetuated and perpetuated.\"<br/>Stigmas like these contribute to the motherhood penalty which causes women's wages to go down when they become parents (while men's wages actually go up) and to be viewed as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://content.thirdway.org/publications/853/NEXT_-_Fatherhood_Motherhood.pdf\">less competent, competitive, and worthy of promotion.</url> They also make it far more difficult for women who have children to feel they can balance their job and their career.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://fortune.com/2014/10/02/women-leave-tech-culture/\">Textio CEO and cofounder Kieran Snyder spent a month collecting stories from 716 women</url> who left the tech industry and found that the overwhelming reason was \"culture.\"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://fortune.com/2014/10/02/women-leave-tech-culture/\">In an article in Fortune</url>, she wrote that more than two-thirds of the women in her survey said motherhood was a factor in their decision to leave tech, due to unreasonable expectations from managers, an absence of support from the company for things like breastfeeding or childcare, and feeling overtly or implicitly discriminated against by leaders and coworkers.<br/>The progressive and inspiring policies of many of tech's most prominent companies have not yet trickled down to the rest of the industry, either in practice or in priorities. While the specifics of the actual policies are important, they are just one part-albeit one critical part-of cultivating a culture that is welcoming to women. A 22-week policy or \"unlimited\" time-off means nothing if women are viewed as less capable, regularly experience harassment, or fear that having children will completely derail their career. Startups have been willing enough to emulate Google in offering free lunch for employees and other perks in an effort to recruit and retain the best staffers. Let's hope that the same follow-the-leader routine soon takes place for supporting women and families.<br/>Read       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/the-best-and-worst-companies-for-new-moms-and-dads-in-silicon-valley/386384/\">Silicon Valley's Best and Worst Jobs for New Moms (and Dads)</url> on theatlantic.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-siliconvalleysbestandworstjobsfornewmomsanddads386384</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FF2-KDH1-DYY9-J088-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2471\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Local leaders criticized the $3 billion in subsidies[3] (at least) Amazon stood to gain for locating the headquarters, known as HQ2, in Long Island City, Queens, near AOC's district. The new offices[4], while bringing fewer jobs to New York (about 1,500 compared with an estimated 25,000 in HQ2), will not cost the city anything in economic-development subsidies. Amazon begged off any of the special tax credits and grants that it previously was offered.'Waiting on the haters to apologize after we were proven right on Amazon and saved the public billions,' AOC tweeted[5] on the news.But Amazon may still make out like bandits in the end. </p><p>The new office space, in the Hudson Yards neighborhood on the West Side of Manhattan, joins other tech giants like Google, Apple, and Facebook, all of which are planning or have already moved into new digs on the West Side. That happens to be the district of House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler (D-NY). And his committee is currently investigating all four of those tech firms for antitrust violations and anti-competitive behavior.This is an old strategy tech has picked up from other corporate giants: If you bring jobs to an area, maybe lawmakers will become friendlier to your interests. There's a reason that large weapons systems rely on parts manufactured in practically every congressional district[6]. Nadler will now have to weigh following the law and promoting competition that benefits workers, entrepreneurs, and society with the thousands of jobs at home. Turning the West Side into the next Silicon Valley, in other words, must be seen as part of the political fortress Big Tech wants to build around its practices.Nadler won the Judiciary Committee ranking slot at the end of 2017[7], after the late John Conyers resigned from Congress. He beat out Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), who represents part of Silicon Valley, including most of the tech hub of San Jose, where Google is building a mega-campus[8]. Lofgren's defeat meant that Big Tech needed to establish a beachhead to influence the new Judiciary Committee chair. And they went right to work.New York City is a good spot for tech firms to relocate anyway, with its large, well-educated workforce. The whole idea that New York needed to lure Amazon or any tech firm with billions of dollars never made sense. But there's plenty of real estate in the five boroughs, all accessible by public transit. The fact that Big Tech has clustered on the West Side is a little suspicious.More from David Dayen[9]The same day that Amazon announced it would lease 335,000 square feet of office space in Hudson Yards, a large development on the far west edge of Manhattan between 30th and 33rd Streets, Facebook announced[10] it was in talks to put in 700,000 square feet of space in the Farley Building, a former post office across from Penn Station. That's on top of the 1.5 million square feet Facebook already has planned for Hudson Yards, which has drawn several other tenants[11].Joining these two along the Hudson River are Google, which expects to house 8,000 employees in Chelsea and Greenwich Village by 2022, and Apple, which has inquired about properties in the Flatiron District and Hudson Yards. (Apple already has some existing office space in the Flatiron area.) LinkedIn, a division of Microsoft, also has an office in the Empire State Building, which they are in the midst of expanding.According to The New York Times[12], Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google should have over 20,000 employees in nine different locations on the West Side by 2022. Total tech jobs in New York City, including businesses that partner with (or will soon by purchased by) the Big Four, have jumped to 142,600[13], up 80 percent over the past decade. This isn't quite to the level of Silicon Valley or Seattle, but it's a significant and growing number.All of the Big Four's offices sit inside Nadler's congressional district. And the House Judiciary Committee, which Nadler chairs, has its eye on the Big Four. The House Antitrust Subcommittee, led by chair David Cicilline[14] (D-RI), initiated historic hearings[15] on the tech industry last June. Officials from the top tech firms have all testified, and thousands of pages of documents have been gathered.Turning the West Side into the next Silicon Valleymust be seen as part of the political fortress Big Tech wants to build around its practices. This is the most wide-reaching antitrust investigation in decades. The endgame could be new laws, a damning report that spurs enforcement at the state or federal level, or some other hardship on Big Tech's profits. It signals that the free ride in Washington is over. So it's a good time for the tech behemoths to place a bunch of workers in the district of the man who will ultimately decide the direction of any investigation. While Cicilline runs the subcommittee, Nadler will clearly have some say in the matter.Nadler has been quite supportive of the investigation. His name appears on the committee's September document request[16] to the major firms. In a November hearing[17], he said, 'There is growing evidence that a handful of dominant platforms now control key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications,' calling out Google, Facebook, and Amazon by name. There is no indication whatsoever that Nadler has been influenced by the new tech rush into his district, although he did note that the investigation would serve as 'the beginning of a long process[18],' and of course delay assists Big Tech. Nadler's office did not respond to a request for comment.But whether it works or not is an open question; there's less unpredictability about Big Tech's strategy. 'It's very concerning,' says Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute. '[Nadler] is one of the members of Congress who's on this issue and doing something about it. That's 20,000 new voters in his district that are employees of the industry he's trying to rein in.'Progressive groups that have taken on Big Tech are girding for battle. David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress Education Fund, tells the Prospect, 'Activists and the broader public are going to have to step up and help Nadler continue to stand strong in the context of extraordinary pressure Silicon Valley is likely to put on him and his colleagues.'We've seen the tech giants play the influence game through lobbying[19], purchasing academic papers[20], creating astroturf organizations[21], and sheer persistence[22]. Of course placing jobs in the districts of powerful politicians\u2014and implicitly threatening the end of those jobs in the event of a crackdown\u2014would be on the menu.

Projected on a screen behind him was the headshot of a mellow-looking goat.<br/><br/>\"You become the owner of the goats' babies,\" Jimale explained during his pitch for Ari.Farm, his livestock-investment startup based in Stockholm. The crowd murmured approval. \"We're planning to expand to camels,\" he added.</p><p><br/>Jimale was among a spate of founders who participated in a start-up-idea marathon, billed as \"Pitch Don't Kill My Vibe\"-after the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF8aaTu2kg0\">Kendrick Lamar song</url>-as part of the housewarming festivities for Berlin's newest start-up campus. The evening gave entrepreneurs and investors, among others, a peek at the 75,000-square-foot workspace, dubbed Silicon Allee in a nod to California's tech mecca. What had begun in 2011 as a monthly meet up for tech entrepreneurs at a local coffee shop had grown until its organizers set out to procure a dedicated physical headquarters in the center of the city.<br/>The refurbished office building is among the latest in a wave of sleek structures for entrepreneurs to pop up in Europe in recent years, as cities including Berlin, Paris, Warsaw, and Amsterdam race to construct brick-and-mortar start-up campuses in the hope of luring talent and incubating the next unicorn. In a growing number of capitals, large U.S. firms are scrambling to call \"dibs,\" pouring significant resources into establishing a European-campus presence. These tech giants are betting that wrapping themselves in promising local start-ups will smooth the way for broad global expansion efforts, even as foreign regulators try to rein them in.<br/>Start-up-campus directors say their model has come to dominate the European landscape because it fosters in-person connections among founders-as well with some potential investors and corporate sponsors. Campuses, many of which mimic the clean-lines aesthetic of some Silicon Valley headquarters, typically comprise a mix of workstations, private offices, meeting rooms, and areas for socializing and events that encourage tenants to rub elbows. The campuses occupy a hybrid niche of sorts, with more selective admissions criteria than the typical coworking space, but a less hands-on approach than accelerators like Silicon Valley's Y Combinator that require founders to give up some equity and demonstrate progress.<br/>Big tech is willing to pay up for the chance to rent desks or host events or office hours. Travis Todd, a co-founder of Silicon Allee-allee means \"avenue\" in German-says he's already fielding partnership inquiries from large U.S. companies like General Electric eager to mix with budding entrepreneurs.<br/>Or take       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://stationf.co/\">Station F</url>, a sprawling glass-and-steel Paris workspace set to open its doors this summer to roughly 3,000 aspiring entrepreneurs. The refurbished 1920s train station is \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/05/with-station-f-paris-will-have-the-worlds-biggest-startup-campus/\">the size of the Eiffel Tower lying down</url>,\" and is funded by French businessman Xavier Niel. Start-ups have been vying for approval by its selection committee. But at least one firm has already been cleared to set up shop: Facebook.<br/>Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, stopped by the French campus in January for a hardhat tour, where she announced that the social network would be a founding partner. Facebook said it will be making its first foray there into onsite start-up initiatives with a new mentorship program called Start-Up Garage.<br/>Such partnerships aren't just a chance for corporate tech leaders to waft fresh ideas. They're also an employer-branding win for big companies, helping them make the case to potential corporate hires that they're plugged into the start-up scene and are therefore a cool place to work. In turn, signing on household names typically is a boon for campuses, lending credibility, name recognition, and a steady rent check to their organizations. And many campuses have begun to tout access to representatives from the likes of Facebook as a perk of membership distinguishing them from traditional coworking spaces.<br/>Who knows? A chat over cold-pressed juice at the campus caf\u00e9 might lead to an acquisition or a job offer.<br/>But probably not. Much as some U.S. tech giants might hope to project an interest in scouting talent and ideas abroad, several European campus directors and venture capitalists say corporate partners rarely acquire or even invest in the campus' start-ups. In fact, they say, cash often flows in the other direction as big companies pitch tech tools-including devices, software, cloud storage, and development platforms-to a captive audience.<br/>Still, any marketing boost at the margins pales in importance relative to what campus leaders say is Silicon Valley's foreign-campus long game: influencing policy in strategic locations across the globe on core issues like data privacy, net neutrality, and online censorship. The hubs function as touchpoints for feeling out local regulatory climates and cozying up to start-up leaders.<br/>At Factory Berlin, a campus housed in a converted brewery a few minutes' walk from Silicon Allee, Google parent Alphabet is front and center. The search giant's Google for Entrepreneurs division hosts regular events there, including talks on machine learning or web analytics. Vinton Cerf, a Google vice president who is widely considered one of the internet's inventors, recently stopped by for a \"fireside chat.\" A display of Android devices graces one of the campus's walls.<br/>Though company representatives have been onsite since soon after the campus opened in 2014, Google has yet to acquire or make a significant investment in a Factory Berlin start-up. Google maintains that it isn't, in fact, there to scoop up companies; its entrepreneurship arm supports early-stage firms like those at Factory Berlin through initiatives like educational workshops and product discounts, while its investment arm, Google Ventures, operates independently and targets later-stage start-ups.<br/>Instead, Google's campus initiative seems to hinge on identifying policy areas where its business interests overlap with those of the start-up communities it supports. For instance, Simon Schaefer, a co-founder of Factory Berlin, says when privacy regulations governing transatlantic data transfers came up for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-area-of-justice-and-fundamental-rights/file-eu-us-privacy-shield-adequacy-decision\">debate</url> in the European Parliament last year, he spoke with policy representatives at Google and others to brainstorm lobbying strategies. The fear was that a European privacy crackdown could crimp companies' efforts to transmit some types of personal data overseas. An unfettered ability to store data abroad is critical both for scaling start-ups and for Google's business model, he says.<br/>Schaefer, who now co-runs Silicon Allee alongside Todd, says the consensus was that advocates representing fledgling local start-ups might be better received in Brussels than a Silicon Valley juggernaut. He says he was among several entrepreneurs who traveled to the Belgian capital to voice start-ups' concerns before parliamentary committees. Though the issue is still pending, the sense among start-ups and big tech firms alike is that the so-called       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.privacyshield.gov/Program-Overview\">Privacy Shield</url> measures implemented since the hearings and currently in place are friendly enough.<br/>Google has planted flags of a similar sort in start-up communities across 125 countries since 2011, according to the company, establishing a sprawling web of influence. Often, as in Amsterdam, Stockholm, and Dublin, Google has linked up with existing spaces. Yet in a handful of cities like Warsaw, Google has constructed and runs its own standalone complexes, and plans to complete a new one in Berlin by early next year.<br/>It's clear that Silicon Valley leaders have high hopes for this resource-heavy approach to charming European regulators. Yet the symbiotic entrenchment, which has at times cast big tech in the unlikely roles of far-flung community organizer or office-space manager, could soon show diminishing returns as global capitals become saturated with branded workspaces.<br/>One sign the wave might have crested: The campus-partnership strategy has now begun to attract more traditional firms, prompting directors to weigh costs and benefits of inviting somewhat stodgier brands aboard. Factory Berlin partners like Deloitte and Deustche Bank will have increased access to start-ups now that the campus has reopened a roughly 11,000 square-foot wing vacated last year by Twitter, according to a spokeswoman for the campus. Deutsche Bank plans to host office hours there twice a week.<br/>Silicon Allee plans to go a slightly different route, its directors say. Large companies won't be granted office space there, but instead will be steered towards hosting events. The concern, Schaefer and Todd say, is that too many onsite corporate employees might dilute their core community of founders.<br/>After all, the last thing they'd want would be to kill the vibe.<br/>Read       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/european-tech-campuses/526359/\">Silicon Valley's Big Bet on Europe's Hip New Start-Up Scene</url> on theatlantic.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-siliconvalleysbigbetoneuropeshipnewstartupscene526359</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NHY-3HH1-JCG7-V32C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1489\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Amazon (AMZN) pledged $1 billion in January, Facebook (FB) invested nearly $6 billion in late April and Google (GOOGL) topped them all last week with a $10 billion commitment. They're part of a wave of investment into India's tech industry this year that's now well over $20 billion, with most of it coming from the United States. The magnitude and sources of those investments would have seemed highly unlikely, if not outright unthinkable, just months ago when all those technology companies were on a collision course with Indian regulators and tech CEOs were getting the cold shoulder on visits to New Delhi. A lot has changed since then. The coronavirus has ripped through the global economy, hitting India particularly hard. India's diplomatic spat with China has spilled over into tech, aligning it with the Trump administration's own distrust of Chinese companies. And while India has always been a big draw for US tech firms, the for tech cooperation with China and new threats to their foothold in places such as Hong Kong are giving new importance to the Indian market. But the flood of investment also highlights something that has now been true for years: India's digital economy, with more than 700 million internet users and roughly half a billion yet to come online, is simply too big a prize for Big Tech to ignore for long. \"People have confidence that, long term, India is going to be a good market, that long term, its regulations are going to be fair and transparent enough,\" said Jay Gullish, who heads tech policy at the advocacy group US-India Business Council. \"I think these are just ... deepening roots that already exist.\" The China factor Silicon Valley has been largely shut out of China for years, thanks in part to the country's massive censorship mechanism dubbed the Great Firewall. And a controversial new national security law imposed in Hong Kong, where Google and Facebook's services are still accessible due to its relatively unfettered internet, could push them further away. The law gives Hong Kong authorities sweeping power to regulate tech platforms, including ordering them to take down posts that threaten China's national security or restricting access to their services. Facebook, Google and Twitter have said they will stop sharing data with the Hong Kong government, while TikTok has exited the city completely. \"It is harder and harder to do business with China,\" said Mark Lemley, director of Stanford University's program in law, science and technology. \"There is also a growing sense that doing business with China involves troubling moral compromises.\" US distrust of Chinese tech continues to grow. President Donald Trump last week claimed credit for thwarting the expansion plans of Chinese tech company Huawei, and his administration has said it is \"looking at\" banning hugely popular short-form video app TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance. It's a step that would only further align the US with India. The Indian government banned TikTok and dozens of Chinese apps last month, after a border clash between the two countries that left 20 Indian soldiers dead led to calls for a boycott of Chinese products. And though India's tech relationship with China still runs deep \u2014 Chinese smartphones dominate the Indian market, and most of India's biggest startups have sizable Chinese investment \u2014 the recent tensions could strengthen India's longstanding tech ties with the US. \"India and its Southeast Asian neighbors have tried to balance the two powers by forging greater economic ties with China while holding on to the security umbrella provided by the United States,\" said Ravi Shankar Chaturvedi, research director at Tufts University's Institute for Business in the Global Context. \"China, through recent actions, has effectively delivered the US to India for a generation.\" Chaturvedi and other experts point out that India and the US have had a longstanding tech relationship, with thousands of Indian engineers working across Silicon Valley and Indians currently at the helm of Google, Microsoft and several other US companies. \"There's natural synergy between India and the United States in the digital realm,\" said Gullish, adding that the boost to internet usage from Indian households socializing and working more from their homes during the coronavirus pandemic may further enhance India's appeal as a market. \"It's easy for American companies to look to India for opportunities,\" he said. The richest gets richer At the same time that US tech companies were eying India's market, Asia's wealthiest man appeared to position himself as a willing gatekeeper. Most of the tech investment into India this year \u2014 including all of Facebook's and nearly half of Google's \u2014 has gone into the coffers of companies controlled by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani. Jio Platforms, the digital subsidiary of Ambani's conglomerate Reliance, has raised more than $20 billion since late April from companies, venture capitalists and sovereign wealth funds looking to use it as a quick conduit to India's massive digital economy. Jio launched as a mobile network in 2016 and has quickly amassed nearly 400 million subscribers. With recent forays into e-commerce, digital payments, streaming services and even a Zoom-like video conference platform called JioMeet, Ambani appears to be looking to turn the company into an all-encompassing Indian ecosystem. And Silicon Valley clearly wants in. \"US tech hasn't been able to penetrate the 'Great Firewall of China' but it has been easier for it to enter the 'Great Paywall of India' created by Jio; all it had to do was pay Reliance the toll fees to enter,\" said Chaturvedi. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella with Mukesh Ambani during the Microsoft Future Decoded Summit on February 24, 2020 in Mumbai, India. As one of India's biggest companies run by the country's richest man, Reliance has an enormous amount of local influence and is unencumbered by many of the regulations on data storage and e-commerce that have been roadblocks for Facebook, Google and Amazon. \"No global entrant could have managed this as successfully and as quickly on their own as Reliance has,\" Chaturvedi said. \"Much of the ecommerce regulation and data localization laws have been influenced by Reliance.\" As the Trump administration increasingly closes the US economy off from the rest of the world, Silicon Valley will look afield to expand its reach, according to Lemley. And India is ripe for the picking. \"Much as it pains me to say it, the US isn't nearly as attractive a place for innovation as it was five years ago,\" Lemley said. \"As the Trump administration makes it harder and harder to bring the best and brightest people from around the world to Silicon Valley, I think tech companies may be looking towards a world where we are no longer the center of innovation.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42631365445</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CY-6TF1-F07F-84V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1205\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 19, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Knee is a professor of professional practice at Columbia Business School and a senior adviser at Evercore. His latest book is \u201cClass Clowns: How the Smartest Investors Lost Billions in Education.\u201d</p><p>What explains the end of America\u2019s love affair with tech? As with many passionate affairs, time has a way of taming new love\u2019s ardor. As the internet moves into middle age, and technology has increasingly become associated with \u201cBig Tech,\u201d it is perhaps not surprising that the na\u00efve presumptions of young love have begun to fade.</p><p>The consistent theme that underlies many cultural critiques of Silicon Valley is that innovators behind the dominant platforms invoke a high-minded libertarian ideology to justify a range of unjustifiable, self-interested actions. This includes the shameful treatment of women and minorities, the exploitation of personal customer data, crushing competitors while colluding with peers and failing to help the government protect our national security. Something has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-entry\">gone off the rails</url>, whether this is the result of a conspiratorial \u201cmerger of a hacker\u2019s radical individualism and an entrepreneur\u2019s greed,\u201d as Noam Cohen argued in his polemic \u201cThe Know-It-Alls,\u201d or simply the result of how \u201caudacity often veers into arrogance,\u201d as suggested by Leslie Berlin\u2019s calmer history, \u201cTroublemakers.\u201d</p><p>The Big Tech standard bearers are the so-called FAANG stocks: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. Only one of these has largely escaped the adverse turn in public opinion: Netflix. There are many possible reasons for this, including that Netflix is a fraction of the size of the others and it has eschewed acquisitions that might attract regulatory attention. But the key differentiator may be something less coldly financial and more softly subjective: Culture.</p><p>Netflix\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, has always been the adult in the room. He was in his 40s when Netflix went public in 2002 and had previously served as a public company chief executive. All of his counterpart FAANG founders were in their 20s or early 30s when they took their companies public. Most brought in professional management to either serve as chief executive or otherwise provide so-called adult supervision.</p><p>____________________________</p><p>Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was edited by Jason Karaian in London.</p><p>____________________________</p><p>Although trained in computer science, Mr. Hastings\u2019s preoccupation at Netflix has been organizational design as much as product and technology. His <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-entry\">PowerPoint presentation from 2009</url> on Netflix\u2019s corporate culture had been viewed by well over 15 million people by the time it was<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-entry\">updated and condensed</url> in 2017. Sheryl Sandberg, the adult supervision at Facebook for its founder Mark Zuckerberg, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-entry\">said</url> the initial presentation \u201cmay well be the most important document ever to come out of the Valley.\u201d</p><p>By picking this moment in time to publish a book called \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-entry\">No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention</url>,\u201d Mr. Hastings risks being drawn into the broader questions and controversies that he has largely avoided. The book is narrowly focused on how to most effectively manage creative enterprises. And as if to underline his hope to avoid wider social and political topics, he is joined in the endeavor by Erin Meyer, a respected professor at Insead business school in France. They largely succeed, but it is impossible not to be struck by how distant the problem of encouraging innovation in high performing work environments of the creative economy is from the more existential cultural crises we are all currently grappling with well beyond the borders of Silicon Valley.</p><p>The management approach advanced in \u201cNo Rules Rules\u201d is striking in its simplicity: Get the best people, give them honest feedback and empower their decision-making. Although Hastings has been talking about these three key elements for years, it is still jarring to see them synthesized and applied in context.</p><p>Strikingly, having the best people involves a regular \u201ckeeper test.\u201d If a manager won\u2019t fight to keep an employee as an indispensable star, the solution is a generous severance package. In place of annual reviews \u2014 salaries are adjusted based on the market, not individual performance \u2014 a system of continuous written and live, 360-degree feedback serves a remarkable degree of organizational transparency. The result is a work force with high \u201ctalent density\u201d who can be trusted to use their own judgment.</p><p>The confidence in unsupervised employee decision-making \u2014 managing by \u201ccontext, not control\u201d \u2014 allows Netlix to get rid of annoyances like expense processes and vacation policies. Managers also have unlimited authority to make financial commitments within their domain without approvals. At least as many people would find the lack of approvals, rules and metrics terrifying as would find the level of autonomy liberating. That divide is presumably a major determinant of who applies to work at Netflix in the first place.</p><p>Given the current hostility to the technology sector, the rejection of established H.R. wisdom and intensity of the organizational upheaval promoted by \u201cNo Rules Rules\u201d may generate controversy. Mr. Hastings could have remained under the radar during the Silicon Valley\u2019s cultural maelstrom. Instead, he has entered the fray with an important contribution that provides the beginnings of a road map for the sector to regain trust.</p><p>Although there is much to legitimately debate in the details, it strikes me that the overarching approach to culture endorsed by Netflix speaks directly to the fundamental failure in technology industry leadership. Both the book and the first page of Netflix\u2019s famous presentation are organized under the same banner: Freedom and Responsibility.</p><p>This is the corporate equivalent of the Peter Parker principle, uttered by Uncle Ben to his superhero nephew in the first \u201cSpiderman\u201d film (unfortunately not currently available on Netflix): \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d Where Netflix\u2019s tech peers have fallen down is by emphasizing empowerment \u2014 their own corporate prerogatives as well as that of their high-performing employees \u2014 without establishing a clear context for understanding the corresponding responsibilities, both internally and externally. \u201cNo Rules Rules\u201d demonstrates how hard, but essential, it is to take the responsibility side of the equation seriously. Many may find the \u201ckeeper rule\u201d inexcusably brutal, but it is hard to argue with the seriousness with which the company takes its responsibility to develop its people.</p><p>Netflix is not immune to the cultural blinders of the Silicon Valley bubble. The term \u201cdiversity,\u201d despite significant academic research supporting its role in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-entry\">fostering creativity</url>, is largely absent from the first 200 pages of \u201cNo Rules Rules.\u201d They wait until the very end, when the authors discuss the management challenges posed by the introduction of Netflix simultaneously in 130 new markets in 2016. It took until then for the company to add \u201cinclusion\u201d as a corporate value, and in 2018 Netflix hired its first head of inclusion strategy; this is presented as a result of expanding the business rather than something that\u2019s intrinsically valuable.</p><p>It\u2019s right to be skeptical that this book will have any meaningful impact on the technology industry\u2019s willingness to embrace corporate and personal accountability as central to its culture. Nonetheless, \u201cNo Rules Rules\u201d demonstrates that it is not only possible to pursue both freedom and responsibility at the same time, but that for Silicon Valley and the rest of us to thrive together, it is essential.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Final thoughts</p><p>Bosses of technology companies love to talk about how unique their corporate cultures are. Openness. Autonomy. Mission-driven. Snack bars.</p><p>There\u2019s truth to this. But I\u2019m just not sure that tech company cultures are so distinct anymore \u2014 partly because they have been copied to death.</p><p>Netflix is unique. But it and other tech companies are getting less unique by the day. No ideas stay confined for very long.</p><p>A lot of companies now tell employees that work is about a mission, not just about a paycheck. Employers have copied a lot of open floor plans common in tech companies, and some of their perks. Empowerment is spouted by every human resources director. Hedge funds have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-entry\">high-minded philosophies about radical transparency.</url> A lot of this is hokum, but that\u2019s true at some tech companies, too.</p><p>Not all of this was influenced by the technology industry, of course. Workers everywhere have demanded different things from their employers. But as Silicon Valley\u2019s legend grew, the management methods there spread.</p><p>\u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-entry\">Shira Ovide</url>, writer of The Times\u2019s On Tech newsletter (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-entry\">sign up here</url>)</p><p>Our current relationship with technology reminds me of our relationship with food. Granted, we may not need tech in order to survive, but many of us do rely on it to work, to learn, to document and to connect.</p><p>We like, and even love, many foods \u2014 fresh baked bread, piping hot tacos \u2014 and the same is true for much of our tech. Would you voluntarily give up the smartphone or tablet that many of you are probably holding right now? Your favorite app? Your ability to access vast catalogs of music or to have video chats with your doctor or relatives who live far away?</p><p>As is also true for food, we have reason to be cautious, and even angry, about how some tech is made and the inequalities of access to it. Some food companies deliberately engineer their products to make us addicted. So, too, do some tech companies. Working conditions in both the food and tech industries can be suboptimal, and in some cases downright dangerous and exploitive.</p><p>Under public pressure, hazardous food additives and ingredients have been regulated out of our food supply, and unfair labor practices are under scrutiny. Now that we\u2019re discussing the toxicity of tech, we need to be specific: Which technologies nourish society, and which are making us sick?</p><p>\u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-entry\">Leslie Berlin</url>, project historian for the Silicon Valley Archives at Stanford University and author of \u201cTroublemakers\u201d </p><p>What backlash? Whenever I hear about the \u201ctech backlash,\u201d I glance at Facebook\u2019s share price, consider that the tech sector is the only thing holding up the stock market and wonder just what planet the speaker lives on. I also imagine Facebook\u2019s internal usage dashboards, which must be similarly off the charts (not to mention Zoom\u2019s).</p><p>Times have never been better for tech. Work-from-home orders were less of a hit to productivity than management thought, and many founders, C.E.O.s and other senior executives have decamped for gorgeous rural areas or \u201csecond-tier\u201d cities with shockingly high qualities of life. Every weekend features a traffic jam of moving trucks in front of my Bay Area apartment building.</p><p>While much of the rest of the country struggles with economic stagnation, tech companies keep growing, hiring and filing for I.P.O.s. The Bay Area has never been a more challenging place to live, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-entry\">in a poll</url> of my (admittedly biased) tech-heavy friends and followers, over a third said that their lives improved during the pandemic.</p><p>If there\u2019s a tech backlash going on, few in tech seem to realize it.</p><p>\u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-entry\">Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez</url>, author of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d</p><p>* * *</p><p>Further reading</p><p>\u201cEvery new technology has real issues that have to be thought through and, you know, we\u2019re in that phase for social media,\u201d Mr. Hastings told The Times\u2019s Maureen Dowd <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-entry\">in a new interview</url>. He spoke about other aspects of the tech industry, Netflix\u2019s place in it, and the unique company culture he has built, as revealed in \u201cNo Rules Rules.\u201d</p><p>As Maureen writes of the Netflix founder:</p><p>He started a delivery system for movies, and now his company is one of the most powerful forces in movies. In the capital of drama, Mr. Hastings is, without drama, ripping out the infrastructure and replacing it with his own.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a conflict between the head and the heart,\u201d Mr. Hastings said, describing the radical candor that is a hallmark of how his company is run. \u201cColdly rational and calculating,\u201d is how a fired former Netflix manager put it, adding that it was still an \u201camazing fun ride.\u201d</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-entry\">Read the whole thing</url>.</p><p>What do you think?

If 100 percent of computers run the same code and malware authors discover an exploit, 100 percent of computers will be vulnerable to the same attack. Fortunately, the way to reduce such risks is straightforward: Increase diversity.</p><p>Alas, this insight seems limited to software. Technology executives have yet to fully recognize the risks posed by the potent political monocultures forming inside their own companies.</p><p>We've reached the point where many tech employees in the San Francisco Bay Area who happen to be libertarian or conservative feel compelled to keep their views secret. Others, open about their opinions, report that they've suffered career setbacks for being insufficiently progressive, even as their outspoken left-of-center colleagues who spent 2016 sporting \"I'm With Her\" hats have not.</p><p>Even some self-identified liberals are dismayed at what they view as a toxic monoculture. Tim Ferriss, a startup advisor and investor, moved to Austin after living for 17 years in San Francisco. \"Silicon Valley also has an insidious infection that is spreading--a peculiar form of McCarthyism masquerading as liberal open-mindedness,\" he posted on Reddit in November. \"I'm as socially liberal as you get, and I find it nauseating.\"</p><p>This climate is unhealthy for employers as well. Companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Apple are increasingly likely to miss opportunities to develop products that can appeal to the half of the nation that cares little for left-of-center politics.</p><p>That's created market opportunities for substitute services, from Gab.ai (a Twitter alternative) to Brave (a web browser), from InfoGalactic (akin to Wikipedia) to Voat.co (a chat board site much like Reddit)--each of which advertises itself as committed to protecting free speech, privacy, and a diversity of viewpoints. D.tube, a decentralized video sharing site, boasts that, unlike YouTube, it is \"not able to censor videos\" due to built-in technological constraints.</p><p>For CEOs of billion-dollar companies who are famously paranoid about competition from upstarts, this is a remarkable unforced error. (Google employees are well aware that they occupy a campus owned by Silicon Graphics before its bankruptcy, while Facebook's headquarters used to be Sun Microsystems'. Mark Zuckerberg kept the old Sun sign around to remind employees of what their fate could be.)</p><p>The current climate means that tech companies are likely to miss out on good workers who don't quite fit in. The brilliant nonconformists who helped to create the computing and internet industries--and launched the Burning Man festival along the way--would likely fail an initial human resources resume screen today. Yet Silicon Valley has thrived in part because its history is populated by figures like Whole Earth Catalog editor Stewart Brand, novelist Ken Kesey and his LSD-fueled \"Merry Pranksters,\" phone hacker Cap'n Crunch, inventor Douglas Engelbart, and the late Electronic Frontier Foundation co-founder John Perry Barlow. Time was, the counterculture co-existed and even overlapped with conservatives and libertarians. Barlow, for example, was chairman of Wyoming's Sublette County Republican Party and a coordinator for Dick Cheney's 1978 congressional campaign. He also was a lyricist for the Grateful Dead.</p><p>The Bay Area could transform itself from fruit orchards to a trillion-dollar economy precisely because it lacked a political monoculture. Take David Packard and Bill Hewlett, who founded what would become Silicon Valley's largest employer and first great corporation. The two were avid outdoorsmen who together bought a 28,539-acre ranch east of San Jose for hunting deer and wild pigs.</p><p>Packard in particular was a prominent supporter of conservative causes: He became a trustee of the American Enterprise Institute and Stanford University's Hoover Institution and served as Richard Nixon's deputy defense secretary. He was also unapologetic about his politics, warning in 1992 that \"the Democratic Party has been the party of socialism since President Roosevelt's term.\"</p><p>William Shockley, creator of the transistor, ran for the California GOP's Senate nomination in 1982. Ron Conway, an early investor in Google and Paypal, is a self-described conservative who worked on Nixon's 1968 campaign. According to one of his longtime friends, Steve Jobs voted for Ronald Reagan; according to Steve Wozniak, he was influenced by Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. T.J. Rodgers, the now-retired CEO of Cypress Semiconductor, assigned Rand's writings to his management team, and Doubleclick's Kevin O'Connor gave his son \"Rand\" as a middle name. As recently as 2008, then-presidential candidate Ron Paul could show up at Google and find a standing-room-only employee audience.</p><p>Today's Silicon Valley, on the other hand, seems to repel smart people who are insufficiently progressive. Billionaire investor Peter Thiel, arguably the region's most prominent conservative, is moving to Los Angeles because of the Bay Area's \"intolerant, left-leaning politics,\" according to The Wall street Journal. Andrew Torba, founder of Gab.ai, explained to The Guardian why he too had left: \"As a conservative, a Christian, and a Trump supporter I felt like I couldn't speak freely without being shunned or attacked for having a different opinion.\"</p><p>Entrepreneur Marc Andreessen has said he knows of exactly two people in Silicon Valley who voted for Donald Trump. \"I guarantee there are Trump supporters in Silicon Valley who feel like they can't say so,\"</p><p>he added. \"What does it do to someone who feels literally like they cannot express themselves? That is such an unhealthy place to get to.\"</p><p>The atmosphere inside Google has become especially toxic, according to a lawsuit filed by James Damore against his former employer. The software engineer has buttressed his case with nearly 100 pages of posts shared openly among employees, including one in which a manager announced that he maintains a blacklist of workers who hold differing views on religion. '\"Legitimate world views' 'Conservative Christianity,'\" read another. \"I admire your tolerance, but pairing those two phrases still sounds like an oxymoron to me.\"</p><p>Those posts appeared before Damore circulated his controversial memo within the company. Afterward, he says, the tone darkened. One colleague predicted that \"a good number of the people you might have to work with may simply punch you in the face.\" Others likened conservative coworkers to \"this cancer within our culture.\"</p><p>Google will have a chance to defend itself, and the courts may well decide there was no unlawful discrimination involved in Damore's firing. But management's decision to tolerate (encourage?) such extreme single-mindedness aligns Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., even more hermetically with one side of the culture wars. (Twitter wasn't helped, either, by Project Veritas' release of undercover videos in which current and former employees appear to disparage Christians and discuss \"shadow banning,\" or preventing other users from seeing someone's public posts.)</p><p>All this comes during a time of unfortunate regulatory overreach targeting technology companies. Even before Damore's lawsuit, conservatives had begun to propose treating social media platforms as public utilities. Missouri's Republican attorney general is investigating Google, a move that should worry any CEO who remembers how states helped to kick off the antitrust case against Microsoft from two decades ago. Congress is considering a bill to weaken the federal law that shields internet companies from liability for their users' crimes, while Facebook is on the defensive over allegations of social media addiction and its role in spreading \"fake news.\" President Trump claims Amazon has been ducking its taxes. And the head of the Federal Communications Commission calls Silicon Valley \"a much bigger actual threat to an open internet than broadband providers.\"</p><p>A wave of populist anger may never crest against the technology industry, but for the first time in recent memory, such a scenario looks possible. If 100 percent of major technology companies share the same monoculture, 100 percent of them become vulnerable to the same threats: lost market opportunities, alienated employees, and newfound regulatory enthusiasm. If only there were another option.</p><p>DECLAN MCCULLAGH is a Silicon Valley writer, entrepreneur, and co-founder of Recent Media Inc.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-534376602</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 534376602</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S4F-61F1-JCBJ-K30R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1416\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Reason Foundation</copyright><publicationName>Reason Magazine</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0048-6906</issn><volume>Vol. 50</volume><issueNumber>No. 1</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 1, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Humanities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Philosophy and religion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political science</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>High technology industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Human resource management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political aspects</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Work environment</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Personnel administration</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Badly bruised from the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000, it came back from it many times stronger, even if many of the names were new ones.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even as Wall Street had its own near-death experience amid the collapse of Lehman, the technology giants on the other side of the US barely sneezed; indeed, many of the inventions and companies that have defined the new tech boom came to light during the financial crisis: the iPhone, Uber, Twitter.</p><p>Five of the world's seven biggest listed companies are technology groups, not to mention some of the biggest and best IPO candidates such as Snapchat and Spotify. Many governments have cosied up to internet companies, looking for a slice of their wealth and kudos. Look at it from the right angle, these companies look set to shape the future; we are living in the information age after all, and Google, Facebook and others are the gatekeepers.</p><p>But in a few years, we may well look back on the present as a golden era for these titans: one in which they had free rein to patrol the internet, squeeze out any competitors and enjoy the fruits of benevolent governments, not to mention a sympathetic general public.</p><p>The web, computers and digital services have developed at a rapid pace: too rapidly, really, for anyone to take stock.</p><p>Tax laws designed for an offline world have allowed Amazon to make much of its European sales out of Luxembourg, while Uber's use of technology has allowed it to operate much like a taxi company while being subject to much looser regulations around private hire vehicles.</p><p>Telecoms services have been undercut by free chat apps run by Facebook and Apple that use the same infrastructure that those telecoms groups built.</p><p>Consumers have cheered cheap books, rides and text messages, and politicians have praised innovation, while the grumbles of those negatively affected by them have often been dismissed as luddism. But perhaps not for much longer.</p><p>Cracks started to emerge in 2016. The European Union, which has long taken potshots at the Californian giants and the impact they have on homegrown companies, advanced into full-blown warfare against them.</p><p>Google was served with three charges of abusing monopoly power last year, each of which can ultimately result in a fine worth billions of dollars. Apple's tax status in Ireland, which have seen it shelter huge sums there with the aim of eventually returning it to the US, was deemed illegal state aid.</p><p>Facebook, which has typically evaded regulatory scrutiny up to this point, was also caught in Brussels' glare when competition officials accused the company of misleading them over its purchase of WhatsApp in 2014.</p><p>The social network has also become a growing target for privacy campaigners uneasy about the wealth of data it has on its users, and has been accused of corroding democracy by allowing fake news to spread: politicians in some places are now talking about fining Facebook over it.</p><p>2017 is not likely to be easier. While President Obama rubbed shoulders with tech bosses, his replacement called many of them out on the campaign trail. Donald Trump scorned Apple for making its gadgets in China instead of America, told Amazon it faces an antitrust investigation, and raised the idea of shutting down parts of the internet. Silicon Valley's progressive streak sits uneasily with the conservative swell that voted Trump in.</p><p>China, a market that tech companies have been denied access to or have had to compromise to survive in, is tightening its grip on the internet rather than loosening it: Apple was recently forced to remove the New York Times from its iPhone App Store under laws that ban apps \"disrupting social order\".</p><p>Elsewhere, the \"sharing economy\", the idea that consumers would rent out their homes or labour with apps like Airbnb and Uber skimming off the top, is facing a backlash. A tribunal in London ruled last year that Uber drivers should have basic employment rights; Airbnb is enforcing 90-day limits on rentals.</p><p>The advertising industry is voicing a growing concern about the duopoly of Facebook and Google over digital revenues.</p><p>In Silicon Valley, the future is always bright; there is no shortage of opportunities waiting to be solved with technology. But the rest of the world is not necessarily on the same page.</p><p>Political commentators have not failed to notice how the liberal world order showed signs of fraying last year, and may face a full-blown crisis in this one. In parallel, the tech industry that thrived in that order may find itself in a similar bind in 2017.</p><p>It is no coincidence that technology shares have underperformed the S&amp;P 500 since the US election, with some of the biggest companies missing out on the Trump bump that has pushed US stock markets to record highs.</p><p>Amid a dearth of big tech flotations, start-ups are now nervously eyeing Snapchat's forthcoming IPO as a litmus test for 2017. The company's value has been tentatively put at $25bn (\u00a320bn), a sum that many see as overblown for an app with relatively miniscule revenues.</p><p>Failing to live up to that billing could be a portentous moment for an industry that has not reckoned with the good times ending.</p><p>'Silicon Valley's progressive streak sits uneasily with the conservative swell that voted Trump in'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-121108200</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MKF-S451-JBVM-Y22K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"882\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>January 9, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

In just five days, hundreds of contributors signed up for a piece of what they hope will be the next Silicon Valley unicorn. But there's a catch - unlike traditional venture capital investments, the tokens don't confer a claim on Storj's equity or future profits.</p><p> Instead, the tokens' value derives from their utility in the firm's app, by providing access to data storage on a distributed network. They are the latest entry in the growing ledger of cryptocurrencies, digital coins that unlock myriad apps across the computing world.</p><p> The coins are tradable on dozens of online exchanges and demand for all sorts of them has exploded as people speculate on the next big tech startup.</p><p> \"The average investor is missing out on the Ubers and AirBnbs of the world,\" said Bart Stephens, a managing partner at Blockchain Capital, a VC firm that's invested in blockchain-related startups since 2012. \"If the next Uber decides to issue tokens, that would be an opportunity for more investors to get access to the most exciting technologies out there.\"</p><p> The Storj sale is known as an initial coin offering, a model of finance spreading across the tech sector. Investors spent $332 million on tokens in the past year, more than double what VCs handed over in seed rounds, according to data compiled by coin-focused blog The Control. The haul is slated to hit $600 million in 2017, it says, adding to a market for tokens that's nearly tripled in the past year.</p><p> ICOs are possible thanks to blockchain, the catchall term for a digital ledger that promises incorruptible storage of financial transactions. Banks and stock exchanges have spent millions on it, looking for ways to cut the costs for transferring money or recording equity sales. Most famously, it's the technology that underpins bitcoin - just as it does for every token offered in an ICO.</p><p> The offerings happen outside the purview of regulators - quite by design - as technically, the coins are part of the app and not securities. ICOs don't have disclosure requirements, and the issuer can accept an unlimited number of U.S. investors, instead of the 99 vetted investors limited to traditional VC funding rounds.</p><p> For entrepreneurs, the appeal is obvious. A white paper published online replaces weeks of pitches to VC firms, followed by an online auction that can take minutes. The technology can be poked and prodded by geeks around the world, providing a depth of expertise often missing at even the best Silicon Valley firms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-4b912208efa03ba02839e87c68f8e3c9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899AA5719889C NWBKMA</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NNY-78H1-DXVP-V4B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"463\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Patriot Ledger<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

They ate at Mar-a-Lago, a private club in Florida owned by <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shapiro, president and CEO of the influential Consumer Technology Association, says he wondered if some would feel \"uncomfortable,\" given the tech industry's opposition to Trump.</p><p>\"I didn't want to offend anyone,\" he says.</p><p>Shapiro, a Trump critic during the campaign, was one of the first to lay out how the tech industry could work with the new president. Yet, one month into <person><nameText>Trump's presidency, </nameText></person>that working relationship is increasingly rocky, thanks in large part to the controversial travel ban loathed by Silicon Valley.</p><p>Tech leaders are now faced with a difficult balancing act. They worry that appearing to get too close to Trump could damage their standing with customers. But they need to build bridges to the administration on key issues like tax reform and regulations.</p><p>The new \"calculus\" for some companies, according to Shapiro, boils down to: \"Are you more concerned about what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>can do with a tweet, or are you more concerned with what your customers can do?\"</p><p>Lately, the answer seems to be the latter.</p><p>The CEOs of Uber, Tesla and IBM have each had to defend their role on Trump's business advisory council after facing criticism from customers and employees. Uber, in particular, faced a backlash that pushed CEO <person><nameText>Travis Kalanick </nameText></person>to drop out of the council.</p><p>\"The Uber issue has sent most companies in the other direction. You get punished for not distancing yourself from this guy,\" says Bradley Tusk, a regulatory adviser who has worked with Uber and Tesla.</p><p>Friending Republicans</p><p>The <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>can make life difficult for any tech company. It can push for antitrust investigations, scrutinize large mergers, withhold government contracts and slap on new regulations.</p><p>During the campaign, Trump said he would create \"problems\" at Amazon for allegedly being a \"monopoly\" and not paying enough taxes. He also pledged to block the mega-merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner, CNN's parent company.</p><p>Some tech companies are now trying to keep a foot in the door with the new D.C. even as they publicly push back against Trump's policies.</p><p>\"There are lines of communication with the White House. They are still talking,\" says one lobbyist who works with the tech industry and spoke on the condition of anonymity. But much of the industry's public outreach will likely be directed at federal departments and Congress rather than the president, according to the lobbyist.</p><p/><p>Tech firms are beginning to turn to lobbyists with connections to Trump. The problem is that there aren't many because Trump himself is new to politics.</p><p>Brian Ballard, a finance chairman for Trump in Florida, recently opened a new lobbying office in D.C. for federal issues and counts Amazon as a client. The goal, Ballard says, is to help clients figure out the \"new universe\" in D.C.</p><p>\"You can't put your head in the sand and say, 'I just wish this didn't happen,'\" Ballard tells CNNTech. \"It's happened. It's real. And people are adapting to it.\"</p><p>But it's still unclear who exactly tech companies should be courting.</p><p>\"If you're a company trying to hire Republicans, do you hire Trump Republicans, or [Paul] Ryan Republicans, or [Mike] Pence Republicans, or somebody else?\" says one person who works with the big tech companies on government policy.</p><p>\"I don't think most of us have figured out how to deal with it,\" the source adds. \"From one week to another, it's not clear what's the best tactic.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley gets disrupted</p><p>The relationship between tech and Trump has worsened from just two months ago.</p><p>Top execs from Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and other tech companies met with Trump in December.</p><p>The conversation touched on key issues for Silicon Valley, including jobs, China, tax reform and immigration. But it was the immigration issue that undermined the working relationship in the first days of <person><nameText>Trump's presidency.</nameText></person></p><p>After Trump ordered a temporary travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, dozens of tech companies filed court papers arguing it was unconstitutional. For Silicon Valley, the issue was personal.</p><p>\"It goes directly against all of the values of our ecosystem and our industry,\" Aaron Levie, CEO and cofounder of Box, told CNNTech after joining the court fight. \"The industry got caught off guard.\"</p><p>The result, according to Levie, was a \"more stressed relationship\" between tech and Trump. \"I think that we can have disagreements on specific policies while still being productive and collaborating with the overall administration,\" Levie says.</p><p>But, Levie added, that potential for a productive working relationship \"does get reduced with the more unpredictability there is and the more chaos that emerges.\"</p><p>Reps for the White House did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p/><p>During the Obama years, the tech industry took positions on political issues like net neutrality and the need for encryption. But Obama was a vocal advocate for tech innovation and has hinted at a desire to be a venture capitalist. The administration basically gave Silicon Valley \"a pass,\" according to one lobbyist.</p><p>Some members of Obama's staff came from, or took jobs in, Silicon Valley. So tech companies could push back and still enjoy a strong relationship with the administration.</p><p>\"Most of our companies have only known a President Obama during their life as a company,\" says Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of the Internet Association, a trade group that represents Facebook, Snapchat, Pinterest and others. \"That's going to be an adjustment.\"</p><p>Trump and his administration may be less willing than Obama to look past the outspokenness on certain issues.</p><p>\"No one is keeping score, but it is natural to notice who is supportive on key policies,\" says Charlie Black, a former lobbyist for Trump whose firm Prime Policy Group works with Google.</p><p>This may explain why the tech industry chose to speak out in unison against Trump's immigration order. As the source who works with tech companies on government policy put it, \"You don't want to be an outlier in a world of Trump.\"</p><p>Advisers and lobbyists are now cautioning tech companies to think twice before opposing the <person><nameText>Trump administration.</nameText></person></p><p>\"It's going to be a long and bumpy four years,\" Tusk wrote in a memo to his tech clients this month. \"Even if you are going to speak out, wait for the right moment.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20170221tech-trump-relationship1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MY2-7X41-JBPX-W0SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1091\"/><timeReceived>4:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>February 21, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>tech-trump-relationship</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

They ate at Mar-a-Lago, a private club in Florida owned by <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shapiro, president and CEO of the influential Consumer Technology Association, says he wondered if some would feel \"uncomfortable,\" given the tech industry's opposition to Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I didn't want to offend anyone,\" he says.</p><p>Shapiro, a Trump critic during the campaign, was one of the first to lay out how the tech industry could work with the new president. Yet, one month into <person><nameText>Trump's presidency, </nameText></person>that working relationship is increasingly rocky, thanks in large part to the controversial travel ban loathed by Silicon Valley.</p><p>Tech leaders are now faced with a difficult balancing act. They worry that appearing to get too close to Trump could damage their standing with customers. But they need to build bridges to the administration on key issues like tax reform and regulations.</p><p>The new \"calculus\" for some companies, according to Shapiro, boils down to: \"Are you more concerned about what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>can do with a tweet, or are you more concerned with what your customers can do?\"</p><p>Lately, the answer seems to be the latter.</p><p>The CEOs of Uber, Tesla and IBM have each had to defend their role on Trump's business advisory council after facing criticism from customers and employees. Uber, in particular, faced a backlash that pushed CEO <person><nameText>Travis Kalanick </nameText></person>to drop out of the council. </p><p>\"The Uber issue has sent most companies in the other direction. You get punished for not distancing yourself from this guy,\" says Bradley Tusk, a regulatory adviser who has worked with Uber and Tesla.</p><p>Friending Republicans</p><p>The <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>can make life difficult for any tech company. It can push for antitrust investigations, scrutinize large mergers, withhold government contracts and slap on new regulations.</p><p>During the campaign, Trump said he would create \"problems\" at Amazon for allegedly being a \"monopoly\" and not paying enough taxes. He also pledged to block the mega-merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner, CNN's parent company. </p><p>Some tech companies are now trying to keep a foot in the door with the new D.C. even as they publicly push back against Trump's policies.</p><p>\"There are lines of communication with the White House. They are still talking,\" says one lobbyist who works with the tech industry and spoke on the condition of anonymity. But much of the industry's public outreach will likely be directed at federal departments and Congress rather than the president, according to the lobbyist.</p><p>Tech firms are beginning to turn to lobbyists with connections to Trump. The problem is that there aren't many because Trump himself is new to politics.</p><p>Brian Ballard, a finance chairman for Trump in Florida, recently opened a new lobbying office in D.C. for federal issues and counts Amazon as a client. The goal, Ballard says, is to help clients figure out the \"new universe\" in D.C.</p><p>\"You can't put your head in the sand and say, 'I just wish this didn't happen,'\" Ballard tells CNNTech. \"It's happened. It's real. And people are adapting to it.\"</p><p>But it's still unclear who exactly tech companies should be courting.</p><p>\"If you're a company trying to hire Republicans, do you hire Trump Republicans, or [Paul] Ryan Republicans, or [Mike] Pence Republicans, or somebody else?\" says one person who works with the big tech companies on government policy. </p><p>\"I don't think most of us have figured out how to deal with it,\" the source adds. \"From one week to another, it's not clear what's the best tactic.\" </p><p>Silicon Valley gets disrupted</p><p>The relationship between tech and Trump has worsened from just two months ago. </p><p>Top execs from Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and other tech companies met with Trump in December.</p><p>The conversation touched on key issues for Silicon Valley, including jobs, China, tax reform and immigration. But it was the immigration issue that undermined the working relationship in the first days of <person><nameText>Trump's presidency.</nameText></person></p><p>After Trump ordered a temporary travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, dozens of tech companies filed court papers arguing it was unconstitutional. For Silicon Valley, the issue was personal.</p><p>\"It goes directly against all of the values of our ecosystem and our industry,\" Aaron Levie, CEO and cofounder of Box, told CNNTech after joining the court fight. \"The industry got caught off guard.\"</p><p>The result, according to Levie, was a \"more stressed relationship\" between tech and Trump. \"I think that we can have disagreements on specific policies while still being productive and collaborating with the overall administration,\" Levie says.</p><p>But, Levie added, that potential for a productive working relationship \"does get reduced with the more unpredictability there is and the more chaos that emerges.\"</p><p>Reps for the White House did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>During the Obama years, the tech industry took positions on political issues like net neutrality and the need for encryption. But Obama was a vocal advocate for tech innovation and has hinted at a desire to be a venture capitalist. The industry basically gave Silicon Valley \"a pass,\" according to one lobbyist.</p><p>Some members of Obama's staff came from, or took jobs in, Silicon Valley. So tech companies could push back and still enjoy a strong relationship with the administration.</p><p>\"Most of our companies have only known a President Obama during their life as a company,\" says Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of the Internet Association, a trade group that represents Facebook, Snapchat, Pinterest and others. \"That's going to be an adjustment.\" </p><p>Trump and his administration may be less willing than Obama to look past the outspokenness on certain issues.</p><p>\"No one is keeping score, but it is natural to notice who is supportive on key policies,\" says Charlie Black, a former lobbyist for Trump whose firm Prime Policy Group works with Google. </p><p>This may explain why the tech industry chose to speak out in unison against Trump's immigration order. As the source who works with tech companies on government policy put it, \"You don't want to be an outlier in a world of Trump.\"</p><p>Advisers and lobbyists are now cautioning tech companies to think twice before opposing the <person><nameText>Trump administration. </nameText></person></p><p>\"It's going to be a long and bumpy four years,\" Tusk wrote in a memo to his tech clients this month. \"Even if you are going to speak out, wait for the right moment.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Police officers in San Mateo, priced out of a market where the median house price has surged to $1.3m ((EURO)1.17m), have taken to sleeping in their cars. In the nearby town of Sunnyvale, homelessness has nearly tripled in two years. San Francisco's pavements are so awash in human faeces from its soaring homeless population that they pose a greater contamination risk than developing world cities in Brazil or Kenya, according to a study by the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The tech boom has unleashed a wave of wealth. Yet in the face of growing public opprobrium of the industry's power and the clumsiness with which it wields it, companies are suddenly scrambling to be seen as good citizens.</p><p>The latest spasm came last week when Apple unveiled a sweeping, if vague, $2.5bn plan to bankroll new housing. Facebook pledged $1bn for new homes last month. Google said it would stump up $1bn in June.</p><p>Silicon Valley companies did not create the housing and homelessness crisis, but they have made it worse. The companies shower employees with lavish pay packages and share options, turning countless rank-and-file workers into millionaires who plough their earnings into a critically undersupplied housing market. For years, however, the industry studiously avoided dealing with the fallout - a frenzy in home prices and rents and an attendant spike in homelessness in America's richest state.</p><p>Now tech's leading lights are aping the Victorian business dynasties, such as the Cadbury family, which built Bournville, a \"model village\" just outside Birmingham, meant to \"alleviate the evils of modern, more cramped living conditions\".</p><p>The $4.5bn from Big Tech made for good headlines. Governor Gavin Newsom, who last month signed the Housing Crisis Act to streamline planning approvals, praised Apple's move. The problem is that it will barely make a dent in a situation that has been building for years. Since 2011, the San Francisco Bay Area, which is home to three of America's five biggest companies - Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook - has created 676,000 net new jobs. Over that period, however, only 176,000 new housing units were built.</p><p>When Apple opened its $5bn spaceship headquarters in Cupertino in 2017, the project included an 80-acre car park - enough for 11,000 cars - but just 19 units of new affordable housing in the city of 60,000. The plan was blessed by a local council known for its Olympic-level not-in-my-backyard policies.</p><p>Indeed, it has been so successful at stopping development that the median home price in the city just topped $2m, more than twice the $970,000 it hit in 2010. A plan to turn a defunct shopping centre into 2,400 apartments has been tied up in court by local interest groups who claim the property is a toxic waste site.</p><p>It is lost on no one that Silicon Valley's pang of conscience, after years of doing little to address the problems, has come at the same time that the government has levelled an antitrust bazooka at its leading lights. Competition investigations have been opened this year into Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.</p><p>Apple's plan includes a $1bn affordable housing fund, $1bn in low-interest mortgages for homebuyers, and $300m worth of Apple owned-land that it will set aside for new homes, among other programmes.</p><p>In the local county, Apple and Google are the second and third largest landowners (Stanford University is number one), with portfolios worth $9bn and $7.5bn, respectively. Public pressure has been growing for them to loosen their grip on their land - and their cash - as tent cities have popped up under flyovers and on pavements. Google's plan for a giant new headquarters in nearby Mountain View is centred on a public train station and contemplates hundreds of new affordable housing units.</p><p>The problem is worse in San Francisco, where one child in every 20 attending the city's public schools is homeless. A recent proposal to build housing for teachers, who are leaving the city in droves, was struck down by the city council.</p><p>The reality is that even if every cent of that $4.5bn is poured in new housing units, it will be a drop in the bucket. It costs $450,000 to build a single unit of affordable housing in the Bay Area, which is almost double the median home price nationally. In other words, that $4.5bn would build at most 10,000 new housing units in a state that, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, needs 3.5m by 2025.</p><p>And all the money in the world can do only so much when regulations are tilted so mightily against development. The upshot is that California, which has record-low unemployment and is flush with high-paying jobs, is experiencing a net outflow of people. According to the state figures, California saw 5m arrive in the 10 years to 2016, but saw 6m leave. In short, people are fleeing the best job market in America because they can't afford it. Big Tech has thus far dealt with it by ratcheting up salaries and laying on thousands of luxury buses to ferry in workers from increasingly far-off locations.</p><p>Richard Walker, an economic geographer at the University of California, Berkeley and author of Pictures of a Gone City, a book on the societal fallout of the tech boom, sees this taking a darker turn.</p><p>He said: \"The only way you're going to rectify this is through massive social mobilisation. It used to be called class struggle. You can call it whatever you want, but it's social conflict, social mobilisation, political battles, to try to get back some of the wealth that has been frittered away by de-taxation at the national and state level.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The ultra-modern Apple Park in Cupertino contrasts with the gritty reality on the streets, where homelessness is a growing problem</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-154636327</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XG5-KJ71-JCBW-N4DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"939\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 10, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Our analysis shows a groundswell of support among tech workers for Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The two most radical\u00a0candidates\u00a0have received the most donations from employees at California\u2019s largest technology companies \u2014 despite their threats to\u00a0drastically curb the influence of Big Tech.

We love our nifty phones and just-a-click-away services, but these behemoths enjoy unfettered economic domination and horde riches on a scale not seen since the monopolies of the Gilded Age. The only logical conclusion?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We must bust up big tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Want to build a firm with billions of users and hundreds of billions in value? Appeal to a core human organ that makes adoption of the platform instinctive. Google is God, Facebook is love, Amazon is consumption, and Apple is sex.</p><p>In an economy, productivity growth should raise the living standards for the majority of workers. However, in recent decades, productivity has climbed nearly 74%, while hourly compensation grew just 12.5%.</p><p>I've benefited enormously from big tech. Prophet, the consulting firm I cofounded in 1992, helped companies navigate a new landscape being reshaped by Google. Red Envelope, the upscale e-commerce company I cofounded in 1997, never would have made it out of the crib if Amazon hadn't ignited the market's interest in e-commerce. More recently, L2, which I founded in 2010, was born from the mobile and social waves as companies needed a way to benchmark their performance on new platforms.</p><p>The benefits of big tech have accrued for me on another level as well. In my investment portfolio, the appreciation of Amazon and Apple stock restored economic security to my household after being run over in the Great Recession. Finally, Amazon is now the largest recruiter of students from the brand-strategy and digital-marketing courses I teach at NYU Stern School of Business.</p><p>These firms have been great partners, clients, investments, and recruiters. And the sum of two decades of experience with, and study of, these companies leads me to a singular conclusion_ It's time to break up big tech.</p><p>Over the past decade, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google-or, as I call them, \"the Four\"-have aggregated more economic value and influence than nearly any other commercial entity in history. Together, they have a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion (the GDP of France), a staggering 24 percent share of the S&amp;P 500 Top 50, close to the value of every stock traded on the Nasdaq in 2001.</p><p>How big are they? Consider that Amazon, with a market cap of $591 billion, is worth more to the stock market than Walmart, Costco, T. J. Maxx, Target, Ross, Best Buy, Ulta, Kohl's, Nordstrom, Macy's, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Saks/Lord &amp; Taylor, Dillard's, JCPenney, and Sears combined.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook and Google (now known as Alphabet) are together worth $1.3 trillion. You could merge the world's top five advertising agencies (WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, IPG, and Dentsu) with five major media companies (Disney, Time Warner, 21st Century Fox, CBS, and Viacom) and still need to add five major communications companies (AT&amp;T, Verizon, Comcast, Charter, and Dish) to get only 90 percent of what Google and Facebook are worth together.</p><p>And what of Apple? With a market cap of nearly $900 billion, Apple is the most valuable public company. Even more remarkable is that the company registers profit margins of 32 percent, closer to luxury brands Herm\u00e8s (35 percent) and Ferrari (29 percent) than peers in electronics. In 2016, Apple brought in $46 billion in profits, a haul larger than that of any other American company, including JPMorgan Chase, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Wells Fargo. What's more, Apple's profits were greater than the revenues of either Coca- Cola or Facebook. This quarter, it will clock nearly twice the profits that Amazon has produced in its history.</p><p>The Four's wealth and influence are staggering. How did we get here?</p><p>As I wrote in my book, The Four, the only way to build a company with the dominance and mass influence of Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple is to appeal to a core human organ that makes adoption of the platform instinctive.</p><p/><p>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 GOOGLE_ MIND-ALTERING</p><p>Our brains are sophisticated enough to ask very complex questions but not sophisticated enough to answer them. Since Homo sapiens emerged from caves, we've relied on prayer to address that gap_ We lift our gaze to the heavens, send up a question, and wait for a response from a more intelligent being. \"Will my kid be all right?\" \"Who might attack us?\"</p><p>As Western nations become wealthier, organized religion plays a smaller role in our lives. But the void between questions and answers remains, creating an opportunity. As more and more people become alienated from traditional religion, we look to Google as our immediate, all-knowing oracle of answers from trivial to profound. Google is our modern-day god.</p><p>Google appeals to the brain, offering knowledge to everyone, regardless of background or education level. If you have a smartphone or an Internet connection, your prayers will always be answered_ \"Will my kid be all right?\" \"Symptoms and treatment of croup. . .\" \"Who might attack us?\" \"Nations with active nuclear-weapons programs . . .\"</p><p>Think back on every fear, every hope, every desire you've confessed to Google's search box and then ask yourself_ Is there any entity you've trusted more with your secrets? Does anybody know you better than Google?</p><p>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 FACEBOOK_ THE HEART OF THE MATTER</p><p>Facebook appeals to the heart. Feeling loved is the key to well-being. Studies of kids in Romanian orphanages who had stunted physical and mental development found that the delay was due not to poor nutrition, as suspected, but to lack of human affection. Yet one of the traits of our species is that we need to love nearly as much as we need to be loved. Susan Pinker, a developmental psychologist, studied the Italian island of Sardinia, where centenarians are six times as common as they are on mainland Italy and ten times as common as in North America. Pinker discovered that among genetic and lifestyle factors, the Sardinians' emphasis on close personal relationships and face-to-face interactions is the key to their superlongevity. Other studies have also found that the deciding factor in longevity isn't genetics but lifestyle, especially the strength of our social bonds.</p><p>Facebook gives its 2.1 billion monthly active users tools to fuel our need to love others. It's satisfying to rediscover someone we went to high school with. It's good to know we can keep in touch with friends who move away. It takes minutes, with a \"like\" on a baby pic or a brief comment on a friend's heartfelt post, to reinforce friendships and family relationships that are important to us.</p><p>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 AMAZON_ ALWAYS CONSUMING</p><p>What sight is to the eyes and sound is to the ears, the feeling of more, of insatiety, is to the gut. We crave more stuff psychologically just as the stomach craves more sugar, more carbs, after an indulgent meal. Originally this instinct operated in the service of self-preservation_ Having too little meant starvation and certain death, whereas too much was rare, a bloat or a hangover. But open your closets or your cupboards right now, and you'll probably find you have ten to a hundred times as much as you need. Rationally, we know this makes no sense, but society and our higher brain haven't caught up to the instinct of always feeling like we need more.</p><p>Amazon is the large intestine of the consumptive self. It stores nutrients and distributes them to the cardiovascular system of the 64 percent of American households who are Prime members. It has adopted the best strategy in the history of business-\"more for less\"-and deployed it more effectively and efficiently than any other firm in history.</p><p>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 APPLE_ SET TO VIBRATE</p><p>The second-most-powerful instinct after survival is procreation. As sexual creatures, we want to signal how elegant, smart, and creative we are. We want to signal power. Sex is irrational, luxury is irrational, and Apple learned very early on that it could appeal to our need to be desirable-and in turn increase its profit margins-by placing print ads in Vogue, having supermodels at product launches, and building physical stores as glass temples to the brand.</p><p>A Dell computer may be powerful and fast, but it doesn't indicate membership in the innovation class as a MacBook Air does. Likewise, the iPhone is something more than a phone, or even a smartphone. Consumers aren't paying $1,000 for an iPhone X because they're passionate about facial recognition. They're signaling they make a good living, appreciate the arts, and have disposable income. It's a sign to others_ If you mate with me, your kids are more likely to survive than if you mate with someone carrying an Android phone. After all, iPhone users on average earn 40 percent more than Android users. Mating with someone who is on the iOS platform is a shorter path to a better life.</p><p>The brain, the heart, the large intestine, and the groin_ By appealing to these four organs, the Four have entrenched their services, products, and operating systems deeply into our psyches. They've made us more discerning, more demanding consumers. And what's good for the consumer is good for society, right?</p><p>Well, yes and no. The Four have so much power over our lives that most of us would be rocked to the core if one or more of them were to disappear. Imagine not being able to have an iPhone, or having to use Yahoo or Bing for search, or losing years' worth of memories you've posted on Facebook. What if you could no longer order something with one click on the Amazon app and have it arrive tomorrow?</p><p>At the same time, we've handed over so much of our lives to a few Silicon Valley executives that we've started talking about the downsides of these firms. As the Four have become increasingly dominant, a murmur of concern-and even resentment-has begun to make itself heard. After years of hype, we've finally begun to consider the suggestion that the government, or someone, ought to put the brakes on.</p><p>Not all of the arguments are equally persuasive, but they're worth restating before we get to the real reason I believe we ought to break up big tech.</p><p>Big tech learned from the sins of the original gangster, Microsoft. The colossus at times appeared to feel it was above trafficking in PR campaigns and lobbyists to soften its image among the public and regulators. In contrast, the Four promote an image of youth and idealism, coupled with evangelizing the world-saving potential of technology.</p><p>The sentiment is sincere, but mostly canny. By appealing to something loftier than mere profit, the Four are able to satisfy a growing demand among employees for so-called purpose-driven firms. Big tech's tinkerer- in-the-garage mythology taps into an old American reverence for science and engineering, one that dates back to the Manhattan Project and the Apollo program.</p><p>Best of all, the companies' vague, high-minded pronouncements-\"Think Different,\" \"Don't Be Evil\"-provide the ultimate illusion. Political progressives are generally viewed as well-meaning but weak, an image that offered the perfect cover for companies that were becoming hugely powerful. Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg told women to \"lean in\" because she meant it, but she also had to register the irony of her message of female empowerment, set against a company that emerged from a site originally designed to rank the attractiveness of Harvard undergraduates, much less a firm destroying tens of thousands of jobs in an industry that hires a relatively high number of female employees_ media and communications.</p><p>These public-relations efforts paid off handsomely but also set the companies up for a major fall. It's an enormous letdown to discover that the guy who seems like the perfect gentleman is in fact addicted to opioids and a jerk to his mother. It's even worse to learn that he only hung out with you because of your money (clicks).</p><p>In my experience as the founder of several early Internet firms, the people who work for the Four are no more or less evil than people at other successful companies. They're a bit more educated, a little smarter, and much luckier, but like their parents before them, most are just trying to find their way and make a living. Sure, many of them would be happy to help out humanity. But presented with the choice between the betterment of society or a Tesla, most would opt for the Tesla-and the Tesla dealerships in Palo Alto are doing well, really well. Does this make them evil? Of course not. It simply makes them employees at a for-profit firm operating in a capitalist society.</p><p>Our government operates on an annual budget of approximately 21 percent of GDP, money that is used to keep our parks open and our military armed. Does big tech pay its fair share? Most would say no. Between 2007 and 2015, Amazon paid only 13 percent of its profits in taxes, Apple paid 17 percent, Google paid 16 percent, and Facebook paid just 4 percent. In contrast, the average tax rate for the S&amp;P 500 was 27 percent.</p><p>So, yes, the Four do avoid taxes . . . and so do you. They're just better at it. Apple, for example, uses an accounting trick to move its profits to domains such as Ireland, which results in lower taxes for the most profitable firm in the world. As of September 2017, the company was holding $250 billion overseas, a hoard that is barely taxed and should never have been abroad in the first place. That means a U. S. company is holding enough cash overseas to buy Disney and Netflix.</p><p>Apple is hardly alone. General Electric also engages in massive tax avoidance, but we're not as angry about it, as we aren't in love with GE. The fault here lies with us, and with our democratically elected government. We need to simplify the tax code-complex rules tend to favor those who can afford to take advantage of them-and we need to elect officials who will enforce it.</p><p>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 The destruction of jobS by the Four is significant, even frightening. Facebook and Google likely added $29 billion in revenue in 2017. To execute and service this additional business, they will create twenty thousand new, high-paying jobs.</p><p>The other side of the coin is less shiny. Advertising-whether digital or analog-is a low-growth (increasingly flat) business, meaning that the sector is largely zero-sum. Google doesn't earn an extra dollar by growing the market; it takes a dollar from another firm. If we use the five largest media-services firms (WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, IPG, and Dentsu) as a proxy for their industry, we can estimate that $29 billion in revenue would have required about 219,000 traditional advertising professionals to service. That translates to 199,000 creative directors, copywriters, and agency executives deciding to \"spend more time with their families\" each year-nearly four Yankee Stadiums filled with people dressed in black holding pink slips.</p><p>The economic success stories of yesterday employed many more people than the firms that dominate the headlines today. Procter &amp; Gamble, after a run-up in its stock price in 2017, has a market capitalization of $233 billion and employs ninety-five thousand people, or $2.4 million per employee. Intel, a new-economy firm that could be more efficient with its capital, enjoys a market cap of $209 billion and employs 102,000 people, or $2.1 million per employee. Meanwhile, Facebook, which was founded fourteen years ago, boasts a $542 billion market cap and employs only twenty-three thousand people, or $23.4 million per employee-ten times that of P&amp;G and Intel.</p><p>Granted, we've seen job destruction before. But we've never seen companies quite this good at it. Uber set a new (low) bar with $68 billion spread across only twelve thousand employees, or $5.7 million per employee. It's hardly obvious that a ride-share company-which requires actual drivers on the actual roads-would be the one to arbitrage the middle class with a Houdini move that would have Henry Ford spinning in his grave. But Uber managed it by creating a two-class workforce, complete with a new classification_ \"driver-partners,\" in other words, contractors. Keeping them off the payroll means that Uber's investors and twelve thousand white-collar employees do not share any of the company's $68 billion in equity with its \"partners.\" In addition, the firm is not inconvenienced with paying health or unemployment insurance and paid time off for any of its two-million-strong driver workforce.</p><p>Big tech's job destruction makes an even stronger case for getting these firms to pay their fair share of taxes, so that the government can soften the blow with retraining and social services. We should be careful, however, not to let job destruction be the lone catalyst for intervention. Job replacement and productivity improvements-from farmers to factory workers, and factory workers to service workers, and service workers to tech workers-are part of the story of American innovation. It's important to let our freaks of success fly their flag.</p><p>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Getting warmer. Having your firm weaponized by foreign adversaries to undermine our democratic election process is bad . . . really bad. During the 2016 election, Russian troll pages on Facebook paid to promote approximately three thousand political ads. Fabricated content reached 126 million users. It doesn't stop there-the GRU, the Russian military-intelligence agency, has lately taken a more bipartisan approach to sowing chaos. Even after the election, the GRU has used Facebook, Google, and Twitter to foment racially motivated violence. The platforms invested little or no money or effort to prevent it. The GRU purchased Facebook ads in rubles_ literally and figuratively a red flag.</p><p>If you're a country club with a beach or a pool, it's more profitable, in the short run, not to have lifeguards. There are risks to that business model, as there are to Facebook's dependence on mainly algorithmic moderation, but it saves a lot of money. The notion that we can expect big tech to allocate the requisite resources, of the companies' own will, for the social good is similar to the idea that Exxon will take a leadership position on global warming. It's not going to happen.</p><p>However, the alarm for trust busting, not just regulation, rang for me in November, when Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr pleaded with the general counsels of Facebook, Google, and Twitter, \"Don't let nation-states disrupt our future. You're the front line of defense for it.\" This represented a seminal moment in our history, when our elected officials handed over our national defense to firms whose business model is to nag you about the shoes you almost bought, and remind you of your friends' birthdays.</p><p>They should be our front line against our enemies?</p><p>Let's be clear, our front line of defense has been, and must continue to be, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. Not the Zuck.</p><p>It's not just federal officials who have folded in the face of big tech. As part of their bid for Amazon's second headquarters, state and city officials in Chicago proposed to let Amazon keep $1.3 billion in employee payroll taxes and spend this money as the company sees fit. That's right_ Chicago offered to transfer its tax authority to Amazon and trusts the Seattle firm to allocate taxes in a manner best for Chicago's residents.</p><p>The surrender of our government only gets worse from there. If you want to manufacture and sell a Popsicle to children, you must undergo numerous expensive FDA tests and provide thorough labeling that outlines the ingredients, calories, and sugar content of the treat. But what warning labels are included in Instagram's user agreement? We've now seen abundant research indicating that social- media platforms are making teens more depressed. Ask yourself_ If ice cream were making teens more prone to suicide, would we shrug and seat the CEO of Dreyer's next to the president at dinners in Silicon Valley?</p><p>Anyone who doesn't believe these products are the delivery systems for tobacco- like addiction has never separated a seven- year-old from an iPad in exchange for a look that communicates a plot to kill you. If you don't believe in the addictive aspects of these platforms, ask yourself why American teenagers are spending an average of five hours a day glued to their Internet- connected screens. The variable rewards of social media keep us checking our notifications as though they were slot machines, and research has shown that children and teens are particularly sensitive to the dopamine cravings these platforms foster. It's no accident that many tech companies' execs are on the record saying they don't give their kids access to these devices.</p><p>All of these are valid concerns. But none of them alone, or together, is enough to justify breaking up big tech. The following are reasons I believe the Four should be broken up.</p><p>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 The purpose of an economy</p><p>Ganesh Sitaraman, professor at Vanderbilt Law School, argues that the U. S. needs the middle class, that the Constitution was designed for a balanced share of wealth for our representative democracy to work. If the rich have too much power, it can lead to an oligarchy. If the poor have too much power, it can lead to a revolution. So the middle class needs to be the rudder that steers American democracy on an even keel.</p><p>I believe that the primary purpose of the economy, and one of its key agents, the firm, is to create and sustain the middle class. The U. S. middle class from 1941 to 2000 was one of the most ferocious sources of good in world history. The American middle class financed, fought, and won good wars; took care of the aged; funded a cure for polio; put men on the moon; and showed the rest of the world that self-interest, and the consumption and innovation it inspired, could be an engine for social and economic transformation.</p><p>The upward spiral of an economy depends on the circular flow between households and companies. Households offer resources and labor, and companies offer goods and jobs. Competition motivates the invention and distribution of better offerings (happy hour, rear-view camera, etc.), and the big wheel spins round and round.</p><p>Big tech creates enormous stakeholder value. So why are we witnessing, for the first time in decades, other countries grow their middle class while ours is declining? If an economy is meant to sustain a middle class, and the social stability it fosters, then our economy is failing.</p><p>Without a doubt, there have been tremendous gains in productivity in the U. S. over the past thirty years. It would be hard to deny that the American consumer, at every level, has become the envy of the free world. Yet the productivity boost and the elevation of the consumer to modern-day nobility have created a dystopia in which we've traded well- paying jobs and economic security for powerful phones and coconut water delivered in under an hour.</p><p>How did that happen? Since the turn of the millennium, firms and investors have fallen in love with companies whose ability to replace humans with technology has enabled rapid growth and outsize profit margins. Those huge profits attract cheap capital and render the rest of the sector flaccid. Old-economy firms and fledgling start-ups have no shot.</p><p>The result is a winner-takes-all economy, both for companies and for people. Society is bifurcating into those who are part of the innovation economy (lords) and those who aren't (serfs). One great idea will make a twenty- something the darling of venture capital, while those who are average, or even just unlucky (most of us), have to work much harder to save for retirement.</p><p>It's never been easier to be a billionaire or harder to be a millionaire. It's painfully clear that the invisible hand, for the past three decades, has been screwing the middle class. For the first time since the Great Depression, a thirty-year-old is less well-off than his or her parents at thirty.</p><p>Should we care? What if these icons of innovation are the disrupters we need to keep our economy fit? Isn't there a chance we'll come through the other end of the tunnel with a stronger economy and higher wages? Already there's evidence that this isn't happening. In fact, the bifurcation effect seems to be gaining momentum. It's likely the biggest threat to our society. Many will argue it's the world we live in. But isn't the world what we make of it? And we have consciously shifted the mission of the U. S. from producing millions of millionaires to producing one trillionaire. Alexa, is this a good thing?</p><p>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Markets Are Failing, Everywhere</p><p>Right now we are in the midst of a dramatic market failure, one in which the government has been lulled by the public's fascination with big tech. Robust markets are efficient and powerful, yet just as football games don't work without referees who regularly step in, throw flags, and move one team backward or forward, unfettered capitalism gave us climate change, the mortgage crisis, and U. S. health care.</p><p>Monopolies themselves aren't always illegal, or even undesirable. Natural monopolies exist where it makes sense to have one firm achieve the requisite scale to invest and offer services at a reasonable price. But the tradeoff is heavy regulation. Florida Power &amp; Light serves ten million people; its parent company, NextEra Energy, has a market cap of $72 billion. However, pricing and service standards are regulated by people who are fiduciaries for the public.</p><p>The Four, by contrast, have managed to preserve their monopoly-like powers without heavy regulation. I describe their power as \"monopoly-like,\" since, with the possible exception of Apple, they have not used their power to do the one thing that most economists would describe as the whole point of assembling a monopoly, which is to raise prices for consumers. Nevertheless, the Four's exploitation of our knee-jerk antipathy to big government has been so effective that it's led most of us to forget that competition-no less than private property, wage labor, voluntary exchange, and a price system-is one of the indispensable cylinders of the capitalist engine. Their massive size and unchecked power have throttled competitive markets and kept the economy from doing its job-namely, to promote a vibrant middle class.</p><p>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Air supply</p><p>How do they do it? It's useful here to remember how Microsoft killed Netscape in the 1990s. The process starts innocently enough, as a firm builds an outstanding product (Windows) that becomes a portal to an entire sector-what we'd now call a platform. To sustain its growth, the company points the portal at its own products (Internet Explorer) and bullies its partners (Dell) to shut out the competition. Even though Netscape had the more popular browser, with over 90 percent market share, it couldn't compete with Microsoft's implicit subsidies for Internet Explorer.</p><p>It's happening everywhere across the Four, whether it's the slow takeover of the entire first page of search results that Google can better monetize, substandard products on your iPhone's home screen (like Apple Music), coordinating all assets of the firm (Facebook) to arrest and destroy a threat (Snap), or information-age steel dumping via fulfillment build-out and predatory pricing no other firm can access the capital to match (Amazon).</p><p/><p>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 (Un)Natural Monopolies</p><p>Maybe the consumer is better off with these \"natural\" monopolies. The Department of Justice didn't think so. In 1998, the federal government filed suit against Microsoft, alleging anticompetitive practices. During the trial, one witness reported that Microsoft executives had said they wanted to \"cut off Netscape's air supply\" by giving away Internet Explorer for free. In November 1999, a district court found that Microsoft had violated antitrust laws and subsequently ordered the company to be broken into two. (One company would sell Windows; the other would sell applications for Windows.) The breakup order was overruled by an appeals court, and ultimately Microsoft agreed to a settlement with the government that sought to curb the company's monopolistic practices by less stringent means.</p><p>The settlement was criticized by some for being too lenient, but it's worth asking whether Google-today worth $770 billion and the object of affection for any free-market evangelist-would exist if the DOJ hadn't put Microsoft on notice regarding the infanticide of promising upstarts. In the absence of the antitrust case, Microsoft likely would have leveraged its market dominance to favor Bing over Google, just as it had used Windows to euthanize Netscape. Indeed, the DOJ's case against Microsoft may have been one of the most market-oxygenating acts in business history, one that unleashed trillions of dollars in shareholder value.</p><p>The concentration of power achieved by the Four has created a market desperate for oxygen. I've sat in dozens of VC pitches by small firms. The narrative has become universal and static_ \"We don't compete directly with the Four but would be great acquisition candidates.\" Companies thread this needle or are denied the requisite oxygen (capital) to survive infancy. IPOs and the number of VC-funded firms have been in steady decline over the past few years.</p><p>Unlike Microsoft, which was typecast early on as the \"Evil Empire,\" Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon have combined savvy public-relations efforts with sophisticated political lobbying operations-think Oprah Winfrey crossed with the Koch brothers-to make themselves nearly immune to the scrutiny endured by Microsoft.</p><p>The Four's unchecked power manifests most often as a restraint of competition. Consider_ Amazon has become such a dominant force that it's now able to perform Jedi mind tricks and inflict pain on potential competitors before it enters the market. Consumer stocks used to trade on two key signals: the underlying performance of the firm (Pottery Barn's sales per square foot are up 10 percent) and the economic macro-climate (more housing starts). Now, however, private and public investors have added a third key signal: what Amazon may or may not do in the respective sector. Some recent examples:</p><p>The day Amazon announced it would enter the dental-supply business, dental-supply companies' stock fell 4 to 5 percent.</p><p>When Amazon reported it would sell prescription drugs, pharmacy stocks fell 3 to 5 percent.</p><p>Within twenty-four hours of the Amazon- Whole Foods acquisition announcement, large national grocery stocks fell 5 to 9 percent.</p><p>When the subject of monopolistic behavior comes up, Amazon's public-relations team is quick to cite its favorite number_ 4 percent-the share of U. S. retail (online and offline) Amazon controls, only half of Walmart's market share. It's a powerful defense against the call to break up the behemoth. But there are other numbers. Numbers you typically won't see in an Amazon press release:</p><p>\u00b7 34 percent_ Amazon's share of the worldwide cloud business</p><p>\u00b7 44 percent_ Amazon's share of U. S. online commerce</p><p>\u00b7 64 percent_ U. S. households with Amazon Prime</p><p>\u00b7 71 percent_ Amazon's share of in-home voice devices</p><p>\u00b7 $1.4 billion_ Amount of U. S. corporate taxes paid by Amazon since 2008, versus $64 billion for Walmart. (Amazon has added the entire value of Walmart to its market cap in the past twenty-four months.)</p><p>What about Facebook? Eighty-five percent of the time we spend on our phones is spent using an app. Four of the top five apps globally-Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger-are owned by Facebook. And the top four have allied, under the command of the Zuck, to kill the fifth-Snap Inc. What this means is that our phones are no longer communications vehicles; they're delivery devices for Facebook, Inc.</p><p>Facebook even has an internal database that tells it when a competitive app is gaining traction with its users, so that the social network can either acquire the firm (as it did with Instagram and WhatsApp) or kill it by mimicking its features (as it's trying to do with Stories and Bonfire, which are aimed at Snapchat and Houseparty).</p><p>Google, for its part, now commands a 92 percent share of a market, Internet search, that is worth $92.4 billion worldwide. That's more than the entire</p><p>advertising market of any country except the U. S. Search is now a larger market than the following global industries_</p><p>\u00b7 paper and forest products_ $81 billion</p><p>\u00b7 construction and engineering_ $79 billion</p><p>\u00b7 real estate management and development_ $76 billion</p><p>\u00b7 gas utilities_ $58 billion</p><p>How would we feel if one company controlled 92 percent of the global construction and engineering trade? Or 92 percent of the world's paper and forest products? Would we worry that their power and influence had breached a reasonable threshold, or would we just think they were awesome innovators, as we do with Google?</p><p>And then there's Apple, the most successful firm selling a low-cost product at a premium price. The total material cost for the iPhone 8 Plus is $288, a fraction of the $799 price tag. Put another way, Apple has the profit margin of Ferrari with the production volume of Toyota. Apple's users are among the most loyal, too. It has a 92 percent retention rate among consumers, compared with just 77 percent for Samsung users. In February 2017, 79 percent of all active iOS users had updated to the most recent software, versus just 1.2 percent of all active Android devices.</p><p>Apple uses its privileged place in consumers' lives to instill monopoly-like powers in its approach to competitors like Spotify. In 2016, the firm denied an update to the iOS Spotify app, essentially blocking iPhone users' access to the latest version of the music-streaming service. While Spotify has double the subscribers of Apple Music, Apple makes up the discrepancy by placing a 30 percent tax on its competition.</p><p>Apple is not shy about using its popularity among consumers to its advantage. It was recently discovered that Apple has been purposely slowing down performance on outdated iPhone models, a strategy that is likely to entice users to upgrade sooner than they would have otherwise. This is the confidence of a monopoly.</p><p/><p>In the late nineteenth century, the term trust came into use as a way to describe big businesses that controlled the majority of a particular market. Teddy Roosevelt gained a reputation as the original \"trust buster\" by breaking up the beef and railroad trusts, and filing forty more antitrust suits during his presidency. Fast-forward a hundred years, to 2016, and we find candidate Trump announcing that a Trump administration would not approve the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger \"because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" A year later, his Justice Department sued to block it.</p><p>So our presidents are still fighting the good fight, right?</p><p>Well, let's break this down. AT&amp;T has 139 million wireless subscribers, sixteen million Internet subscribers, and twenty-five million video subscribers, about twenty million of which were acquired from DirecTV. Time Warner owns content-producing brands such as HBO, Warner Bros., TNT, TBS, and CNN. A vertical merger between the two companies could, in theory, create a megacorporation capable of creating and distributing content across its network of millions of wireless-phone, Internet, and video subscribers.</p><p>Too much power in the hands of too few? Maybe. But if content-and-distribution heft is what we're worried about, then Teddy would have been knocking on Jeff's, Tim's, Larry's, and Mark's doors a decade ago. Already each of the Four has content and distribution that dwarfs a combined AT&amp;T-Time Warner_</p><p>\u00b7 Amazon spent $4.5 billion on original video in 2017, second only to Netflix's $6 billion. Prime Video has launched in more than two hundred countries and recently struck a $50 million deal with the NFL to stream ten Thursday-night games. Amazon controls a 71 percent share in voice technology and has an installed distribution base of 64 percent of American households through Prime. Name a cable company with a 64 percent market share-I'll wait. In addition, Amazon controls more of the market in cloud computing than the next five largest competitors combined. Alexa, does this foster innovation?</p><p>\u00b7 Apple is set to spend $1 billion on original content this year. The company controls 2.2 million apps and set a record in 2013 when the number of songs it sold on iTunes hit twenty- five billion. Apple's library now includes forty million songs, which can be distributed across the company's one billion active iOS devices, and that's not even mentioning its television and video offerings. But AT&amp;T needs to sell Cartoon Network?</p><p>\u00b7 Facebook owns a torrent of content created by its 2.1 billion monthly active users. Through its site and its apps, the company reaches 66 percent of U. S. adults. Facebook plans to spend $1 billion on original content. It's the world's most prolific content machine, dominating the majority of phones worldwide. Now \"what's on your mind?\"</p><p>\u00b7 Four hundred hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute, which means that Google has more video content than any other entity on earth. It also controls the operating system on two billion Android devices. But AT&amp;T needs to divest Adult Swim?</p><p>Perhaps Trump is right that the merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner is unreasonable, but if so, then we should have broken up the Four ten years ago. Each of the Four, after all, wields a harmful monopolistic power that leverages market dominance to restrain trade. But where is the Department of Justice? Where are the furious Trump tweets? Convinced that the guys on the other side of the door are Christlike innovators, come to save humanity with technology, we've allowed our government to fall asleep at the wheel.</p><p>Margrethe Vestager, the EU commissioner for competition, is the only government official in a Western country whose testicles have descended-who is not afraid of, or infatuated with, big tech. Last May, she levied a $122 million fine against Facebook for lying to the EU about its ability to share data between Facebook and WhatsApp, and a month later she penalized Google $2.7 billion for anticompetitive practices. This was a good start, but it's worth noting that those fines are mere mosquito bites on the backs of elephants. The Facebook fine represented 0.6 percent of the acquisition price of WhatsApp, and Google's amounted to just 3 percent of its cash on hand. We are issuing twenty-five-cent parking tickets for not feeding a meter that costs $100 every fifteen minutes. We are telling these companies that the smart, shareholder-friendly thing to do is obvious_ Break the law, lie, do whatever it takes, and then pay a (relatively) anemic fine if you happen to get caught.</p><p/><p>The monopolistic power of big tech serves as a macho test for capitalists. The embrace of the innovation class makes us feel powerful. We like success, especially outrageous success, and we're inspired by billionaires and the incredible companies they founded. We also have a gag reflex when it comes to regulation, one that invites unattractive labels. Since I started suggesting that Amazon should be broken up, Stuart Varney of Fox News, a charming guy, has taken to introducing me on-air as a socialist. Any day now, I suspect he'll start calling me European.</p><p>There's no question that the markets sent a strong signal in 2017 that our economy is sated on regulation. But there's a difference between regulation and trust busting. What's missing from the story we tell ourselves about the economy is that trust busting is meant to protect the health of the market. It's the antidote to crude, ham-handed regulation. When markets fail, and they do, we need those referees on the field who will throw a yellow flag and restore order.</p><p>We are so there. The tremendous success of the Four-which alone accounted for 40 percent of the gains in the S&amp;P 500 for the month of October-wallpapers over the fact that, as a whole, the markets in which they operate are not healthy. Late last year, Refinery29 and BuzzFeed, two promising digital-marketing fledglings, announced layoffs, while Criteo, an ad-tech firm, shed 50 percent of its market capitalization. Why? Because there is Facebook, there is Google, and then there is everyone else. And all of those other firms, including Snap Inc., are dead; they just don't know it yet.</p><p>Are we sure all these companies deserve to die? Or is it the case that our markets are failing and preventing the development of a healthy ecosystem with dozens of digital-marketing firms growing, hiring, and innovating?</p><p/><p>Search . . .

While trust busting is typically bad for stocks in the short run, busting up Ma Bell unleashed a torrent of shareholder growth in telecommunications. Similarly, Microsoft, despite its run-in with the DOJ in the 1990s, just hit an all-time high. In addition, it's reasonable to believe that Amazon and Amazon Web Services may be worth more as separate firms than they are as one.</p><p>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Inspire more investment.There are half as many publicly traded U. S. firms than there were twenty-two years ago, and most firms in the innovation economy understand that their most likely-or only-path to exist is to be acquired by big tech. An absence of buyers makes for an economy in which the two options are to go big (become Google) or go home (go out of business). While home runs provide good theater, the doubles and triples of acquisitions by medium-sized firms are likely a stronger engine of growth.</p><p>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Broaden the tax base. The aggregation of power has resulted in firms that have so much political clout and resources that they can bring their effective tax rates well below what midsize companies pay, creating a regressive tax system.</p><p>Why should we break up big tech? Not because the Four are evil and we're good. It's because we understand that the only way to ensure competition is to sometimes cut the tops off trees, just as we did with railroads and Ma Bell. This isn't an indictment of the Four, or retribution, but recognition that a key part of a healthy economic cycle is pruning firms when they become invasive, cause premature death, and won't let other firms emerge. The breakup of big tech should and will happen, because we're capitalists. It's time.</p><p/><p>In the past forty years, four companies have created $2.8 trillion in market value--yet the middle class has seen its share of income (going to the middle 60% of households) decrease seven points.</p><p>Anyone who doesn't believe these products are the delivery systems for tobacco-like addiction has never separated a seven-year-old from an ipad in exchange for a look that communicates a plot to kill you.</p><p>It's painfully clear that the invisible hand, for the past three decades, has Been screwing the middle class.</p><p>For the first time since The Great Depression,</p><p>a thirty-year-old is less well-off than his or her parents at thirty.</p><p>Facebook and Google need fewer employees to produce the same amount of revenue as traditional advertising firms.

Between 2007 and 2015, Amazon paid only 13% in corporate-income tax, Apple paid 17%, Google paid 16%, and Facebook just 4%. In contrast, the S&amp;P 500 average was 27%.</p><p>Amazon has the unique ability to wreak havoc in an industry before it's actually entered that industry.

Google was fined $2.7 billion (just 3% of the cash on its balance sheets) for anticompetitive behavior.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESQUIR-ESQ030118BigTech_lo</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESQUIR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S43-0S41-F09K-Y025-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7346\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Hearst Communications Inc.

(Photo by Tri Nguyen)&lt;nl/&gt; On Wednesday, scores of cafeteria workers marched outside Intel headquarters[1] and disrupted Silicon Valley with a proletarian manifesto, calling for a union and 'a Tech Economy that Works for Everyone.' </p><p>Ad Policy[2] &lt;nl/&gt;This innovation hub isn't as modern as it looks. Beneath its hardware and software, the capital of the digital economy runs on human muscle. Facing retrograde labor conditions in local brick-and-mortar workplaces, advocates want to enact a law to keep the South Bay's Big Tech from crushing its flesh-and-blood workforce. &lt;nl/&gt; Silicon Valley Rising[3] (SVR), a grassroots coalition supported by Working Partnerships USA[4] and local community and labor groups, has proposed a local ballot initiative that would, if implemented, bring thousands of low-wage workers opportunities for full-time, stable employment, particularly in low-wage service sectors like cafeteria, custodial, and security contractor jobs. &lt;nl/&gt; The 'Opportunity to Work[5]' measure would direct companies to give part-time workers an opportunity to work more hours\u00a0before they hire new part-timers. This would, ideally, ensure that incumbent workers are prioritized in hiring for full-time positions, rather than falling into part-time gig work[6]. With labor distributed evenly across a somewhat smaller but higher quality workforce, SVR argues that the measure would spur a virtuous cycle of improving overall job quality across the bottom of the tech-labor market[7]. &lt;nl/&gt; Fast-food worker Sara Delete spoke at the launch of the initiative[8] about the hardships that separate her from the lavish lifestyles of tech professionals: 'Every week the number of hours I get changes, so I am never sure what my paycheck will be\u2026. I am constantly worried about being able to provide for my son, cover my rent and pay the bills.' &lt;nl/&gt; The initiative, which requires about 19,000 petition signatures to get on November's ballot, would impose a mild daily penalty on businesses that fail to comply (with exemptions for small firms and economic 'hardship'). Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce CEO Matthew Mahood told The Mercury-News[9] the measure would 'create a big obstacle to managing a flexible, part-time workforce.' But that's the point: Representing the public's growing disillusionment with the South Bay's Brave New World[10], SVR wants tech firms to play by the same rules as other bosses.&lt;nl/&gt; Most Popular1 Why Hillary Clinton Doesn't Deserve the Black Vote[11] 2 Last Night, Rachel Maddow Perfectly Captured What Bernie's Win Means for the Left[12] 3 In Defense of Beyonc\u00e9's Black Panther Tribute at the Super Bowl[13] 4 Beyond Bernie's Bros and\u00a0Hillary's Hellfire[14] 5 It's the Racism, Stupid[15] LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS&lt;nl/&gt; The precarious labor conditions besetting local service workers are especially stunning in light of the heaps of capital that tech titans\u00a0have funneled into far-flung offshore tax havens, along with the generous tax breaks and financial coddling[16] that they often draw from local lawmakers. &lt;nl/&gt; According to an analysis by Working Partnerships[17], Santa Clara County's wealth gap has expanded amid a flush of tech investment: 'From 2000 to 2010, real median household income in the Valley has fallen by 19 percent\u2014more than three times the national decline.' Housing costs have surged with the gentrification and displacement of longstanding working-class communities[18]. Meanwhile, next door to the hub of the Knowledge Economy, a local public-school district's budget bled about $15 million between 2007 and 2011. About a fifth of Silicon Valley high school students do not graduate on time. &lt;nl/&gt; In recent years, as local manufacturing jobs have collapsed[19], precarity has ballooned alongside the tech bubble. Part-time underemployment has swollen since the recession, with about 64,000 residents now working part-time or irregular hours[20]. They are generally excluded from benefits like employer-sponsored healthcare, and shut out of job-promotion opportunities. Although the vast majority of programmers have paid medical leave, more than half of security guards and maintenance workers risk losing pay if they stay home to care for sick family members. These workers are also often hired through subcontracted agencies, rendering them even more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. &lt;nl/&gt; Class and race divides[21] overlap throughout Big Tech's hierarchy. Software developers may pull in more than $60 an hour, while their office's janitor takes home under $12. Though blacks and Latinos dominate these low-wage service occupations, they 'comprise just 3 to 4 percent of the core tech workforce.' &lt;nl/&gt; There have been some positive changes in recent months spurred by rising labor activism in Silicon Valley. Pushing for a more humane vision of progress in the tech industry, labor unions have instigated successful campaigns among various service workers, including the unionization of shuttle-bus drivers[22] with the Teamsters and a successful pressure campaign led by SEIU-United Service Workers West to force Apple to stop subcontracting with low-wage security service providers[23] and instead directly hire security guards under more equitable conditions. Public pressure has goaded some\u00a0individual firms to proactively\u00a0respond to workforce inequalities: Facebook has agreed to raise wages for contractors, and Microsoft will move to offer 15 annual vacation and paid sick days[24] for employees of hundreds of contractors and vendors. &lt;nl/&gt; These gains have been incremental, however, and given the astronomical growth that tech firms are experiencing, labor groups are mobilizing to organize workplaces while seeking policy interventions that raise standards for the entire workforce[25]. And the focus on protecting labor rights benefits even the professional class, which has suffered its own problems with economic inequity, facing stubborn racial and gender disparities in employment, ferocious stress in the corporate culture, and the exploitation of temporary immigrant guestworkers as substitutes for domestic tech staffers. &lt;nl/&gt; Carrie Gleason of the Center for Popular Democracy said via e-mail that the initiative was 'historic\u2014the first work hours ballot initiative ever.' Her group advocates for comprehensive fair-scheduling[26] regulations, such as penalties on employers who unfairly cut hours and an end to erratic scheduling practices. As both salaried and wage workers face a proliferation of unstable contingent work arrangements[27], such measures have been proposed on the national level[28] and recently enacted in San Francisco's retail sector[29]. But by raising baseline standards for decent work, Gleason adds, 'this ballot measure is a real solution for those in part-time jobs who want the opportunity to work more.' &lt;nl/&gt; Silicon Valley may represent the vanguard of the 'new economy,' but it's the hidden workers, in the margins of tech's economic landscape, that represent the real future of labor. Despite the buzz around crowdsourcing and cloud work, service jobs remain the digital economy's hyper-local social anchor\u2014labor that can't be offshored. When Santa Clara's working parents can't earn enough to raise the next crop of 'makers,' the economy is heading for a system failure.&lt;nl/&gt; [ 1]: <url

(AP Photo / Eric Risberg) No one knows talent better than <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>That's why the president has vowed to end exploitative temporary-visa labor systems and instead promote 'merit-based' foreign-labor recruitment, so that good jobs are reserved for skilled, deserving Americans. </p><p>And he's not just talking about building walls; he also wants\u00a0the engineers the United States imports to build our booming tech sectors, through the\u00a0H-1B foreign-labor visa program.1 Ad Policy[1] Last week Trump announced small-scale\u00a0reforms to tighten regulation of H-1B[2], which he denounced on the campaign trail as a 'cheap labor program.' The program has been criticized from both the left and the right for being a corporate giveaway that helps replace US workers in IT and other 'knowledge industries' with foreigners, many of them from Asian countries with a surplus of young, hungry techies\u00a0eager for jobs with top multinationals\u2014and often willing to work for bottom dollar.\u00a0Since the issue\u00a0deals with highly trained, college-educated specialty fields, it's seen as a direct threat to the white-collar labor force, rather than the blue-collar, low-wage jobs that\u00a0are arguably those that 'Americans won't do.'\u00a02 But\u00a0Trump's promises\u00a0to tighten oversight of the program will likely fall\u00a0short of the full shutdown that his 'America First' critics seek, and will ignore the program's endemic\u00a0inequities[3]\u00a0on labor rights. But mainly, Trump's tough talk on visa workers is primarily\u00a0alienating thousands of foreign tech workers[4] whose hopes for American-style success are now even more uncertain.3 The core problem with H-1B, according to labor advocates, is that despite\u00a0great demand for technology professionals, the program creates\u00a0a low-wage labor surplus for the industry. As with\u00a0other foreign guest-worker programs[5], the imported techies are often shunted into a second-tier permatemp labor pool, which in turn may displace jobs and depress wages for both migrant tech workers\u00a0and their US colleagues.4 The [H-1B] program creates a low-wage labor surplus for the tech industry.  In vilifying 'white collar' workers from Asia, Trump opportunistically courted struggling lower-middle-class\u00a0professionals, playing on lower-bourgeois protectionist anxieties. But beyond the political arena, whatever piecemeal reforms Trump presents\u00a0will fail to hold accountable the real corporate giants driving Silicon Valley's modern-day 'shape-up.' Advocates say the system encourages abuse by mega-staffing firms like Infosys and Accenture, who acting as labor brokers that feed low-cost workers to\u00a0employers, leaving many individual smaller companies unable to tap into a labor pool that is monopolized by the biggest players. While huge multinationals and staffing agencies dominate the market for this\u00a0perma-outsourced workforce, they can harvest masses of applications in order to claim as many visa spots as possible,\u00a0creating an epic backlog that the government tries to manage by\u00a0issuing visas[6]\u00a0through a lottery system.5Bosses insist there simply 'aren't enough' STEM-field graduates in the United States[7]\u00a0to match the job-market demand. But the labor mismatch is less about workers' qualifications than whether the job fits for\u00a0workers. Why would an American STEM graduate take a job that won't earn her enough to repay\u00a0student debt, in a field where promotional opportunities are often reserved for\u00a0white men[8]?\u00a06 So companies find it more profitable\u00a0to\u00a0bring in lower-wage migrants[9], often highly trained specialists frustrated by\u00a0economic barriers in their own home countries. But their career pathways are constrained by debt, restrictions on changing employers, and severely limited access to green cards.7 And they're still poor. About 40 percent of H-1B visas approved in 2015[10] occupied the lowest-wage\u00a0tiers, which the Economic Policy Institute estimates could undercut a sector's prevailing wages by 40 percent. Tracking career progress over time, EPI found[11]\u00a0that out of roughly 460,000 H-1B visas imported in recent years, the ratio of immigrant Mark\u00a0Zuckerbergs to rank-and-file coders was heavily skewed, despite Big Tech's youthful entrepreneurial promise:8[T]he top H-1B employers have been using the program for temporary labor\u2014and as a vehicle to outsource jobs to overseas locations[12]\u2014rather than as a bridge to permanent immigration, which could keep skilled workers in the US labor market for the foreseeable future.9Based on EPI's analysis[13], fewer\u00a0than 140,000 of the H1B workers employed in the United States from 2011 to 2013, out of nearly 819,000 approved visas, actually led to a green card for a worker, suggesting that guest workers experience permanent instability:10 GET A DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTION FOR JUST $12! Subscribe[14] Cognizant, a US-based offshore outsourcing behemoth, received 4,293 H-1B visas in 2014, yet applied for a mere 57 green cards for its H-1B workers in the same year. That is a 1.3 percent rate, or one green card application for every 75 H-1B workers.11These workers operate as high-tech indentured servants: Even if they renew their visas, their legal status essentially remains dependent on their firm's discretion. If they manage to apply for permanent residency, until recently their spouses were barred from working[15] (both economically disenfranchising immigrant women and destabilizing their families)\u2014and many fear that Trump could try to reinstate Obama's recent repeal of the ban.12 About 40 percent of H-1B visas approved in 2015 occupied the lowest wage tiers.  So how can we rationalize Silicon Valley's casino capitalism and help close the tech-opportunity gap for both migrant and US-based workers? EPI analyst Daniel Costa says that while Trump's initial administrative measures appear to beef up enforcement to limit outsourcing, 'I have not seen anything yetthat would suggest to me that they're interested in protecting migrant or American workers, but on paper this could help, if done right.' One basic measure would be ensuring that top-tier jobs and wages are provided to workers in the field already, and offer them\u00a0job security before companies seek outsourced labor.13 A public letter from Senator Dick Durban of Illinois urged Trump[16] last month to dial down the xenophobic rhetoric and 'immediately revamp the annual distribution of H-1B visas, which is currently done by random lottery.' Firms should instead prioritize the highest-paid workers and the 'best and brightest graduates of American schools.'14 Protecting US-based workers before seeking low-cost temps would be a reasonable way to ensure that visa-based workers aren't exploited. If companies do hire\u00a0from abroad, workers deserve 'no less than the average wage for the specific occupation in the local area, so that they're not underpaid according to US wage standards,'\u00a0which could be readily accomplished simply by eliminating the lowest-wage visas.15THE STAKES ARE HIGHER NOW THAN EVER. GET THE NATION IN YOUR INBOX.Sadly, however, no current reform proposals deal directly with global labor justice: All workers deserve stronger oversight of employers' compliance with wage-and-hour rules. And whether migrant or native-born, all workers deserve a fair shot at a living wage and a career-track job, rather than a visa lottery. Costa says that workers should be eligible to 'self-petition for green card status after about 18 months,' and then if an employer and worker negotiate a fair match, 'then the worker should be on a quick path to becoming a permanent fixture in the US labor market and having all the rights that US workers and citizens have.' Instead of doing equal work for less pay, 'they will, by definition, be complementing US workers and adding value to the economy.'16 What if the digital economy interlinked US and migrant workers on equal footing across borders, generating a multinational workforce in solidarity against multinational bosses? Making Silicon Valley's workforce globalized also means globalizing fair-labor standards, to upgrade workers' rights to match technological progress.17 [ 1]: <url

They specifically called for \"independent oversight\" in the form of a watchdog. Tech companies have come under heavy fire recently for how they regulate the content on their platforms. </p><p>Traditional TV is under major threat as young people spend more time on the likes of Snapchat on YouTube than watching linear programming. A group of top British broadcasters have signed a letter calling for more regulation of tech giants like Twitter, Google and Facebook. The letter was published in the Sunday Telegraph[1] and signed by the heads of the BBC, Sky, ITV, Channel 4, BT, and Talk Talk. They called for \"independent oversight\" of tech companies that publish news, in the form of a watchdog. \"We do not think it is realistic or appropriate to expect internet and social media companies to make all the judgment calls about what content is and is not acceptable, without any independent oversight,\" said the letter. \"There is an urgent need for independent scrutiny of the decisions taken, and greater transparency. This is not about censoring the internet, it is about making the most popular internet platforms safer, by ensuring there is accountability and transparency over the decisions these private companies are already taking.\" The signees said they see upcoming government proposals on internet safety as a \"golden opportunity\" to address their concerns. Big tech companies have come under heavy fire recently for misfires in the way they filter content. In July an undercover investigation by Channel 4 revealed that Facebook moderators in Dublin were being trained to leave images of child abuse and racist memes on the platform[2]. Last week, the social network was criticised[3] for deleting a post showing nude, emaciated Holocaust victims. At the same time, traditional TV is under considerable threat from tech firms. A 2017 Ofcom report found that YouTube was the most recognised content brand[4] for viewers aged between 12 and 15 years old. And only last week, Facebook released its video-on-demand service[5], Watch, globally. Business Insider has contacted Facebook, Google, and Twitter to ask for their response to the letter.NOW WATCH: INSIDE WEST POINT: What it's really like for new Army cadets on their first day[6]See

And how is she likely to wield her new powers?</p><p>In a nutshell, the reappointment\u00a0hands\u00a0Vestager five more years to continue holding technology companies to account and see through the appeals in her key court cases, some of which could kick off before the end of the year.\u00a0</p><p>There were audible gasps in press room when she was announced. Vestager had originally been considered a candidate for von der Leyen's\u00a0top job and few had expected the decision to keep her on.</p><p>\"Happy for and humbled for the task ahead, looking forward to work with new and well-known colleagues,\" Vestager said on Twitter.\u00a0</p><p>When asked whether Vestager's re-appointment could annoy the US president, who has referred to her as \"your tax lady\", von der Leyen was succinct: \"The only aspect that matters in assigning portfolios is quality and excellence. Margrethe Vestager has done an outstanding job.\"</p><p>A string of other candidates had been touted for the competition job--\u00a0 among them\u00a0former Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, and former French defence minister Sylvie Goulard. Whoever was appointed would have \"big shoes to fill\", one legal expert said yesterday. Who better that Vestager herself to fill them?</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Happy for and humbled by the task a head - looking forward to work with new and well known colleagues in <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vdLcommission?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw#vdLcommissionhttps://twitter.com/hashtag/EUstrivesformore?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw#EUstrivesformorehttps://twitter.com/hashtag/genderbalance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw#genderbalance\">https://twitter.com/hashtag/vdLcommission?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw#vdLcommissionhttps://twitter.com/hashtag/EUstrivesformore?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw#EUstrivesformorehttps://twitter.com/hashtag/genderbalance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw#genderbalance</url> - also       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/balanceEUgeography?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw#balanceEUgeography\">https://twitter.com/hashtag/balanceEUgeography?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw#balanceEUgeography</url> - Margrethe Vestager (@vestager)       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/vestager/status/1171366034755981312?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwSeptember\">https://twitter.com/vestager/status/1171366034755981312?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwSeptember</url> 10, 2019</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>She has reasons to be cheerful.

One of the loudest is among her biggest cheerleaders, French president Emanuel Macron, who campaigned for her after she joined a cohort called the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats ahead of the European elections earlier this year.</p><p>Camino Mortera-Martinez, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, says the decision to couple competition law and digital issues for the first time is important.\u00a0</p><p>\"Digital stands for everything, from security, to jobs, to the economy and civil rights,\" she explains. \"By tying it to competition law, which has been used as a geopolitical tool, you risk alienating the partners that you need to work closely together with you.\"</p><p>Mortera-Martinez argues that tech giants are unlikely to warm to the woman who hands them multi-million euro fines and then asks them to line up to invest in European tech.\u00a0</p><p>\"She is a policewoman who is going up to the Googles and Amazons\u00a0 for abusing their positions and the next day sit down with them and ask for cooperation on the code of conduct and GDPR.\"</p><p>The criticism leveled at the last commission was going too far \"by the book\", instead of thinking about the more long-term consequences that harsh competition penalties might have. Vestager will have to adopt a hard-line, yet pragmatic, approach if she is to succeed at both roles.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-55980407</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X17-BTF1-JCJY-G2P2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1443\"/><timeReceived>4:41 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

As the tech industry rushes to make a dent in this public health crisis, it is facing a test of some of its most cherished ways of doing business \u2014 as well as its relationship with customers and users around the world.</p><p>The can-do spirit and creativity unleashed by the public health crisis has certainly been heart-warming. Social media sites and mobile app stores, the open platforms on which crowdsourced innovation thrive, are awash with ideas.</p><p>The Facebook page for Open Source Covid-19 Medical Supplies, for instance, has brought an outpouring of designs for essential medical gear. Much of it is protective equipment for people in the front lines of the battle against the virus, to be produced on home 3D printers close to where it is most needed.</p><p>Ad hoc alliances are being formed to elevate makeshift designs like these into more robust supply lines. Carbon, a San Francisco-based 3D printing company, is trying to harness the customers who have installed 1,000 of its industrial-grade machines. </p><p>Among its designs is a swab for coronavirus tests that can be produced from the high-grade resin that used in dental labs. Ellen Kullman, the company\u2019s chief executive, said more than 300 people joined a webinar this week to learn how to turn 3D printing machines to use for this and other designs.</p><p>Protective gear and testing equipment are in short supply, and some lives will undoubtedly be saved by initiatives like this. But doing anything at a scale that will bring a real flattening in the Covid-19 morbidity \u2014 and mortality \u2014 curves is a different matter.</p><p>Sometimes, only government will do. Centralised authorities are needed to pick the best ideas to back, provide validation and certification, and command the resources on a scale that will make a real difference. Silicon Valley traces its origins to a close relationship with government \u2014 specifically, the defence build-up during the cold war. A series of similarly tight public/private partnerships, needed to deal with the public health emergency, will test the Valley\u2019s ability to meet a serious public need, without abandoning the methods and values it holds dear.</p><p>The first results of this new spirit of co-operation have probably been clearest in the information realm \u2014 specifically, when it comes to the collection and dissemination of reliable information about the nature and spread of the virus, and ways to limit the risks.</p><p>App Stores, for instance, were designed to act as open platforms for anyone with a bright idea. But a search in Google\u2019s Play store for anything coronavirus-related offers only a link to the World Health Organisation, along with apps from the Centers for Disease Control and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Apple\u2019s App Store is only slightly less restrictive, letting through a handful of vetted apps from medical researchers for tracking coronavirus symptoms.</p><p>One of the most valuable locations on the internet, the Google homepage, now acts as a quasi-public service announcement, its single outbound link connecting to a trove of official coronavirus information. </p><p>Searches for anything related to the pandemic bring special advice boxes, with most links leading back to the CDC and WHO. A company that rose to prominence by finding relevance in the \u201clong tail\u201d of the internet has defaulted, at a time of global crisis, to being a conduit for government-generated information and advice.</p><p>This highlights just how serious a test the tech industry faces as it aligns itself with government to solve the current crisis, while at the same time defending its values and protecting user rights such as privacy and freedom of speech.</p><p>The very nature of a pervasive health scare makes this hard. Suppressing the spread of Covid-19 has forced a limitation of basic freedoms \u2014 though Western governments have tried to do this through social pressure rather than coercion.</p><p>The next phase, when it comes, is likely to involve attempts to partially reopen the economy while still regulating individual movement. As China\u2019s successful efforts to limit renewed outbreaks of the virus have shown, this is likely to require collecting information about individuals thought to pose a risk, such as where they have been and who they have had contact with. For the big tech platforms, stuffed with this kind of personal data, this could pose the biggest challenge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-09e8e7182c3b423089e9658269632017</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YHK-SPY1-JB77-K3NS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 27, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Warren had her most successful fundraising quarter yet, raising $125,305 from employees at Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and their subsidiaries. Overall, in the past year, Warren has raised $254,717 from tech employees. </p><p>Six hundred and sixty tech workers total gave to Warren's campaign. Overall, Silicon Valley tech workers have donated a total of $1,206,976 to Democratic candidates. The Massachusetts senator has by far the most radical plan when it comes to dealing with Big Tech companies. She wrote back in March for Medium[1] that she planned on breaking up Big Tech companies, saying, 'That's why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition \u2014 including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.' Morning Consult[2] writes that Mayor Pete Buttigieg received the second highest number of political donations, amounting to $237,919 this year. Facebook[3] has deep ties to Buttigieg's campaign, going back as far as CEO Mark Zuckerberg's time at Harvard University[4]. Warren may have collected the most money, but candidate Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has attracted more people. Morning Consult estimates the number of tech workers who donated to Sanders at 869. Warren announced[5] in October that she would not accept donations of more than $200 from executives at tech companies or banks. The senator wrote in Medium[6] that 'when I'm the Democratic nominee for president, I'm not going to change a thing in how I run my campaign: No PACs. No federal lobbyists.'Facebook has been a target of Warren's complaints from the beginning, and the candidate even posted a false ad on Facebook to demonstrate her issue with the lack of fact-checking. After Zuckerberg[7] announced that he would not fact-check politicians, Warren tweeted[8], 'Facebook is accepting millions of dollars from Trump to run political ads, including ones with misinformation and outright lies. Ads that TV stations won't even run.' Zuckerberg has said in leaked audio to the Verge[9] that he was concerned about Warren's plan to regulate Big Tech, particularly Facebook. He said[10], 'I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.' Corinne Weaver[11] is a staff writer for MRC TechWatch and she works as a senior analyst for the Media Research Center at the NewsBusters[12] site. As the Joe and Betty Anderlik Fellow, her coverage on tech censorship, media bias, and pro-life issues have been cited by many in the conservative movement.

Overall, in the past year, Warren has raised $254,717 from tech employees. Six hundred and sixty tech workers total gave to Warren's campaign. </p><p>Overall, Silicon Valley tech workers have donated a total of $1,206,976 to Democratic candidates.The Massachusetts senator has by far the most radical plan when it comes to dealing with Big Tech companies. She wrote back in March for Medium[1] that she planned on breaking up Big Tech companies, saying, 'That's why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition   including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.'Morning Consult[2] writes that Mayor Pete Buttigieg received the second highest number of political donations, amounting to $237,919 this year. Facebook[3] has deep ties to Buttigieg's campaign, going back as far as CEO Mark Zuckerberg's time at Harvard University[4].Warren may have collected the most money, but candidate Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has attracted more people. Morning Consult estimates the number of tech workers who donated to Sanders at 869.Warren announced[5] in October that she would not accept donations of more than $200 from executives at tech companies or banks. The senator wrote in Medium[6] that 'when I'm the Democratic nominee for president, I'm not going to change a thing in how I run my campaign: No PACs. No federal lobbyists.' Facebook has been a target of Warren's complaints from the beginning, and the candidate even posted a false ad on Facebook to demonstrate her issue with the lack of fact-checking. After Zuckerberg[7] announced that he would not fact-check politicians, Warren tweeted[8], 'Facebook is accepting millions of dollars from Trump to run political ads, including ones with misinformation and outright lies. Ads that TV stations won't even run.'Zuckerberg has said in leaked audio to the Verge[9] that he was concerned about Warren's plan to regulate Big Tech, particularly Facebook. He said[10], 'I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. ...

Overall, in the past year, Warren has raised $254,717 from tech employees. Six hundred and sixty tech workers total gave to Warren's campaign. </p><p>Overall, Silicon Valley tech workers have donated a total of $1,206,976 to Democratic candidates.The Massachusetts senator has by far the most radical plan when it comes to dealing with Big Tech companies. She wrote back in March for Medium[1] that she planned on breaking up Big Tech companies, saying, 'That's why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition \u2014 including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.'Morning Consult[2] writes that Mayor Pete Buttigieg received the second highest number of political donations, amounting to $237,919 this year. Facebook[3] has deep ties to Buttigieg's campaign, going back as far as CEO Mark Zuckerberg's time at Harvard University[4].Warren may have collected the most money, but candidate Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has attracted more people. Morning Consult estimates the number of tech workers who donated to Sanders at 869.Warren announced[5] in October that she would not accept donations of more than $200 from executives at tech companies or banks. The senator wrote in Medium[6] that 'when I'm the Democratic nominee for president, I'm not going to change a thing in how I run my campaign: No PACs. No federal lobbyists.' Facebook has been a target of Warren's complaints from the beginning, and the candidate even posted a false ad on Facebook to demonstrate her issue with the lack of fact-checking. After Zuckerberg[7] announced that he would not fact-check politicians, Warren tweeted[8], 'Facebook is accepting millions of dollars from Trump to run political ads, including ones with misinformation and outright lies. Ads that TV stations won't even run.'Zuckerberg has said in leaked audio to the Verge[9] that he was concerned about Warren's plan to regulate Big Tech, particularly Facebook. He said[10], 'I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. ...

Masks thwart facial recognition: A new study by the National Institute for Standards and Technology found that even the best facial recognition tools don't work on masked targets.</p><p>FULL BRIEFING</p><p>1. Big Tech antitrust hearing could be colossal -- or mere theater</p><p>The virtual appearance by four of the world's most powerful technology executives before the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee on Wednesday could be a defining moment for bipartisan efforts to rein in Silicon Valley.</p><p>Or it could be a political circus.</p><p>On one hand, the hearing represents the subcommittee's only chance to publicly question the executives -- Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai -- during the course of its 13-month bipartisan investigation into each company's business practices and whether those practices illegally stifle competition.</p><p>On the other hand, it is a rare opportunity for lawmakers less interested in antitrust to pepper the executives with questions about a host of other issues, or to simply criticize them for perceived wrongdoing. Similar hearings in the past have gone in the latter direction.</p><p>But speaking to reporters by phone on July 23, the senior committee aides who have guided the investigation through five prior hearings -- and 1.3 million documents provided by the companies and their competitors -- stressed the seriousness of Wednesday's hearing.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., the subcommittee chairman who has led the investigation, intends for Wednesday's hearing to remain \"laser-focused\" on antitrust issues, said the aides, which is why the hearing is being held at the subcommittee level despite its high-profile witness list.</p><p>The aides said the hearing would be \"evidentiary\" in nature, with the goal of filling gaps in the subcommittee's investigation prior to the release of a set of policy recommendations later this year. The aides downplayed the possibility of adversarial cross examinations by lawmakers, saying the affair would not play out like \"a normal oversight hearing.\"</p><p>Many observers in the world of antitrust law are eagerly anticipating the hearing and hoping that Cicilline succeeds in his efforts to keep the proceedings focused.</p><p>\"This hearing is timely and important,\" said Maurice Stucke, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department's antitrust division who teaches law at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. \"It's taking place not in isolation, but amid increased scrutiny of the dominant technology platforms from around the world.\"</p><p>Stucke believes the hearing is happening at a critical juncture, when authorities are beginning to grapple with the sweeping market power amassed by a handful of digital platforms only to realize that current antitrust laws are inadequate and in need of change.</p><p>All four companies appearing at Wednesday's hearing are the targets of ongoing antitrust investigations by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, or bipartisan coalitions of state attorneys general.</p><p>\"The emerging consensus is that first, antitrust scrutiny is a necessary but not sufficient component to address the multiple risks that these powerful platforms pose; second, the antitrust laws need to be updated; and third, we need to go beyond antitrust to a regulatory framework that addresses the risks posed to consumer protection and privacy,\" Stucke said.</p><p>But there are others who see the antitrust scrutiny of major technology companies as misplaced. Geoffrey Manne, president of the International Center for Law and Economics, which advocates limited antitrust regulation of digital platforms, is skeptical of using antitrust enforcement to rein in or break up the companies, as some have suggested doing.</p><p>\"The risk of error seems to me to be substantially high and seriously risks deterring innovation and novel business models that may look anti-competitive because we don't quite understand them,\" Manne said. \"There's always a monopoly explanation for conduct we don't understand.\"</p><p>Manne said he supports the committee's investigation because \"it's hard to fault the effort to obtain more information,\" though he remains concerned that members of Congress are not up to the task of successfully questioning the executives -- or the task of staying on topic.</p><p>\"There are a lot of political points to be scored by criticizing Big Tech,\" he said. \"And that always worries me because I don't think we're likely to get the best results for consumers in a highly politicized sort of environment.\"</p><p>Read my full preview of Wednesday's hearing here.</p><p>2. Republicans and Democrats battle over who has better voter data effort</p><p>By the time this November's presidential race is over, President Donald Trump and his rival, former Vice President Joe Biden,  could raise as much as $2 billion as they plug away online and through limited physical rallies to reach citizens and get them to vote either in person or by mail. </p><p>Behind each candidate's advertising, social media messaging and turn-out-the-vote effort is a data operation that meticulously tracks not only past patterns of voters, but a vast array of demographic, consumer and behavioral data about them. Plus, the data operation figures out the best of multiple ways to reach the voters, and predicts who's likely to vote or be swayed on specific topics and policies. </p><p>Top executives behind each party's data efforts claim theirs is better and will produce winners on Election Day.</p><p>The Republican National Committee says its database and models that assign voter scores as well as track how voters react to political advertising and other messages is superior to the Democrats and helped produce a winner in 2016 when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. </p><p>Democrats stung by the loss in 2016 -- even Clinton blamed the Democratic National Committee's poor data practices -- say they have rebuilt their operation and point to successes in the 2018 midterm elections when Democratic candidates beat their Republican rivals in congressional races to win a majority in the House.  </p><p>While it's impossible for any outsider to adjudicate which party has the better data operation, one indicator of how well each party is using its underlying data infrastructure is to look at online advertising and fund-raising efforts, says Laura Edelson, a researcher at the online political transparency project of New York University. </p><p>\"I can say that in general Donald Trump has a more sophisticated digital ad operation in terms of how the economics are monitored and he has a better cost per click than Joe Biden,\" Edelson says. On the other hand, generally speaking, \"Democratic candidates have better operations than Republican candidates,\" she says. </p><p>Read Gopal Ratnam's full report on the battle for the best voter data operation here. </p><p>3. Thune to highlight his Section 230 bill at Senate Commerce hearing</p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee is holding a hearing on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act this morning.</p><p>Chairman John Thune, R-S.D., the Senate majority whip, is likely to use the opportunity to highlight his bipartisan legislation (S 4066) that would make the first changes to Section 230, the so-called 26 words that created the internet, since it was made law in 1996.</p><p>Section 230, long considered a catalyst for the growth of Silicon Valley in the late 1990s and early aughts, protects technology companies from incurring lawsuits related to third-party content hosted on their platforms. But the law has come under increasing bipartisan scrutiny in recent years as Washington seeks to gain greater control over Silicon Valley amid concerns about the spread of hate speech, illegal content and disinformation online.</p><p>The hearing will \"provide an opportunity to discuss ways to ensure platforms are accountable for their content moderation practices and what legislative measures, from transparency to accountability tools, can empower consumers online,\" according to the Commerce Committee.</p><p>Thune's bill, introduced with Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, is one of two prominent Section 230 bills making their way through the Senate. The other, sponsored by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., was recently approved by the Judiciary Committee, which Graham chairs.</p><p>Of the two measures, Thune's bill is seen as applying a lighter touch to Section 230, whereas Graham's is the more sweeping.</p><p>Graham's bill, first introduced in March, would revoke automatic Section 230 protections for online companies and require them to \"earn\" them back through following guidelines designated by a national commission tasked with recommending best practices for content moderation.</p><p>Thune's bill would allow companies to keep their immunity under Section 230 but require them to post their content moderation practices online and explain what content is removed. It would also require them to be more responsive to user complaints and allow federal regulators and state governments more leeway when pursuing civil lawsuits against the companies.</p><p>Read my earlier report comparing the bills here.</p><p>4. NIST study finds facial recognition software fails when seeing masked faces</p><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology on Monday announced results of a preliminary study that found even high quality commercial facial recognition software had \"great difficulty\" identifying faces when a person is wearing a mask.</p><p>\"Even the best of the 89 commercial facial recognition algorithms tested had error rates between 5 percent and 50 percent in matching digitally applied face masks with photos of the same person without a mask,\" NIST said in a statement.</p><p>The agency said it planned to conduct a series of tests on the performance of facial recognition software during the current period when widespread COVID-19 fears are leading to more mask use and assess whether newer iterations of facial recognition software do a better job than earlier versions.</p><p>\"With the arrival of the pandemic, we need to understand how face recognition technology deals with masked faces,\" said Mei Ngan, a NIST computer scientist and an author of the report. \"We have begun by focusing on how an algorithm developed before the pandemic might be affected by subjects wearing face masks. Later this summer, we plan to test the accuracy of algorithms that were intentionally developed with masked faces in mind.\"</p><p>NIST tested existing algorithms by applying them on 6 million photos in its database that have been used in previous facial recognition studies. The team of scientists then altered the images by digitally applying masks on the photos. To match the real-world variations, NIST said it used nine different mask types to reflect shape, color and nose coverage, according to the statement. The digital masks were either blue or black.</p><p>The tests showed that algorithm accuracy \"declined substantially across the board\" when attempting to identify masked faces, NIST said.</p><p>While most algorithms fail to identify or authenticate an unmasked face in the database about 0.3 percent of the time, when a digital mask was applied the top algorithms registered a 5 percent failure rate, and other software failed between 20 percent and 50 percent of the time, NIST said.</p><p>The failure rate rose in tandem with a greater coverage of a person's nose area, NIST said. \"The more of the nose a mask covers, the lower the algorithm's accuracy,\" it said. Round masks produced lower error rates, while black colored masks increased errors compared with blue ones, NIST said.</p><p>-- Gopal Ratnam</p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ Roll Call's up-to-date daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

VentureBeat spoke to a slew of the top players at well-known West Coast institutions   the founding team at Stanford University's technology accelerator, StartX[1], partners at some of Silicon Valley's most prominent venture capital firms, and others   to help illuminate what the big trends will be in the coming year. For VCs, it's not enough to build an addictive mobile app or game: Investors expect to see\u00a0more, something worth building a venture-funded company around[2]. So in 2013, get ready for mind-blowing, nerdgasmic tech, whether it's augmented reality, 3D printing, self-driving cars, or space travel. </p><p>For later-stage startups, 2013 will be the year all hell breaks loose. The IPO pipeline is already brimming with contenders: Venture-funded companies like Twitter, Box, and Square are ready for Wall Street. With heated competition for customers and users, there may also be some mammoth failures when some venture-backed companies that have received hundreds of millions of dollars simply buckle. Most of the investors we spoke to agreed confidence in the tech industry is sky-high and 2013 is a year to take bigger risks. This time last year, we predicted entrepreneurship would be an engine to drive jobs creation and stimulate economic growth.\u00a0With the global economy beginning to stabilize, we're ready to take more risks and push technology into new verticals, like education, government, financial services, and health care. Financial firms will\u00a0finally embrace innovation David Blumberg, managing partner, Blumberg Capital\u00a0[3] <br/> #8216;The financial services sector should be highly attractive to IT entrepreneurs and investors for its size, growth, high margins, and dramatic need for greater innovation and efficiency.\u00a0At more than 8.5 percent of the global GDP, the industry is measured in trillions of dollars. #8216;Despite rapid growth, the financial industry is burdened by outmoded IT systems and legacy software, extensive and increasingly punitive regulations, and taxes as well as a negative public image as being too expensive, inflexible, and inefficient. It is an industry consumers and politicians love to hate   hence it's ripe for innovation to improve outcomes for all. #8216;And fortunately, startups are leading the way forward. Go for innovation in financial services, young entrepreneur   it's where the money is!#8217; Ones to watch: Square[4], Credorax, Lenddo[5], LendUp[6], SoFi[7], Addepar[8], Zanbato[9] Computers will get smarter and more autonomous Mike Maples, founding partner, Floodgate Capital [10] <br/> #8216;I've been thinking a lot recently about the next big tech cycle after social networking. One of the things we did right as a firm is to see that trend early [Editor's note: Maples is an early investor in Twitter and Reputation.com]. We use the term #8216;hypernet' to describe this notion that technology will no longer be characterized by one world wide web or one search engine. #8216;Computers will exist in billions of nodes and millions of clouds. In 2013, people will expect to be hyperconnected on the hyperweb: They will want to manage content on any device. We will see user experiences that are no longer assumed to be windows on a computer screen or a smart phone. Some of my favorite examples are Google's self-driving car[11] or Nest[12]#8216;s thermostat, which learns the temperature you like and turns it down when you're away.#8217; Ones to watch: Nest[13], Google's self-driving car, IFFFT[14], Grok[15], Genwi[16] #8216;Big data' won't be a buzzword; it will be part of life Ross Fubini, venture partner, Canaan Partners[17] <br/> #8216;#8216;Big data' is the buzzword of the year, but 2013 will be the year that big data will be a reality across many application areas. #8216;Big data allows the user to experience magic. Anyone can ask questions of the data, and soon we'll be using these technologies\u00a0for everyday decision-making, whether it's pricing, hiring, or managing our finances. These new applications are going to require more than an open-source computing framework like Hadoop. The shift to #8216;big data' will herald an entirely new set of\u00a0infrastructures\u00a0to store and process all that data. #8216;Data has been a big deal and a big market for years   SQL, hello!. But #8216;big data' is a big deal because of the sheer volume of trackable data and because it's cheaper than ever before to build an application to make that data valuable. By the end of the year, we will see some big winners emerge leading up to some splashy 2014 and 2015 IPOs.#8217; Ones to watch: Kaggle, Splunk, Platfora,[18] Grok[19], Intuit[20], Quid[21], LendUp[22],\u00a0GNS Healthcare[23] Storage will get even sexier Bipul Sinha, investor, Lightspeed Venture Partners[24] <br/> #8216;The enterprise storage market is experiencing a tectonic shift led primarily by virtualization and storage media disruptions. The incumbents are slow to respond, and the startup activity is at an all-time high. The new year will witness two significant trends: an acceleration of storage and compute hyper-convergence and a bifurcation of performance and capacity tiers for shared enterprise storage. #8216;These trends will eventually commoditize the storage layer of the enterprise information technology stack and essentially propel the emergence of software defined, agile enterprise datacenter.#8217; Ones to watch: SimpliVity[25], Nutanix[26], Zadara[27], Exablox[28], Bitcasa[29] The developer ecosystem will go mainstream Peter Levine, partner, Andreessen Horowitz[30] <br/> #8216;The shift from the web to an app-based computing architecture is reinventing the entire developer ecosystem. Until recently, Microsoft and Java controlled all software development and services because developers could only write for those APIs. With 2013 on the horizon, we believe those days will soon be over. #8216;The old way of computing has been eroded by and replaced with special-purpose, easy-to-integrate backend services. These best-of-breed services also innovate at a breakneck pace, which means applications can take advantage of many additional services, thus paving the way for a new developer ecosystem.#8217; Ones to watch:\u00a0GitHub[31], Mixpanel[32], Pixelapse[33], Okta[34], Parse[35], Bizness Apps[36], Urban Airship[37] Hardware companies will raise larger rounds Naval Ravikant, founder, AngelList[38] <br/> #8216;The declining cost of building tech startups has finally reached\u00a0hardware. We're seeing accelerators like Lemnos Labs[39] turning out very interesting seed-stage\u00a0hardware companies. #8216;Some of the coolest I've seen this year include Momentum Machines[40], which builds burger-flipping robots; UnmannedInnovation[41], which builds an operating system for UAVs; NanoSatisfi[42], a Kickstarter-funded project to launch and rents CubeSats; and Nomiku[43], which makes sous vide [machines] affordable. #8216;It used to be that for a\u00a0hardware\u00a0company, you'd have to raise lots of money from the get-go. But now you can start small with a seed, as AngelList[44] alum Leap Motion did, and then go on to raise significant rounds from large investors later.#8217; Ones to watch: Maykah[45], Goldiebox[46], OpenRov[47], Momentum Machines[48], Unmanned Innovation[49] Indoor location will be the next billion-dollar market Don Dodge, developer advocate, Google; advisor, Google Ventures[50] <br/> #8216;Indoor location will be bigger than GPS, which only works outdoors. We spend 90 percent of our time indoors, whether it's in shopping malls, offices, schools, restaurants, and so on, where GPS doesn't work or is inaccurate. In 2013, you'll use your smartphone to find the exact store aisle location for every item on your shopping list. #8216;With indoor location, you can find people, products, or services plotted exactly on a floor plan with walking directions to get there. You could receive coupons, advertisements, or free offers for products based on where you are in a store. Imagine playing indoor location games like capture the flag, tower defense, or other games based on real-life indoor locations. There are thousands of applications in many different market segments that will be built using accurate indoor positioning technology.#8217; Related: Read VentureBeat's roundup of indoor location technologies[51].

Many med-tech startups are harnessing innovation in these fields to prevent diseases, increase health outcomes, and tailor medical engagement on an individual level. #8216;With a rising number of med-tech companies launching personalized medicine platforms, we are going to see a greater demand for individual treatment options around the world as these options become increasingly accessible.#8217; Ones to watch:Morpheus Medical[57],\u00a0Ubiome[58],\u00a0Wellness FX[59], GenapSys[60], Numedii[61], The Chordoma Foundation[62] A.I. and human-computer interaction Brian Singerman, partner, Founders Fund[63] <br/> #8216;We are always highly suspicious of trends. The best investments are often in companies and industries that others do not consider hot or trendy. Therefore, a theme for 2013 will be to not invest in trends, but rather long-lasting value.\u00a0Trends come and go, but the best companies will be the ones that buck the trends and don't look like all the others, companies that don't appear to have much competition. #8216;To that end, we\u00a0think 2013 will see some major technological breakthroughs through new ways of interacting with machines.\u00a0Interface breakthrough Leap Motion will change the way we think about and operate computers of all types.\u00a0Google will make huge strides in self-driving cars. We will even see the beginnings of a sophisticated A.I.\u00a0The new year will be a true revenge of the nerds year, with product giving ground to actual technological innovation.#8217; Ones to watch:
