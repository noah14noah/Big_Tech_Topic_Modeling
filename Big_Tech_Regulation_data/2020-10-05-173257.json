The market reaction  though dollar rally and then it ended up selling off, and the curve  continues to flatten. The curve makes sense to me. But what happened to the  dollar? Why did it not respond?</p><p>CANDICE BANGSUND, MANAGER, FIERA CAPITAL PORTFOLIO: Yes. So I think a lot  of the news was already priced into the U.S. dollar. So you did see the  dollar move up little bit after the news but then come back in a week and  ended the day actually a little bit lower. And I think that's because the  focus is likely shifting over to the ECB now.</p><p>DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Well, exactly. Kay, it appears that both of  these companies are in it and it's a win it, as it said.</p><p>KAY KOPLOVITZ, MANAGING PARTNER, SPRINGBOARD GROWTH CAPITAL: Yes, they are.</p><p>WESTIN: Why do Disney and Comcast believe that they have to have these  assets?</p><p>KOPLOVITZ: Well, I think it's really the fight for the consumer, direct to  the consumer, that it's very, very important to both of them. And Disney,  Bob has (inaudible) very aggressively, he made his plan. I think he wants  that content for that reason. And I think that Bryan was fighting back  because he doesn't want to lose out in a war. He's got his own studio but  more product, again, they going to find themselves going direct to consumer  before long. I think that's really the fight here. And that's both that  they want the content property and the distribution international is very  important to Comcast.</p><p>WESTIN: Okay. Let's talk about who is the most likely to win, who's got the  advantage? These are the two important bids as they describe. You see, the  Comcast right now now is well above Disney and also Disney, thus far all  stack, they both are offering a breakup fee of $2.5 billion. But let's  talk, Kay, about who has the advantage. I talked to Bob Allen Iger when his  earnings came out a couple of weeks ago and asked him, how are you going to  avoid overspending? He thinks he has the advantage. So listen to what he  said. Do we have it? Okay. So I'll impersonate Bob Iger. What he said -- in  essence, what he said was, if you get into an auction, you have to see  which is getting more attractive to the seller. I mean, really, Fox. And in  fact, as he thinks (inaudible) for regulatory purposes, he'll have less  difficulty to admit this done. Also he suggests that, in fact, they may  actually like Disney stock.</p><p>KOPLOVITZ: I think that's the case. I think Murdoch does definitely like  the Disney Stock and would like to have that longer term. I think that as  delta gives bigger though, it's getting harder to justify. There's tax  deficiency and in the Disney bid that was not there in the Comcast bit. But  the delta has gotten quite large now. So I think they have to pause and  say, who's got the better deal. Murdoch, I'm pretty clear, looks like,  clearly, he would like Disney. But I wonder if Bob is going to raise his  bid.</p><p>WESTIN: Really? You think he might not?</p><p>KOPLOVITZ: He might not. Bob is disciplined. That I think that he's showing  -- I guess, he's quite disciplined purchaser, but I think he's going to  have to do something.</p><p>STEEL: So pretend that one person gets it, Kay. What does the company do?  What kind of assets out there that can replace Fox?</p><p>KOPLOVITZ: Well, I don't think it's very easy to do that. That's why -- I  mean, there are other content players out there. If you want more study,  you could buy Viacom possibly because they have Paramount Studio, they've  got John Malone out there with some properties in deals with Discovery and  Lionsgate and some content out there, but it's a different kind of content.  Then the studio offers at the Fox studio and the distribution networks that  they have and the international, which I -- you can't short change that. I  think they both wanted international distribution on Sky.</p><p>WESTIN: Well, that's an interesting point you make though, Kay. How much of  this is the library as it where and the franchises that you have at the  studio, The Simpsons and all that sort of stuff (inaudible) was that and  how much are real distribution outliers (ph), I mean, the channels and  think do you should specialize in -- boy, you really created that business.</p><p>KOPLOVITZ: Yes I think the channels are very important to them. And so I  think that's one of the reasons they want all of the content. Because the  more channels you have, the more places you have to repurpose all that  content in different ways to the consumer. And that's very valuable long- term, especially when you're looking at a strategy, when you're going  direct to consumer. Don't forget that all the digital information that you  get off of direct to consumer is really, really important in the future. I  think the -- we've hit the tipping point on that. And I think see how the  big tech companies are relative by any of these companies actually as they  could. So I think this is fortifying themselves for that door, not only  against each other but against the big tech companies.</p><p>WESTIN: Okay. Thank you very much. Kay Koplovitz, it's really great to have  you, Kay.</p><p>STEEL: So what's the trade for that? How do you position yourself around  this tight rope and the issue that Paul was just talking about?</p><p>BANGSUND: Well, I think when you're thinking about the ECB meeting today  and even going forward the path to normalization, I think you want to get  long with the euro and short to U.S. dollar. Like I mentioned before, the  U.S dollar is fully priced for what the fed has planned for the next few  years anyways where as we're not seeing ex-Federal Reserve, central banks  been pricing such as the ECB who has, regardless of whether it's today or  in July, except to reduce paper, that asset purchase program, and be done  by the end of 2018.</p><p>STEEL: Well, taking a look at, say, the ECB versus the fed, if you come  inside the Bloomberg, you're looking at the financial conditions and next  for both of the regions, and you have a much easier condition in the U.S.,  the higher it goes, the looser it is, versus the European index which does  not have as much a loosening. In fact, it's much well below that of the  U.S. I feel on part of that, Candice, is the better inflation, I put that  in quote, and better wages closing upward growth versus the recent down  that we've seen, like industrial output, for example, starting to roll  over, how do you -- how does that all work?</p><p>BANGSUND: So, obviously, last year in Europe, we had decade high GDP  growth, which was very impressive. And I think that's a big part of why  we're seeing or why we saw the euro strengthen last year. Although the Q1,  a little bit concerning, the rollover, but it's important to remember that  the economy is still growing at above trend levels, helping to close that  output gap and allowing the ECB to proceed with normalization, though,  gradually, I think we're going to be looking for that rate to stay  unchanged until well past the end of asset purchases.</p><p>WESTIN: So the monetary conditions are tightening or they're tighter there  in the United States, as Alix just pointed out. If the euro early does go  up the way you project to go up, that's going to tighten them further. So  is that really a restrain on the ECB? Do we have to be concern about that?</p><p>BANGSUND: Absolutely. It's something that they're going to have to watch  particularly on the inflation front. And I think it's going to warrant that  gradual cautious stance from the ECB in 2019. We're not expecting them to  move on interest rate until likely the back half of '19.</p><p>WESTIN: So, Candice, one of the things we have in our list is things we  watch for or concerns about trade. There were some early indications that  maybe, for example, like Germany exports maybe down on some because it  concerns about the uncertainty of trade with United States, frankly. How  big a factor is that for the ECB today?</p><p>BANGSUND: I think trade is a big factor for everybody these days,  particularly in Europe. You do have that combination of stronger euro and  the lingering trade uncertainties likely going to factor into that gradual  approach from the ECB in general.</p><p>STEEL: All right. Candice Bangsund of Fiera Capital, thank you very much, a  pleasure to have you on set.

Don't forget that all the digital information that you get off of direct to consumer is really, really important in the future. I think the -- we've hit the tipping point on that. And I think see how the big tech companies are relative by any of these companies actually as they could. So I think this is fortifying themselves for that door, not only against each other but against the big tech companies.</p><p>WESTIN: Okay. Thank you very much. Kay Koplovitz, it's really great to have you, Kay.</p><p>STEEL: So what's the trade for that? How do you position yourself around this tight rope and the issue that Paul was just talking about?</p><p>BANGSUND: Well, I think when you're thinking about the ECB meeting today and even going forward the path to normalization, I think you want to get long with the euro and short to U.S. dollar. Like I mentioned before, the U.S dollar is fully priced for what the fed has planned for the next few years anyways where as we're not seeing ex-Federal Reserve, central banks been pricing such as the ECB who has, regardless of whether it's today or in July, except to reduce paper, that asset purchase program, and be done by the end of 2018.</p><p>STEEL: Well, taking a look at, say, the ECB versus the fed, if you come inside the Bloomberg, you're looking at the financial conditions and next for both of the regions, and you have a much easier condition in the U.S., the higher it goes, the looser it is, versus the European index which does not have as much a loosening. In fact, it's much well below that of the U.S. I feel on part of that, Candice, is the better inflation, I put that in quote, and better wages closing upward growth versus the recent down that we've seen, like industrial output, for example, starting to roll over, how do you -- how does that all work?</p><p>BANGSUND: So, obviously, last year in Europe, we had decade high GDP growth, which was very impressive. And I think that's a big part of why we're seeing or why we saw the euro strengthen last year. Although the Q1, a little bit concerning, the rollover, but it's important to remember that the economy is still growing at above trend levels, helping to close that output gap and allowing the ECB to proceed with normalization, though, gradually, I think we're going to be looking for that rate to stay unchanged until well past the end of asset purchases.</p><p>WESTIN: So the monetary conditions are tightening or they're tighter there in the United States, as Alix just pointed out. If the euro early does go up the way you project to go up, that's going to tighten them further. So is that really a restrain on the ECB? Do we have to be concern about that?</p><p>BANGSUND: Absolutely. It's something that they're going to have to watch particularly on the inflation front. And I think it's going to warrant that gradual cautious stance from the ECB in 2019. We're not expecting them to move on interest rate until likely the back half of '19.</p><p>WESTIN: So, Candice, one of the things we have in our list is things we watch for or concerns about trade. There were some early indications that maybe, for example, like Germany exports maybe down on some because it concerns about the uncertainty of trade with United States, frankly. How big a factor is that for the ECB today?</p><p>BANGSUND: I think trade is a big factor for everybody these days, particularly in Europe. You do have that combination of stronger euro and the lingering trade uncertainties likely going to factor into that gradual approach from the ECB in general.</p><p>STEEL: All right. Candice Bangsund of Fiera Capital, thank you very much, a pleasure to have you on set.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CANDICE BANGSUND, MANAGER, FIERA CAPITAL PORTFOLIO AND KAY KOPLOVITZ, MANAGING PARTNER, SPRINGBOARD GROWTH CAPITAL, ARE INTERVIEWED ON BLOOMBERG TELEVISION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JUNE 14, 2018</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: CANDICE BANGSUND, MANAGER, FIERA CAPITAL PORTFOLIO</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KAY KOPLOVITZ, MANAGING PARTNER, SPRINGBOARD GROWTH CAPITAL</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p>[*] ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Well, what was interesting about the market reaction -- the rhetoric was that he was more hawkish. The market reaction though dollar rally and then it ended up selling off, and the curve continues to flatten. The curve makes sense to me. But what happened to the dollar? Why did it not respond?</p><p>CANDICE BANGSUND, MANAGER, FIERA CAPITAL PORTFOLIO: Yes. So I think a lot of the news was already priced into the U.S. dollar. So you did see the dollar move up little bit after the news but then come back in a week and ended the day actually a little bit lower. And I think that's because the focus is likely shifting over to the ECB now.</p><p>DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Well, exactly. Kay, it appears that both of these companies are in it and it's a win it, as it said.</p><p>KAY KOPLOVITZ, MANAGING PARTNER, SPRINGBOARD GROWTH CAPITAL: Yes, they are.</p><p>WESTIN: Why do Disney and Comcast believe that they have to have these assets?</p><p>KOPLOVITZ: Well, I think it's really the fight for the consumer, direct to the consumer, that it's very, very important to both of them. And Disney, Bob has (inaudible) very aggressively, he made his plan. I think he wants that content for that reason. And I think that Bryan was fighting back because he doesn't want to lose out in a war. He's got his own studio but more product, again, they going to find themselves going direct to consumer before long. I think that's really the fight here. And that's both that they want the content property and the distribution international is very important to Comcast.</p><p>WESTIN: Okay. Let's talk about who is the most likely to win, who's got the advantage? These are the two important bids as they describe. You see, the Comcast right now now is well above Disney and also Disney, thus far all stack, they both are offering a breakup fee of $2.5 billion. But let's talk, Kay, about who has the advantage. I talked to Bob Allen Iger when his earnings came out a couple of weeks ago and asked him, how are you going to avoid overspending? He thinks he has the advantage. So listen to what he said. Do we have it? Okay. So I'll impersonate Bob Iger. What he said -- in essence, what he said was, if you get into an auction, you have to see which is getting more attractive to the seller. I mean, really, Fox. And in fact, as he thinks (inaudible) for regulatory purposes, he'll have less difficulty to admit this done. Also he suggests that, in fact, they may actually like Disney stock.</p><p>KOPLOVITZ: I think that's the case. I think Murdoch does definitely like the Disney Stock and would like to have that longer term. I think that as delta gives bigger though, it's getting harder to justify. There's tax deficiency and in the Disney bid that was not there in the Comcast bit. But the delta has gotten quite large now. So I think they have to pause and say, who's got the better deal. Murdoch, I'm pretty clear, looks like, clearly, he would like Disney. But I wonder if Bob is going to raise his bid.</p><p>WESTIN: Really? You think he might not?</p><p>KOPLOVITZ: He might not. Bob is disciplined. That I think that he's showing -- I guess, he's quite disciplined purchaser, but I think he's going to have to do something.</p><p>STEEL: So pretend that one person gets it, Kay. What does the company do? What kind of assets out there that can replace Fox?</p><p>KOPLOVITZ: Well, I don't think it's very easy to do that. That's why -- I mean, there are other content players out there. If you want more study, you could buy Viacom possibly because they have Paramount Studio, they've got John Malone out there with some properties in deals with Discovery and Lionsgate and some content out there, but it's a different kind of content. Then the studio offers at the Fox studio and the distribution networks that they have and the international, which I -- you can't short change that. I think they both wanted international distribution on Sky.</p><p>WESTIN: Well, that's an interesting point you make though, Kay. How much of this is the library as it where and the franchises that you have at the studio, The Simpsons and all that sort of stuff (inaudible) was that and how much are real distribution outliers (ph), I mean, the channels and think do you should specialize in -- boy, you really created that business.</p><p>KOPLOVITZ: Yes I think the channels are very important to them. And so I think that's one of the reasons they want all of the content. Because the more channels you have, the more places you have to repurpose all that content in different ways to the consumer. And that's very valuable long- term, especially when you're looking at a strategy, when you're going direct to consumer. Don't forget that all the digital information that you get off of direct to consumer is really, really important in the future. I think the -- we've hit the tipping point on that. And I think see how the big tech companies are relative by any of these companies actually as they could. So I think this is fortifying themselves for that door, not only against each other but against the big tech companies.</p><p>WESTIN: Okay. Thank you very much. Kay Koplovitz, it's really great to have you, Kay.</p><p>STEEL: So what's the trade for that? How do you position yourself around this tight rope and the issue that Paul was just talking about?</p><p>BANGSUND: Well, I think when you're thinking about the ECB meeting today and even going forward the path to normalization, I think you want to get long with the euro and short to U.S. dollar. Like I mentioned before, the U.S dollar is fully priced for what the fed has planned for the next few years anyways where as we're not seeing ex-Federal Reserve, central banks been pricing such as the ECB who has, regardless of whether it's today or in July, except to reduce paper, that asset purchase program, and be done by the end of 2018.</p><p>STEEL: Well, taking a look at, say, the ECB versus the fed, if you come inside the Bloomberg, you're looking at the financial conditions and next for both of the regions, and you have a much easier condition in the U.S., the higher it goes, the looser it is, versus the European index which does not have as much a loosening.

The market reaction  though dollar rally and then it ended up selling off, and the curve  continues to flatten. The curve makes sense to me. But what happened to the  dollar? Why did it not respond?</p><p> CANDICE BANGSUND, MANAGER, FIERA CAPITAL PORTFOLIO: Yes. So I think a lot  of the news was already priced into the U.S. dollar. So you did see the  dollar move up little bit after the news but then come back in a week and  ended the day actually a little bit lower. And I think that's because the  focus is likely shifting over to the ECB now.</p><p> DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Well, exactly. Kay, it appears that both of  these companies are in it and it's a win it, as it said.</p><p> KAY KOPLOVITZ, MANAGING PARTNER, SPRINGBOARD GROWTH CAPITAL: Yes, they are.</p><p> WESTIN: Why do Disney and Comcast believe that they have to have these  assets?</p><p> KOPLOVITZ: Well, I think it's really the fight for the consumer, direct to  the consumer, that it's very, very important to both of them. And Disney,  Bob has (inaudible) very aggressively, he made his plan. I think he wants  that content for that reason. And I think that Bryan was fighting back  because he doesn't want to lose out in a war. He's got his own studio but  more product, again, they going to find themselves going direct to consumer  before long. I think that's really the fight here. And that's both that  they want the content property and the distribution international is very  important to Comcast.</p><p> WESTIN: Okay. Let's talk about who is the most likely to win, who's got the  advantage? These are the two important bids as they describe. You see, the  Comcast right now now is well above Disney and also Disney, thus far all  stack, they both are offering a breakup fee of $2.5 billion. But let's  talk, Kay, about who has the advantage. I talked to Bob Allen Iger when his  earnings came out a couple of weeks ago and asked him, how are you going to  avoid overspending? He thinks he has the advantage. So listen to what he  said. Do we have it? Okay. So I'll impersonate Bob Iger. What he said -- in  essence, what he said was, if you get into an auction, you have to see  which is getting more attractive to the seller. I mean, really, Fox. And in  fact, as he thinks (inaudible) for regulatory purposes, he'll have less  difficulty to admit this done. Also he suggests that, in fact, they may  actually like Disney stock.</p><p> KOPLOVITZ: I think that's the case. I think Murdoch does definitely like  the Disney Stock and would like to have that longer term. I think that as  delta gives bigger though, it's getting harder to justify. There's tax  deficiency and in the Disney bid that was not there in the Comcast bit. But  the delta has gotten quite large now. So I think they have to pause and  say, who's got the better deal. Murdoch, I'm pretty clear, looks like,  clearly, he would like Disney. But I wonder if Bob is going to raise his  bid.</p><p> WESTIN: Really? You think he might not?</p><p> KOPLOVITZ: He might not. Bob is disciplined. That I think that he's showing  -- I guess, he's quite disciplined purchaser, but I think he's going to  have to do something.</p><p> STEEL: So pretend that one person gets it, Kay. What does the company do?  What kind of assets out there that can replace Fox?</p><p> KOPLOVITZ: Well, I don't think it's very easy to do that. That's why -- I  mean, there are other content players out there. If you want more study,  you could buy Viacom possibly because they have Paramount Studio, they've  got John Malone out there with some properties in deals with Discovery and  Lionsgate and some content out there, but it's a different kind of content.  Then the studio offers at the Fox studio and the distribution networks that  they have and the international, which I -- you can't short change that. I  think they both wanted international distribution on Sky.</p><p> WESTIN: Well, that's an interesting point you make though, Kay. How much of  this is the library as it where and the franchises that you have at the  studio, The Simpsons and all that sort of stuff (inaudible) was that and  how much are real distribution outliers (ph), I mean, the channels and  think do you should specialize in -- boy, you really created that business.</p><p> KOPLOVITZ: Yes I think the channels are very important to them. And so I  think that's one of the reasons they want all of the content. Because the  more channels you have, the more places you have to repurpose all that  content in different ways to the consumer. And that's very valuable long- term, especially when you're looking at a strategy, when you're going  direct to consumer. Don't forget that all the digital information that you  get off of direct to consumer is really, really important in the future. I  think the -- we've hit the tipping point on that. And I think see how the  big tech companies are relative by any of these companies actually as they  could. So I think this is fortifying themselves for that door, not only  against each other but against the big tech companies.</p><p> WESTIN: Okay. Thank you very much. Kay Koplovitz, it's really great to have  you, Kay.</p><p> STEEL: So what's the trade for that? How do you position yourself around  this tight rope and the issue that Paul was just talking about?</p><p> BANGSUND: Well, I think when you're thinking about the ECB meeting today  and even going forward the path to normalization, I think you want to get  long with the euro and short to U.S. dollar. Like I mentioned before, the  U.S dollar is fully priced for what the fed has planned for the next few  years anyways where as we're not seeing ex-Federal Reserve, central banks  been pricing such as the ECB who has, regardless of whether it's today or  in July, except to reduce paper, that asset purchase program, and be done  by the end of 2018.</p><p> STEEL: Well, taking a look at, say, the ECB versus the fed, if you come  inside the Bloomberg, you're looking at the financial conditions and next  for both of the regions, and you have a much easier condition in the U.S.,  the higher it goes, the looser it is, versus the European index which does  not have as much a loosening. In fact, it's much well below that of the  U.S. I feel on part of that, Candice, is the better inflation, I put that  in quote, and better wages closing upward growth versus the recent down  that we've seen, like industrial output, for example, starting to roll  over, how do you -- how does that all work?</p><p> BANGSUND: So, obviously, last year in Europe, we had decade high GDP  growth, which was very impressive. And I think that's a big part of why  we're seeing or why we saw the euro strengthen last year. Although the Q1,  a little bit concerning, the rollover, but it's important to remember that  the economy is still growing at above trend levels, helping to close that  output gap and allowing the ECB to proceed with normalization, though,  gradually, I think we're going to be looking for that rate to stay  unchanged until well past the end of asset purchases.</p><p> WESTIN: So the monetary conditions are tightening or they're tighter there  in the United States, as Alix just pointed out. If the euro early does go  up the way you project to go up, that's going to tighten them further. So  is that really a restrain on the ECB? Do we have to be concern about that?</p><p> BANGSUND: Absolutely. It's something that they're going to have to watch  particularly on the inflation front. And I think it's going to warrant that  gradual cautious stance from the ECB in 2019. We're not expecting them to  move on interest rate until likely the back half of '19.</p><p> WESTIN: So, Candice, one of the things we have in our list is things we  watch for or concerns about trade. There were some early indications that  maybe, for example, like Germany exports maybe down on some because it  concerns about the uncertainty of trade with United States, frankly. How  big a factor is that for the ECB today?</p><p> BANGSUND: I think trade is a big factor for everybody these days,  particularly in Europe. You do have that combination of stronger euro and  the lingering trade uncertainties likely going to factor into that gradual  approach from the ECB in general.</p><p> STEEL: All right. Candice Bangsund of Fiera Capital, thank you very much, a  pleasure to have you on set. And Paul Donovan of UBS Global Wealth  Management stays with us.</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

She is a fresh and attractive mid-fifties face, compared with septuagenarian frontrunners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, or the aging progressive Elizabeth Warren. Part Asian-Indian, part Afro-Caribbean, and female, Harris seems the frontrunner in the intersectionality sweepstakes that currently largely defines Democratic politics. Yet the national obsession with ethnicity and novelty obscures the more important reality: Harris is also the favored candidate of the tech and media oligarchy now almost uniformly aligned with the Democratic Party. She has been a hit in all the important places the Hamptons[2], Hollywood[3], and Silicon Valley that financed Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. </p><p>Unlike Warren and Sanders, or Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar[4], Harris has not called for curbs on, let alone for breaking up, the tech giants. As California's attorney general, she did little to prevent the agglomeration of economic power that has increasingly turned California into a semi-feudal state dominated by a handful of large tech firms. These corporate behemoths now occupy 20 percent of Silicon Valley's office space, and they have undermined the start-up culture[5] that once drove the area's growth. When I started covering Silicon Valley in the mid-1970s, most top executives such as David Packard tended to be middle-of-the-road Republicans, supportive of some government role in the economy, including providing for physical infrastructure, but strongly committed to the idea of competition-driven innovation. This pattern changed dramatically as the Valley began to move away from manufacturing products often by shifting production to less-expensive states and then, ultimately, to Asia toward a focus largely on media, advertising, and Internet search. These new companies, unlike, say, chip manufacturers, were less concerned with electricity prices, road conditions, or environmental regulations. Many of these 'second wave[6]' firms are essentially involved in 'information peddling,' which requires a workforce divided between elite managers and a large, impermanent base of coders, many living only for a brief time in the Bay Area. Such firms, which don't require as many longtime employees as traditional companies, have largely emerged from San Francisco, arguably the most progressive city in the United States. The massive inequality that characterizes the region would seem to undercut the progressive narrative[7] that sees California, and particularly the Bay Area, as a harbinger of a more enlightened future. Increasingly under fire from both left and right[8] for abusing its power, Silicon Valley could find Kamala Harris a convenient way to counter criticism while maintaining a tolerant, 'woke' facade. The shift in tech firms' focus has fit perfectly with the trajectory of Harris's career. As district attorney of San Francisco, Harris had the opportunity to cultivate the tech aristocracy. Her intermittently 'tough on crime' positions would not offend corporate executives who find themselves in a city that even the New York Times has labelled 'dystopia by the bay[9]' rife with petty crime, homelessness, and sometimes violent mentally-ill people. Elected state attorney general in 2010, Harris got decidedly mixed results, with some notable abuses of office[10] and a demonstrated disinterest in individual rights[11] and privacy protections[12] a record that alienated some on the left[13]. On economics, she talked tough on energy companies and homebuilders[14], but when it came to privacy legislation, she supported policies[15] favored by her tech backers[16]. By the time Harris ran for the Senate, she could count on massive support from Bay Area law firms[17], real-estate developers, and Hollywood[18]. More important, she appealed, early on, to tech mavens [19]such as Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and Sean Parker, Marc Benioff of Salesforce, Yahoo's Marissa Mayer, venture capitalist John Doerr, Steve Jobs's widow Laurene Powell, and various executives at tech firms such as Airbnb, Google, and Nest, who have collectively poured money into her campaigns. Their investment was not ill-considered. Harris seems a sure bet for the tech leaders. Her husband, attorney Doug Emhoff[20], was a managing partner with Venable Partners, whose clients include Microsoft, Apple, Verizon, and trade associations opposing strict Internet regulations. This year, Harris keynoted the Joint Venture Silicon Valley conference[21], and she is once again reaping large donations from tech and media[22] giants. As the most significant California candidate in the race, she has a big advantage in harvesting the lion's share of these riches: California donors collectively contributed over $500 million[23] to the 2016 campaign. The largest benefactors[24] so far to Harris's 2020 campaign include employees at Alphabet (the parent of Google) including its former chairman, Eric Schmidt[25] Cisco, and Apple, as well as many prominent media and entertainment interests. For these companies, with few non-Asian minorities or women in senior positions, and some executives implicated in #MeToo infractions, Harris offers a low-impact way to connect to contemporary progressive concerns. Today's Democratic Party is increasingly defined by the progressive Left, with competing factions focused on basic economic issues, on the one hand, and identity politics (greens, gays, feminists, racial identity, and legalizing undocumented migrants[26]) on the other. Another vital faction is made up of employees of public-employee unions, which dominate the party in California. Harris has already maneuvered to appeal to this powerful sector, proposing legislation that would send billions of dollars from Washington to pay teachers' salaries[27]. The more economically focused progressives like Klobuchar[28], Bernie Sanders, Warren, and Ohio's Tim Ryan seek primarily to address income inequality. They see the tech giants, in control of much information media, as a danger both to the economy and to democracy. Whatever one thinks of their approach, the economic populists at least reflect a tradition that seeks to make capitalism more beneficial for working people. They don't excuse the tech firms for their offshoring practices, lack of unionization, and stifling of competition. Originally posted at City Journal.

She is a fresh and attractive mid-fifties face, compared with septuagenarian frontrunners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, or the aging progressive Elizabeth Warren. Part Asian-Indian, part Afro-Caribbean, and female, Harris seems the frontrunner in the intersectionality sweepstakes that currently largely defines Democratic politics. Yet the national obsession with ethnicity and novelty obscures the more important reality: Harris is also the favored candidate of the tech and media oligarchy now almost uniformly aligned with the Democratic Party. She has been a hit in all the important places\u2014the Hamptons[2], Hollywood[3], and Silicon Valley\u2014that financed Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. </p><p>Unlike Warren and Sanders, or Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar[4], Harris has not called for curbs on, let alone for breaking up, the tech giants. As California's attorney general, she did little to prevent the agglomeration of economic power that has increasingly turned California into a semi-feudal state dominated by a handful of large tech firms. These corporate behemoths now occupy 20 percent of Silicon Valley's office space, and they have undermined the start-up culture[5] that once drove the area's growth. When I started covering Silicon Valley in the mid-1970s, most top executives\u2014such as David Packard\u2014tended to be middle-of-the-road Republicans, supportive of some government role in the economy, including providing for physical infrastructure, but strongly committed to the idea of competition-driven innovation. This pattern changed dramatically as the Valley began to move away from manufacturing products\u2014often by shifting production to less-expensive states and then, ultimately, to Asia\u2014toward a focus largely on media, advertising, and Internet search. These new companies, unlike, say, chip manufacturers, were less concerned with electricity prices, road conditions, or environmental regulations. Many of these 'second wave[6]' firms are essentially involved in 'information peddling,' which requires a workforce divided between elite managers and a large, impermanent base of coders, many living only for a brief time in the Bay Area. Such firms, which don't require as many longtime employees as traditional companies, have largely emerged from San Francisco, arguably the most progressive city in the United States. The massive inequality that characterizes the region would seem to undercut the progressive narrative[7] that sees California, and particularly the Bay Area, as a harbinger of a more enlightened future. Increasingly under fire from both left and right[8] for abusing its power, Silicon Valley could find Kamala Harris a convenient way to counter criticism while maintaining a tolerant, 'woke' facade. The shift in tech firms' focus has fit perfectly with the trajectory of Harris's career. As district attorney of San Francisco, Harris had the opportunity to cultivate the tech aristocracy. Her intermittently 'tough on crime' positions would not offend corporate executives who find themselves in a city that even the New York Times has labelled 'dystopia by the bay[9]'\u2014rife with petty crime, homelessness, and sometimes violent mentally-ill people. Elected state attorney general in 2010, Harris got decidedly mixed results, with some notable abuses of office[10] and a demonstrated disinterest in individual rights[11] and privacy protections[12]\u2014a record that alienated some on the left[13]. On economics, she talked tough on energy companies and homebuilders[14], but when it came to privacy legislation, she supported policies[15] favored by her tech backers[16]. By the time Harris ran for the Senate, she could count on massive support from Bay Area law firms[17], real-estate developers, and Hollywood[18]. More important, she appealed, early on, to tech mavens [19]such as Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and Sean Parker, Marc Benioff of Salesforce, Yahoo's Marissa Mayer, venture capitalist John Doerr, Steve Jobs's widow Laurene Powell, and various executives at tech firms such as Airbnb, Google, and Nest, who have collectively poured money into her campaigns. Their investment was not ill-considered. Harris seems a sure bet for the tech leaders. Her husband, attorney Doug Emhoff[20], was a managing partner with Venable Partners, whose clients include Microsoft, Apple, Verizon, and trade associations opposing strict Internet regulations. This year, Harris keynoted the Joint Venture Silicon Valley conference[21], and she is once again reaping large donations from tech and media[22] giants. As the most significant California candidate in the race, she has a big advantage in harvesting the lion's share of these riches: California donors collectively contributed over $500 million[23] to the 2016 campaign. The largest benefactors[24] so far to Harris's 2020 campaign include employees at Alphabet (the parent of Google)\u2014including its former chairman, Eric Schmidt[25]\u2014Cisco, and Apple, as well as many prominent media and entertainment interests. For these companies, with few non-Asian minorities or women in senior positions, and some executives implicated in #MeToo infractions, Harris offers a low-impact way to connect to contemporary progressive concerns. Today's Democratic Party is increasingly defined by the progressive Left, with competing factions focused on basic economic issues, on the one hand, and identity politics (greens, gays, feminists, racial identity, and legalizing undocumented migrants[26]) on the other. Another vital faction is made up of employees of public-employee unions, which dominate the party in California. Harris has already maneuvered to appeal to this powerful sector, proposing legislation that would send billions of dollars from Washington to pay teachers' salaries[27]. The more economically focused progressives like Klobuchar[28], Bernie Sanders, Warren, and Ohio's Tim Ryan seek primarily to address income inequality. They see the tech giants, in control of much information media, as a danger both to the economy and to democracy. Whatever one thinks of their approach, the economic populists at least reflect a tradition that seeks to make capitalism more beneficial for working people. They don't excuse the tech firms for their offshoring practices, lack of unionization, and stifling of competition. Originally posted at City Journal.

The following came from Steve Monas, Republican candidate for state House District 14, which includes Hanalei, Princeville, Kilauea, Anahola, Kapaa and Wailua. Go to Civil Beat'sElections Guide[1]for general information, and check out other candidates on thePrimary Election Ballot[2].  Steve Monas  1. Hawaii has been deeply affected by the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>Perhaps the biggest impact is to the economy and the tourism industry, which has been Hawaii's biggest economic driver. Do you think state leaders have handled the response to the virus effectively, including the approach to testing and health care as well as the stay-at-home orders that have caused serious economic harm? What would you have done differently? I would have followed guidelines by our current presidential administration. We could have started preparing during the State of the Union address when President Trump announced that we should be on high alert of a new flu-like virus coming from a city of Wuhan. I do not think that the local government should have had the right to decide which business they could save and which they should close down. Same as in 2008 when Lehman Brothers failed, now Kauai has an unemployment rates as high as 95% percent, which is in my District 14. Everyone should have had the chance to put in place safety measures; we are all essential. 2. The state budget is facing record shortfalls. How would you balance the budget? What would you cut? What would you protect? Currently our mayor and some of our unelected 'task force' officials are unofficially cutting regulation, bureaucratic red tape, cutting taxes and handing out loans for the remainder of small businesses that might survive. Does that sound familiar? It should because when you cut regulations, and taxes, just like our current administration has been doing for over three years, we will see an economic boom. I would never cut the wages of our health care workers, teachers, police officers, firefighters, lifeguards, social workers and other first responders. 3. What do you think should be done to diversify the economy? What would you do as an elected official to make that happen? I am running on my ideas on how to diversify the economy that I have been regularly posting on social media sites with hashtag #votestevemonas. It is not the position of the elected official to create businesses, that would be socialism, and some would say communism. It is up to the ingenuity of our Hawaiian citizens to use this time to come up with ideas based on its elected officials cutting burdensome regulations and taxes. Let the culture of the Hawaiian people create products that are unique to the world and export our aloha. 4. Are you satisfied with the current plans to pay for the state's unfunded liabilities? If not, how would you propose to meet pension and health obligations for public workers? Would you support reductions in benefits including in pension contributions for public employees in light of virus-related budget shortfalls? I would never support reductions in benefits, including pension contributions for public employees or for any public workers. Why should they have to pay for the elected officials mismanagement or poor decision making? I would support doing a bipartisan independent audit of the government's current regulations, taxation and spending. If we need to cut costs, it would not be from our hard-working Hawaiian public employees, including and not limited to health-care workers, first responders, police officers, social workers, firefighters, and lifeguards - let's not forget about the administration staff of each that makes their department work. 5. The state's virus response effort has exposed deep rifts within the top levels of government, including between the Legislature and Gov. David Ige. He will be in office two more years, so what would you do to ensure public confidence in Hawaii's government officials and top executives? The best example I have read was the response of Vietnam. I am not saying that we should follow everything, but what I am saying is that they were prepared since 2002 when China had an outbreak that affected this small nation. They took note, and were ready. China has been known to experiment with various flu-type viruses since 2002 and now the world see's it. I think that Gov. Ige has scared public confidence into submission. 6. Recent deaths of citizens at the hands of police are igniting protests and calls for reform across the country, primarily aimed at preventing discrimination against people of color. How important do you see this as an issue for Hawaii? What should be done to improve policing and police accountability throughout the state? Do you support police reform efforts such as mandatory disclosure of misconduct records by police agencies and adequate funding for law enforcement oversight boards that have been established in recent years? I have been an outspoken person about this topic on my various social media channels, #votestevemonas. Hawaii is a place of diversity. We have all sorts of different colors, races, religions from all over the world. If the movie 'Trolls World Tour' has taught us anything besides that it took too long to own the movie instead of renting it, what makes us different is what makes us beautiful. If we need to make change, let's make change together. I support mandatory disclosure of misconduct records and internal affairs agencies. 7. Hawaii is the only Western state without a statewide citizens initiative process. Do you support such a process? Distrust of the Legislature is a theme in support for initiatives. It is a very expensive process as other states have seen, and at times the proposals are disguised. Democrats have dominated politics since 1954 and subsequently since statehood in 1959 to the present. If a proposal is brought before Hawaii's Legislature and Senate that is against the platform of the Democratic Party, it will not go on the ballot. So if you are angry about the Legislature in Hawaii since 1954, you know who to blame. I would support a statewide citizens initiative process to let the Hawaiian people get their voices heard and not be silenced anymore. 8. Hawaii's public records law mandates that public records be made available whenever possible. Gov. David Ige suspended the open government laws under an emergency order during the pandemic. Do you agree or disagree with his action? What would you do to ensure the public has access to open meetings and public records in a timely fashion? The government, unless it's for national security, like keeping secrets from our enemies, should be transparent and not keep secrets from our own Hawaii citizens. When you are not being transparent, it basically means you are hiding something. 9. What should Hawaii be doing to prepare for the effects of climate change, including sea level rise and threats to the reefs? How big of a priority is this for you? I do not think it's a good idea to cap the population at 9.2 billion and enact a one-child global policy like China did. The documentary 'One Child Nation' was, being polite, horrific of what the Chinese government did to its citizens when they believed they had more than one child. If we need to find answers, we should not look to the Chinese Communist Party for answers. The climate is going to change, it will rain, it will be sunny, it might snow in some parts, but we should not hurt our populations if we think that we are the biggest threat to our planet. 10. What do you see as the most pressing issue facing your district? What will you do about it? The biggest issues we have in my district is high unemployment, fear of each other infecting each other that has been played over and over on our portable display screens. We need to use our ingenuity to diversify our economy like opening up swap meets, drive-in movie theaters, able to us our SNAP benefits on our phones for pickup at grocery stores, creating a 'Smart Kauai' and most importantly, remember that we should not be scared of each other. We are a culture, we are a community, we are a small island that will survive and thrive. 11. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed numerous flaws in Hawaii's structure and systems, from outdated technology to economic disparity. If you could take this moment to reinvent Hawaii, to build on what we've learned and create a better state, a better way of doing things, what would you do? Please share One Big Idea you have for Hawaii. Be innovative, but be specific. One Big Idea from SteveMonas.com: A 'Smart Kauai' is our community built on a foundation that our kids will remain on the island. We are already teaching our kids 'STEM' from kindergarten, and they are competing in robotics in high school. These high-paying computer jobs are work-from-home jobs. Generations of Kauai ohana can stay at home with good-paying computer jobs. Since #WuhanVirus, most big tech firms (Facebook, Shopify, Twitter, Square, Google, etc) have already said that within the next five to 10 years most positions will be 'work from home.' I will get these tech firms to use Kauai as a pilot program. Sign up for our FREE morning newsletter and face each day more informed.    Sorry. That's an invalid e-mail.   Thanks!

The following came from Noelle Famera, Democratic candidate for U.S. House District 2, which includes rural Oahu and the neighbor islands. </p><p>Other Democratic candidates include Brian Evans[1], Kai Kahele and Brenda Lee. Go to Civil Beat'sElections Guide[2]for general information, and check out other candidates on thePrimary Election Ballot[3].  Noelle Famera  1. The entire country, including Hawaii, has been deeply affected by the coronavirus pandemic. What should national leaders be prioritizing to help keep the outbreak under control and repair economic damage done by measures taken to respond to the outbreak? What role can you play as just one of 435 members of the U.S. House to help Hawaii? I would work to co-sponsor the important coronavirus relief bills that are helping to fund small businesses and individuals. But I would make sure that the money is going to the people, and not the big corporations or businesses that don't need it. 2. What would be your first priority if elected? How would that change if your party is in the majority? The minority? My first priority if elected would be climate action, which is something that a majority of my fellow Democrats believe in. If my party was in the majority I would push to pass sweeping climate change legislation like the Green New Deal. If my party was in the minority, I would work across the aisle to begin to build a base for when we are ready to push the big climate change legislation. 3. Recent deaths of citizens at the hands of police are igniting protests and calls for reform across the country, primarily aimed at preventing discrimination against people of color. What should Congress do, if anything, to improve policing and police accountability? I believe Congress needs to pass sweeping legislation that opens up the funding for full police reform. We should also open up congressional hearings into police brutality cases across America, as to make sure they are handled correctly. 4. Whatever happens in the general election, Congress and the country will likely remain deeply divided. What specifically would you do to help bridge the partisan divide in Washington? I would be a bipartisan voice that works for my constituents, not the top 1%, not the establishment machine, and not the partisan politics that has plagued this nation for far too long. I would work across the aisle with the mindset that it isn't my way or the highway, we need to find a middle ground in order to move America forward. 5. What is your view of the role of the U.S. military in the islands, and would you like to see that role increased or decreased? We need better regulation of what our military is doing here. 6. Congress has struggled in recent years to reach agreement on budget deficits, the national debt and spending in general. What would be your approach to fiscal matters? I would make cuts to certain departments, as well as holding Big Tech accountable for taking jobs overseas and paying less taxes. I would work to investigate money laundering that the U.S. loses billions of dollars to a year. 7. Under what circumstances should America go to war? America should rarely go to war, but if we know that our country is at risk, we should fight to protect it at all costs. We should also try to promote free and fair democracies around the world, and we should always protect the lives of innocent refugees. If we are in an alliance with another country we should truly examine if it is worth starting a war; if the issue is serious we need to support our allies. 8. What should the United States do to control carbon emissions and slow climate change? The United States needs to close all nuclear facilities to start; they pose a sudden and dangerous threat to the well-being of our nation. We should also begin to transform our factories to 100% green energy, we should also transform our economy to a 100% green economy. A huge way our nation can help in the fight against climate change would be passing the Green New Deal. 9. Is it time to reform Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid? How? Yes, by implementing rehabilitation centers for the homeless and housing, as well as dental care. 10. What should be done to reform U. S. immigration policies, if anything? We support a pathway to citizenship. 11. What specific reforms, if any, would you seek in gun control policies? Universal background checks. 12. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed numerous flaws in Hawaii's structure and systems, from outdated technology to economic disparity. If you could take this moment to reinvent Hawaii, to build on what we've learned and create a better state, a better way of doing things, what would you do? Please share One Big Idea you have for Hawaii. Be innovative, but be specific. First getting inbound flights tested before arrival is important. Also building a sustainable infrastructure that is not relying on outside sources, such as developing local food sourcing and renewable energies. 13. What other important issue would you like to discuss here? The issues of universal basic income and data rights. For far too long, the homelessness crisis has been a huge problem in America, but by starting a UBI program, we would be able to give these people better lives, which leads to more jobs in America.

''The era of self-regulation is over,'' Speaker <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi </nameText></person>declared on Monday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But just as Ms. Pelosi's Democrats were preparing sweeping House hearings into the tech companies' concentration of power, some of her party's leading presidential candidates spent the weekend canvassing Silicon Valley to raise money from one of the nation's wealthiest and most liberal bastions. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Mayor <person><nameText>Pete Buttigieg </nameText></person>filled his Saturday with no less than four fund-raisers in the Bay Area, with co-hosts that included a former top Facebook executive and Google official. It was at least Mr. Buttigieg's third fund-raising trip to the region in the last three months. <person><nameText>Senator Cory Booker </nameText></person>was making his fourth trip to Silicon Valley to raise money since declaring for president in February. And <person><nameText>Kamala Harris, </nameText></person>California's junior senator, was on her sixth tour of the Bay Area fund-raising circuit this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.]</p><p>  The Democratic Party's intensifying alarms about the technology giants' monopolistic behavior, social media misinformation and lax privacy protections pose an unexpected dilemma for the 2020 field.</p><p>  In a contest where purity tests on the left have already propelled leading campaigns to disavow super PACs and reject money from federal lobbyists, is tech money still politically acceptable? And can those who take it still be trusted to rein in the industry's excesses?</p><p>  The progressive base has already soured on Wall Street, fossil fuel and pharmaceutical cash. Silicon Valley had been, until recently, one of the last relatively untainted wellsprings from which to draw campaign contributions. Now, some, particularly on the left, say tech money is suspect, too.</p><p>  ''Many of the candidates are trying to have it both ways,'' said Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist from the party's progressive wing, who recently called on Democratic political consultants to stop representing corporate clients, ''but it will be hard to be taken seriously as strong on this issue when you're taking money hand over fist from Big Tech.''</p><p>  The fraught Democratic balancing act came into sharp relief last weekend.</p><p>  [Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field.]</p><p>  House Democrats and Ms. Pelosi announced plans for an antitrust investigation into the largest tech companies and <person><nameText>Senator Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>posed in front of a San Francisco billboard calling for breaking up Big Tech. Meanwhile, more than a dozen presidential candidates arrived in the city for the state Democratic convention. That was the public side of their trips; many maintained a busy private itinerary of fund-raisers powered in part by the immense wealth of the tech sector.</p><p>  Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar and Ms. Harris all had finance events around the Bay Area on Friday (while Mr. Booker zipped to Seattle to raise money at the office of Nick Hanauer, a venture capitalist and early Amazon investor.) Mr. Buttigieg blitzed the region on Saturday, attending an event co-hosted by Chris Cox, Facebook's former chief product officer and one of its initial engineers, and Scott Kohler, a corporate counsel to Google and former bundler for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>  On Sunday, Mr. Booker returned for an event at the home of Jeff Jordan, a tech investor who had previously served as president of PayPal and OpenTable.</p><p>  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was not in California over the weekend. But his finance team is tentatively planning a Silicon Valley swing at the end of June. In May, one of his Southern California event co-hosts was Eric Schmidt, the former Google chief executive.</p><p>  Democrats mostly appear to be banking that the cash raised at such events outweighs any risk of backlash.</p><p>  Mark Longabaugh, a Democratic strategist who advised Bernie Sanders in 2016 but is unaligned in 2020, said one reason is that most people still view tech giants ''in a favorable light,'' even if attitudes are shifting.</p><p>  ''They do not see these companies like Big Oil and the pharmaceutical companies,'' he said. ''There's a distinction there.''</p><p>  But as the Trump administration forges ahead with its own antitrust investigations into Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, the Democratic reliance on tech money could provide President Trump a political opening to depict Democrats as beholden to the technology giants. </p><p>  At a forum in San Francisco, the 2020 candidate Beto O'Rourke linked the industry's money to a law signed by Mr. Trump allowing internet providers access to sell browsing data without explicit consumer consent. ''If you follow the dollars, who paid for that access, that influence, and those outcomes, you begin to understand what's at play,'' he said.</p><p>  Most of the 2020 Democrats are aligned on stiffening regulations and tech industry scrutiny.</p><p>  But Ms. Warren, in particular, has gone much further, accusing companies like Amazon of improperly controlling the online marketplace and the items sold in it. She has shunned holding fund-raisers as a presidential candidate, though she has raised money from Silicon Valley in the past.</p><p>  Ms. Warren has surpassed Senator Bernie Sanders as tech's most insistent critic (he recently embraced breaking up Facebook, and he has hammered Amazon for its low wages).</p><p>  Ro Khanna, a California congressman who represents and has raised money heavily from Silicon Valley, serves as national co-chair of Mr. Sanders's campaign, though he is not fully aligned with Mr. Sanders on tech matters. Mr. Khanna said ''calling for a sledgehammer approach'' to breaking up Big Tech was ''bad policy'' when a ''scalpel'' is needed.</p><p>  ''People should, in my view, be proud of having support from technology leaders,'' Mr. Khanna said.</p><p>  Silicon Valley is not monolithic. Some companies profit from user data. Some make money selling hardware. Others hope to break into markets now dominated by the giants. While Ms. Warren's unyielding rhetoric has alienated some tech leaders, political donors and executives in Silicon Valley said that there is a surprising sympathy for broader calls to increase oversight of the industry's biggest players.</p><p>  ''It's my sense that a lot of people in Silicon Valley think tech has gotten too big, that there's overreach,'' said Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder who recently called for the company's breakup.</p><p>  ''There's a sense that people know that mistakes were made, and there's a search for solutions,'' Mr. Hughes added.</p><p>  Mr. Hughes has contributed to four Democratic candidates this year: Mr. Booker, Ms. Warren, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Harris.</p><p>  Three of the most aggressive candidates chasing Silicon Valley money have been Mr. Booker, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Harris, according to interviews with donors and event invitations obtained by The New York Times.</p><p>  All three have ties to the Valley. Mr. Booker attended Stanford and once was an investor in an internet start-up (another investor, the billionaire LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, recently hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Booker).</p><p>  Mr. Booker also worked closely with <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>when the Facebook founder donated $100 million to revamp Newark schools, an undertaking that got mixed reviews.</p><p>  Mr. Buttigieg, who as a Harvard undergraduate was one of Facebook's first several hundred users, attended the university at the same time as Facebook's founders and has quickly cultivated relationships across the Valley.</p><p>  Ms. Harris, a Bay Area native, has raised the most of any 2020 candidate in the first quarter from employees of companies in the Internet Association, a lobbying arm of the tech industry in Washington D.C., according to an analysis of federal records.</p><p>  Yet all have expressed concerns about Big Tech's dominance.</p><p>  Mr. Buttigieg recently went on record in support of Mr. Hughes's call to break up Facebook, saying his old schoolmate had ''made a very convincing case'' about ''these tech companies as monopoly giants.''</p><p>  ''There needs to be tools to deal with that, up to and including preventing or reversing mergers,'' Mr. Buttigieg said in a recent podcast.</p><p>  Going back several years, Mr. Booker has questioned the dominance of companies including Google and Amazon. In a recent interview with The Times, Mr. Booker said he was planning to roll out an internet security platform and has deepening concerns about companies ''able to use your data for your profit.'' But when asked about Ms. Warren's demand that big tech firms be broken up, he replied in a recent television appearance, ''That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say.''</p><p>  In the Senate, Ms. Harris aggressively questioned Facebook executives last year, and this year she said on CNN that government officials ''need to take a serious look at breaking up Facebook.''</p><p>  Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Market Institute, who previously worked for the Senate Budget Committee under Mr. Sanders and is a critic of the consolidation of power in the tech industry, said there were differences in the deference that candidates gave to Silicon Valley leaders.</p><p>  ''Buttigieg and Harris treat them like they're special,'' Mr. Stoller said. ''Warren treats them as they're just citizens. Booker goes back and forth.''</p><p>  Ali Partovi, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Booker, said he sees no evidence that donors are dissuaded by talk about a crackdown on Big Tech.</p><p>  ''I find that people vote and donate in service of their principles and beliefs about what they think is right, not just their self-interest,'' Mr. Partovi said.</p><p>  The tech economy remains a crucial source of funds for congressional Democrats, too.</p><p>  Later this month, Ms. Pelosi will collect checks at a San Francisco law firm that has represented tech companies, asking for as much as $19,600 to help seven of her vulnerable California colleagues.

This week we look ahead to Donald Trump\u2019s visit to India next Monday, where a limited trade deal may (or may not) be signed. </p><p>In other news, the US trade representative\u2019s office chose late on a Friday evening to drop the news that it would increase tariffs on plane imports. It held back from bumping up tariffs on cheese, wine and other delicious imports, though, much to the relief of European officials (and all of us who live in DC).</p><p>Our Person in the News this week is Lord Elgin, of Elgin Marbles fame, as Greece, among other nations, has persuaded the EU to add a \u201cMarbles\u201d clause to the draft of the bloc\u2019s demands for a post-Brexit trade agreement. Meanwhile, the chart of the day highlights the rise in US duties collected from imports over the year to January, according to new figures released last week by the administration. </p><p>Don\u2019t forget to click here if you\u2019d like to receive Trade Secrets every Monday to Thursday. And we want to hear from you. Send any thoughts to , or email me at .</p><p>Restoration of preferential trade terms would be a big prize for India </p><p>Donald Trump is making the first visit of his presidency to Delhi next Monday. White House and state department aides will no doubt be hoping that he\u00a0keeps any boasting of his dealmaking prowess strictly in the realm of the trade (mini) deal.</p><p>Last summer, Trump caused dismay in Washington and chagrin in Delhi when he offered to step in and help solve the decades-old territorial dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir \u2014 a move seen as a foreign policy faux pas from a sitting US president. Moreover, Trump\u2019s claim that Indian prime minister Narendra Modi asked him for help on the issue was swiftly \u2014 and embarrassingly publicly \u2014 contradicted by Delhi, which has long insisted that it will\u00a0talk directly about\u00a0Kashmir only with Islamabad, with no foreign help required, thank you.</p><p>On the subject of trade, though, Trump\u2019s much-vaunted dealmaking impulses might serve him better. Trade watchers in Washington are cautiously hoping a limited trade deal could be signed by Modi and Trump as part of the visit. Drafts of a deal are being exchanged, according to a person familiar with the talks, while Robert\u00a0Lighthizer, the US trade representative, had multiple calls with his Indian counterpart last week. It\u2019s\u00a0still not\u00a0clear\u00a0whether something could be signed on Monday \u2014 but even a mini-deal could ease growing trade tension between the two countries.</p><p>Trade woes began in earnest in 2018 with US tariffs on steel and aluminium, which hit India hard and prompted it to file a series of retaliatory duties\u00a0with the World Trade Organization (which it\u00a0did not levy until last year). The US obsession with trade deficits has also pained Delhi. At $23.3bn in 2019, India has only the 11th largest trade deficit with the US, but has still come under pressure to reduce it. This has perplexed\u00a0Indian officials, who argue that the\u00a0deficit is paltry compared with China\u2019s.</p><p>The US\u2019s seemingly punitive withdrawal of preferential trade terms from India last summer twisted the knife into the\u00a0trading relationship. After public consultation, the Trump administration removed India from the Generalized System of Preferences, or GSP, list \u2014 that let it sell goods duty-free into the US on account of it being a developing economy.\u00a0</p><p>US officials argued that, to be on the list, a country has to provide \u201cequitable and reasonable\u201d access to its markets for US companies \u2014 something they said India did not provide. India quickly hit back, applying retaliatory tariffs it had\u00a0lodged with the WTO on 28 US products, including apples, walnuts and almonds.</p><p>So what might progress look like? If any sort of deal is finalised next week,\u00a0the thorniest issues will probably\u00a0be ignored, as ever. The big prize for India is the restoration of its preferential trade terms. To achieve this, US officials will probably argue that America should see benefits equivalent to the same value, either through tariff reduction or an Indian pledge to buy more America-manufactured goods.</p><p>The latter option is easier: India has increasingly been buying US weapons, with a breakthrough security agreement signed in late 2018 unlocking sales of high-tech military equipment. It has bought about $15bn worth of equipment over the past decade, and more talks are under way. It could in theory promise to buy more liquid natural gas from the US too, allowing\u00a0Trump to claim a win for an industry he is keen to boost.\u00a0 </p><p>Purchase pledges aside, US trade watchers are expecting a compromise on\u00a0a tussle over duties on medical devices. Indian price controls on coronary stents and knee implants have\u00a0irked American companies, which have been complaining that Indian regulators also blocked them from immediately withdrawing their products from the market in response to those tariffs. In a report, US trade officials said this left manufacturers selling their products at a loss for a year and a half.</p><p>Extra agricultural access to the Indian market is high on the US wishlist, but it is unclear whether this can be resolved through only a limited deal. The US wants better access\u00a0for its dairy goods in particular, but for religious and cultural reasons India requires that cattle are fed only vegetarian food. American milk and dairy producers were among those agitating for India\u2019s removal from the GSP list.</p><p>Intellectual property, data localisation rules and ecommerce regulations\u00a0that discriminate against foreign companies are among the hard-to-resolve issues, and unlikely to end up on a list of easy wins. The US is concerned about India\u2019s tough\u00a0patent laws, as well as demands that companies operating there store data on local servers.</p><p>But despite the difficulties, the US is trying to make\u00a0headway given India\u2019s geostrategic importance.\u00a0The countries\u00a0have significantly increased their diplomatic and military co-operation in recent decades as Washington\u00a0searches for regional allies in countering China.</p><p>US officials have said Trump will visit India regardless of whether there is a deal to sign, but big new purchase commitments will be high on the White House wishlist.</p><p>Watch this space.</p><p>Charted waters</p><p>Tariff coverage widened in September to include a wide range of consumer goods. Trump\u2019s approach on trade has been a yo-yo-like alternation between confrontation and conciliation \u2014 the former designed to display toughness and force concessions, with the latter aimed at soothing the markets and keeping business hopeful that agreements can be reached. But the president\u2019s trade wars have not been \u201ceasy to win\u201d.</p><p>Person in the news</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who is it? </emphasis></p><p>Lord Elgin, former British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why are they in the news? </emphasis></p><p>Greece, among other nations, has successfully persuaded the EU to add an \u201cElgin Marbles\u201d clause to the draft of its demands for a post-Brexit trade agreement.</p><p>The Elgin Marbles, also known as the Parthenon sculptures, were removed from Athens and shipped to England by Lord Elgin in the early 19th century, and are now housed at the British Museum in London.</p><p>Greece has demanded their return since it gained independence in 1832. As recently as January, Greek culture minister Lina Mendoni said Britain\u2019s exit from Europe might help create the \u201cright conditions\u201d for the \u201cpermanent return\u201d of the sculptures. </p><p>The clause does not mention the sculptures specifically, and says only that both sides \u201caddress issues relating to the return or restitution of unlawfully removed cultural objects to their countries of origin\u201d. Greek authorities have denied news reports that return of the statues was a condition of a trade deal.

Regulation might eventually slow a behemoth such as Facebook down, but the promise of it will stop would-be competitors dead in their tracks.</p><p>But if the threat of regulation from without is something big tech has learnt to turn to its own advantage, the same can't be said of threats from within.</p><p>This past month, both Google and Oracle have learnt that dealing with activist employees can be a whole lot tricker than dealing with regulators, if only because regulators, almost by definition, tend to follow well-understood rules of engagement.</p><p>Last week, an unknown number of Oracle employees walked off the job, alarmed that the company's co-founder and executive chairman, Larry Ellison, was cosying up too much to the man ultimately in charge of all US regulators, President Donald Trump.</p><p>Ellison, the world's fifth- or seventh-richest person depending on Oracle's share price, (and also its fifth- or seventh-richest man, since everyone in the top 10 is male) has been raising funds for Trump's re-election, which doesn't sit easy with all of Oracle's usually apolitical staff.</p><p>Although \"walked off the job\" is probably too strong a phrase for what happened. Such is the nature of many technology jobs nowadays that many employees don't have a job site to walk off, much less a union to help organise such an action.</p><p>They work from home, or remotely from another country, and Oracle's Employees for Ethics strike (which can't really be called a strike, either) was more of a log-off than a walk-off: a fact which gives us a clue as to how big tech companies might approach the problem of employee activism. But don't let me give away the ending.</p><p>Google's employee activism problems are a little more endemic than Oracle's, at least in part because many of its staff joined the company before it abandoned its morals and changed its company motto from \"Don't be evil\" to \"Do the right thing\" - a slogan that could be asking anything of its employees, including that they crack down on would-be activists and union organisers (which they have been doing dutifully), or that they throw their litter in the bins provided.</p><p>Some of Google's employees stand apart from its management on a number of issues, including: Google's willingness to build secret, censored versions of its search engine for the Chinese market; its participation in a secret drone program that uses Google's artificial intelligence for airborne surveillance; and more recently on the question of whether <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Google should be supplying technology to US Customs and Border Protection</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, which has been implementing Trump policy of separating children from their parents at the USA's southern border.</p><p>Where the company once famously welcomed dissent from within, it's now suppressing it.</p><p>An investigation <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/18/magazine/google-revolt.html\">published last week by the New York Times</url> revealed that Google has hired consultants who specialise in preventing the workforce from organising, and that it has fired employees who speak out.</p><p>But there's an easier solution to the question of what to do with employees who grow a conscience and question your lack of ethics, and it's a solution that big tech is uniquely well-placed to implement.</p><p>You don't have staff. At least, not human staff.</p><p>Amazon, with its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/robots-don-t-destroy-jobs-they-create-them-amazon-20190502-p51jdj\">robots-instead-of-humans policy</url>, has been leading the way for years, but it may be too far out ahead of the pack to serve as a good example.</p><p>A better example might be the one set by Uber, which has staff that it refuses to give any rights to - including the right to be called an \"employee\", rendering moot the question of employee activism - and which it plans to replace with robot drivers, just as soon as the technology allows it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520242461</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8S-R4R1-DY19-C2W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"837\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It will be even harder for European banks to earn their cost of equity.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In late 2019, the Stoxx600 index of European banks is stuck in almost the same trough it fell in to in the depths of the eurozone crisis. The ECB's new policy of only charging for a relatively small tier of reserves did little to offset the impact of a widely expected rate cut in September.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The vast majority of European bank stocks are now trading firmly below book value; a clear signal from the market that the sector needs to shrink. Research by financial institution specialist Algebris Investments recently lamented that the cumulative market capitalization of the top 25 European banks has slumped to roughly the same as just one big US bank: JPMorgan.\u00a0</p><p>In investment banking, the picture is worse. As Kepler Cheuvreux recently noted, the combined market capitalization of four of Europe's biggest investment banking champions \"\" Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS \"\" is less than the smallest of the three big American universal banks, Citi.</p><p>Even in their home region, it is an achievement if a European firm is a top-five fee earner in the Dealogic league tables. Over the last five years, US banks' market share in investment banking and trading in Europe has risen nine percentage points to 40%, according to Oliver Wyman.\u00a0</p><p>At the same time, Europe's share of the global fee pool has declined, while European banks' share in North America has fallen from about a third to a fifth.\u00a0</p><p> We should have a few pan-European diversified banking models, the JPMorgan, Bank of America, or Citi of Europe\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Oud\u00e9a, Societe Generale</p><p>European bank chief executives have never been so open about their limitations. Jean Pierre Mustier, UniCredit's chief executive and the new president of the European Banking Federation (EBF), notes that investment banking commissions in the US are two or three times higher than in Europe, while retail interchange fees are also twice as high in the US.\u00a0</p><p>\"US banks operate in a much bigger and more profitable market, and on top of that we have negative rates,\" Mustier tells Euromoney. \"European banks are at a competitive disadvantage versus US banks. [European banks'] profitability will probably barely match their cost of capital, as the European market is still fragmented between countries. European banks don't have the scale to reach the profitability of the US, which is a quasi-monopolistic market.\"\u00a0</p><p>But is all this pessimism myopic? After all, European banks have not always been less profitable, lower valued and smaller than their US peers. They are also arguably ahead of global rivals in the crucial new area of digital banking and in their success as cross-border retail banks.</p><p>Looking through Euromoney's back issues shows that in 1980, half of the world's top 10 banks by assets were European, compared with three today. None of them are in the top five.\u00a0</p><p>The net income then of two UK banks \"\" Barclays and NatWest (now part of Royal Bank of Scotland) \"\" far surpassed that of any US rival. Three of the top five banks by equity were European, including the biggest, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.</p><p>JPMorgan's global investment banking hegemony and group financial outperformance is also relatively new. During most of the early and mid 2000s, return on equity in the high teens and early 20s at France's Societe Generale was way ahead of JPMorgan Chase \"\" until rogue trader J\u00e9r\u00c3\u00b4me Kerviel reversed its fortunes in 2007.</p><p>In the decades to come, can European banks reclaim a dominant role in global banking?</p><p>Societe Generale's chief executive Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Oud\u00e9a, Mustier's predecessor at the EBF, describes a vision to Euromoney in which there are more European banks with a balance sheet of around \u00e2,\u00ac2 trillion, similar in size to the big US universal banks and compared with around \u00e2,\u00ac1.3 trillion at SocGen today.\u00a0</p><p>\"We should have a few pan-European diversified banking models, the JPMorgan, Bank of America, or Citi of Europe \"\" multi-local banks with a strong foothold and a broader base in retail, with corporate and investment banking, and perhaps asset management,\" says Oud\u00e9a.</p><p>Even JPMorgan is humble enough to recognize that the permanency of its dominance is not guaranteed.\u00a0</p><p>\"I would suggest that this whole notion of the retreat of the European banks has been very much overplayed,\" JPMorgan EMEA chief executive Viswas Raghavan told the audience at Euromoney's Awards for Excellence dinner this year.</p><p>The September ECB rate saw the culmination of fears that Europe is heading towards Japanese-style long-term economic stagnation, as aging populations and high debt levels \"\" now combined with rising economic nationalism \"\" translate into a large but hobbled banking industry.\u00a0  </p><p/><p>Over the last 20 years, Japan's banking sector lost over a quarter of its net interest income, according to Deutsche Bank research. This caused returns at Japanese banks to halve from high single digits \"\" what European banks typically earn today \"\" to low single digits.\u00a0</p><p>Mainly thanks to French and German clients, eurozone loan growth appears relatively robust today. But the price of credit started to fall in 2019. That's crucial, as net interest income typically makes up about 60% of a bank's revenues. Falling interest rate expectations are already eating into banks' investment yields; even Greek five-year bond yields have fallen below their US equivalents.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, the consensus among analysts is that tiering alone will not amount to a meaningful offset to ultra-loose monetary conditions and that the ECB is only following the Bank of Japan as it introduces a tiered system.\u00a0</p><p>\"Negative rates are killing the banks,\" says Alastair Ryan, bank analyst at Bank of America.\u00a0</p><p>He sees little prospect of positive rates, so he says European banks \"\" which are built on deposits and deposit income \"\" could get progressively weaker, especially as income from their rate-hedging portfolios falls.\u00a0</p><p>To further mitigate the hit, the ECB could embark on fiscal-like responses such as purchasing more private-sector assets, purchasing a higher proportion of peripheral government bonds and perhaps even buying senior unsecured bank debt.\u00a0'Fresh air'</p><p>As Brexit and the US-China trade war push the German economy towards a recession, calls for a fiscal response are also growing, even in Berlin.\u00a0</p><p>Due to its size and presence in international wholesale banking, BNP Paribas is a top contender for European champion status. Yet chief executive Jean-Laurent Bonnaf\u00e9 calculates that the eurozone's lag to the US interest rate cycle costs his bank roughly \u00e2,\u00ac2 billion in annual profit.\u00a0</p><p>\"Markets and banks are overflowing with liquidity,\" Bonnaf\u00e9 tells Euromoney. \"It's why margins are under pressure in retail, corporate banking, or [the small and medium-sized enterprise sector].\"\u00a0  </p><p>BNP Paribas chief executive Jean-Laurent Bonnaf\u00e9</p><p/><p>Nevertheless, Bonnaf\u00e9 says the new ECB executive board taking over on October 31 \"\" led by former French finance minister and IMF managing director Christine Lagarde \"\" brings \"fresh air\" that could boost the health of banks in time, even to the extent that mergers become more of a possibility.\u00a0</p><p>Davide Serra, founder and chief executive of Algebris Investments, and a long-standing European banking expert, agrees on both points. He says the three or four percentage-point lag of European banks' returns on equity versus US peers is more or less exactly the hit to European banks' net income from the difference in monetary policy rates \"\" between about $50 billion and $60 billion a year on an aggregate basis.\u00a0</p><p>\"If you were to normalize the rate environment, then European banks are already as profitable as US banks,\" says Serra.\u00a0</p><p>This could indicate that European banks are just as well managed as their US peers.\u00a0</p><p>But even if rates stay negative, Serra says the ECB under Lagarde and vice-president Luis de Guindos (both former politicians) will be \"more pragmatic, less academic\" on the regulatory front.\u00a0</p><p>Former governor Mario Draghi's combination of higher capital requirements with negative rates and quantitative easing has been a debilitating remedy for banks. Serra thinks the mandate under Lagarde is tilting towards stimulating growth, not just simply saving the euro and stabilizing the banks.</p><p>In contrast to previous communications from the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, the ECB has not yet been able to declare that the eurozone's banking sector (as opposed to its currency) has stabilized, says BofA's Ryan. Aside from the sector's poor valuations, many banks still look dicey. The ECB's introduction of new deadlines for full provisioning of non-performing loans is one indicator that the accumulation of new burdens has not ended.\u00a0</p><p>Weak capital structures, such as deferred tax assets, are another concern for the ECB. Deutsche Bank, which has only just embarked on a new, more radical restructuring, remains as a systemic risk. Persistent negative rates hit German banks especially hard.</p><p>The Basel committee's move to standardize risk-weighting calculations is a further hit to the structured finance businesses, traditionally important for the European banks.\u00a0</p><p>The EBA calculated in August that implementation of Basel III in the EU implies an aggregate capital shortfall of \u00e2,\u00ac135 billion. The burden can be spread over seven or eight years, but it will still limit what banks can do with their earnings.\u00a0</p><p>Yet Serra thinks that the ECB could at least change its policy of trapping capital in the banks by constantly asking for more capital under its Targeted Review of Internal Models \"\" effectively assuming banks must be taking more risk if they increase profits. This restricts dividend pay-out ratios to a much greater extent than is the case in the US under the Fed.\u00a0</p><p>\"It doesn't matter how profitable you are, the regulator claims the profit,\" says Serra. \"That's why they've made the sector uninvestable.\"\u00a0</p><p> The problem is not the way European banks are managed, it's Europe\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Ana Bot\u00c3\u00adn,\u00a0Santander </p><p>What's worse, Serra adds, is that below book-share valuations \"\" partly a reflection of Europe-specific regulatory requirements \"\" hurts economic growth even more, causing a vicious circle, as banks respond by lending less. The ECB could alleviate this relatively easily by easing capital requirements, Serra argues.</p><p>Casper von Koskull, departing chief executive of Nordea, holds a similar kernel of hope for change. He has tried to position Scandinavia's biggest bank to be in a better long-term position for a future wave of pan-European mergers.\u00a0</p><p>\"Weak banks won't determine their own fate if consolidation happens,\" he told Euromoney earlier this year. \"Which company will drive a consolidating business? The one that's valued higher.\"</p><p>But von Koskull thinks the ECB's Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), created in 2014, has kept too tight a leash on what stronger banks can do, unnecessarily holding them back. The supervisor should \"allow the strong ones to be stronger,\" not least by permitting banks with healthy capital and profit to have higher pay-out ratios, which would boost their market capitalization, even if putting a stop on pay-outs by weaker banks is justified.</p><p>Von Koskull says supervisors in the US are rightly more liberal in this sense, by allowing banks more of a free rein on what to do with excess capital if they pass the Federal Reserve's stress tests.\u00a0</p><p>\"In Europe, you're holding back the strong banks to wait for the weak ones to catch up,\" he says.Unions</p><p>Beyond the odd regulatory tweak, however, are there any more fundamental reasons for longer-term optimism in Europe's banks?\u00a0</p><p>Many bank chiefs point to the potential for Europe to forge much deeper banking and capital market unions, spurring bigger and more successful cross-European groups.\u00a0</p><p>The basic problem, according to many in the industry, is that the top US banks have a much larger share of regional industry profit than their European equivalents, partly thanks to a more rapid and decisive post-2008 restructuring of the sector.\u00a0</p><p>Over the last three years, the ECB's SSM has been criticized for putting off merger candidates by demanding that any deal must come with a capital raising attached.\u00a0</p><p>According to von Koskull, banks such as Nordea, which was created from mergers of lenders with large market shares in four Nordic markets around the turn of the century, are proof that cross-border consolidation of big universal banks in Europe can work.\u00a0</p><p>As an EU institution, the SSM may be naturally inclined to favour cross-border mergers within Europe. Yet the lack of political consensus among individual member states on building complementary common deposit insurance schemes is a big disincentive for banks.\u00a0</p><p>\"We are paying the cost of banking union without the benefits \"\" 11% of net income to the Single Resolution Fund, on top of all the taxes you can imagine,\" Oud\u00e9a grumbles.\u00a0</p><p>Crucially, national regulators, even in the eurozone, still make it hard for cross-border banks to move capital within their groups. Unlike the ECB, these national regulators are naturally disposed to dislike it when a group based elsewhere turns a country subsidiary into a mere branch, even if this would greatly benefit the group's efficiency on a European level.\u00a0  </p><p> Executive chairman Ana Bot\u00c3\u00adn</p><p/><p>Santander's executive chairman Ana Bot\u00c3\u00adn sums up the challenges when she explains why more banks like hers will not take the plunge and embark on a bolder strategy of pan-eurozone acquisitions.\u00a0</p><p>\"The problem is not the way European banks are managed, it's Europe,\" she says. \"Europe is not an integrated market. If I want to grow in Europe, I can't move money from Germany to the Nordics.\"</p><p>In this sense, European banks are in an even worse position than their equivalents in Japan, which is at least a properly unified banking market.\u00a0</p><p>According to Serra and others, European policy makers may ultimately have no choice but to strengthen the banking union, as it is a necessary part of monetary transmission.\u00a0</p><p>\"Unless the banking system is healthy, the economy can't be healthy,\" says Serra.  </p><p>Societe Generale chief executive Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Oud\u00e9a</p><p/><p>Oud\u00e9a is also unusually optimistic about the imminent prospect of the eurozone coming to an agreement on a common deposit-guarantee scheme. That's partly because he says it has a low political cost relative to other European integration projects and partly because a more internationally assertive China and diplomatic divergence from the US should focus minds on the need for European champions</p><p>Oud\u00e9a thinks progress on the scheme, and technological enablers, could allow banks to engage in consolidation in anticipation of bigger and better integrated European capital markets.\u00a0</p><p>\"I don't see why a large integrated European market shouldn't look like the US market,\" he says. \"The intellectual construction [of the Capital Markets Union] was to have a market with harmonized rules, deeper capital markets and to mimic a US-style system, which is more balanced between capital markets and banks.\"</p><p>Bonnaf\u00e9 adds that bigger and more integrated capital markets are key, as Europe's banking industry needs more than just higher rates to close the market-cap gap to the big US banks.\u00a0</p><p>\"You need to provide for an additional buffer of profitability,\" he says, noting that European banks' cost of equity will also rise if ECB rates rise. \"The most challenging element \"\" as it's in the DNA of how banks evolve in continental Europe \"\" is to have a Capital Markets Union that is relevant and well-managed.\"\u00a0</p><p>According to Bonnaf\u00e9, the situation for European banks would be very different if they were able to sell assets to the capital markets more efficiently, like the big US banks.\u00a0</p><p>\"The reality of Europe is that three quarters of the economy is financed on banks' balance sheets and one quarter on markets, whereas in the US it's the reverse,\" he says. \"You can reduce balance sheet size, free up equity and keep the same market share.\"</p><p>Some of BNP Paribas' businesses are already quite concentrated at a European level, with market shares of between 8% and 10%. Bonnaf\u00e9 points to consumer finance, fixed income, securities services, trade finance and cash management. But he says that's not the case in its domestic retail banks, which are harder to integrate into a single back office because of local differences, especially in regulation.</p><p> It took the US 50 years to develop its capital markets. We can imagine in 20 years we can fix it\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Jean-Laurent Bonnaf\u00e9, BNP Paribas</p><p>As things stand, a bank with \"a decent market share\" on a pan-European scale, \"would need an incredible amount of equity and liquidity,\" says Bonnaf\u00e9. By contrast, if US banks kept a similar volume of mortgages to the European banks on their balance sheets, \"the returns would be dramatically lower.\"\u00a0</p><p>Bonnaf\u00e9 notes that BNP Paribas, which is the eurozone's biggest bank by assets, has a market share of about 4.5% across all businesses in the eurozone and a similar size of balance sheet to Bank of America, which has a market share of about 10% in the US.\u00a0</p><p>If a bank like BNP Paribas were to buy another big bank to increase its eurozone-wide market share, it would therefore need to pay a much higher Financial Stability Board buffer for global systemic risk.</p><p>As the UK was the driving force behind the Capital Markets Union, Brexit and the related departure of European Commissioner for financial markets Jonathan Hill, has caused an important hiatus in this project.\u00a0</p><p>Nevertheless, Bonnaf\u00e9 hopes the EU's capital markets integration efforts will restart under this autumn's new college of European Commissioners. It could take three years to have new CMU regulation to facilitate the production of new assets and, therefore, five years for it to have a big impact on business.\u00a0</p><p>\"It took the US 50 years to develop its capital markets,\" he says. \"We can imagine in 20 years we can fix it.\"</p><p>Widespread acceptance of the necessity of this project is vital and the EU's governance makes it easy for dissenting voices to block such projects.\u00a0</p><p>\"There needs to be a consensus,\" says Bonnaf\u00e9. \"Some national banking supervisors in continental Europe are reluctant about markets as they are concerned that it's too risky.\"Challenges</p><p>Not everyone is convinced, however, about the near-term prospects of either the banking or markets union projects. The European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) is nowhere near the top of the agenda at the European Commission, having been relegated to the \"~too-hard-not-urgent' bucket, says BofA's Ryan.\u00a0  </p><p> Jean Pierre Mustier, UniCredit's chief executive</p><p/><p>UniCredit's Mustier is especially sceptical that completion of the banking union, including a pan-European deposit insurance scheme, can be the trigger for a new wave of big cross-border mergers on the continent any time soon \"\" even if Europe does agree a common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund.\u00a0</p><p>\"The risk profile of European banks is too different today to allow for such a convergence,\" he says.</p><p>Mustier knows the challenges better than most as the German regulator's blocking of capital flows within UniCredit, which owns Germany's third-biggest private bank, is the best-known example of intragroup capital and liquidity controls in Europe.\u00a0</p><p>In fact, Mustier thinks UniCredit can work well enough without EDIS. The bank is affected by what he sees as a generally misplaced focus by European policymakers up to now.\u00a0</p><p>\"Europe's banking and capital markets union needs to be looked at from the investor not the issuer point of view,\" he argues. \"We need to make sure we have seen from the investor's point of view a true unified and consistent financial sector in Europe, not a sum of domestic markets.\u00a0</p><p>\"What's important for the financial sector in Europe is to have more depth to attract more investment in European banks' equity or bonds.\"\u00a0</p><p> European banks have lost the battle in corporate and investment banking\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Jean Pierre Mustier, UniCredit</p><p>Mustier still thinks Europe needs bigger banks, especially in Germany and on the corporate side. At the same time, he thinks the sector must recognize its limits.\u00a0</p><p>\"European banks have lost the battle in corporate and investment banking,\" he says.\u00a0</p><p>Europe's corporate and investment banks can still compete in the euro market \"\" mostly in financing, including equity capital markets. But they cannot, as some imagine, post even low single-digit revenue growth.\u00a0</p><p>\"Cash management is the new derivative,\" is one of Mustier's favourite quips \"\" typically provocative, and perhaps reflecting his own move to UniCredit as well as the change in European banking.</p><p>Even Societe Generale is today, like UniCredit, focusing more on transaction banking rather than solely on the strength in derivatives that drove SocGen's corporate and investment bank when Mustier ran it.\u00a0</p><p>He says this does not necessarily mean European banks are bad investments, as there is plenty they can do to help themselves.\u00a0</p><p>Now others, most importantly Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, are following Mustier's decision at UniCredit in the early 2010s to exit cash equities and instead pool resources with Kepler Cheuvreux.\u00a0</p><p>\"When you realize that the game is lost and act to make sure you have critical size, and maintain credibility, it's initially painful, but it's necessary,\" says Mustier.</p><p>Philippe Brassac, chief executive of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA, the mutual group's listed arm, admits to Euromoney that there is no chance his group will regain its position as the world's biggest bank. The US's 1994 removal of the Depression-era prohibition on bank acquisitions across state borders and, more recently, the growth of China, have removed such a possibility.</p><p>\"We have to do miracles with financing the economy,\" says Brassac.\u00a0</p><p>He doubts policymakers will be able to fulfil their role of creating the regulatory environment needed for Europe's capital markets to take off.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's more difficult in Europe than in China, Japan or the USA, as Europe is not a country,\" Brassac continues. \"Europe is a place of permanent multilateral negotiation. This is why countries always look at their national banks, so it's impossible to contemplate mergers between different countries.\"\u00a0</p><p>What more can European banks do other than accept their limits?\u00a0</p><p>Huge efforts have not brought most European bank shares above book value. UniCredit has made particularly impressive progress since 2017 in reducing costs and bad debt, and boosting capital, yet it trades at about 40% of its book value.\u00a0</p><p>\"The case for European banks is not easy, compared to US banks,\" admits Mustier. \"Investors want share value that grows, and a dividend yield that is stable to growing, and that's what we intend to deliver. You need to make sure you have stable net earnings \"\" reliable and credible \"\" and that you're properly de-risked, so that investors buy into your recurring profitability.\"</p><p>There is, therefore, solace even in Europe's relatively harsh regulatory environment.\u00a0</p><p>\"I welcome the current regulation and I want to have more,\" Mustier says. (However, he adds that the many global and European regulators should improve their understanding of the combined effect of their various capital demands.)</p><p>\"Our cost of capital needs to go down,\" says Mustier. \"The market perception is that banks need to be less risky. A higher capital buffer means that you're seen as a safer bank, meaning cost of capital should be lower and this should be positive for the share performance.</p><p>\"Size is not an answer. It's just about lowering the cost of the product. You need to have a very industrial approach to banking today. The times of very high profitability are behind us. You don't need to spend hours defining the strategy. Do you believe you can make more than your cost of capital? If the answer is no, the strategy is simple: de-risk the bank, optimize the cost base and make sure you have recurring earnings while having a risk profile that will lower your cost of capital.\"Digitalization</p><p>Is all the hand-wringing in European banking about regional fragmentation and lost global wholesale banking share missing the point?\u00a0</p><p>Some European banks, it could be argued, are already global leaders in retail banking. Given their exposure to emerging markets, some could even offer a more promising growth trajectory than the big US banks.</p><p>Digitalization is now probably the single biggest challenge facing the banking industry everywhere. The big tech companies, whose financial services potential banks fear so much, are either American or Chinese. But it is not at all clear that US banks are ahead of European banks on the digital front. In fact, in retail the opposite is true.\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps this should even be expected, given that the UK, Scandinavia and the Netherlands are ahead of the US in terms of their populations' access to the internet and transitioning to a cashless society.\u00a0</p><p>Greater wariness about issuing new banking licenses may also have hampered fintech competition and innovation in the US.</p><p>\"I certainly think we are ahead of the American banks when it comes to a lot of the technology applied in consumer and normal commercial banking,\" says Ralph Hamers, chief executive of Dutch bank ING. \"This is where we feel we are and should continue to be leading. Investment banking doesn't fit us at ING. We've tried it with Barings [the British investment bank ING bought for \u00a31 in 1995]. It just didn't fit our culture.\"</p><p>Spain's BBVA is another reference point for banks around the world with digital aspirations, largely because of its international expansion, including the US.\u00a0</p><p>\"I don't think that the US banks are ahead in the digital race,\" BBVA's executive chairman, Carlos Torres Vila, tells Euromoney. \"We have the best mobile banking app in the world, according to Forrester, for two years in a row. If you look at the performance of our mobile banking app, even in the US, it's the best on many dimensions. We have the highest penetration of digital banking customers in the US, and so on.\"</p><p>Europe's digital banking competitiveness may be both a cause and a result of a greater urgency and ability to find ways to expand abroad.</p><p>The core of Hamers' strategy is transforming ING so that its operations are more easily transferrable across borders, so it has greater ability to reap growth and economies of scale, firstly in retail banking. He cites ING's online-only retail businesses in countries such as Germany and Spain, but also outside Europe, as in Australia.</p><p>\"Where Europeans have to be more inventive than the Americans is in creating cross-border scale, because there are still borders in Europe and there are none in America,\" he argues. \"The Americans don't have that urgency. They have a big chunk of domestic banking revenues in a market with a positive rate environment, where they can have a much more stable income base, on the back of which they can build their more volatile investment banking business.\"</p><p>It's a similar story at BBVA.\u00a0</p><p>\"Retail banking has always been a local business, and even today there's a big element of locality in the solutions we provide our customers, but, in a large part because of digital, the solutions to the problems work everywhere,\" says Torres Vila.\u00a0</p><p>\"The fundamental problems that people have around money are universal. The solutions have been local until now, because of the legacy of payment systems, the legacy of regulation and habits.\u00a0</p><p>\"As we reinvent the solutions to the same problems \"\" leveraging technology and data \"\" the reinvention is universal. It applies to the same problem; it works everywhere. If we have good flow in a mobile banking app for a money transfers, that works everywhere. We don't need to reinvent it.\"</p><p>According to Torres Vila, this means that in countries such as Colombia, Peru and Paraguay, where the competition is mostly local, rival banks' capacity to invest in digital solutions is far more limited. BBVA's banks in those markets, however, can benefit from the combined resources and expertise of its operations in Mexico, Spain, Turkey and the US.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're moving much more to a global organization in terms of how we develop solutions for clients and how we deploy those solutions everywhere else. That's the idea,\" concludes Torres Vila. \"We're not there yet, but we're making big strides towards that globality.\"Spain</p><p>European banks' better internationalization of retail and commercial banking operations has deep roots, especially in Spain. Partly because of links to Latin America, the Spanish are the only banks for which big retail banking share in more than one large economy is unquestionably core to their strategy. Neither BBVA in Mexico nor Santander in Brazil face the kinds of questions that Citi does about its big commercial bank in Mexico.</p><p>Other European but not US banks have retail operations straddling medium-sized economies \"\" notably HSBC, roughly half of whose profit comes from Hong Kong, another colonial legacy.</p><p>Alongside BNP Paribas, Santander is often cited as a possible European banking champion, but it is one that \"\" like BBVA and ING \"\" is more focused on retail banking.\u00a0</p><p>By market capitalization, it is the biggest bank in continental Europe, and about a quarter bigger than BNP Paribas, although still about half the market cap of HSBC. Santander only has about 2% of eurozone deposits.</p><p>Compared with BNP Paribas, Santander is as much a Latin American as a European bank. The bank carved out a Europe division this year, with the regional country heads now reporting to its former Polish country head, Gerry Byrne, rather than directly to the chief executive.</p><p>Santander also has greater ambitions to use technology to bolster its status as the world's leading cross-border retail bank.\u00a0</p><p>It announced a plan earlier this year to increase investment in IT to the extent that it will be the third-biggest bank in the world in terms of its tech spending. Most of its investment in its mobile phone apps is reusable in other countries, including those in Europe.\u00a0</p><p>\"We believe we can leverage our scale to support more customers across Europe,\" executive chairman Bot\u00c3\u00adn tells Euromoney.</p><p>According to Bot\u00c3\u00adn, however, rather than buying a big bank in Italy or France \"\" or stepping into the Commerzbank bidding process \"\" Santander's vehicle for cross-border European expansion today is Openbank, the digital-only Spanish lender it relaunched in 2017 piloting a fully cloud-based IT infrastructure.\u00a0</p><p>Europe, for Santander, is therefore not the be-all and end-all: which is perhaps the key for any outperforming European bank.\u00a0</p><p>Although the continent still accounts for about 70% of the bank's loans, Europe fell back to a minority of Santander's profit last year, despite its 2017 purchase of Spain's Banco Popular.\u00a0</p><p>The impact of Brexit on Santander UK and the tentative recovery of its US business could accentuate that shift.\u00a0 Bonds aren't the answer for Europe's SMEs, says Mustier</p><p>How excited is UniCredit chief executive Jean Pierre Mustier, recently appointed president of the European Banking Federation, about the chances of Europe replicating the US system and replacing businesses' reliance on bank borrowing with bonds?\u00a0</p><p>Not much, it seems \"\" despite the European Commission's efforts in this direction.</p><p>The tiny volumes of the mini-bond market are less than overwhelming. Of much greater concern in continental Europe and especially Italy is the underdevelopment of venture capital and public equity markets.\u00a0</p><p>\"There's massive underinvestment,\" he says. \"We need more startups in Italy to create jobs; we need to invest more. Who can provide the capital?</p><p>\"Capital Markets Union 1.0 has not delivered because it was based on the wrong assumption, to cut the borrowers from the lenders. That's not what you need to do in Europe.\u00a0</p><p>\"If you spend some time with a European SME, you understand that they are usually too small to access capital markets by issuing bonds and they do not need long-term bullet funding.\u00a0</p><p>\"They need working capital financing, leasing, and if they need long-term financing, it's amortizing and on very specific terms. The banks are very willing to lend, as in a low-growth environment their clients are not borrowing much.\u00a0</p><p>\"What startups and SMEs need first in Europe is access to equity capital, which is much scarcer than in the US and Asia\"\u00a6 We are very happy to lend more, but we lend to companies which have the proper capital structure. Our loans are not a substitute for equity.\"</p><p>Mustier thinks the EU, since Brexit, understands this better now.\u00a0</p><p>Member states are also, at their own pace, doing more to support venture funding for SMEs. But there have been mistakes \"\" in particular tax breaks favouring listed equities \"\" and there are still big constraints, especially the smaller size and lower-risk orientation of the European pension and insurance market compared with the US.\u00a0</p><p>\"There are ways to channel more money into pension funds, which would deal with the deficit of the state; there are ways to allow insurance companies to take more risk,\" he says.</p><p>\"Insurance funds in Europe can't take risks because of [the European] Solvency II [Directive]. Pension funds are underdeveloped and investing in double-A or single-A securities. There's no short-term fix, but there's a medium-term solution in terms of making sure that the rules allow pension funds and insurance companies to develop more and take more equity risk. More money from high net-worth individuals also needs to be channelled into risk-taking assets.\"\u00a0</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1hv5yr0qpbmly</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKC-GBK1-JD1P-T4TY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5626\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

But veterans of the 103-year old watchdog say that the agency increasingly runs the risk of being outmatched by the very tech giants it oversees without more cash, cutting-edge staff and stronger legal teeth.'For a long time the FTC itself has been pointing out the gaps in its authority,' said Terrell McSweeny, a Democratic commissioner who concluded her three-year tenure last week. 'What I find hopeful about this moment is that people are realizing the consequences of that and having a conversation about it.' On Tuesday, the FTC gained its newest chairman, Joe Simons, and soon he'll be surrounded by a full complement of four other commissioners. </p><p>They'll be expected to monitor everything from the fast-growing footprint of companies like Amazon to the security practices of the entire tech industry. Most Read Business Stories Unlimited Digital Access: $1 for 4 weeks[1]Already, they face their first, high-profile test: an investigation into Facebook's recent privacy mishaps. In March, the FTC announced it would probe Facebook's entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that improperly accessed names, 'likes' and other personal information for up to 87 million of the social site's users. If the FTC finds that Facebook erred, it could result in massive fines - penalties that some experts say the agency must levy in order to send an early message that it is able, and willing, to police the country's tech behemoths. 'Will the new FTC have the will to take on today's challenges aggressively?' asked Jessica Rich, the former director of the agency's Bureau of Consumer Protection. 'The FTC really is under-resourced. So if it steps up and takes on the challenges, it still will have a limited amount of resources to do that.' The FTC's purview is vast. It reviews hospital mergers, responds to consumer reports about robocalls and ensures that products labeled as 'made in the USA' are actually manufactured here. It stems from its more than century-old mandate to promote competition and penalize those who engage in unfair or deceptive practices.In recent years, though, the FTC has evolved into the U.S. government's primary regulator of the tech industry. While the country may lack a single, federal online privacy law, the agency still has managed to tap its powers to punish tech giants like Facebook, Google, Twitter and Uber for failing to protect the sensitive information they amass about their users. Despite an ever-expanding workload, the FTC's authorities and resources haven't changed much. Its budget this fiscal year is $306 million - or about a third of one percent of the revenue that Google earned in 2017. Those limited funds help the agency maintain a workforce of about 1,140 - roughly 300 fewer than it had almost four decades earlier, according to FTC records, well before it had to police the internet. 'One of the issues is the ability to hire technologists,' acknowledged Rich, who is now the vice president of consumer policy and mobilization at Consumer Reports. 'The FTC simply can't pay what many technologists make in not even the top echelons of companies.'During an interview before she departed, McSweeny praised the agency for its track record, citing the fact it's achieved a 'terrific return on taxpayer investment.' That includes major settlements with companies like Volkswagen for allegedly defrauding drivers.Still, she stressed the FTC faces major structural challenges - issues that she and her predecessors long have highlighted without much success. The FTC is generally hamstrung in its ability to write new rules, for example, and it isn't always able to fine tech companies on their first privacy or security offense.'It would be helpful to have Congress clarify the FTC's authority around privacy and data security. It would be helpful to have civil penalty authority. I think it would be helpful for the agency to have regulatory authority,' she said. Those strictures now fall to Simons, who officially assumed the title of FTC chairman on Tuesday after serving as an antitrust litigator at the law firm Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton ...rrison for clients like Microsoft and Sony. It's not his first tour of duty in the federal government: Simons worked at the agency as its director of the Bureau of Competition from 2001 to 2003. His office declined to make him available for an interview.He'll be aided by two fellow Republicans: Noah Phillips, a former top aide to Texas Sen. John Cornyn, and Christine Wilson, who was a top executive at Delta. Opposite them will be two new Democratic commissioners: Rohit Chopra, a former regulator at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Rebecca Slaughter, previously a top advisor to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. All but Wilson had been sworn in by this week. To start, the agency is under pressure to penalize not only Facebook but other tech companies that mishandle consumers' data.'The FTC largely failed during the Obama years to address the most pressing challenges,' said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which brought the complaint that led to the FTC's settlement with Facebook in 2011. 'The evidence of that is made clear every day.'Others would like to see the FTC under its new leaders take a closer look at companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google for potential antitrust concerns. Regulators around the world increasingly are fearful that big tech is too big \u2014 especially in Europe, which is still probing Google's business practices. In the United States, the FTC hasn't brought such a major case since its own probe of Google - an investigation it closed in 2013 by leaving the company intact. 'We're in an era in which we have massive consolidation happening throughout virtually every sector of the economy, and we've had over the last two decades the rise of the tech industry,' said Ganesh Sitaraman, co-founder of the Great Democracy Initiative, a new progressive-minded policy nonprofit founded by two former aides to Sen. Elizabeth Warren. 'And in large part the FTC has not been doing its job sufficiently to enforce our antitrust laws.' The organization published research this week that calls for regulating the algorithms that power platforms like Facebook's news feed to ensure they aren't used in ways that may harm rival services. In perhaps a sign of his approach, Simons, the agency's new chairman, told Congress earlier this year that the U.S. government may have been 'too permissive in dealing with mergers and acquisitions.' He said the FTC needed to 'devote substantial resources to determining whether its merger enforcement has been too lax.'Yet the evolving nature of digital challenges could make it hard for the FTC to keep up. McSweeny pointed recently to the rise of online 'disinformation' and 'deepfakes' - videos, in some cases, where politicians are edited to say things they never uttered. Both now register on the radar of a more than century-old agency that's supposed to focus on deception. 'I think this is very important moment,' McSweeny said. 'People not just in America, but around the world, are engaging in a real moment of consideration around how these technologies work.'

Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee, at a hearing with the five members of the FTC. She said the agency needs more funding and authority \"at a minimum to restore consumers' confidence.\"</p><p>Rohit Chopra, one of the FTC commissioners, said that for some big companies, fines alone are a mere \"parking ticket.\"</p><p>\"We cannot change behavior without finding out who at the top caused those problems,\" Chopra said.</p><p>Although Schakowsky and Chopra didn't specifically mention Facebook, the giant social network was top of mind for lawmakers as the FTC appears close to ending its yearlong investigation of the company's privacy practices and looks to punish Facebook for alleged violations of users' privacy.</p><p>The question is whether big fines can be just a cost of doing business for huge companies, failing to deter bad conduct. The fine against Facebook is expected to run as high as $5 billion - stacked against the company's revenue of $55.8 billion last year.</p><p>Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, said even a large fine \"is inconsequential for a company the size of Facebook.\"</p><p>The FTC is considering a rare action to hold Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally accountable for Facebook's alleged failure to honor a 2011 agreement over privacy lapses.</p><p>The agency also may limit how Facebook targets advertising to its massive user base - potentially making the action far more than a regulatory slap on the wrist.</p><p>Beyond the fine, comprehensive action by the FTC could mark a watershed in federal action against the tech industry in the name of consumer privacy.</p><p>By usual practice, the FTC - an independent agency - is split with three Republicans and two Democrats. FTC Chairman Joseph Simons has advocated tougher enforcement action against tech companies and must obtain the agreement of at least two other commissioners for any action on Facebook.</p><p>In his testimony, Simons urged the lawmakers to enact privacy and data-security legislation to be enforced by the FTC. The agency has brought more than 65 data security cases and 60 general privacy cases and helped return more than $1.6 billion to consumers in the fiscal year ended in October, Simons noted.</p><p>Lawmakers have started work on a new national privacy law that could sharply curtail the ability of the biggest tech companies to collect and make money off people's personal data. The role of the FTC as an enforcer of privacy protections is a key issue in the debate over legislation. Consumer privacy advocates and Democratic lawmakers say the agency currently lacks teeth and have pushed for expanding its powers and funding.</p><p>The FTC doesn't have the authority, for example, to levy civil money penalties for first violations for most unfair or deceptive practices. It can only issue orders halting the conduct, as it did with Facebook in 2011.</p><p>The agency would be expected to write new privacy rules should Congress pass a new law.</p><p>Behind the momentum for a new law is rising concern over a string of scandals and the compromise of private data held by Facebook, Google and other tech giants that have reaped riches by aggregating consumer information. The industry has traditionally been lightly regulated and has resisted closer oversight as a threat to its culture of free-wheeling innovation.</p><p>Republicans have generally opposed an expansion of federal authority, but in the wake of the Facebook and other privacy scandals, some have taken a more open view toward the FTC's powers and funding. Some business groups are also proposing an expanded role in privacy protection for the FTC.</p><p>The 2011 consent decree with the FTC bound Facebook to a 20-year privacy commitment. Violations could subject the company to fines of $41,484 per violation per user per day. The agreement requires that Facebook users give \"affirmative express consent\" any time that data they haven't made public is shared with a third party.</p><p>The agency started investigating Facebook's privacy practices more than a year ago after reports surfaced that the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly accessed the data of as many as 87 million Facebook users without their consent.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-ef2cf24ac2144e63b71ab57016d4d7a2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2P-M8B1-JC65-531S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><timeReceived>9:05 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 8, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

FTC Chairman Joseph Simons has advocated tougher enforcement action against tech companies and must obtain the agreement of at least two other commissioners for any action on Facebook.</p><p>In his testimony, Simons urged the lawmakers to enact privacy and data-security legislation to be enforced by the FTC. The agency has brought more than 65 data security cases and 60 general privacy cases and helped return more than $1.6 billion to consumers in the fiscal year ended in October, Simons noted.</p><p>Lawmakers have started work on a new national privacy law that could sharply curtail the ability of the biggest tech companies to collect and make money off people's personal data. The role of the FTC as an enforcer of privacy protections is a key issue in the debate over legislation. Consumer privacy advocates and Democratic lawmakers say the agency currently lacks teeth and have pushed for expanding its powers and funding.</p><p>The FTC doesn't have the authority, for example, to levy civil money penalties for first violations for most unfair or deceptive practices.

The agreement requires that Facebook users give \"affirmative express consent\" any time that data they haven't made public is shared with a third party.</p><p>The agency started investigating Facebook's privacy practices more than a year ago after reports surfaced that the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly accessed the data of as many as 87 million Facebook users without their consent.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-ef2cf24ac2144e63b71ab57016d4d7a2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2P-M5V1-DYN6-W2TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><timeReceived>9:05 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 8, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee, at a hearing with the five members of the FTC. She said the agency needs more funding and authority \"at a minimum to restore consumers' confidence.\"</p><p>Rohit Chopra, one of the FTC commissioners, said that for some big companies, fines alone are a mere \"parking ticket.\"</p><p>\"We cannot change behavior without finding out who at the top caused those problems,\" Chopra said.</p><p>Although Schakowsky and Chopra didn't specifically mention Facebook, the giant social network was top of mind for lawmakers as the FTC appears close to ending its yearlong investigation of the company's privacy practices and looks to punish Facebook for alleged violations of users' privacy.</p><p>The question is whether big fines can be just a cost of doing business for huge companies, failing to deter bad conduct. The fine against Facebook is expected to run as high as $5 billion - stacked against the company's revenue of $55.8 billion last year.</p><p>Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, said even a large fine \"is inconsequential for a company the size of Facebook.\"</p><p>The FTC is considering a rare action to hold Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally accountable for Facebook's alleged failure to honor a 2011 agreement over privacy lapses.</p><p>The agency also may limit how Facebook targets advertising to its massive user base - potentially making the action far more than a regulatory slap on the wrist.</p><p>Beyond the fine, comprehensive action by the FTC could mark a watershed in federal action against the tech industry in the name of consumer privacy.</p><p>By usual practice, the FTC - an independent agency - is split with three Republicans and two Democrats. FTC Chairman Joseph Simons has advocated tougher enforcement action against tech companies and must obtain the agreement of at least two other commissioners for any action on Facebook.</p><p>In his testimony, Simons urged the lawmakers to enact privacy and data-security legislation to be enforced by the FTC. The agency has brought more than 65 data security cases and 60 general privacy cases and helped return more than $1.6 billion to consumers in the fiscal year ended in October, Simons noted.</p><p>Lawmakers have started work on a new national privacy law that could sharply curtail the ability of the biggest tech companies to collect and make money off people's personal data. The role of the FTC as an enforcer of privacy protections is a key issue in the debate over legislation. Consumer privacy advocates and Democratic lawmakers say the agency currently lacks teeth and have pushed for expanding its powers and funding.</p><p>The FTC doesn't have the authority, for example, to levy civil money penalties for first violations for most unfair or deceptive practices. It can only issue orders halting the conduct, as it did with Facebook in 2011.</p><p>The agency would be expected to write new privacy rules should Congress pass a new law.</p><p>Behind the momentum for a new law is rising concern over a string of scandals and the compromise of private data held by Facebook, Google and other tech giants that have reaped riches by aggregating consumer information. The industry has traditionally been lightly regulated and has resisted closer oversight as a threat to its culture of free-wheeling innovation.</p><p>Republicans have generally opposed an expansion of federal authority, but in the wake of the Facebook and other privacy scandals, some have taken a more open view toward the FTC's powers and funding. Some business groups are also proposing an expanded role in privacy protection for the FTC.</p><p>The 2011 consent decree with the FTC bound Facebook to a 20-year privacy commitment. Violations could subject the company to fines of $41,484 per violation per user per day. The agreement requires that Facebook users give \"affirmative express consent\" any time that data they haven't made public is shared with a third party.</p><p>The agency started investigating Facebook's privacy practices more than a year ago after reports surfaced that the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly accessed the data of as many as 87 million Facebook users without their consent.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-ef2cf24ac2144e63b71ab57016d4d7a2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2P-M9X1-DYN6-W54F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><timeReceived>9:05 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee, at a hearing with the five members of the FTC. She said the agency needs more funding and authority \"at a minimum to restore consumers' confidence.\"</p><p>Rohit Chopra, one of the FTC commissioners, said that for some big companies, fines alone are a mere \"parking ticket.\"</p><p>\"We cannot change behaviour without finding out who at the top caused those problems,\" Chopra said.</p><p>Although Schakowsky and Chopra didn't specifically mention Facebook, the giant social network was top of mind for lawmakers as the FTC appears close to ending its yearlong investigation of the company's privacy practices and looks to punish Facebook for alleged violations of users' privacy.</p><p>The question is whether big fines can be just a cost of doing business for huge companies, failing to deter bad conduct. The fine against Facebook is expected to run as high as $5 billion - stacked against the company's revenue of $55.8 billion last year.</p><p>Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, said even a large fine \"is inconsequential for a company the size of Facebook.\"</p><p>The FTC is considering a rare action to hold Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally accountable for Facebook's alleged failure to honour a 2011 agreement over privacy lapses.</p><p>The agency also may limit how Facebook targets advertising to its massive user base - potentially making the action far more than a regulatory slap on the wrist.</p><p>Beyond the fine, comprehensive action by the FTC could mark a watershed in federal action against the tech industry in the name of consumer privacy.</p><p>By usual practice, the FTC - an independent agency - is split with three Republicans and two Democrats. FTC Chairman Joseph Simons has advocated tougher enforcement action against tech companies and must obtain the agreement of at least two other commissioners for any action on Facebook.</p><p>In his testimony, Simons urged the lawmakers to enact privacy and data-security legislation to be enforced by the FTC. The agency has brought more than 65 data security cases and 60 general privacy cases and helped return more than $1.6 billion to consumers in the fiscal year ended in October, Simons noted.</p><p>Lawmakers have started work on a new national privacy law that could sharply curtail the ability of the biggest tech companies to collect and make money off people's personal data. The role of the FTC as an enforcer of privacy protections is a key issue in the debate over legislation. Consumer privacy advocates and Democratic lawmakers say the agency currently lacks teeth and have pushed for expanding its powers and funding.</p><p>The FTC doesn't have the authority, for example, to levy civil money penalties for first violations for most unfair or deceptive practices. It can only issue orders halting the conduct, as it did with Facebook in 2011.</p><p>The agency would be expected to write new privacy rules should Congress pass a new law.</p><p>Behind the momentum for a new law is rising concern over a string of scandals and the compromise of private data held by Facebook, Google and other tech giants that have reaped riches by aggregating consumer information. The industry has traditionally been lightly regulated and has resisted closer oversight as a threat to its culture of free-wheeling innovation.</p><p>Republicans have generally opposed an expansion of federal authority, but in the wake of the Facebook and other privacy scandals, some have taken a more open view toward the FTC's powers and funding. Some business groups are also proposing an expanded role in privacy protection for the FTC.</p><p>The 2011 consent decree with the FTC bound Facebook to a 20-year privacy commitment. Violations could subject the company to fines of $41,484 per violation per user per day. The agreement requires that Facebook users give \"affirmative express consent\" any time that data they haven't made public is shared with a third party.</p><p>The agency started investigating Facebook's privacy practices more than a year ago after reports surfaced that the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly accessed the data of as many as 87 million Facebook users without their consent.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-ef2cf24ac2144e63b71ab57016d4d7a2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2J-33H1-JBVR-33C0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><timeReceived>05:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 8, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Members of a House consumer protection subcommittee also gave a sympathetic hearing on the Federal Trade Commission's request for funding and powers to authorities solitude. She said the agency needs more funding and authority\"at a minimum to restore customers' confidence\"Rohit Chopra, one of the FTC commissioners, said that for a few huge businesses, fines alone are a mere\"parking ticket.\"\"We cannot change behaviour without discovering who in the most effective caused those issues,\" Chopra said.Although Schakowsky and Chopra did mention Facebook, the giant social network was top of mind for lawmakers since the FTC appears close to ending its evaluation of the privacy practices of the company and seems to penalize Facebook for violations of consumers' privacy.The question is if fines can be a cost of doing business because of businesses, failing to deter behaviour that is bad. </p><p>The good against Facebook is expected to operate as large as $5 billion -- piled against the company's revenue of $55.8 billion final year.The FTC is contemplating a rare activity to hold Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally accountable for the alleged failure to honor an 2011 agreement of Facebook.The bureau also may restrict Facebook targets advertisements to its user base -- potentially making the action than the usual regulatory smack on the wrist.Beyond the nice, detailed action by the FTC will mark a watershed in action.By clinic, the FTC -- an agency -- is split with 2 Democrats and three Republicans. FTC Chairman Joseph Simons has advocated tougher enforcement action against companies and have to get the agreement of two other commissioners for any actions on Facebook. The bureau has attracted over 65 data safety cases and 60 overall privacy cases and helped return more than $1.6 billion to customers from the financial year ended in October, Simons noted.Lawmakers have started work on a national privacy law that will sharply curtail the largest tech companies' capacity to collect and earn money. The role of the FTC as an enforcer of privacy protections is a key issue in the debate on laws. Democratic lawmakers and consumer privacy advocates say the agency now lacks teeth and also have pushed for expanding its own forces and financing.The FTC does not have the authority, by way of instance, to levy money penalties for first violations for deceptive or unfair practices. It may only issue orders as it did in 2011 with Facebook stopping the behaviour.The agency would be expected to write privacy rules if a law that was is passed by Congress.Underneath the momentum for a brand new law is the compromise of information stored by Facebook, both Google and other technology giants that have reaped wealth and increasing concern over a series of scandals. The sector has resisted closer oversight to its civilization of innovation as a threat and has been lightly regulated.Republicans have opposed an expansion of national jurisdiction, but in the wake of this Facebook and other privacy scandals, a few have even taken a view supporting the forces and funding of the FTC. Some business classes are also proposing an expanded part in privacy protection to the FTC. Violations could subject the organization to penalties of $41,484 per violation per user every day. The agreement requires that Facebook users give\"affirmative express consent\" any moment that data they have not made people is shared with a third party.The bureau began investigating the privacy practices of Facebook after reports surfaced that the British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had accessed the information as many as 87 million Facebook users with their permission. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AMCN1343111557662788910251762500212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BANS-134311</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3F-4JX1-JCMN-Y175-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"653\"/><timeReceived>12:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Baseball News Source</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 12, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Rural Telephone Service Company Inc. refused to license its local information to Feist Publications Inc., so Feist went ahead and copied part of Rural's phonebook. Rural shrewdly placed false entries in its directory, caught Feist in the act, and sued for copyright infringement. But despite Rural's ingenuity, the Supreme Court ruled that the raw data collected in phonebooks were not copyrightable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Phonebooks are long gone in 2019, but a similar situation arose this week: The site Genius, known for crowd-sourcing lyrics and annotations from listeners and occasionally artists, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/genius-sues-google-50-million-920399/\">filed a lawsuit against Google</url>, alleging that the search engine and its partner company LyricFind lifted verses and choruses wholesale from Genius without attribution or compensation. Much like Rural Telephone Service Company Inc., Genius came up with a neat ruse to help make its case: First, an apostrophe pattern concealed in song lyrics that spelled out \"red handed\" in Morse code (which is even older than phonebooks), then a spacing pattern that spelled out \"genius.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the scenario is familiar, the legalese is different this time around.</p><p>Genius \"alleges that by taking the content created on their site and misappropriating it and using it for commercial purposes, [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/t/google/\">Google</url> and LyricFind are] violating the terms of use on their website,\" explains Imraan Farukhi, an entertainment lawyer and an assistant professor at Syracuse University's S.I. Newhouse School. On top of that, Genius' suit accuses Google and LyricFind of \"unethical and unfair anti-competitive practices,\" which Farukhi says \"can give rise to actionable legal claims\" in New York. Genius demands at least $50 million from Google and LyricFind in compensation.</p><p>A representative for Genius declined to comment on the lawsuit, while a representative for Google referred\u00a0Rolling Stone to a conciliatory, <url normalizedValue=\"http://blog.google/products/search/how-we-help-you-find-lyrics-google-search/\">months-old company blog post</url>. In an email, Darryl Ballantyne, founder and CEO of LyricFind, tells Rolling Stone that \"we have not had any contact with Genius since June, and in fact, have not even been served with the complaint.\"</p><p>\"From what we're reading online,\" Ballantyne added, \"[the suit] is completely frivolous and without merit.\" (Genius did not respond to a request for comment on Ballantyne's statement.)</p><p>But Don Gorder, an attorney and the chair of the music business and management department at Berklee College of Music, says Genius' watermarking trap \"is pretty clever.\" \"It looks like they do have a pretty strong case against LyricFind for lifting those lyrics and then, when putting those out through Google, violating their terms of service agreement,\" Gorder continues. \"Does that add up to $50 million [in damages]? That's probably a stretch.\"</p><p>Genius' suit is a strange one - it's about copying, but not about copyright. That's because Genius and Google both license song lyrics from their owners (either publishing companies or songwriters) but then create the transcripts on their own. \"It's an odd industry practice that companies that are in the business of displaying lyrics are not actually getting the source material from the licensors,\" Farukhi says. \"They're just transcribing those themselves.\"</p><p>What's more, Genius became a successful company thanks in large part to the unpaid work of tens of thousands of music fans who transcribe and annotate without any compensation. In what seems like a hypocritical turn, Genius is now accusing Google and LyricFind of doing a version of the same thing - benefitting from someone else's work without paying for it. Not only that, Genius was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/business/media/rap-genius-website-agrees-to-license-with-music-publishers.html\">forced to settle with the National Music Publishers Association</url> in 2014 after the NMPA accused the site of using song lyrics without permission. No one would say that Genius is the perfect David to take a shot at Google's Goliath.</p><p>\"It looks like [Genius has] a pretty strong case against LyricFind for lifting those lyrics and then, when putting those out through Google, violating their terms of service agreement,\" says one lawyer</p><p>But Genius' suit could still be cutting, because it comes at a time when distrust of Google and other massive technology conglomerates is at an all-time high. In March, the European Union levied a third billion-dollar-plus fine on Google in three years; each penalized the company for anti-competitive practices.</p><p>The U.S. lags behind the E.U. in terms of regulating pretty much everything, but the political climate for big tech companies is no kinder stateside. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has made \"break up big tech\" a central tenet of her presidential campaign. And in a surprising moment of bipartisan agreement, even the Justice Department has opened an antitrust review of tech conglomerates, acknowledging that \"without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.\"</p><p>One man cheering Genius' suit is Brian Warner, founder and CEO of the site CelebrityNetWorth, who has publicly accused Google of stealing his company's work to debilitating effect. \"When I was looking at Twitter yesterday, the first question was, 'Why does Genius have the right to this?'\" Warner says. \"We need to all get over that. The bigger thing here is, Google cannot just look at what people are going to search for and scrape their own version to choke traffic off.\"</p><p>Genius' lawsuit accuses Google of cribbing lyrics as far back as 2016. When a curious listener searches for lyrics in Google, the first result to appear is a read-out from a partner like LyricFind. This not only pushes the link to Genius' website further down in the search results - especially when users are on their phones - it renders the lyrics site mostly superfluous.</p><p>The suit filed by Genius claims it approached the search engine about the alleged plagiarism but was mostly ignored. So Genius took matters into its own hands, creating watermarks to help bolster its own investigation into Google's behavior. \"This is an interesting case because Genius had done so much due diligence in trying to confirm that LyricFind was providing Google improperly with content listed from Genius' page,\" Farukhi says.</p><p>This summer, Genius went public with its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/lyrics-site-genius-com-accuses-google-of-lifting-its-content-11560677400\">accusations in The Wall Street Journal</url>, claiming that the apostrophe watermark had popped up numerous times in Google search read-outs. The search engine made a public display of concern, but Genius' suit claims no substantive action was taken. The site accuses Google of offering \"platitudes of 'high standards' and 'best practices'\" while \"continu[ing] to exploit content misappropriated from Genius' website.\"</p><p>That exploitation allegedly wreaks havoc on Genius' traffic. The company claims that when Selena Gomez released her new single \"Lose You to Love Me\" in October, 75 percent of the users who searched for the track's lyrics were initially clicking through to Genius' website. But then Google allegedly swiped Genius' lyrics - the company says it detected its watermark in the search engine's display box - and the click-through rate nosedived to five percent.</p><p>The suit \"is pretty dramatic in showing how Google can drive the traffic to a website down,\" says David Lowery, a prominent critic of big tech and lead singer of the groups Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker. (In the past, Lowery has been both a critic and a supporter of Genius.) \"It illustrates how [Google] can act as a monopoly in certain cases - using their dominant search position and content scraping to maintain their status as the market leader by eating up other people.\"</p><p>\u00a0\"This is not a good look for Google when they're getting re-examined for antitrust stuff\" - David Lowery</p><p>Genius is far from the first company to accuse Google of this sort of anti-competitive behavior. Yelp, which also relies on user-generated content, has been in a years-long battle with the search engine; Yelp's chief executive, Jeremy Stoppelman, took his case to Congress. So did Warner, who told the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust that Google's decision to lift information from CelebrityNetWorth without consent devastated the site's traffic, leaving Warner's creation \"treading water with cement blocks around our feet.\"</p><p>In his testimony, Warner also described Google as \"an $800 billion company that employs an army of lawyers, lobbyists, think tanks, and talking heads.\" That's part of why the tech company has continued to skate by despite repeated allegations of anti-competitiveness. Will Genius' suit be any different?</p><p>\"There are some questions as to the unilateral enforceability of a website's terms of use,\" Farukhi acknowledges. \"But generally courts have said that terms of use are enforceable just like any other contract. Sometimes it depends on certain aspects of how reasonable it is that the users will know these terms exist and find them.\" And while multiple lawyers contacted by Rolling Stone find it unlikely this lawsuit will ever reach trial, if it ever did, Genius' use of watermarks \"lend[s] itself to being persuasive evidence\" of alleged theft.</p><p>Who would be held responsible for that theft? Genius is leveling separate claims against both Google and LyricFind. But \"Google is saying, 'It's not us, we get our lyrics from LyricFind,'\" Gorder explains. \"I'm wondering if something will come forward where Google goes against LyricFind because they have some sort of indemnity agreement with them.\"</p><p>Google also works with another third-party lyric provider, Musixmatch, which was not named in the lawsuit. Max Ciociola, CEO and founder of Musixmatch, says the company also takes a user-driven approach to lyric generation, much like Genius or Wikipedia. In contrast, \"LyricFind is not a company known for having a community,\" Ciociola says. \"So they can't really scale - we're talking about 40,000 new tracks per day coming out. If you don't have a community like Musixmatch or Genius, how can you add the content? There is only one way: scraping.\"</p><p>In the end, the optics of Genius' suit might be more valuable than the actual court case, since the company's action continues to ratchet up public pressure on Google. \"This is not a good look for Google when they're getting re-examined for antitrust stuff,\" Lowery says. \"It's not like the FTC would start an investigation because of this, but if they are gonna look into this stuff again, or if the Europeans are looking into this stuff again, it's a really clear example of how Google can abuse its dominant search position.\"</p><p>\"Google is under fire for a lot of things,\" Gorder concludes. \"Genius is basically saying, 'Hey! Us too.'\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RLNGST-922666</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RLNGST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNK-M771-JC3V-61YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468655</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Rolling Stone</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1921\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 5, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Unemployment is low. </p><p>Compared with their American counterparts, German employees work on average 400 hours less a year, enjoy long holiday breaks and a strong safety net. What accounts for all this good luck? Many point to the country's \"social market economy\" system, the soziale Marktwirtschaft.The term was first coined by the German economist Alfred M\u00fcller-Armack in 1947 after the end of World War II. It was a time when the Allied military command rationed food and goods, enforced price and wage regulations, and cigarettes were a real substitute for currency.Soon Ludwig Erhard started to use the phrase to describe his ideas for Germany's post-war economy. And though at the end of the war, Erhard was nearly 50 and had never held any political office what he said mattered, because he became economy minister of West Germany in1949. It was a position he held until 1963.Getting West Germany working again after the war was more important than simply making products or money. Getting people into jobs brought about social peace at a difficult time, and if the country was successful it could fend off communism.Other countries like France, Italy and Austria also experienced a boom, but nothing like Germany, and these years have broadly come to be described as a time of miracles. Erhard for his part has been nicknamed the \"father of the German economic miracle\" and often called the \"incarnation of prosperity\" or simply the \"miracle man.\"Erhard's sense of fairness\"The outstanding economic development of Germany after the Second World War has been significantly influenced by the social market economy,\" J\u00f6rg Rocholl, president of the European School of Management and Technology (ESMT) in Berlin, told DW. \"Its biggest merit is the balance between work and capital in enabling competition. On the one hand, it gives companies the greatest possible freedom. It uses social elements to ensure that those who cannot successfully participate in the economy are socially secure.\"In the past 70 years the workings of Germany's social market economy have widened and now encompass more than Erhard imagined. His ideas were something between the extremes of ultraliberal laissez-faire economics and a Marxist socialist \u2014 in other words a planned \u2014 system. Performance-based competition was the key to it all.Basically he wanted a minimally regulated free market economy without day-to-day government interference where supply and demand determined prices, wages and what was produced. He called for private property rights, tough antitrust laws and codetermination, a system that puts worker representatives on company boards in the hope of reaching a consensus on wages, benefits and working conditions.Perhaps what Erhard wouldn't recognize today is the country's welfare system. He loved entrepreneurship and always put the \"market\" before the \"social\" in his social market economy and was not in favor of excessive social benefits. He wanted people to work hard and stand on their own as much as possible. Today's current health care, pension and unemployment systems go beyond his ideals. A new world orderJ\u00f6rg Rocholl from ESMT notes that the principles of the social market economy are slowly being softened. He criticizes the government for increasingly intervening in pricing and market mechanisms. A perfect example of this is the current discussion around putting a temporary hold on housing rent hikes in Germany. Not only that, but authorities want to set price limits in the future to cushion rising rents.\"Any artificial slowing down of the price mechanism like we saw in East Germany leads to a decline in investment and the building infrastructure suffers. In the end, nobody benefits,\" said Rocholl. Especially this year when Germans are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent unification of East and West Germany, many people in the former East feel that they have been left behind. It's not hard to imagine how surprised people in East Germany felt when a new economic and social system was imposed on them in 1989. After all, they had lived in a planned socialist system for many decades and have struggled to catch up.The situation in Eastern Germany is not due to the fact that a market economy is bad, but rather that the East German system was economically finished even before 1989,\" explained Rocholl, referring to secret internal government reports. \"Even before the fall of the Berlin Wall in October 1989, Gerhard Sch\u00fcrer, head of the Central Planning Commission of East Germany, had submitted a secret report on the economic situation of the county to the politburo,\" according to Rocholl. \"The report showed the catastrophic state of the production facilities because of worn-out equipment and an enormous need for repairs. In addition, it showed that the country was already so heavily indebted abroad that a state bankruptcy was imminent.\"Looking forwardDespite the challenges of integrating East and West in the past three decades, as a whole the unified Germany has roared ahead economically. Today many countries look at its current success to see what parts they can take from it.Erhard called for \"prosperity for all\" and indeed Germany is riding high at the moment despite a slight recent downturn. When things go well, people don't ask questions. From 2005 to 2019, unemployment dropped from 10% to 5%.

Unemployment is low. </p><p>Compared with their American counterparts, German employees work on average 400 hours less a year, enjoy long holiday breaks and a strong safety net. What accounts for all this good luck? Many point to the country's \"social market economy\" system, the soziale Marktwirtschaft.The term was first coined by the German economist Alfred M\u00fcller-Armack in 1947 after the end of World War II. It was a time when the Allied military command rationed food and goods, enforced price and wage regulations, and cigarettes were a real substitute for currency.Soon Ludwig Erhard started to use the phrase to describe his ideas for Germany's post-war economy. And though at the end of the war, Erhard was nearly 50 and had never held any political office what he said mattered, because he became economy minister of West Germany in1949. It was a position he held until 1963.Getting West Germany working again after the war was more important than simply making products or money. Getting people into jobs brought about social peace at a difficult time, and if the country was successful it could fend off communism.Other countries like France, Italy and Austria also experienced a boom, but nothing like Germany, and these years have broadly come to be described as a time of miracles. Erhard for his part has been nicknamed the \"father of the German economic miracle\" and often called the \"incarnation of prosperity\" or simply the \"miracle man.\"Erhard's sense of fairness\"The outstanding economic development of Germany after the Second World War has been significantly influenced by the social market economy,\" J\u00f6rg Rocholl, president of the European School of Management and Technology (ESMT) in Berlin, told DW. \"Its biggest merit is the balance between work and capital in enabling competition. On the one hand, it gives companies the greatest possible freedom. It uses social elements to ensure that those who cannot successfully participate in the economy are socially secure.\"In the past 70 years the workings of Germany's social market economy have widened and now encompass more than Erhard imagined. His ideas were something between the extremes of ultraliberal laissez-faire economics and a Marxist socialist \u2014 in other words a planned \u2014 system. Performance-based competition was the key to it all.Basically he wanted a minimally regulated free market economy without day-to-day government interference where supply and demand determined prices, wages and what was produced. He called for private property rights, tough antitrust laws and codetermination, a system that puts worker representatives on company boards in the hope of reaching a consensus on wages, benefits and working conditions.Perhaps what Erhard wouldn't recognize today is the country's welfare system. He loved entrepreneurship and always put the \"market\" before the \"social\" in his social market economy and was not in favor of excessive social benefits. He wanted people to work hard and stand on their own as much as possible. Today's current health care, pension and unemployment systems go beyond his ideals. A new world orderJ\u00f6rg Rocholl from ESMT notes that the principles of the social market economy are slowly being softened. He criticizes the government for increasingly intervening in pricing and market mechanisms. A perfect example of this is the current discussion around putting a temporary hold on housing rent hikes in Germany. Not only that, but authorities want to set price limits in the future to cushion rising rents.\"Any artificial slowing down of the price mechanism like we saw in East Germany leads to a decline in investment and the building infrastructure suffers. In the end, nobody benefits,\" said Rocholl. Especially this year when Germans are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent unification of East and West Germany, many people in the former East feel that they have been left behind. It's not hard to imagine how surprised people in East Germany felt when a new economic and social system was imposed on them in 1989. After all, they had lived in a planned socialist system for many decades and have struggled to catch up.The situation in Eastern Germany is not due to the fact that a market economy is bad, but rather that the East German system was economically finished even before 1989,\" explained Rocholl, referring to secret internal government reports. \"Even before the fall of the Berlin Wall in October 1989, Gerhard Sch\u00fcrer, head of the Central Planning Commission of East Germany, had submitted a secret report on the economic situation of the county to the politburo,\" according to Rocholl. \"The report showed the catastrophic state of the production facilities because of worn-out equipment and an enormous need for repairs. In addition, it showed that the country was already so heavily indebted abroad that a state bankruptcy was imminent.\"Looking forwardDespite the challenges of integrating East and West in the past three decades, as a whole the unified Germany has roared ahead economically. Today many countries look at its current success to see what parts they can take from it.Erhard called for \"prosperity for all\" and indeed Germany is riding high at the moment despite a slight recent downturn. When things go well, people don't ask questions. From 2005 to 2019, unemployment dropped from 10% to 5%. But the moment things turn sour, the tides will turn on whatever system is in place.A recent report on Germany's social market economy published by KfW, the country's state owned development bank, point out problems facing the county like growing income disparity, poverty, climate change, a stumbling global trade regime, demographic change and dismal progress in digitalization.This is a long list. Additionally, many businesses say they need more flexibility, especially when it comes to hiring and firing workers. No one system can be everything to everyone, yet it seems like the social market economy is being attached on all sides. Should the economy tank as some are predicting, the cries for it to be dismantled will only grow.Germany must rise to these enormous challenges. The KfW report hit the nail on the head when it stated \"securing prosperity is a permanent task.\" The government will be called on to bring about more social peace and solutions to some big problems. \"In his book 'Prosperity for All,' Erhard wrote that as economy minister, he was not the representative of large commercial enterprises and cartels, but someone who had to promote the well-being of everyone by ensuring competition. Exactly this point is more important today than ever. How do we deal with big, powerful companies like the big tech giants? What kind of competition regulation do we need?\" concluded ESMT's Rocholl.To stay on top in a changing world, Germany may need to come up with a new \"economic miracle\" plan. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL1099871570000071393251761700048</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7825</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5W-P4K1-JCMN-Y4G5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1220\"/><timeReceived>7:07 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle Germany</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 2, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp; MESSAGE BOARDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000549</classCode><className>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001772</classCode><className>UNEMPLOYMENT RATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A1SO</classCode><className>BUSINESS EDUCATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST00097YO</classCode><className>WAGE &amp; HOUR LAWS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzkwRDQ1MTExNzNDNEFENTk1Njk0MTg0Rjg0RUQzRkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTE3QUQwOTA0MUYzNDlCMEFFMjUwRUNDM0RDRkM5QzM</classCode><className>Wage &amp; Hour Laws</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp; MESSAGE BOARDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX121</classCode><className>BERLIN, GERMANY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GC318</classCode><className>GERMANY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GC346</classCode><className>AUSTRIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Although Google's core services, Google Search, Gmail and YouTube, remain blocked in China, the company is involved in providing digital tools and support to large a number of Chinese app developers and manufacturers, mobile companies and advertisers, who want to reach out to their global customers.Google had pulled out of China eight years ago over censorship issues. However, if reports are to be believed, Google now plans to re-enter the China market. </p><p>For this, Google is reportedly planning to launch a censorship-friendly mobile search engine, wherein its Chinese partners might play a key role in its efforts to expand in that country. However, there are challenges aplenty for Google in China, which the company needs to overcome.Google Takes Alternate ApproachAlthough Google's core services, Google Search, Gmail and YouTube remain blocked in China, the company has played a key role in supporting local tech companies. Google provides digital tools and support to a large number of Chinese app manufacturers, developers and advertisers, who want to reach out to global customers.Google decided to pull out of China in 2010 over censorship issues. However, it has been providing its digital services and tools to many local companies. Reportedly, the company now plans to re-enter the China market and launch a censorship-friendly mobile search engine codenamed Dragonfly.Play Video[2] Local Partnerships Hold the KeyUnderstandably, for Google, partnerships with these local companies will play a key role in convincing the Chinese government to let it expand in China. Google can cite that such partnerships have been helping the Chinese economy to grow.Moreover, such local partnerships could result in Google providing customers its other services such as cloud computing and other business apps, thus helping its business to grow in China. Google recently invested $550 million in Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com, Inc.JD[3] for a 1% stake.Also, in July, Google launched an Artificial Intelligence (AI) game on WeChat. In January, the company signed a patent cross-licensing agreement with Tencent Holdings Limited TCEHY[4] to expand its presence in China. Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Shares of tech giants such as Facebook, Inc. FB[6] and Netflix, Inc.NFLX[7] recently took a hit after the companies reported slowing user growth in their quarterly results.Re-entering the China market won't be that easy given the strict regulations the Chinese government imposes on Internet companies. China has more than 770 million Internet users but most access it with the help of a device running Google's open source Android operating system.However, China has been actively encouraging local tech companies that have seen the rise of search engine giant Baidu, Inc.BIDU[8] and e-commerce behemoth JD.com. Also, Baidu's popularity has grown on the vernacular quotient. This certainly will raise competition for the company. Google has been focusing on this area and launched a Google Translate App in China in 2017. Recently, it also added a file management app to its local Chinese app store.That said, before Google launches any such app, it would require approval from the Cybersecurity Administration from China along with a clearance from the Chinese government. And the laws have become are a lot stricter than they was eight years ago.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Once seen as a force for making our lives better and our brains smarter, tech is now accused of inflaming, radicalizing, dumbing down and squeezing the masses. Tech company stocks have been pummeled from their highs. Regulation looms. Even tech executives are calling for it.</p><p>In the face of such a sustained assault, this might be a good moment for Big Tech to lie low. It could devote some of its mountains of cash - Apple alone has $237 billion in the bank - to genuine good works, and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destiny.</p><p>That is not the path the companies are taking.</p><p>\"The tech companies are not flinching,\" said Bob Staedler, a Silicon Valley consultant. \"Nothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back. Instead, they are expanding. They're going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whiz-bang thing.\"</p><p>There is so much of life that remains undisrupted. The companies are competing to own the cloud - to become, in essence, the internet's landlord.</p><p>When every home has an Amazon Echo, Google Home, an Apple HomePod or some other smart speaker, the companies are already signaling, all human and metaphysical needs will be fulfilled. </p><p>For those who insist on venturing out, there will be driverless cars operated by Big Tech. And the companies are plunging further into artificial intelligence, with consequences unclear even to them.</p><p>To accomplish all this, Big Tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees, which means it needs somewhere to put them. </p><p>This isn't a matter of reconfiguring a floor or two at corporate headquarters. It means building new campuses around the country.</p><p>Big Tech's push into New York City and the Washington area has been well-documented in recent months, with Google bulking up in the first and Amazon planning satellite offices in both. </p><p>But even in its backyard of Silicon Valley, which is a mess of traffic congestion and housing prices that have attained levels even well-paid engineers can scarcely afford, there is a boom that, if anything, is accelerating.</p><p>Anyone who wants to believe Big Tech is chastened should visit a section of San Jose just west of downtown, a jumble of car washes and auto-body shops with a sprinkling of modern apartments. On a short street there is a house nearly a century old, a tiny thing with only one bath. Google bought it and another house last month in a package deal for $4 million, according to county documents reviewed by the San Jose Mercury News.</p><p>Multiply that real estate transaction by dozens, big parcels and small, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to date. Google is planning very long term here. The buses, light rail, Caltrain and Amtrak trains that converge on the Diridon Station transit center will give the company an opportunity to embed mass transit into its growth. The eventual result will be a new Google campus of 8 million square feet with offices for 20,000 workers, a figure that is more than the company's total employment in 2009.</p><p>But Diridon Station is just a part of Google's Silicon Valley expansion. A week before the company got the two houses, it bought a 100,000-square-foot building in Palo Alto, Calif., for $70 million.</p><p>Facebook keeps growing, too. In the spring, it leased 1 million square feet in the Silicon Valley community of Sunnyvale for its fast-growing community operations team. And it will soon move this year into 750,000 square feet in a San Francisco tower, making it the third-biggest tech tenant in the city, after Salesforce and Uber.</p><p>In total, Google's employment increased 21 percent in the last year. Facebook's workforce rose by 45 percent in that time, to 34,000, and it is advertising 2,700 additional jobs.</p><p>Amazon's head count tripled over the last three years, thanks to its warehouses and the acquisition of Whole Foods. It is only the second company in the United States to employ more than 500,000 people - and that is not counting its contractors.</p><p>The expansion underlines the dizzying truth of Big Tech: It is barely getting started.</p><p>\"For all intents and purposes, we're only 35 years into a 75- or 80-year process of moving from analog to digital,\" said Tim Bajarin, a longtime tech consultant to companies including Apple, IBM and Microsoft. \"The image of Silicon Valley as Nirvana has certainly taken a hit, but the reality is that we, the consumers, are constantly voting for them.\"</p><p>\"Much as people are now wary or even unhappy with the outsized power held by Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., they are simultaneously quite dependent on the services they provide,\" said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>Big Tech needs to be regulated, many are beginning to argue, and yet there are worries about giving that power to the government.</p><p>\"The government doesn't have a good clue,\" Bajarin said. \"They're not even asking the kind of questions that would drive to regulation.\"</p><p>Which leaves regulation up to the companies themselves, always a dubious proposition.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUFNEW-618685</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUFNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V3W-GGR1-DY37-D3GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8391</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"873\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Buffalo News (New York)</publicationName><edition>Buffalo News Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 3, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST000DOUS</classCode><className>SMART SPEAKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

Today, digital infrastructure, starting from data servers to optical fibres, from chips to mobile form factors, are taking on the same roles as the railways and waterways of a colonised world.</p><p>Global, multinational technology corporations use proprietary hardware, software, corporate clouds, centralised internet servers to process data and provide 'ready-to-consume' content and services to users around the globe.</p><p>Countries such as India, are often overwhelmed by these readily available services and technology and don't even try to develop indigenous technologies that can compete with the tech giants of the world. Today, control over how technology works in the form of trademarks and patents, form the foundation of digital colonialism.</p><p>Big-tech western companies are colonising the digital economy. Their products are spreading and posing a threat to local industries. At the same time, spreading philosophies of what a digital society should look like, which have captivated local audiences.</p><p>Big tech companies have developed standards and technologies, penetrated deeper into the local markets, managed large footprints globally and achieved economies of scale and market presence. They have also built brand loyalty among both consumers and service providers which cannot be matched by domestic manufacturers.</p><p>India story</p><p>About 97 per cent of telecom equipment used in India is imported. In 2018 India imported about $21 billion worth of telecom equipment, up from $16.2 billion in 2017, even after the government's Make in India push. This is because most of the equipment that is imported has been manufactured and patented by multinationals, which are being assembled and marketed in the country under the same programme.</p><p>If a company like Corning, which manufactures Gorilla Glass that has been included in over five billion devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, wearables; can patent and license its product out to 40 different OEM across the world, why can't Indian manufacturers do the same?</p><p>The challenge lies in IPR. While India adheres to Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, the annual IP index released by the United States Chamber of Commerce (USCC) ranks India as 37 out of 38 countries, for its intellectual property rights environment. And the main reason for this is that the patent protection in India remains outside of international best practices and the laws have not been framed according to India's technological and social status.</p><p>Challenging monopolistic tech</p><p>However, around the world, there is a growing movement to challenge the technological design of the digital society, changing it from one that concentrates wealth and power to the one that brings power to all. For example, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), in its recommendation on promoting local telecom equipment manufacturing, has suggested that India should aim to achieve the objective of 'net-zero' imports of telecommunications equipment by 2022 and create an initial corpus of Rs 1,000 crore for promoting indigenous research, innovation, standardisation, design testing, certification and manufacturing.</p><p>Having said that, homegrown companies have taken IPR seriously and are now delivering to the world. For example, a Bengaluru-based company's transmission products for both 4G LTE and GPON are now on par with offerings from MNCs. The company has hundreds of patents in the US, EU and India and exports to 70 countries. Similarly, another Bangalore-based award winning, patented Software Defined Radio SDR platform company, has recently unveiled its series of Software Defined Radio (SDR) chipsets with over 27 patents, that are optimised to deliver better battery life in mobiles.</p><p>Apart from IPR, India has taken a stand in other areas of Digital Colonisation, for example, in the internet space, Facebook was forced to cancel its \"Free Basics\" programme that gave the social media giant control over the Internet experience on mobile phones. Indians protested that the service deepened Facebook's monopoly power and subjected them censorship and surveillance.</p><p>Today in India, multinational telecom companies like Vodafone, that has the maximum market share is also now being threatened by players like homegrown Reliance Jio, which is quickly expanding in the broadband and LTE space with more competitive tariffs and free data packs.</p><p>As people across the globe gain access to the most sophisticated personal technology, the smartphone, a new generation of developers and creators are emerging. The next generation of technologies, produced outside the tech giants, are aiming to challenge digital colonialism with Intellectual Property and stop the current direction of technology architecture that restricts creativity rather than enabling it and which encourages consumption and centralises power.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDEXP-0047328680</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDEXP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W1X-HY31-DXMP-K05S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">364854</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"873\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Indian Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 3, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001NLJ</classCode><className>TERADATA CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS334111 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>TDC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>International Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Trade Agreements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00090NP</classCode><className>MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000895</classCode><className>IMPORT TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A2A8</classCode><className>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000935</classCode><className>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001301</classCode><className>PATENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CZAG</classCode><className>TRADEMARKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000175</classCode><className>BEST PRACTICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096SA</classCode><className>BRAND EQUITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813910MM</classCode><className>BUSINESS &amp;

Facebook isn't afraid of a few more rules. It's afraid of an antitrust case and of the kind of accountability that real government oversight would bring.\"</p><p>His argument certainly holds water as analysts across financial firms have called Instagram the true engine of growth at the company as user activity appears to plateau on the flagship platform, especially as the company invests in shopping additions to the subsidiary.</p><p>\"We see the near-term bull case supported by improving monetization of Instagram Stories and the eCommerce opportunity, particularly when the company opens up Instagram Checkout from beta,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley said in a recent review of the company.</p><p>If Instagram is taken out of the equation, that could stop the bull case in its tracks.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scale for Solutions</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>However, insiders at the company are beginning to  .</p><p>Facebook's recently installed head of Instagram Adam Mosseri said that breaking up the company would only increase nefarious action, rather than counteract it, during a recent conference,</p><p>\"Personally, if we split it off, it might make a lot of my life easier, and it would probably be beneficial for me as an individual. But I just think it's a terrible idea,\" Mosseri said at Recode's Code Conference just one week ago. \"If you're trying to solve election integrity, if you're trying to approach content issues like hate speech, and you split us off, it would just make it exponentially more difficult - particularly for us at Instagram - to keep us safe.\"</p><p>He explained that security and content teams are integrated across Facebook's current ecosystem and cutting off the parent from its child would leave it orphaned without a guardian.</p><p>His colleague, vice president of augmented reality Andrew Bosworth, added that the economy of scale Facebook provides is the best safeguard against malicious activity.</p><p>Of course, this might appear to be a secondary problem to Facebook's social media overreach for many critics, which begs the question as to whether the warning will be effective.</p><p>The survival of not only Facebook's bull case, but the safety of Instagram appear to hinge upon it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSCSRM-14993425</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSCSRM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCB-2YY1-F00X-J0GT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420101</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"674\"/><timeReceived>3:22 PM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc.

See also: Rise in IoT push government agencies to rethink security[1] He points out that in the summer of 2014, a hacker group with outspoken support for ISIS - called the Cyber Caliphate - overran the Twitter account of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), the unit with overall responsibility for military operations. At the time, he said, media outlets were abuzz with the story, and 'questions regarding ISIS's capabilities to hack into the government's secrets fed the frenzy.' </p><p>Relax, it was a Twitter account. 'The matter of fact is (they were) able to obtain the credentials to a Twitter account, not top secrets,' Alkhouri said. 'Frameworks for such hacking attacks are available, and many online hacking forums have courses for anyone who is interested.' A lot of ISIS cyber-attacks mirror their real-life counterparts - small businesses with less-than-stellar data security that wind up with client personal information being hacked and exposed. Or, as security agencies would say in the real world: soft targets. Alkhouri pointed out that at one point, ISIS hackers made threats against big tech companies like Google, Twitter and Facebook, even claiming to have disrupted Twitter for two hours in one instance. 'There is no substance to the claim, and evidence suggests that they are far from nearing such accomplishment,' he said. 'They are under-sophisticated, and apparently under-funded.'Play Video[2]So IoT is safe\u2026.for nowSo hacking a far more complex network of devices and systems, like the Internet of Things, disrupting major networks, or overrunning critical systems 'are not feasible today,' he said. Recent breathless media\u00a0reports suggesting ISIS was developing a 'Google-style' driverless vehicle[3] for attacks are fanciful at best. 'If this (plan)\u00a0was so (potentially) successful, or even exists in the first place, why keep sending suicide bombers to launch attacks then?' Alkhouri asked. He added that ISIS has claimed to have launched attacks by mobilizing unmanned explosive vehicles and target security sites. 'But the number of claims of credit for this sort of attack are negligible when compared the overall number of attacks ISIS claims responsibility for,' he said. But it doesn't mean we should get complacent. 'Operationally they seem to be on an upward trajectory,' Alkhouri said. 'They have increased the volume of cyber attacks, the (ISIS hackers) have grown in number, and they have received significant online support.' We may not be under imminent threat, but he pointed out 'their cyber capabilities are not expected to stay underwhelming.' But as in real life, it often takes the worst to force action from the public and private sector. David Miller, chief security officer at IoT and cloud security firm Covisint, said similar motivations, balancing advances and privacy against security, will likely mean an ISIS-hacked self-driving car will have done its worst before we do something about it.[4] '(It'll) be like what we've seen with the internet. It'll take until someone actually dies in an autonomous vehicle due to a hack,' Miller told ReadWrite previously.[5] 'That doesn't mean people aren't thinking about security, but usually, there needs to be an actual event before you solve them \u2014 unless there's a government agency that comes in and says 'We're going to regulate exactly what you can and cannot do.'' As cybersecurity experts keep watch, 'companies and governments must beware of this looming threat and take proactive measures against it,' Alkhouri said.

Big tech companies like Tesla, Google, and Uber, as well as major car manufacturers including Toyota, Volvo, and Mercedes Benz, are all racing to perfect driverless technology [2]and have vehicles on the market by the end of the decade. As these technological advances continue, the government is beginning to take steps to create regulations for self-driving vehicles. </p><p>Currently, only California and Nevada have regulators overseeing the operation of self-driving Vehicles. In addition to preparation on a federal level, law enforcement agencies across the country are examining what actions need to be taken, as well as how their roles may change, when self-driving cars become a common sight on the roads[3].Across the nation, 94% of all automobile accidents [4]are a result of driver error. Whether it's a cell phone notification for a new text message, adjusting the in-dash navigation, or browsing through hundreds of radio stations beamed to the car from a satellite, drivers today face more distractions than ever before. It's estimated that autonomous driver cars would reduce the number of accidents on the road, due in part to the programming and avoidance abilities built into these vehicles. Self-driving vehicles will have an even greater impact on law enforcement, as shown in the Self Driving Cars Infographic from Denmon Lawyer[5]. Roughly, 30 percent of tickets written by law enforcement each day are for speeding. This amounts to more than 6 billion dollars a year in fines. As more and more self-driving cars begin to appear on the roads, programming in these vehicles will prevent speeding from ever occurring, cutting into the speeding ticket revenues that law enforcement departments rely on to bring in yearly. What will the roads look like in 2030? Will the automobile as we know it become obsolete[6]? How will we travel and transport goods? What will be getting pulled over by a law enforcement officer in a self-driving car be like? Whether you're behind the dashboard of a self-driving car, or at the wheel of a (soon to be defunct) regular automobile, it's important to be aware of your rights during a traffic stop. As we continue to watch companies around the globe continue to push the envelope of self-driving vehicles, in what could be compared to a modern day 'space race'[7], it will be interesting to see how technological advances and government regulations will coexist. What do you think about the future of self-driving cars and the effect it will have on the government and law enforcement? Leave your thoughts in the comments!

In addition to revelations surrounding new research regulations in process, the hearing, titled 'Cannabis Policy For the New Decade,' included a brief statement from Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) on his personal evolution on this issue, including his opinion that 'Prohibition has clearly failed and America isn't waiting for its government anymore.' Watch the full hearing, linked in the article above.Joe Biden again says no to marijuana legalization without more studies[2] - Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) reiterated his opposition to federal legalization, without more studies. </p><p>Instead, Biden's cannabis reform plan involves rescheduling the plant to make it easier for researchers to access, decriminalizing simple possession and expunging prior cannabis records. Read the full interview here[3].Congress should make cannabis research less cumbersome, APA says in written testimony[4] - The American Psychological Association issued a statement asking Congress to remove roadblocks to cannabis studies, including calling for the Drug Enforcement Administration to be relieved of its role in reviewing requests to conduct such research. Instead, institutional review boards and the FDA are more appropriate bodies to manage this task, said APA Chief Scientific Officer Russell D. Shilling, PhD, in prepared remarks[5]. States FL[6] - Make it Legal Florida will not put a constitutional amendment on the 2020 ballot, the group announced Monday. Instead, it is shifting its focus to a 2022 ballot initiative. Meanwhile, a ballot initiative by Sensible Florida has also stalled. According to the Florida Division of Elections, the group so far has only 92,805 verified petition signatures. The signature requirement for 2020 measures is 766,200.IL[7] - Illinois regulators are investigating some dispensaries for violations of the state law requirement that no more than 40 percent of product inventory come from one cultivator. The law is aimed at preventing cultivators from entering into exclusive agreements with specific dispensaries and making sure all stores have a diversity of products from different sources.KY[8] - David W. Osborne (R), Kentucky's House speaker, said at a hearing on the issue that if medical cannabis is legalized in Kentucky it should not be taxed.NH[9] - New Hampshire lawmakers are looking to legalize low-level cannabis possession and home cultivation without adding a commercial market, an approach similar to Vermont's. A bipartisan bill is scheduled to get a hearing on January 23.NJ[10] - The New Jersey Appellate Division ruled that employers may lawfully reimburse workers for medical cannabis, finding that the payments would not violate the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The court notably rejected the employer's argument that the payments were akin to aiding and abetting a crime and relied on the fact that the employer had failed to show that the federal government aims to enforce the CSA in any state in which medical cannabis has been legalized. Importantly, the court found that compliance with the order does not establish the specific intent element of an aiding and abetting offense under federal law.NJ[11] - A New Jersey court said regulators cannot review new medical cannabis business licenses while applicants who were rejected on technicalities challenge the process.NM[12] - Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) formally asked lawmakers to legalize cannabis during the short 30-day legislative session beginning this month by including the issue in her written session call. Additionally, she asked lawmakers to pass a bill making clear that the state's medical cannabis program applies only to residents, reversing a court ruling to the contrary. The following day, legislators filed an adult legalization bill. Introduced by Sen. Jerry Ortiz y Pino (D) and Rep. Javier Martinez (D), the legislation would allow adults in the state to possess and purchase cannabis from licensed retailers. It also includes a number of restorative justice and social equity provisions. Observers have expressed skepticism of the bill's chances in 2020. We understand that a research bill may be considered as an alternative.RI[13] - Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo (D) submitted a 2021 budget proposal to lawmakers that includes a plan to legalize cannabis and sell it through state-run stores. Already, however, the proposal seems unlikely to succeed as top lawmakers in the state are pushing back against the plan.SD[14] - A cannabis legalization measure officially qualified for the 2020 ballot in South Dakota. The development comes one month after the secretary of state said that a separate campaign to legalize medical cannabis in the state had also submitted the required valid signatures to qualify for the 2020 ballot\u2014meaning that voters will see both medical and adult-use measures when they go to the polls in November. This means South Dakota could be the first state to legalize medical and adult-use at the same time.VA[15] - The ACLU of Virginia said instead of enacting cannabis decriminalization in the short term, it would \"prefer the status quo while we're waiting for full legalization.\" Its comments are in response to proposed bills that would replace a criminal fine with a civil penalty, which the organization finds problematic.WA[16] - Washington State regulators will adopt 18 cannabis enforcement changes recommended by consulting firm Hillard Heintze. Three themes emerged in the firm's recommendations: (1) a need for greater consistency in how interpretations of agency decisions are communicated and applied; (2) a need for greater transparency and understanding by stakeholders about agency decisions and interpretations; and (3) a need for stronger outreach, communication, education and collaboration with the industry. Hemp/CBD Federal[17] - A new bill filed by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson (D-MN) and bipartisan cosponsors would allow the marketing of CBD as a dietary supplement by amending the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to include CBD in the definition of dietary supplements.Federal[18] - A federal judge ruled that CBD maker Green Roads shouldn't face liability claims in a class action lawsuit until the Food and Drug Administration completes a review of policies for such products: 'The FDA regulations currently provide little guidance with respect to whether CBD ingestibles, in all their variations are food supplements, nutrients or additives and what labelling standards are applicable to each iteration,' the judge stated. This decision is likely to be cited by defendants in the current California lawsuits against ingestible hemp product manufacturers and any that may arise in the future. Read the full decision here[19].US Department of Agriculture[20] - The USDA filed a Federal Register notice about a new data collection system it is creating to keep track of hemp production license applications. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments by February 28, 2020 here[21].Cowen's Equity Research[22] - Cowen published its key takeaways from a CBD Policy Summit in Washington, DC, including that 'strong consumer demand is advancing the ball,' according to the results of December 2019 survey of US consumers in which 10 percent of respondents reported having used CBD as a supplement. International EU[23] - The European Commission is proposing a unified EU vote on six pending World Health Organization cannabis scheduling recommendations. If those countries vote as a block, they will represent almost a quarter of the total votes within the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs. Among its recommended actions are: (1) to vote in favor of removing cannabis from Schedule IV of the 1961 convention (which would signal cannabis has therapeutic value while maintaining the status quo); and (2) postponing a vote on adding a footnote saying that 'preparations containing predominantly cannabidiol and not more than 0.2% of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol are not under international control.'Barbados[24] - The island country's agriculture minister said the government plans to begin issuing medical cannabis cultivation licenses next month. Barbados will adopt a tiered approach to cultivation and processor permits, ranging from Tier 1 for small-scale cultivation to Tier 3 for large-scale farms.UK[25] - Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the government will not legalize cannabis anytime soon. 'We have to be very clear controlled drugs, dangerous drugs are unlawful, they're illegal, they're criminal to possess or supply,' he said in an interview with LBC, a London-based national phone-in and talk radio station. Business Metrics[26] - Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics published a report finding that global legal cannabis sales rose 48 percent, to $15 billion, in 2019. Additionally, sales in 2020 are forecast to increase by 38 percent driven by growth in established markets and continued geographic expansion, including Illinois' recreational market opening. 'The disconnect between investor sentiment and the facts on the ground is as dramatic as anything I've seen since the dot.com stock crash of 2000, which happened just as the internet caught fire with consumers,' said Tom Adams, editor-in-chief of Arcview Market Research and managing director of BDS Analytics Industry Intelligence. 'Five billion additional dollars were spent on legal cannabis in 2019 [than in 2018]. That's bigger than the entire legal cannabis market was in 2015.'Cresco[27] - Cresco's Illinois employees joined the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Zach Koutsky, legislative and political director for the local chapter, anticipates far more union involvement in the state's cannabis industry as it grows.Trends[28] - XpertHR finds cannabis one of top HR concerns for 2020. Medical/Health Impaired driving[29] - For those of you who may have been alarmed by headlines claiming that a study showed that cannabis use affects automobile drivers days after use (CNN: 'Weed impairs driving skills long after the high is gone'[30]), here is an article describing the nuances and limitations of the study. To see the original study, click here[31].CBD research[32] - A review concluded that \"pre-clinical research using animal models of innate fear and anxiety-like behaviors have found anxiolytic, antistress, anticompulsive, and panicolytic-like effects of CBD\" and that \"preliminary evidence from human trials using both healthy volunteers and individuals with social anxiety disorder, suggests that CBD may have anxiolytic [i.e., anti-anxiety] effects.\"Magic Mushrooms[33] - A UK-based mental health care company announced it has been granted a US patent for a formulation that includes an active ingredient in psychedelic mushrooms, which the company is researching as a treatment for drug-resistant depression. Basically, 'shrooms' have been patented, which will have a whole host of implications. Stay tuned. Dentons Speaks In 'Ready for the next episode? Antitrust in the cannabis industry,'[34] Cannabis Business Executive, Dentons attorney Ausra Deluard notes that Standard Oil's history appears relevant today as federal antitrust agencies again investigate nascent industries striving for economic efficiency. In particular, she looks at current probes into big tech to provide some context for why the cannabis industry has been subject to antitrust merger investigations, and offers insights into what's ahead in antitrust enforcement.PLEASE NOTE: In light of the impeachment trial, Dentons has rescheduled our Globalization of Cannabis event in Washington, DC, from Jan. 30, 2020 to Mar. 11, 2020.

Previously cannabis technology was a phrase synonymous with San Francisco and Denver, but the tech minds of L.A. are ready to stake their claim a bit closer to home.</p><p> Recently CBRE, the world's largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, gauged the state of the L.A. tech workforce along with 50 others across the United States. Though L.A. is in the middle of the pack overall, it ranked a lot closer to the top when it came to growth. L.A. was home to the largest rise in tech jobs in the country last year. The only place on the continent that did better was Canada's capital, Ottawa. And that was despite the comparative expense of running a tech company in L.A. CBRE's analysis found L.A. to be the seventh most expensive market to run a 500-person tech company needing 75,000 square feet of office space.</p><p> The folks at the California Cannabis Industry Association are watching the L.A. tech wave make its way into the business.</p><p> \"My feeling on Los Angeles is that it really could be a hub for innovation,\" CCIA communications and outreach director Josh Drayton tells L.A. Weekly. He also noted the medical innovation happening at various SoCal universities as proof that local catalysts exist for that kind of big tech.</p><p> The biggest challenge for the continued growth in the sector? Drayton points to ongoing licensing issues. But those same challenges present an opportunity to L.A. technologists to create new solutions.</p><p> According to Drayton, the membership expansion in Southern California for the industry's oldest statewide trade group is a clear indicator that the pot technology scene is less attached to its original incubator the Bay Area. But many of the most innovative minds will face unique regulatory challenges wherever they end up in California, especially if they need to put hands on the plant in-house for R&amp;D purposes.</p><p> \"I think being a tech company is very challenging both inside and outside the cannabis industry,\" Drayton says. \"Tech platforms have become a part of our everyday life, for good and for bad. I think across the board we're trying to figure out what role they could play, should play, and what responsibilities they have.\"</p><p> Drayton referenced Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg testifying in front of Congress. Never mind the Russians, imagine an even scarier situation where user data at a dispensary was breached in a trackable way against something like a driver's license number.</p><p> As for the still unknown regulatory challenges pot tech will face in L.A.?</p><p> \"I know they're taking it slow,\" Drayton says. \"But I do think there is a desire for L.A. to do this right. They have a great leader in Cat Packer [executive director of L.A.'s Department of Cannabis Regulation], who is very thoughtful in going through all the nuances. So I'm cautiously optimistic about the future of cannabis in Los Angeles.\"</p><p> Paragon founder Sam Zartoshty has found himself at the crest of the L.A. pot tech wave over the last few years while working to develop a staffing solution for the industry and leading the popular \"Blunt Talk\" series, which brings together some of SoCal's brightest weed industry minds for Ted Talk\u2013style presentations. Zartoshty did a lap through Berkeley as part of Canopy accelerator's 2016 Berkeley class, which enlightened him on the experiences of developing a platform in both markets.</p><p> \"A lot of people in this industry just aren't ready for new technology. Unless they really need it right away, like the track and trace system and all that. But we're creating recruiting technology, and it's really hard to get people to take the time out of their day to create a profile,\" Zartoshty says.</p><p> Besides convincing operators who not too long were scared of getting locked up to use new tech, there are other issues once your foot's in the door, as Zartoshty sees it. \"You have no idea how hard it is to get a job description from a legacy operator. Most of the corporate people always have one ready to go, but there aren't too many of those in L.A.,\" he says.</p><p>Zartoshty has led Blunt Talk for the past two years, and credits the general enthusiasm for both cannabis and tech in L.A. for its rise in popularity.</p><p> \"Our main advertising for Blunt Talk started through the Los Angeles Cannabis Tech Meetup group. We created that group and it grew organically to 1,800 members. We get a ton of people from the tech industry who are just interested in cannabis, getting a job in the industry or starting a company,\" Zartoshty says.</p><p> One of the most notable trends he's seeing is the rise of blockchain technology in the cannabis space. There are tons of folks trying to integrate the tech into the inventory supply chain. We asked Zartoshty if that kind of tech was over the top in an age where so many proven inventory logistics mechanisms could be integrated from other industries. \"I don't want to talk down about what anyone is doing, but it's definitely overkill. At the end of the day, I think there is going to be one solution,\" he says. Zartoshty thinks the fact that hundreds of people are working on blockchain inventory controls will result in a higher-quality product in the end but it's going to take a lot longer.</p><p> When he first headed north for the accelerator program in Berkeley, Zartoshty says, he was focused on being in the heart of the regulated cannabis industry. He would spend the first few months saturating himself in the cannabis scene before spreading his wings.</p><p> \"What I learned is the Bay Area cannabis community is a lot harder to break into than the L.A. cannabis community. What I felt like in Berkeley? I felt like an outsider. It's a lot harder to build relationships in Oakland and San Francisco than it is down here,\" Zartoshty says.</p><p> After his rough start in pot, things would go a lot better on the Silicon Valley side of things for Zartoshty.</p><p> \"They were a lot more open to helping me out. They really liked the idea of helping me because they found the cannabis industry interesting. And I got a ton of great advice from going outside of cannabis into Silicon Valley,\" Zartoshty says.</p><p> Another SoCal-born pot tech mind who came home after a lap through the Bay Area is Eaze founder Keith McCarty. Eaze's consumer-facing platform \u2014 which allowed permitted dispensaries to deliver under the Eaze brand as Eaze handled the back-end tech \u2014 made waves as it expanded from San Francisco. Now back home, closer to his roots, McCarty hopes to have similar success connecting brands to licensed retailers with his new effort, Wayv, which has planted its flag in Silicon Beach.</p><p> \"We're really focused on the logistics,\" McCarty tells L.A. Weekly. \"There are a lot of additional complexities in this very quick-growing industry, all the new regulations that are coming out and ever-changing. And we feel the logistics through technology is really the only way to scale in the way that these brands and retailers need to.\"</p><p> McCarty notes that's not some random hypothesis but a result of the experiences he had in his role at Eaze. Even before the challenges of the legal market, McCarty saw how much trouble some people had keeping their shelves stocked.</p><p> \"I think what we're really trying to solve is not only streamlining the process through the technology but layering the compliance features so that as they're navigating through the technology, it's just working and they don't have to worry about compliance at all. It just happens automatically,\" McCarty says.</p><p> We asked McCarty what it's been like developing Wayv in L.A. after a decade in San Francisco. When he first got to San Francisco, most of the startups in the area weren't located in the city, but as time passed the number soared and presented the challenges of what became one of the most absurd commercial real estate markets in the world.</p><p> \"If I wasn't in cannabis, I would probably still be in the Bay Area,\" McCarty says. \"But because L.A. is the biggest market in the world, and also because Silicon Beach has come along so much with Bird and other companies popping up, I just think there is an incredible amount of talent. Much more so than 10 years ago, when I made the decision to move.\"</p><p> McCarty said both cities are amazing but, at this intersection of time and the cannabis industry, L.A. is where he needs to be. As for the rest of the L.A. pot tech scene?</p><p> \"I think people had the same idea we did \u2014 why would you not be in L.A. if you're going to be in the cannabis industry? There is a lot of osmosis for tech in Silicon Valley. In L.A., specifically Silicon Beach, there is a lot of osmosis for cannabis as well as tech.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Sam Zartoshty's \"Blunt Talk\" series offers Ted Talk\u2013 style presentations for the weed industry.

There have been too many scandals - from election interference to online bullying and the glorification of self-harm - for the government to avoid taking action.</p><p>Big tech firms such as Facebook and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">Google</url> may have hoped to stave off external interference by establishing various initiatives designed, for instance, to tackle the spread of misinformation and the publication of harmful material. While those steps have proved too late, and too little, nascent schemes are likely to become important under the proposed regulatory regime, with companies required to show they are meeting a mandatory \"duty of care\" towards users.</p><p>The work will not, therefore, wholly go to waste. Judging by recent remarks by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">Mark Zuckerberg</url>, governmental intervention may indeed be welcome (though the possibility of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">being held personally liable</url> might not be).</p><p>Free speech campaigners have already expressed concern that new rules might hamper the ability of individuals to express legitimate views online. That anxiety is not to be sniffed at, although we may (fortunately) be some distance from the kind of case which has seen a British woman arrested in Dubai for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">calling her ex-husband's new wife a \"horse\"</url> on       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">Facebook</url>.</p><p>In reality, the right to freedom of expression has always been limited in one way or another. Even beyond the strictures of the law, there are all sorts of restrictions that we set by voluntary codes or social conventions. The classic example about causing a panic by falsely shouting fire in a theatre (which emanates from a 1919 US Supreme Court judgement written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr) is a useful analogy for the online era, when so many fake claims are thrown around precisely to whip up disorder.</p><p>Read more</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg asks governments to help control internet</p><p>This isn't to say that regulating online content is an easy task. For one thing, defining harm is not necessarily straightforward. In cases involving terrorist propaganda or images depicting physical abuse there may be few arguments, but what about a forum discussion around self-harm - where does mutual support between individuals looking for help end, and the encouragement of vulnerable people to inflict injuries on themselves begin? And this is without even getting into the minefield that is party politics. </p><p>Another key question will be exactly who it is that should be subject to new regulation. The internet is not a sector in and of itself, but rather a platform on which other sectors operate. Many of those are already subject to industry-specific regulation.</p><p>The media is an obvious example, with editorial content already subject to various voluntary or statutory codes (as well as to the common law). If the new regulator is to be confined to social media companies then defining its membership might be manageable, but when ministerstalk blithely about holding \"big tech\" to account, it raises more questions than it answers.</p><p>For the public, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">a multiplicity of regulators is highly confusing</url> - which is perhaps why there is sense in the idea that an existing body,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">Ofcom</url>, could be given an expanded mandate; rather than yet another organisation being established.</p><p>Read more</p><p>The media should never have published the New Zealand shooting video</p><p>Whoever gets the job will therefore have a tricky balance to strike. And frankly, however successful they are in achieving that, criticism will be inevitable - no regulator pleases everyone, especially not when it is dealing with subjective issues like freedom of expression. (I speak from personal experience, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">having worked in press self-regulation</url> for nearly two decades.)</p><p>On the plus side, Britain has a strong tradition when it comes to practical regulation and there are reasons to think that a code of practice can be developed which defends relevant freedoms while at the same protecting internet users from abuse, misinformation and other harm.</p><p>But can we totally avoid the Brexit question in all this? There is a peculiar paradox that the internet - that great symbol of the globalised world - has been weaponised to particular effect by politicians promoting variations on a nationalist theme; and now here we are considering nation-based regulation of an international monolith.</p><p>Quite aside from the business considerations in all this - to wit, will regulation here make online firms less likely to invest in Britain? - there is a simple issue about the capacity of a UK-based regulator handling complaints about material posted by individuals living elsewhere to internet platforms registered beyond British shores.</p><p>This isn't to say that international regulation is necessarily the answer (that brings with it interesting challenges of its own). Nevertheless, there can be little doubt that the development of an effective regulatory structure will require significant cross-border co-operation - just at a time when that notion is at its least fashionable.  </p><p>Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent Minds</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-52824003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV5-1VC1-JCJY-G0YW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"899\"/><timeReceived>12:46 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 8, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

What's actually happening is that they very likely are going to get a better plan for less money.</p><p/><p>CHRISTIE: The fact is that the president didn't tell the truth. It turns out not to be true that people could keep their insurance policy.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Former Congressman Alan West joins us.</p><p/><p>Good evening, sir.</p><p/><p>ALAN WEST, (R), FORMER CONGRESSMAN: Good evening, Greta. It's a pleasure to be with you.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Nice to have you.</p><p/><p>Well, from all those sound bites, it sounds like the president's critics are really going heavy handed on calling him a liar.</p><p/><p>WEST: Well, there is no doubt that the president did, I believe, purposefully deceive the American people in order for his, you know, signature policy, the Obamacare, to be able to get passed. And now, we see truth come to power in the fact that this thing is -- you know, we talked about it before, Greta. It's based upon very false premises and it's not going to be able to sustain itself and it's not ready to be rolled out. And the fact that you are having so many Americans being forced off of their private insurance plans to try to get them to go into these exchanges, which are not being well-run and well orchestrated, this is a calamity.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I will tell you that in putting together that opening, we actually looked to see if any Democrats supported the president today, said anything. It is a holiday in Washington today. You know, we can't even -- the Democrats are rather silent with what is going on except with the Congressman Debbie Wasserman Schultz on it. What in the world can the president do to bail himself out and bail the American people out so that those who are harmed are not harmed by it?</p><p/><p>WEST: Well, first of all, you did see 15 Democrat Senators have impromptu meeting with the president last week for about two hours. And Alaska Senator Mark Begich called it a crisis in confidence. I think right now, the president has to take a page from Hillary Clinton and hit the restart button and go back to the start and say, OK, this thing is not ready for prime time, let's scrap this. Let's start truly having some bipartisanship and let's sit down and talk about free-market solutions. Let's, first of all, solve the crisis of 4.2 million Americans who have lost their private insurance plans. Let's see how we can work with the insurance industry and get those plans back.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Do you think he will do that or can do that because this is his signature accomplishment, what is he very proud of as president of the United States? There are other -- not to say that the Navy SEALs getting Usama bin Laden wasn't huge as well. But this is something that he has been very adamant that he was standing behind. Do you think that he has it in himself to say, look, it's not working for a lot of Americans, let's put it on hold and let's see if we can fix it?</p><p/><p>WEST: Well, the short answer is. No, I believe that his arrogance precludes him from doing that and admitting that he was wrong, that he took the wrong approach with trying to have a government-centric health care solution to the problems that we see. And the American Health care Reform Act that the Republicans Study Committee has brought forth, Dr. Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, has done a great job. He is an orthopedic surgeon. I think the president should listen to him.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I will tell what you is so deeply disturbing about the law. Right now, a lot of Democrats are very upset. Republicans have always been upset about it. But a lot of Democrats are upset the medical device tax because a lot of them have hit their constituents. They are very upset about it. They're upset about individual policies, other constituents that have been canceled since they don't have -- meet the full requirements of Obamacare requirements. And they are upset about the website not working. Well, with the exception of the website not working -- and, of course, they are upset because of a funding problem, too. With the exception of the website not working, these problems were evident from day one. But not one of them bothered to read the bill or fully understand it. They just sort of signed off on it. Not a single person. And so I don't have a lot of sympathy because they should have known about these things if they had spent, you know, a little time looking at the bill.</p><p/><p>WEST: Well, contrary to what the DNC chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, has said, the Democrats are upset with this whole rollout because of politics, not because of policy. Republicans are upset because it is bad policy. But the Democrats are concerned about what this will do for them, all of those members of the House and those Senators that are up for re-election in 2014. That's the only care and concern that they have. If this thing was going a little bit better, they would be all behind it. Now they are somewhat like the rats on the Titanic, seeking to jump off to save their own self-interest.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I must say, Senator Mary Landrieu -- and I'll probably talk about it later in the show -- put up a bill -- she is a Democrat -- in the Senate, which, even if it passed, it is absurd. It couldn't possibly work. What she wants is just something you can't do. You can't order insurance companies to do what she wants.</p><p/><p>WEST: But that's -- that's her trying to show some type of care and concern because she is running in a tough re-election --</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: She is in trouble.</p><p/><p>WEST: -- in a red state.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Yeah.</p><p/><p>WEST: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Right.</p><p/><p>WEST: So it's not about her caring about policies. It's about politics.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: \"Guardian of the Republic,\" a new book coming out by you, hitting the shelves in April.</p><p/><p>WEST: Yeah.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Does that mean -- a lot of times, people write books to give us notice that they are running for office again?</p><p/><p>WEST: Well, it's not so much about running for office again. I will continue to serve this country. And that's why I would say happy Veterans Day to all my brothers and sisters that are out there. We all took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. We are all guardians of this great republic. I want to talk about the early lessons of my life, the influence of my parents, my political philosophy, and what I see as far as a vision, a way ahead to go out of this crisis and restore this great republic to the greatness that it can be and should be. I think that it's so important that we have folks that will lay out a strategic plan and a blueprint for that to occur. If the American people call me back to serve, I will be happy to do it.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Congressman, happy Veterans Day, because you are, indeed, a vet.</p><p/><p>To those who are watching, we are going to talk about Veterans Day later because this is a very important day to our country.</p><p/><p>Congressman, thank you, sir.</p><p/><p>WEST: Thank you. And it's an honor to serve. Take care, Greta.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: OK. Viewers, if you know someone sick, it can be really scary for them with all this Obamacare uncertainty. The very people who were supposed to get the most help, could be in the biggest trouble. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin is here next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Time is running out for the people who need health insurance the most. In many states, seriously ill patients in high-risk pools are in danger of losing the coverage that they have. It gets worse, even scarier in that they may not be able to enroll for new plans in time.</p><p/><p>Oklahoma is one of those states.</p><p/><p>Governor Mary Fallin joins us.</p><p/><p>Good evening, Governor.</p><p/><p>MARY FALLIN, (R), GOVERNOR OF OKLAHOMA: Good evening, Greta.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Governor, the people who are in the high-risk pool are ones that we care so deeply about because they are the ones who are sick. What is going on in Oklahoma? What is this risk?</p><p/><p>FALLIN: Well, we are very worried about those people because they are the ones who are the sickest, the ones that need health insurance coverage the most. They're the ones who might have cancer, leukemia, diabetes and heart problems. They are the ones in our risk pools, as they are in many other states. As we know, the health insurance exchanges haven't worked the way they were supposed to work. At the end of this year, December 31st, we have over 850 Oklahomans in that risk pool who at risk of losing insurance and they are the ones who need the health insurance coverage the worse because they're the sickest.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: So what are we going to do? What are you going to do? What is the president going to do?</p><p/><p>FALLIN: Well, I don't know. But something needs to be done. And the administration needs to do something about this particular issue. You know, come December 31st, they may not have any coverage at all. It's a federal issue. And I think a lot of people in Congress have been saying that we should delay the implementation of the Obamacare health care law just because there are so many different glitches that are coming up. But it is a federal issue but it's affecting our states.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Is it more catastrophic than that? Because a lot of them are losing their insurance. They have had cancellations, right? They have got to get into this Obamacare and the high risk, am I right?</p><p/><p>FALLIN: That's right. And they can't because the --</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: All right. So, here's the problem. If they have had their policies canceled, they are very sick, they are in the high risk, they are up against a deadline, they can't get the insurance, but even if we could get their old insurance back, it doesn't exist to get back. So we are really squeezing these people.</p><p/><p>FALLIN: That's right. It is the people who don't need to be squeezed because they are already ill and needing health care coverage right now. It's just a very unfortunate circumstance. My hope is Congress and the administration will do something about this. Time is running out. It's December 31st.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Like what?</p><p/><p>FALLIN: We'll they're going to have to either --</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Like what because --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>FALLIN: I want to delay the implementation of the law. Just delay the implementation.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: But even if they delay the implementation, because you have the law, the insurance company, a lot of them have gotten out of these policies to begin with, and you can't order the insurance companies --</p><p/><p>FALLIN: That's right.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: You can't order the insurance companies -- you know that old policy you just canceled? Well, now, we want you to sell it and to sell it to a really sick person who is high-risk who going to cost you more than the premium. They don't even want those people. They don't want the high-risk ones.</p><p/><p>FALLIN: That's exactly right. That's why this health care law has been such a mess. We knew it was going to be complicated. The president promised these people that if they liked their health insurance, they could keep it, they could keep their doctor, their premium rates would go down. And we're seeing all those things haven't worked out and, frankly, just weren't true.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Governor, one other note. Good news. I like to report it. The Feeding Oklahoma Food Drive.</p><p/><p>FALLIN: Yes.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Your goal was 1.4 million meals. And according to what - - I was doing a lot of research on you today and on your program out there -- is that the state of Oklahoma and your Feeding Oklahoma Food Drive, 2.9 million meals to help the hungry in Oklahoma. That's more than twice than what you expected?</p><p/><p>FALLIN: Well, thank you. Yes, it was. And, you know, this is a very challenging time when you go into the Thanksgiving holiday season, Christmas time, and people want to be with their families. And we have food insufficiency in America and certainly here in Oklahoma. This is my fourth year to do a Feeding Oklahoma Food Drive. It's one of the ways I can give back. I'm thrilled at our results. We had so many different companies, foundations, organizations and people that donated food and we worked on it for a month. So 2.9 million meals is a lot of meals. Thank you for recognizing that.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Indeed. It is, indeed, a lot of meals. A lot of citizens around this country really want to help people all the time, not just, you know, at the time of the holidays. I know you got hit so badly with that tornado and Oklahoma has been hurting pretty badly, so I thought I would give you a shout-out for that.</p><p/><p>Governor, thank you. Thank you for joining us.</p><p/><p>FALLIN: Thank you. I appreciate it.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: And <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>making another promise to the American people, saying he will help fix the problem with the canceled insurance. What in the world can he do? How can he possibly keep this promise in light of where we are? That's next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: What would do you if a convicted felon showed up at your door demanding money? Two college students in Washington State had to think quickly when that happened to them. The criminal trying to barge into the students' Gonzaga University Apartments. That's when one of the students pulled out a gun. The convicted felon ran off when he saw the pistol. Police arrested him soon after. But the criminal is not the only one on trouble. The students are now on university probation and could face disciplinary action. The school says they violated a policy forbidding guns in university owned housing.</p><p/><p>Now, you be the judge. Should the students be in trouble for having a gun or not? Go to Gretawire.com right now and vote in our poll.</p><p/><p>And coming up, should a top tech official take time out from fixing healthcare.gov to testify in before of Congress? That is the fight heating up right now on Capitol Hill. The latest coming up.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>now insisting his administration will do everything it can to help Americans with canceled insurance plans. But think about it. Like what? Does the president have any options to fix this giant mess?</p><p/><p>\"The Weekly Standard's\" John McCormack joins us.</p><p/><p>OK. The president -- and I believe the president wants to fix this, but like what? What are the options?</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK, REPORTER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: There aren't a lot of good options right now.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Are there any bad ones?</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK: What health insurance experts are saying right now, industry officials are saying, there is a three-fold problem. First, you need federal law. An administrative fix can't do it. The law says plans that are after March of 2010, those plans are gone. You actually need a law to fix this. Secondly --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Wait a second. Stop.</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK: Yes.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: If had you a plan that the insurance company dumped, let's say, for the high-risk pool that I talked about with Governor Fallin, the government can't change the law and order the insurance company to put that policy back in effect. They can't order insurance companies to do that. Secondly, an insurance company is not going to want to voluntarily do that. You are not going to put in a plan on the table that some high-risk person is going to be drawing a lot of costs out of it for medical care. They don't want to insure the high risk.</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK: There are a lot of people who wouldn't have those problems that that couldn't (INAUDIBLE). Furthermore, there are millions of people who haven't had their plans canceled. If you a pass a law like Ron Johnson's bill that doesn't force insurers to issue the new plans but simply gave them the option, you would have a lot of insurers who want to continue selling their policies --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK: -- losing them each month into next year.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I don't buy it. I think the insurance companies were happy to get out of a lot of these policies. Happy to get out of them. The ones where they have to pay out more in medical bills.</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK: They're certainly regulated at the state level. But insurers aren't exactly doing this for charity. They are selling plans and they're making a profit on this. I have got to think if millions and millions of people are losing their plans -- it might take some times. That's the real issue. Is that if you pass a law allowing them to do, this then you have to have the state insurance commissioners approve these new plans. That usually takes up to a year in some case cases. But -- let's say that's state-level action. You have the states take extraordinary measures, pass laws there, let them waive these regulations. And then you have got the question of whether or not the insurers actually have the time to reconfigure their computers and reissue these plans, send a letter, and give people time to figure out, do I want to go back on my old plan or go into Obamacare? It's a huge mess for the millions of people losing their plans on January 1st. Just a complete disaster. It may be too late for them. That's what I am hearing.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: OK, January. They're losing on January 1st. What you are describing is going to take one, two years, three years to do, right?</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK: It could take months. I don't think it would take years. But I think it will take months.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: All right.</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK: There are people who are going to lose their plans at January to February, all the way to December of next year. You can actually renew your plan in some states through December of next year. For those people, there would be hope if you passed this law --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I tell you people there's very little hope for, the ones who have been canceled and they're in the middle of some regiment of some program, whether it's chemotherapy or whether it's other, some sort of serious medical treatment that they are getting. There is not a lot of hope for them right now under this scenario if they have to wait months.</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK: It's looking like a disaster for them. There is no way to spin that. I don't know what the president going to do.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: You know what? Even Senator Mary Landrieu's bill introduced legislation, required insurers to keep offering current individual plans. That is one of the silliest things I ever heard because you can't order these insurance companies to do this. And it's it the states that regulate it and not the federal.</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK: You can't do it.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: What in the world she introduced that for is beyond me.</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK: It's a violation of state law. I spoke to Senator Ron Johnson today and his plan would merely allow people to --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: -- allow. Not ordered. Allow.</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK: -- which makes sense. He says, I don't want to mislead anyone and give people false hope and think that, oh, they can turn on a dime and reissue these plans on January 1st. For a lot of people, that's not going to happen. What he is trying to do is simply give them the chance. He might as well try.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Yeah.</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK: At least try to give them the opportunity.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Right. And insurance companies are in business. They are not charities.</p><p/><p>Anyway, John, thank you.</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK: Thank you.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Coming up, a doctor who is not only losing his own insurance but there is so much more he is losing. A doctor's personal Obamacare nightmare is next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Now get ready to \"Speed Read\" your way through the news.</p><p/><p>Right now, the \"USS George Washington\" aircraft carrier getting ready to head to the Philippines. It will bring medical supplies, food, water and temporary shelters to the typhoon-ravaged nation. The aircraft carrier is expected to arrive in the next 48 to 72 hours. U.S. Marines, international agencies, including Samaritan's Purse are already on the ground with supplies. The killer storm leaving many roads impassable. The country's president declaring a state of national calamity. They government saying more than nine million people devastated by the typhoon. 10,000 feared dead. Dead bodies lining the streets and hundreds of thousands are homeless. Tonight, more bad news for the Philippines. Another tropical storm is headed their way. Also tonight, several deaths from Typhoon Haiyan reported in Vietnam.</p><p/><p>Back in the United States, looks like governor and presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, has a new mission. Governor Romney working on bringing the Olympics to Boston in 2024. He's acting as advisor to a group exploring the Olympic bid. You will remember, in 2002, Governor Romney was the Salt Lake City Olympics Organizing Committee president. He tells the \"Boston Globe,\" \"Boston will be a fantastic place for the summer games.\"</p><p/><p>And now to Oregon. Last week we told you about a middle school football coach who got fired for planning a team party at Hooters. Well, over the weekend, that controversial party happened, and we have the video. Hooters waitresses lining up to cheer for the young football players as they arrived for the post-season party. Hooters paid for the party and made a donation to the school's sports' program.</p><p/><p>And that's tonight's \"Speed Read.\"</p><p/><p>Get ready. A war is breaking out here in Washington. House Oversight Committee chair, Darrell Issa, taking no prisoners, has issued a subpoena to one of the top officials working to fix healthcare.gov. The Obama administration is furious and so is ranking Democrat, Elijah Cummings. Is he demanding Chairman Issa withdraw that subpoena.</p><p/><p>Elise Viebeck joins us.</p><p/><p>Nice to see you, Elise.</p><p/><p>ELISE VIEBECK, REPORTER, THE HILL: Thanks, Greta.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Who has been subpoenaed and why.</p><p/><p>VIEBECK: This is the chief technology officer of the United States who works in the White House, and he has been enlisted to help fix this struggling health care enrollment site. He is one of the main people helping to organize this effort.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I thought Jeffrey Zients was one of the maim people. And I thought his boss, where the buck stops, was HHS Secretary Sebelius. Who are these other people?</p><p/><p>VIEBECK: You are right on both counts. But, no, they are bringing all the talent they have to the table fort his. This Todd Park is some guy who has done billions of dollars of work in health care I.T. They really trust him. They think is he going to be great. All his former colleagues have praised him to the skies and all kinds of papers. But now, Darrell Issa is saying that he needs to show up to Capitol Hill to tell lawmakers what's going on. Initially, he refused to do that.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: When was he tasked to fix the site?</p><p/><p>VIEBECK: I believe in the beginning of October. As soon as they found out that all the problems were happening, that's when they brought the team in.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: And they can't find two hours where they can relieve this guy so he can testify before Congress, which has an obligation to do oversight?</p><p/><p>VIEBECK: That's what they are saying, that it would be too disruptive to his efforts to fix the website for him to not only testify on Capitol Hill but also to prepare his testimony. Because, obviously, these officials don't just show up. They are coached beforehand on how to answer.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: If he has been working on this for six weeks, he ought to have it in the back of his mind. These answers ought to be pretty easy.</p><p/><p>VIEBECK: I think it's a little bit hard to believe that a couple of hours can't be spared for an official. I'm not on the inside of these repairs. At the same time, this is an important hearing. Darrell Issa, it's his first one as Oversight Committee chairman. So we are going to find things out. Apparently, Todd Park is going to show up because he was subpoenaed.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: See, this is what I don't get. I mean, he doesn't need preparation time. I mean, I've done a bazillion depositions over my life and trials.. You want someone who isn't steeped in it if he is the one since the beginning and involved in it. You would think he hasn't been involved. Get it to you or bring an army of associates with him and dispatch somebody to get it.</p><p/><p>VIEBECK: Right. So he has only been involved in the repair effort. The other people that they are calling to testify were involved in actually constructing the site.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: But he is the only one who is resisting the subpoena.</p><p/><p>VIEBECK: That's right. So the White House on his behalf sent Issa a letter saying listen it's really -- we are happy to reschedule they said. We will do it in December as long as the November 30th deadline has already passed and Park's time is a little bit more free. What this underscores is the fact that the White House and Darrell Issa do not get along.</p><p/><p>I mean, that's the bottom line here. This is a spat and caused another spat with congressional Democrats who are batting back at Issa saying withdraw the subpoena and let this guy work. Now there is this big tech campaign saying \"Let Todd Work.\"</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: Does Todd work on weekends?</p><p/><p>VIEBECK: I imagine they do.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: Actually the shutdown for maintenance so maybe they are doing it over the weekend. Maybe he has the weekend free.</p><p/><p>VIEBECK: Right, you would think so. We know Jeff Zients is working around the clock and apparently for no pay although I don't think he needs it.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: So why is it so urgent to Issa that he come before November 30th? The he is willing to come after November 30th?</p><p/><p>VIEBECK: This is Darrell Issa's big chance to look at the rollout.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: He can look at it on December 1st.</p><p/><p>VIEBECK: He can but he wants the answers now. There is a little bit of politics being played here. Of course, Darrell Issa has actually handled it very well. He has been leaking documents excessively throughout these weeks. Internal HHS memos, meeting notes all of us in the media have been very interested in because they shed light on the amount of chaos surrounding all of this in the first week of October.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: Well, let me be a little sarcastic. So I take we weren't getting those documents through transparency of the administration?</p><p/><p>VIEBECK: I don't know. Well, apparently, they finally gave them to Congress, but he has had to issue another subpoena for Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius to get those documents in advance.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: Elise, thank you. It's nice to see you.</p><p/><p>VIEBECK: Thanks, Greta.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: Obamacare causing unthinkable problems for some doctors for themselves, their employees and their patients. Dr. Rick Henegan joins us. Good evening, sir.</p><p/><p>DR. RICK HENEGAN, EMPLOYEES HEALTH INSURANCE CANCELED: Good evening, Greta.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: As I understand it, you have lost your insurance, sir?</p><p/><p>HENEGAN: That's correct our group health plan has been canceled as of about a month ago.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: In terms of you have a number of employees and provide health insurance for them. Have you attempted to find out like go on the web site to see if there is some insurance you can get for them and what the cost would be?</p><p/><p>HENEGAN: Well, right now we are waiting on our broker to get back with us. She is supposed to have some figures for us by the end of this week. The only time I went on the web site to check it out it was down.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: And so what is this doing to your practice?</p><p/><p>HENEGAN: The employees naturally are concerned as everybody. Just like the other millions of Americans that are uncertain about their health insurance as it's been canceled as ours has. We are just waiting to see what kind of premiums are going to be because I have been providing healthcare insurance for my employees for 30 years without a mandate as a benefit. I would like to be able to continue doing that.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: Now, what about your parents? Are you still in a -- are they still able to go to-have you been tossed out of the network? Can they been tossed out of the exchange to see you?</p><p/><p>HENEGAN: Right now, everybody still has their insurance until the end of this year. It's not affecting me at this point. We can't find our name anywhere on the exchange. Our patients can't that go on 00 exchange. We have no idea how to get on it. Nobody has contacted us about that. So we are looking into that right now.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: About how many patients, what's the number of patients that might involve? People who are looking to find you on the exchange and can't at this point?</p><p/><p>HENEGAN: Well, for our entire practice, there is six providers that would be thousands of people that would be looking.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: And so what -- I mean, are you a little panicked? Are you making calls and saying look we have got to fix this? I'm a doctor not a business person. I would like to spend my time taking care of patients and not on hold listening to some healthcare hold line?</p><p/><p>HENEGAN: Well, we're doing everything we can to try and contact the state exchange to find out what's going on. They are not very responsive. We haven't been given any information about it to begin with. But they definitely have enforced all regulations from Obamacare in terms of the electronic health records.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: All right, in terms, and I know there is a major headache right now and very terrifying to a lot of people who have had their insurance canceled. I'm curious, overall do you have optimism for Obamacare or do you think it would be better to sort of scrap and it starts all over? What's your thought on it?</p><p/><p>HENEGAN: I would like to scrap it and start all over. I just don't believe that anything that's not patient/doctor centered is going to work to the betterment of the healthcare of the American people. You know, when government gets involved as we have seen with this rollout, it's inefficient. It's going to be way more costly than it could have been and I think there is some very good ideas that other people have about how to reform healthcare in this country that are far better than what we are looking at now.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: Doctor, thank you very much. I always thought there ought to be more discussion when developing a program, talked more to doctors and patients than sort of business people and insurance and politicians. And, you know, might be a little better in terms of how we treat people and how we take care of them. Doctor, thank you.</p><p/><p>HENEGAN: Thank you. I would like to say Happy Veterans Day to my brother, Pat, and all the other veterans out there, thanks.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: Indeed, happy Veterans Day to your brother and everybody else. Thank you, sir.</p><p/><p>Straight ahead, something terribly wrong the state promising to build one of the best exchanges in the nation doesn't have a single enrollment. That's next.</p><p/><p>Also Bill Cosby finally answering the question America's been asking for decades. Start guessing what that question is using #greta and you will hear from Bill Cosby coming up.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: OK, everyone. It's time to hash it out. Tim Tebow news, Yahoo tweeting former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow is considering a career in college broadcasting. Tebow hiring a prominent broadcast agent to scope out TV jobs, but Tebow isn't giving up on his football career not just yet. He is reportedly still interested in landing an NFL gig. He was released from the New England Patriots earlier this year.</p><p/><p>And funny man, Bill Cosby, answers America's burning question, TMZ tweeting Bill Cosby reveals his favorite kind of Jell-o. Cosby famously starred in Jell-o ads for decades, but is he really a fan of the desert?</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is Jell-o that good? Do you still eat it?</p><p/><p>BILL COSBY, ACTOR: Yes.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's your favorite kind?</p><p/><p>COSBY: Chocolate.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: And there you have it. The U.S. Postal Service getting help from unexpected ally \"The Washington Post\" tweeting Amazon to deliver on Sundays using Postal Service fleet just in time for the holiday season. The Postal Service will ship Amazon's packages on Sundays at no extra charge. The Sunday delivery service is offered in Los Angeles and New York City and will expand to other parts of the country next year. The officials hope the partnership will help the struggling Postal Service.</p><p/><p>This is not your average tattoo. \"Time\" tweeting Google's lie detecting neck tattoo probably won't improve your dating life. Google's Motorola mobility division filing the patent for the bizarre tattoo. It's not a permanent ink tattoo, but instead an electronic tattoo that sticks to your skin. The tattoo included an imbedded microphone that connects to a mobile device and also includes a lie detector function, creepy.</p><p/><p>And talk about coincidence? \"Huffington Post\" comedy tweeting thieves on the lamb after stealing 160 sheep from a town called \"Wool,\" the case of the missing sheep stumping police in England. Authorities say the sheep were stolen sometime between Sunday and Monday, and the thieves would have needed a large vehicle to pull off the heist. Now it's your turn to hash it out with us. Use #greta on all your tweets and posts.</p><p/><p>And coming up, a healthcare exchange with zero enrollment, that's right, zero, that story next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: All right, let's go off the record for a minute. What's going on? We have gone from what was our favorite national sport baseball to being poisoned by steroids, horrible? College football another favorite and now one of the most famous franchises, Penn State, is now scarred, all those sexual abuse charges known by coaches and simply ignored.</p><p/><p>And now the NFL, are they ruing it for us? The nation has loved football. I love football, but the NFL is beginning to look bad. Former New England Patriot's tight end, Aaron Hernandez in jail on a murder charge and of course, the NFL knew he was in trouble long before the rest of us.</p><p/><p>A history of violence and run in with police and there are lots of other players with criminal run-ins. Now the NFL embroiled in ugly scandal in the Dolphins locker room. It's very painful. Here is Shannon Sharp talking about Richie Incognito's use of racial slurs.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SHANNON SHARPE, CBS AND DOTBALL ANALYST AND RETIRED NFL PLAYER: I'm so disappointed. I just hope that someone was misquoted. I hope I'm wrong and they didn't allow, Richie Incognito, to say this racially charged word in an open locker room and go unchecked. That's unacceptable. I'm embarrassed for -- because if he said that to Jonathan Martin, he didn't only say it he is talking to you too because if you are black, you know what that word means.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: I'm sure you all have a view on this current controversy and I know some of you non-African-Americans think African-Americans say it to each other so it must be OK. It's not. It's not OK. It's mean, it's degrading and you know what? African-Americans should stop saying it, too. And hip hop artists should stop using it in song lyrics. It's not funny and not clever.</p><p/><p>It fuels the nonminority idiot ignorant of history is thinking it's OK to say it it's not. It's wrong no matter who is saying it and when. That's my off-the-record comment tonight. If you have an important story or issue you think I should take off-the-record go to gretawire.com and tell us about it.</p><p/><p>Listen to this, if you thought the federal Obamacare web site was a mess, it is and has low enrollment. It has. You will be stunned to hear exchange even worse. The Oregon healthcare exchange has not enrolled a single person. A.P. reporter, Jonathan Cooper is here with more. Jonathan, is that correct? Not a single person?</p><p/><p>JONATHAN COOPER, \"ASSOCIATED PRESS\": That's correct.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: What happened? What's going on in Oregon?</p><p/><p>COOPER: Well, they set the bar really high. They tried to do -- they thought they were going to get one of the nation's biggest and best exchanges and didn't have enough time to pull it off. So right now the online enrollment system doesn't even -- it's not even launched if you go to their web site, it's not there.</p><p/><p>And that's because they say that it can't accurately determine whether you are eligible for Medicaid, children's health insurance program, how much tax credit you are eligible for especially in complex family situations. They say they're not going to launch it until it can work properly.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: How can they not have enough time? I mean, you know, they have had, what, three and a half years? That's the first thing. Secondly, if it is such a disaster, did they notify HHS, Sebelius, saying, you know, let's put the brakes on it because we have the state exchange and we promised the people of Oregon and it's an abject failure.</p><p/><p>COOPER: Well, they were -- the exchange had a risk consultant that issued monthly reports and, you know, going back at least a year of the consultant was saying that it's a real danger that October 1st isn't going to happen and they stuck with it. You know, they said that if -- it will be worth the extra headaches I guess to get this extra functionality. They want to, you know, they think that in the end if they -- it will be worth the wait.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: You say they stuck with it. Who is the \"they,\" number one? Who is the one behind that and secondly, you are running up against a deadline in terms of insurance. So, you know, I don't know why they didn't listen to their risk consultant. I don't know why they bothered to pay risk consultant if they are not going to pay attention to them.</p><p/><p>COOPER: They being the leaders of the health insurance exchange and you can still -- the online system doesn't work. So they have told everybody that wants to sign up to fill out these paper applications. They are 19 pages long. They ask a ton of questions about family background and income and then you have to mail that in and then a person human by hand they have hired 400 extra workers to help out, going through these by hand and trying to do the calculations to find out what you are qualify for as they mail that back to you.</p><p/><p>Then you can kind of use that information to decide what you want. You mail it back. It's a multi-week process instead of the one hour or so that it would take, you know, to go on the web site and go through it like travelocity as it was.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: Assuming beings of course, of course, the one hour to would take assuming it would work, but it doesn't. Jonathan, thank you and good luck in Oregon. I hope you can get it working. Having zero is pretty bad. Thank you, Jonathan.</p><p/><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: And coming up, America's salutes its veterans, but many veterans finding a whole new battle when they come home to the United States. You are going to hear from them coming up you. Of course, don't forget to watch \"HANNITY\" tonight at 10 p.m. Eastern. Former Governor Sarah Palin is Sean's guest. That's tonight at 10:00 p.m. Eastern on \"HANNITY.\"</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: Now it's time to show you what we are watching. We put together the most fantastic videos out there tonight take a look, terrifying moments as a power boat doing a back flip. The boat was racing at 135 miles per hour when it flips over, the boat summer assaulting one and half times through the air then it finally lands top down on the water. The power boat racer was not hurt and hundreds of spectators got the thrill of a lifetime.</p><p/><p>Lady Gaga known for her wild costumes now hitting new heights, Lady Gaga unveiling the world's first flying dress. The battery-powered dress lifting Gaga several feet off the ground during a launch party for her new album. That's what we are watching.</p><p/><p>Coming up, many of our vets now facing a big struggle right here at home. You're going to hear from them next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MAJOR ANDERSON, TUSKEGEE AIRMAN: The airmen the year 1944, the country -- Kentucky. My first time seeing so many black military officers being from the south and not having ever seen a black military officer. So I knew this was a very unusual type of organization as I learned many years later about the accomplishment of the Tuskegee airmen. So I'm just proud.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: That one of the very proud Tuskegee airmen, one of the first African-American pilots in the U.S. Armed Forces flying during World War II. The nation is paying tribute to them and all our veterans on Veterans Day. One of the best ways to honor them is to help veterans find work when they come home. Griff Jenkins spoke to many of them.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>JOHANNA PEREZ, VETERAN: My name is Johanna and I served two tours to Iraq. I was stationed at Fort Hood, Texas. And, yes, first deployment Baghdad and second was Kirkuk, the northern province.</p><p/><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS: And after two years since retiring from the Army, she is still finding it difficult to get work.</p><p/><p>PEREZ: Well, without exaggerating I think I have filled out about 35 job applications, sent them out and haven't got any calls for any interviews. I have gone to the Veterans Affairs Office and they told me that right now the hiring freeze, you know, there is not much they could do. So they told me flat out, you know, it's just really hard.</p><p/><p>JENKINS (on camera): How long have you been looking?</p><p/><p>PEREZ: Since like a year now.</p><p/><p>(voice-over): Unfortunately, Johanna isn't alone. After serving in the military for 13 years, Jerry Doye rejoined the Army National Guard because he was finding it hard to get by. He says it's just tough out there right now.</p><p/><p>JERRY DOYE, VETERAN: My experience was it was just kind of hard to make it in Montgomery County without -- you know, it's just expensive to live there and with the National Guard it subsidizing a little bit of my income so that I can make it from month to month.</p><p/><p>JENKINS (on camera): So you got out in 2000, you retired then you finally got into National Guard. How hard is the job market out there right now?</p><p/><p>DOYE: It's kind of hard. Just especially for soldiers that are -- who are going to school and then soldiers that have families because, I mean, the pay is OK. But just finding a steady job that pays the bills is just very hard I went through driving a tow truck, working at temp agencies until I found a job pays the bills, but I'm still living check to check.</p><p/><p>JENKINS (voice-over): Brenda Lutz, an Army sergeant who served in Iraq was able to find work after five months on the job market. She also thinks many veterans are struggling.</p><p/><p>BRENDA LUTZ, VETERAN: What was more frustrating for me is that I had soldiers that didn't have the skills or support network that I had when I came back. I already had a bachelor's degree going into the military. I had that working for me when I left the military and then now I have a masters plus professional experiences.</p><p/><p>But I have soldiers that I used to work with who are now leaving the military. They don't have that background and so they are trying to find the guidance and aren't receiving it as they should. I know that the VA is trying to improve helping veterans translate their skills from the military to the civilian world, but I think that's one difficulty for veterans.</p><p/><p>Another difficulty for veterans right now is there is already a high unemployment rate so there is a competition level. But then on top of that, they spent the last decade of their life in a certain skill or a certain environment, certain job, and now that's finished so what do we do now? And we have to figure out a niche or a way that we can improve our personal skills. It takes time to do that translation of skills into the work place.</p><p/><p>JENKINS: And Brenda says that employers should consider hiring veterans.</p><p/><p>LUTZ: I will say hiring a veteran is wonderful because they have a certain work ethic and a support system and belief in themselves because of the training they have received through the military that can help them succeed in any task that they are put on.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>SUSTEREN: And on this Veterans Day, we want to take a moment to salute all current and former members of the U.S. military for their brave service to our country and special thanks also to their families for holding down the fort here at home. See you tomorrow 7 p.m. Eastern. Good night. O'Reilly is next.</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

New information  tonight.  Here is a hint.  Zero on one exchange.  Can President Obama  bail himself out of this mess?  His critics are on fire.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R), GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY:  The president's biggest  problem right now is you have got to tell the truth.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Who committed the greater fraud,  Bernie Madoff or Barack Obama?  Madoff defrauded a few.  This is  defrauding the entire country.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RICK PERRY, (R), GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:  He needs to stand up in front of  the American people and say, you know what, I perpetrated a fraud.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, REAL ESTATE MOGUL:  He totally lied.  He, therefore, got  his Obamacare passed.  Now had Congress had known this, even the  Democrats would have voted against him.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I want to know why we were promised a state-of-the- art website and we got an abacus and a sun dial.  </p><p>To say it's a train wreck is an insult to train wrecks.</p><p>CHRISTIE:  Anybody who has run anything in their lives could see this  coming a mile away.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have never seen anything run so incompetent as  what we have watched.  </p><p>LIMBAUGH:  The president of the United States lied to the entire country  on the most important thing to people, their health care and their  current plan.  </p><p>DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, (D), FLORIDA &amp; DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE  CHAIRWOMAN:  It is a real significant distortion to say that hundreds of  thousands of people are being canceled.  What's actually happening is  that they very likely are going to get a better plan for less money.  </p><p>CHRISTIE:  The fact is that the president didn't tell the truth.  It  turns out not to be true that people could keep their insurance policy.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Former Congressman Alan West joins us.  </p><p>Good evening, sir.  </p><p>ALAN WEST, (R), FORMER CONGRESSMAN:  Good evening, Greta.  It's a  pleasure to be with you.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Nice to have you.  </p><p>Well, from all those sound bites, it sounds like the president's critics  are really going heavy handed on calling him a liar.  </p><p>WEST:  Well, there is no doubt that the president did, I believe,  purposefully deceive the American people in order for his, you know,  signature policy, the Obamacare, to be able to get passed.  And now, we  see truth come to power in the fact that this thing is -- you know, we  talked about it before, Greta.  It's based upon very false premises and  it's not going to be able to sustain itself and it's not ready to be  rolled out.  And the fact that you are having so many Americans being  forced off of their private insurance plans to try to get them to go  into these exchanges, which are not being well-run and well  orchestrated, this is a calamity.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  I will tell you that in putting together that opening, we  actually looked to see if any Democrats supported the president today,  said anything.  It is a holiday in Washington today.  You know, we can't  even -- the Democrats are rather silent with what is going on except  with the Congressman Debbie Wasserman Schultz on it.  What in the world  can the president do to bail himself out and bail the American people  out so that those who are harmed are not harmed by it?  </p><p>WEST:  Well, first of all, you did see 15 Democrat Senators have  impromptu meeting with the president last week for about two hours.  And  Alaska Senator Mark Begich called it a crisis in confidence.  I think  right now, the president has to take a page from Hillary Clinton and hit  the restart button and go back to the start and say, OK, this thing is  not ready for prime time, let's scrap this.  Let's start truly having  some bipartisanship and let's sit down and talk about free-market  solutions.  Let's, first of all, solve the crisis of 4.2 million  Americans who have lost their private insurance plans.  Let's see how we  can work with the insurance industry and get those plans back.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Do you think he will do that or can do that because this  is his signature accomplishment, what is he very proud of as president  of the United States?  There are other -- not to say that the Navy SEALs  getting Usama bin Laden wasn't huge as well.  But this is something that  he has been very adamant that he was standing behind.  Do you think that  he has it in himself to say, look, it's not working for a lot of  Americans, let's put it on hold and let's see if we can fix it?  </p><p>WEST:  Well, the short answer is.  No, I believe that his arrogance  precludes him from doing that and admitting that he was wrong, that he  took the wrong approach with trying to have a government-centric health  care solution to the problems that we see.  And the American Health care  Reform Act that the Republicans Study Committee has brought forth, Dr.  Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, has done a great job.  He is an  orthopedic surgeon.  I think the president should listen to him.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  I will tell what you is so deeply disturbing about the  law.  Right now, a lot of Democrats are very upset.  Republicans have  always been upset about it.  But a lot of Democrats are upset the  medical device tax because a lot of them have hit their constituents.   They are very upset about it.  They're upset about individual policies,  other constituents that have been canceled since they don't have -- meet  the full requirements of Obamacare requirements.  And they are upset  about the website not working.  Well, with the exception of the website  not working -- and, of course, they are upset because of a funding  problem, too.  With the exception of the website not working, these  problems were evident from day one.  But not one of them bothered to  read the bill or fully understand it.  They just sort of signed off on  it.  Not a single person.  And so I don't have a lot of sympathy because  they should have known about these things if they had spent, you know, a  little time looking at the bill.  </p><p>WEST:  Well, contrary to what the DNC chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman  Schultz, has said, the Democrats are upset with this whole rollout  because of politics, not because of policy.  Republicans are upset  because it is bad policy.  But the Democrats are concerned about what  this will do for them, all of those members of the House and those  Senators that are up for re-election in 2014.  That's the only care and  concern that they have.  If this thing was going a little bit better,  they would be all behind it.  Now they are somewhat like the rats on the  Titanic, seeking to jump off to save their own self-interest.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  I must say, Senator Mary Landrieu -- and I'll probably  talk about it later in the show -- put up a bill -- she is a Democrat --  in the Senate, which, even if it passed, it is absurd.  It couldn't  possibly work.  What she wants is just something you can't do.  You  can't order insurance companies to do what she wants.  </p><p>WEST:  But that's -- that's her trying to show some type of care and  concern because she is running in a tough re-election --  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  She is in trouble.  </p><p>WEST:  -- in a red state.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Yeah.</p><p>WEST:  Absolutely.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Right.</p><p>WEST:  So it's not about her caring about policies.  It's about  politics.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  \"Guardian of the Republic,\" a new book coming out by you,  hitting the shelves in April.  </p><p>WEST:  Yeah.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Does that mean -- a lot of times, people write books to  give us notice that they are running for office again?  </p><p>WEST:  Well, it's not so much about running for office again.  I will  continue to serve this country.  And that's why I would say happy  Veterans Day to all my brothers and sisters that are out there.  We all  took an oath to support and defend the Constitution.  We are all  guardians of this great republic.  I want to talk about the early  lessons of my life, the influence of my parents, my political  philosophy, and what I see as far as a vision, a way ahead to go out of  this crisis and restore this great republic to the greatness that it can  be and should be.  I think that it's so important that we have folks  that will lay out a strategic plan and a blueprint for that to occur.   If the American people call me back to serve, I will be happy to do it.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Congressman, happy Veterans Day, because you are, indeed,  a vet.  </p><p>To those who are watching, we are going to talk about Veterans Day later  because this is a very important day to our country.  </p><p>Congressman, thank you, sir.  </p><p>WEST:  Thank you.  And it's an honor to serve.  Take care, Greta.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  OK.  Viewers, if you know someone sick, it can be really  scary for them with all this Obamacare uncertainty.  The very people who  were supposed to get the most help, could be in the biggest trouble.   Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin is here next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Time is running out for the people who need health  insurance the most.  In many states, seriously ill patients in high-risk  pools are in danger of losing the coverage that they have.  It gets  worse, even scarier in that they may not be able to enroll for new plans  in time.  </p><p>Oklahoma is one of those states.  </p><p>Governor Mary Fallin joins us.  </p><p>Good evening, Governor.  </p><p>MARY FALLIN, (R), GOVERNOR OF OKLAHOMA:  Good evening, Greta.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Governor, the people who are in the high-risk pool are  ones that we care so deeply about because they are the ones who are  sick.  What is going on in Oklahoma?  What is this risk?</p><p>FALLIN:  Well, we are very worried about those people because they are  the ones who are the sickest, the ones that need health insurance  coverage the most.  They're the ones who might have cancer, leukemia,  diabetes and heart problems.  They are the ones in our risk pools, as  they are in many other states.  As we know, the health insurance  exchanges haven't worked the way they were supposed to work.  At the end  of this year, December 31st, we have over 850 Oklahomans in that risk  pool who at risk of losing insurance and they are the ones who need the  health insurance coverage the worse because they're the sickest.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  So what are we going to do?  What are you going to do?   What is the president going to do?  </p><p>FALLIN:  Well, I don't know.  But something needs to be done.  And the  administration needs to do something about this particular issue.  You  know, come December 31st, they may not have any coverage at all.  It's a  federal issue.  And I think a lot of people in Congress have been saying  that we should delay the implementation of the Obamacare health care law  just because there are so many different glitches that are coming up.   But it is a federal issue but it's affecting our states.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Is it more catastrophic than that?  Because a lot of them  are losing their insurance.  They have had cancellations, right?  They  have got to get into this Obamacare and the high risk, am I right?  </p><p>FALLIN:  That's right.  And they can't because the --  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  All right.  So, here's the problem.  If they have had  their policies canceled, they are very sick, they are in the high risk,  they are up against a deadline, they can't get the insurance, but even  if we could get their old insurance back, it doesn't exist to get back.   So we are really squeezing these people.  </p><p>FALLIN:  That's right.  It is the people who don't need to be squeezed  because they are already ill and needing health care coverage right now.   It's just a very unfortunate circumstance.  My hope is Congress and the  administration will do something about this.  Time is running out.  It's  December 31st.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Like what?  </p><p>FALLIN:  We'll they're going to have to either --  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Like what because --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FALLIN:  I want to delay the implementation of the law.  Just delay the  implementation.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:   But even if they delay the implementation, because you  have the law, the insurance company, a lot of them have gotten out of  these policies to begin with, and you can't order the insurance  companies --</p><p>FALLIN:  That's right.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  You can't order the insurance companies -- you know that  old policy you just canceled?  Well, now, we want you to sell it and to  sell it to a really sick person who is high-risk who going to cost you  more than the premium.  They don't even want those people.  They don't  want the high-risk ones.  </p><p>FALLIN:  That's exactly right.  That's why this health care law has been  such a mess.  We knew it was going to be complicated.  The president  promised these people that if they liked their health insurance, they  could keep it, they could keep their doctor, their premium rates would  go down.  And we're seeing all those things haven't worked out and,  frankly, just weren't true.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Governor, one other note.  Good news.  I like to report  it.  The Feeding Oklahoma Food Drive.  </p><p>FALLIN:  Yes.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Your goal was 1.4 million meals.  And according to what - - I was doing a lot of research on you today and on your program out  there -- is that the state of Oklahoma and your Feeding Oklahoma Food  Drive, 2.9 million meals to help the hungry in Oklahoma.  That's more  than twice than what you expected?  </p><p>FALLIN:  Well, thank you.  Yes, it was.  And, you know, this is a very  challenging time when you go into the Thanksgiving holiday season,  Christmas time, and people want to be with their families.  And we have  food insufficiency in America and certainly here in Oklahoma.  This is  my fourth year to do a Feeding Oklahoma Food Drive.  It's one of the  ways I can give back.  I'm thrilled at our results.  We had so many  different companies, foundations, organizations and people that donated  food and we worked on it for a month.  So 2.9 million meals is a lot of  meals.  Thank you for recognizing that.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Indeed.  It is, indeed, a lot of meals.  A lot of  citizens around this country really want to help people all the time,  not just, you know, at the time of the holidays.  I know you got hit so  badly with that tornado and Oklahoma has been hurting pretty badly, so I  thought I would give you a shout-out for that.</p><p>Governor, thank you.  Thank you for joining us.  </p><p>FALLIN:  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  And President Obama making another promise to the  American people, saying he will help fix the problem with the canceled  insurance.  What in the world can he do?  How can he possibly keep this  promise in light of where we are?  That's next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  What would do you if a convicted felon showed up at your  door demanding money?  Two college students in Washington State had to  think quickly when that happened to them.  The criminal trying to barge  into the students' Gonzaga University Apartments.  That's when one of  the students pulled out a gun.  The convicted felon ran off when he saw  the pistol.  Police arrested him soon after.  But the criminal is not  the only one on trouble.  The students are now on university probation  and could face disciplinary action.  The school says they violated a  policy forbidding guns in university owned housing.  </p><p>Now, you be the judge.  Should the students be in trouble for having a  gun or not?  Go to Gretawire.com right now and vote in our poll.  </p><p>And coming up, should a top tech official take time out from fixing  healthcare.gov to testify in before of Congress?  That is the fight  heating up right now on Capitol Hill.  The latest coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  President Obama now insisting his administration will do  everything it can to help Americans with canceled insurance plans.  But  think about it.  Like what?  Does the president have any options to fix  this giant mess?  </p><p>\"The Weekly Standard's\" John McCormack joins us.  </p><p>OK.  The president -- and I believe the president wants to fix this, but  like what?  What are the options?  </p><p>MCCORMACK, REPORTER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD:  There aren't a lot of good  options right now.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Are there any bad ones?  </p><p>MCCORMACK:  What health insurance experts are saying right now, industry  officials are saying, there is a three-fold problem.  First, you need  federal law.  An administrative fix can't do it.  The law says plans  that are after March of 2010, those plans are gone.  You actually need a  law to fix this.  Secondly --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Wait a second.  Stop.  </p><p>MCCORMACK:  Yes.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  If had you a plan that the insurance company dumped,  let's say, for the high-risk pool that I talked about with Governor  Fallin, the government can't change the law and order the insurance  company to put that policy back in effect.  They can't order insurance  companies to do that.  Secondly, an insurance company is not going to  want to voluntarily do that.  You are not going to put in a plan on the  table that some high-risk person is going to be drawing a lot of costs  out of it for medical care.  They don't want to insure the high risk.  </p><p>MCCORMACK:  There are a lot of people who wouldn't have those problems  that that couldn't (INAUDIBLE).  Furthermore, there are millions of  people who haven't had their plans canceled.  If you a pass a law like  Ron Johnson's bill that doesn't force insurers to issue the new plans  but simply gave them the option, you would have a lot of insurers who  want to continue selling their policies --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCCORMACK:  -- losing them each month into next year.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  I don't buy it.  I think the insurance companies were  happy to get out of a lot of these policies.  Happy to get out of them.   The ones where they have to pay out more in medical bills.  </p><p>MCCORMACK:  They're certainly regulated at the state level.  But  insurers aren't exactly doing this for charity.  They are selling plans  and they're making a profit on this.  I have got to think if millions  and millions of people are losing their plans -- it might take some  times.  That's the real issue.  Is that if you pass a law allowing them  to do, this then you have to have the state insurance commissioners  approve these new plans.  That usually takes up to a year in some case  cases.  But -- let's say that's state-level action.  You have the states  take extraordinary measures, pass laws there, let them waive these  regulations.  And then you have got the question of whether or not the  insurers actually have the time to reconfigure their computers and  reissue these plans, send a letter, and give people time to figure out,  do I want to go back on my old plan or go into Obamacare?  It's a huge  mess for the millions of people losing their plans on January 1st.  Just  a complete disaster.  It may be too late for them.  That's what I am  hearing.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  OK, January.  They're losing on January 1st.  What you  are describing is going to take one, two years, three years to do,  right?  </p><p>MCCORMACK:  It could take months.  I don't think it would take years.   But I think it will take months.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  All right.</p><p>MCCORMACK:  There are people who are going to lose their plans at  January to February, all the way to December of next year.  You can  actually renew your plan in some states through December of next year.   For those people, there would be hope if you passed this law --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  I tell you people there's very little hope for, the ones  who have been canceled and they're in the middle of some regiment of  some program, whether it's chemotherapy or whether it's other, some sort  of serious medical treatment that they are getting.  There is not a lot  of hope for them right now under this scenario if they have to wait  months.  </p><p>MCCORMACK:  It's looking like a disaster for them.  There is no way to  spin that.  I don't know what the president going to do.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  You know what?  Even Senator Mary Landrieu's bill  introduced legislation, required insurers to keep offering current  individual plans.  That is one of the silliest things I ever heard  because you can't order these insurance companies to do this.  And it's  it the states that regulate it and not the federal.  </p><p>MCCORMACK:  You can't do it.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  What in the world she introduced that for is beyond me.  </p><p>MCCORMACK:  It's a violation of state law.  I spoke to Senator Ron  Johnson today and his plan would merely allow people to -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  -- allow.  Not ordered.  Allow.  </p><p>MCCORMACK:  -- which makes sense.  He says, I don't want to mislead  anyone and give people false hope and think that, oh, they can turn on a  dime and reissue these plans on January 1st.  For a lot of people,  that's not going to happen.  What he is trying to do is simply give them  the chance.  He might as well try.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Yeah.</p><p>MCCORMACK:  At least try to give them the opportunity.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Right.  And insurance companies are in business.  They  are not charities.  </p><p>Anyway, John, thank you.  </p><p>MCCORMACK:  Thank you.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Coming up, a doctor who is not only losing his own  insurance but there is so much more he is losing.  A doctor's personal  Obamacare nightmare is next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Now get ready to \"Speed Read\" your way through the news.  </p><p>Right now, the \"USS George Washington\" aircraft carrier getting ready to  head to the Philippines.  It will bring medical supplies, food, water  and temporary shelters to the typhoon-ravaged nation.  The aircraft  carrier is expected to arrive in the next 48 to 72 hours.  U.S. Marines,  international agencies, including Samaritan's Purse are already on the  ground with supplies.  The killer storm leaving many roads impassable.   The country's president declaring a state of national calamity.  They  government saying more than nine million people devastated by the  typhoon.  10,000 feared dead.  Dead bodies lining the streets and  hundreds of thousands are homeless.  Tonight, more bad news for the  Philippines.  Another tropical storm is headed their way.  Also tonight,  several deaths from Typhoon Haiyan reported in Vietnam.  </p><p>Back in the United States, looks like governor and presidential  candidate, Mitt Romney, has a new mission.  Governor Romney working on  bringing the Olympics to Boston in 2024.  He's acting as advisor to a  group exploring the Olympic bid.  You will remember, in 2002, Governor  Romney was the Salt Lake City Olympics Organizing Committee president.   He tells the \"Boston Globe,\" \"Boston will be a fantastic place for the  summer games.\"  </p><p>And now to Oregon.  Last week we told you about a middle school football  coach who got fired for planning a team party at Hooters.  Well, over  the weekend, that controversial party happened, and we have the video.   Hooters waitresses lining up to cheer for the young football players as  they arrived for the post-season party.  Hooters paid for the party and  made a donation to the school's sports' program.</p><p>And that's tonight's \"Speed Read.\"  </p><p>Get ready.  A war is breaking out here in Washington.  House Oversight  Committee chair, Darrell Issa, taking no prisoners, has issued a  subpoena to one of the top officials working to fix healthcare.gov.  The  Obama administration is furious and so is ranking Democrat, Elijah  Cummings.  Is he demanding Chairman Issa withdraw that subpoena.  </p><p>Elise Viebeck joins us.  </p><p>Nice to see you, Elise.</p><p>ELISE VIEBECK, REPORTER, THE HILL:  Thanks, Greta.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Who has been subpoenaed and why.  </p><p>VIEBECK:  This is the chief technology officer of the United States who  works in the White House, and he has been enlisted to help fix this  struggling health care enrollment site.  He is one of the main people  helping to organize this effort.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  I thought Jeffrey Zients was one of the maim people.  And  I thought his boss, where the buck stops, was HHS Secretary Sebelius.   Who are these other people?  </p><p>VIEBECK:  You are right on both counts.  But, no, they are bringing all  the talent they have to the table fort his.  This Todd Park is some guy  who has done billions of dollars of work in health care I.T.  They  really trust him.  They think is he going to be great.  All his former  colleagues have praised him to the skies and all kinds of papers.  But  now, Darrell Issa is saying that he needs to show up to Capitol Hill to  tell lawmakers what's going on.  Initially, he refused to do that.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  When was he tasked to fix the site?  </p><p>VIEBECK:  I believe in the beginning of October.  As soon as they found  out that all the problems were happening, that's when they brought the  team in.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  And they can't find two hours where they can relieve this  guy so he can testify before Congress, which has an obligation to do  oversight?  </p><p>VIEBECK:  That's what they are saying, that it would be too disruptive  to his efforts to fix the website for him to not only testify on Capitol  Hill but also to prepare his testimony.  Because, obviously, these  officials don't just show up.  They are coached beforehand on how to  answer.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  If he has been working on this for six weeks, he ought to  have it in the back of his mind.  These answers ought to be pretty easy.  </p><p>VIEBECK:  I think it's a little bit hard to believe that a couple of  hours can't be spared for an official.  I'm not on the inside of these  repairs.  At the same time, this is an important hearing.  Darrell Issa,  it's his first one as Oversight Committee chairman.  So we are going to  find things out.  Apparently, Todd Park is going to show up because he  was subpoenaed. </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  See, this is what I don't get.  I mean, he doesn't need  preparation time.  I mean, I've done a bazillion depositions over my  life and trials..  You want someone who isn't steeped in it if he is the  one since the beginning and involved in it.  You would think he hasn't  been involved.  Get it to you or bring an army of associates with him  and dispatch somebody to get it.</p><p>VIEBECK:  Right.  So he has only been involved in the repair effort.   The other people that they are calling to testify were involved in  actually constructing the site.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  But he is the only one who is resisting the subpoena.</p><p>VIEBECK:  That's right.  So the White House on his behalf sent Issa a  letter saying listen it's really -- we are happy to reschedule they  said.  We will do it in December as long as the November 30th deadline  has already passed and Park's time is a little bit more free.  What this  underscores is the fact that the White House and Darrell Issa do not get  along.</p><p>I mean, that's the bottom line here.  This is a spat and caused another  spat with congressional Democrats who are batting back at Issa saying  withdraw the subpoena and let this guy work.  Now there is this big tech  campaign saying \"Let Todd Work.\"</p><p>SUSTEREN:  Does Todd work on weekends?</p><p>VIEBECK:  I imagine they do.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  Actually the shutdown for maintenance so maybe they are doing  it over the weekend.  Maybe he has the weekend free.</p><p>VIEBECK:  Right, you would think so.  We know Jeff Zients is working  around the clock and apparently for no pay although I don't think he  needs it.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  So why is it so urgent to Issa that he come before November  30th?  The he is willing to come after November 30th?</p><p>VIEBECK:  This is Darrell Issa's big chance to look at the rollout.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  He can look at it on December 1st.</p><p>VIEBECK:  He can but he wants the answers now.  There is a little bit of  politics being played here.  Of course, Darrell Issa has actually  handled it very well.  He has been leaking documents excessively  throughout these weeks.  Internal HHS memos, meeting notes all of us in  the media have been very interested in because they shed light on the  amount of chaos surrounding all of this in the first week of October.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  Well, let me be a little sarcastic.  So I take we weren't  getting those documents through transparency of the administration?</p><p>VIEBECK:  I don't know.  Well, apparently, they finally gave them to  Congress, but he has had to issue another subpoena for Health and Human  Services Kathleen Sebelius to get those documents in advance.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  Elise, thank you.  It's nice to see you.</p><p>VIEBECK:  Thanks, Greta.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  Obamacare causing unthinkable problems for some doctors for  themselves, their employees and their patients.  Dr. Rick Henegan joins  us.  Good evening, sir.</p><p>DR. RICK HENEGAN, EMPLOYEES HEALTH INSURANCE CANCELED:  Good evening,  Greta.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  As I understand it, you have lost your insurance, sir? </p><p>HENEGAN:  That's correct our group health plan has been canceled as of  about a month ago.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  In terms of you have a number of employees and provide health  insurance for them.  Have you attempted to find out like go on the web  site to see if there is some insurance you can get for them and what the  cost would be?</p><p>HENEGAN:  Well, right now we are waiting on our broker to get back with  us.  She is supposed to have some figures for us by the end of this  week.  The only time I went on the web site to check it out it was down.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  And so what is this doing to your practice?</p><p>HENEGAN:  The employees naturally are concerned as everybody.  Just like  the other millions of Americans that are uncertain about their health  insurance as it's been canceled as ours has.  We are just waiting to see  what kind of premiums are going to be because I have been providing  healthcare insurance for my employees for 30 years without a mandate as  a benefit.  I would like to be able to continue doing that.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  Now, what about your parents?  Are you still in a -- are they  still able to go to-have you been tossed out of the network?  Can they  been tossed out of the exchange to see you?</p><p>HENEGAN:  Right now, everybody still has their insurance until the end  of this year.  It's not affecting me at this point.  We can't find our  name anywhere on the exchange. Our patients can't that go on 00  exchange.  We have no idea how to get on it.  Nobody has contacted us  about that.  So we are looking into that right now.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  About how many patients, what's the number of patients that  might involve?  People who are looking to find you on the exchange and  can't at this point?</p><p>HENEGAN:  Well, for our entire practice, there is six providers that  would be thousands of people that would be looking.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  And so what -- I mean, are you a little panicked?  Are you  making calls and saying look we have got to fix this? I'm a doctor not a  business person.  I would like to spend my time taking care of patients  and not on hold listening to some healthcare hold line?</p><p>HENEGAN:  Well, we're doing everything we can to try and contact the  state exchange to find out what's going on.  They are not very  responsive.  We haven't been given any information about it to begin  with.  But they definitely have enforced all regulations from Obamacare  in terms of the electronic health records.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  All right, in terms, and I know there is a major headache  right now and very terrifying to a lot of people who have had their  insurance canceled.  I'm curious, overall do you have optimism for  Obamacare or do you think it would be better to sort of scrap and it  starts all over?  What's your thought on it?</p><p>HENEGAN:  I would like to scrap it and start all over.  I just don't  believe that anything that's not patient/doctor centered is going to  work to the betterment of the healthcare of the American people.  You  know, when government gets involved as we have seen with this rollout,  it's inefficient.  It's going to be way more costly than it could have  been and I think there is some very good ideas that other people have  about how to reform healthcare in this country that are far better than  what we are looking at now.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  Doctor, thank you very much.  I always thought there ought to  be more discussion when developing a program, talked more to doctors and  patients than sort of business people and insurance and politicians.   And, you know, might be a little better in terms of how we treat people  and how we take care of them.  Doctor, thank you.</p><p>HENEGAN:  Thank you.  I would like to say Happy Veterans Day to my  brother, Pat, and all the other veterans out there, thanks.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  Indeed, happy Veterans Day to your brother and everybody  else.  Thank you, sir. </p><p>Straight ahead, something terribly wrong the state promising to build  one of the best exchanges in the nation doesn't have a single  enrollment.  That's next.</p><p>Also Bill Cosby finally answering the question America's been asking for  decades.  Start guessing what that question is using #greta and you will  hear from Bill Cosby coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SUSTEREN:  OK, everyone.  It's time to hash it out.  Tim Tebow news,  Yahoo tweeting former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow is considering a career  in college broadcasting.  Tebow hiring a prominent broadcast agent to  scope out TV jobs, but Tebow isn't giving up on his football career not  just yet.  He is reportedly still interested in landing an NFL gig.  He  was released from the New England Patriots earlier this year.</p><p>And funny man, Bill Cosby, answers America's burning question, TMZ  tweeting Bill Cosby reveals his favorite kind of Jell-o.  Cosby famously  starred in Jell-o ads for decades, but is he really a fan of the desert?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is Jell-o that good?  Do you still eat it?</p><p>BILL COSBY, ACTOR:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What's your favorite kind?</p><p>COSBY:  Chocolate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUSTEREN:  And there you have it.  The U.S. Postal Service getting help  from unexpected ally \"The Washington Post\" tweeting Amazon to deliver on  Sundays using Postal Service fleet just in time for the holiday season.   The Postal Service will ship Amazon's packages on Sundays at no extra  charge.  The Sunday delivery service is offered in Los Angeles and New  York City and will expand to other parts of the country next year.  The  officials hope the partnership will help the struggling Postal Service.</p><p>This is not your average tattoo.  \"Time\" tweeting Google's lie detecting  neck tattoo probably won't improve your dating life.  Google's Motorola  mobility division filing the patent for the bizarre tattoo.  It's not a  permanent ink tattoo, but instead an electronic tattoo that sticks to  your skin.  The tattoo included an imbedded microphone that connects to  a mobile device and also includes a lie detector function, creepy.</p><p>And talk about coincidence?  \"Huffington Post\" comedy tweeting thieves  on the lamb after stealing 160 sheep from a town called \"Wool,\" the case  of the missing sheep stumping police in England.  Authorities say the  sheep were stolen sometime between Sunday and Monday, and the thieves  would have needed a large vehicle to pull off the heist.  Now it's your  turn to hash it out with us.  Use #greta on all your tweets and posts.</p><p>And coming up, a healthcare exchange with zero enrollment, that's right,  zero, that story next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SUSTEREN:  All right, let's go off the record for a minute.  What's  going on?  We have gone from what was our favorite national sport  baseball to being poisoned by steroids, horrible?  College football  another favorite and now one of the most famous franchises, Penn State,  is now scarred, all those sexual abuse charges known by coaches and  simply ignored.</p><p>And now the NFL, are they ruing it for us?  The nation has loved  football.  I love football, but the NFL is beginning to look bad.   Former New England Patriot's tight end, Aaron Hernandez in jail on a  murder charge and of course, the NFL knew he was in trouble long before  the rest of us.</p><p>A history of violence and run in with police and there are lots of other  players with criminal run-ins.  Now the NFL embroiled in ugly scandal in  the Dolphins locker room.  It's very painful.  Here is Shannon Sharp  talking about Richie Incognito's use of racial slurs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHANNON SHARPE, CBS AND DOTBALL ANALYST AND RETIRED NFL PLAYER:  I'm so  disappointed.  I just hope that someone was misquoted.  I hope I'm wrong  and they didn't allow, Richie Incognito, to say this racially charged  word in an open locker room and go unchecked.  That's unacceptable.  I'm  embarrassed for -- because if he said that to Jonathan Martin, he didn't  only say it he is talking to you too because if you are black, you know  what that word means.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUSTEREN:  I'm sure you all have a view on this current controversy and  I know some of you non-African-Americans think African-Americans say it  to each other so it must be OK.  It's not.  It's not OK.  It's mean,  it's degrading and you know what?  African-Americans should stop saying  it, too.  And hip hop artists should stop using it in song lyrics.  It's  not funny and not clever.</p><p>It fuels the nonminority idiot ignorant of history is thinking it's OK  to say it it's not.  It's wrong no matter who is saying it and when.  That's my off-the-record comment tonight.  If you have an important  story or issue you think I should take off-the-record go to  gretawire.com and tell us about it.</p><p>Listen to this, if you thought the federal Obamacare web site was a  mess, it is and has low enrollment.  It has.  You will be stunned to  hear exchange even worse.  The Oregon healthcare exchange has not  enrolled a single person.  A.P. reporter, Jonathan Cooper is here with  more.  Jonathan, is that correct?  Not a single person?</p><p>JONATHAN COOPER, \"ASSOCIATED PRESS\":  That's correct.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  What happened?  What's going on in Oregon?</p><p>COOPER:  Well, they set the bar really high.  They tried to do -- they  thought they were going to get one of the nation's biggest and best  exchanges and didn't have enough time to pull it off.  So right now the  online enrollment system doesn't even -- it's not even launched if you  go to their web site, it's not there.</p><p>And that's because they say that it can't accurately determine whether  you are eligible for Medicaid, children's health insurance program, how  much tax credit you are eligible for especially in complex family  situations.  They say they're not going to launch it until it can work  properly.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  How can they not have enough time?  I mean, you know, they  have had, what, three and a half years?  That's the first thing.   Secondly, if it is such a disaster, did they notify HHS, Sebelius,  saying, you know, let's put the brakes on it because we have the state  exchange and we promised the people of Oregon and it's an abject  failure.</p><p>COOPER:  Well, they were -- the exchange had a risk consultant that  issued monthly reports and, you know, going back at least a year of the  consultant was saying that it's a real danger that October 1st isn't  going to happen and they stuck with it.  You know, they said that if --  it will be worth the extra headaches I guess to get this extra  functionality.  They want to, you know, they think that in the end if  they -- it will be worth the wait.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  You say they stuck with it.  Who is the \"they,\" number one?   Who is the one behind that and secondly, you are running up against a  deadline in terms of insurance.  So, you know, I don't know why they  didn't listen to their risk consultant.  I don't know why they bothered  to pay risk consultant if they are not going to pay attention to them.</p><p>COOPER:  They being the leaders of the health insurance exchange and you  can still -- the online system doesn't work.  So they have told  everybody that wants to sign up to fill out these paper applications.   They are 19 pages long.  They ask a ton of questions about family  background and income and then you have to mail that in and then a  person human by hand they have hired 400 extra workers to help out,  going through these by hand and trying to do the calculations to find  out what you are qualify for as they mail that back to you.</p><p>Then you can kind of use that information to decide what you want.  You  mail it back.  It's a multi-week process instead of the one hour or so  that it would take, you know, to go on the web site and go through it  like travelocity as it was.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  Assuming beings of course, of course, the one hour to would  take assuming it would work, but it doesn't.  Jonathan, thank you and  good luck in Oregon.  I hope you can get it working.  Having zero is  pretty bad.  Thank you, Jonathan.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you.</p><p>SUSTEREN:  And coming up, America's salutes its veterans, but many  veterans finding a whole new battle when they come home to the United  States.  You are going to hear from them coming up you.  Of course,  don't forget to watch \"HANNITY\" tonight at 10 p.m. Eastern.  Former  Governor Sarah Palin is Sean's guest.  That's tonight at 10:00 p.m.  Eastern on \"HANNITY.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SUSTEREN:  Now it's time to show you what we are watching.  We put  together the most fantastic videos out there tonight take a look,  terrifying moments as a power boat doing a back flip.  The boat was  racing at 135 miles per hour when it flips over, the boat summer  assaulting one and half times through the air then it finally lands top  down on the water.  The power boat racer was not hurt and hundreds of  spectators got the thrill of a lifetime.</p><p>Lady Gaga known for her wild costumes now hitting new heights, Lady Gaga  unveiling the world's first flying dress.  The battery-powered dress  lifting Gaga several feet off the ground during a launch party for her  new album.  That's what we are watching.</p><p>Coming up, many of our vets now facing a big struggle right here at  home.  You're going to hear from them next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAJOR ANDERSON, TUSKEGEE AIRMAN:  The airmen the year 1944, the country  -- Kentucky.  My first time seeing so many black military officers being  from the south and not having ever seen a black military officer.  So I  knew this was a very unusual type of organization as I learned many  years later about the accomplishment of the Tuskegee airmen.  So I'm  just proud.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUSTEREN:  That one of the very proud Tuskegee airmen, one of the first  African-American pilots in the U.S. Armed Forces flying during World War  II.  The nation is paying tribute to them and all our veterans on  Veterans Day.  One of the best ways to honor them is to help veterans  find work when they come home.  Griff Jenkins spoke to many of them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHANNA PEREZ, VETERAN:  My name is Johanna and I served two tours to  Iraq.  I was stationed at Fort Hood, Texas.  And, yes, first deployment  Baghdad and second was Kirkuk, the northern province.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS:  And after two years since retiring from the  Army, she is still finding it difficult to get work.</p><p>PEREZ:  Well, without exaggerating I think I have filled out about 35  job applications, sent them out and haven't got any calls for any  interviews.  I have gone to the Veterans Affairs Office and they told me  that right now the hiring freeze, you know, there is not much they could  do.  So they told me flat out, you know, it's just really hard.</p><p>JENKINS (on camera):  How long have you been looking?</p><p>PEREZ:  Since like a year now.</p><p>(voice-over):  Unfortunately, Johanna isn't alone.  After serving in the  military for 13 years, Jerry Doye rejoined the Army National Guard  because he was finding it hard to get by.  He says it's just tough out  there right now.</p><p>JERRY DOYE, VETERAN:  My experience was it was just kind of hard to make  it in Montgomery County without -- you know, it's just expensive to live  there and with the National Guard it subsidizing a little bit of my  income so that I can make it from month to month.</p><p>JENKINS (on camera):  So you got out in 2000, you retired then you  finally got into National Guard.  How hard is the job market out there  right now?</p><p>DOYE:  It's kind of hard. Just especially for soldiers that are -- who  are going to school and then soldiers that have families because, I  mean, the pay is OK.  But just finding a steady job that pays the bills  is just very hard I went through driving a tow truck, working at temp  agencies until I found a job pays the bills, but I'm still living check  to check.</p><p>JENKINS (voice-over):  Brenda Lutz, an Army sergeant who served in Iraq  was able to find work after five months on the job market.  She also  thinks many veterans are struggling.</p><p>BRENDA LUTZ, VETERAN:  What was more frustrating for me is that I had  soldiers that didn't have the skills or support network that I had when  I came back.  I already had a bachelor's degree going into the military.   I had that working for me when I left the military and then now I have a  masters plus professional experiences.</p><p>But I have soldiers that I used to work with who are now leaving the  military.  They don't have that background and so they are trying to  find the guidance and aren't receiving it as they should.  I know that  the VA is trying to improve helping veterans translate their skills from  the military to the civilian world, but I think that's one difficulty  for veterans.</p><p>Another difficulty for veterans right now is there is already a high  unemployment rate so there is a competition level.  But then on top of  that, they spent the last decade of their life in a certain skill or a  certain environment, certain job, and now that's finished so what do we  do now?  And we have to figure out a niche or a way that we can improve  our personal skills.  It takes time to do that translation of skills  into the work place.</p><p>JENKINS:  And Brenda says that employers should consider hiring  veterans.</p><p>LUTZ:  I will say hiring a veteran is wonderful because they have a  certain work ethic and a support system and belief in themselves because  of the training they have received through the military that can help  them succeed in any task that they are put on.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSTEREN:  And on this Veterans Day, we want to take a moment to salute  all current and former members of the U.S. military for their brave  service to our country and special thanks also to their families for  holding down the fort here at home.  See you tomorrow 7 p.m. Eastern.   Good night.  O'Reilly is next. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

He, therefore, got his Obamacare passed. Now had Congress had known this, even the Democrats would have voted against him.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to know why we were promised a state-of-the- art website and we got an abacus and a sun dial.</p><p>To say it's a train wreck is an insult to train wrecks.</p><p>CHRISTIE: Anybody who has run anything in their lives could see this coming a mile away.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have never seen anything run so incompetent as what we have watched.</p><p>LIMBAUGH: The president of the United States lied to the entire country on the most important thing to people, their health care and their current plan.</p><p>DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, (D), FLORIDA &amp; DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRWOMAN: It is a real significant distortion to say that hundreds of thousands of people are being canceled. What's actually happening is that they very likely are going to get a better plan for less money.</p><p>CHRISTIE: The fact is that the president didn't tell the truth. It turns out not to be true that people could keep their insurance policy.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Former Congressman Alan West joins us.</p><p>Good evening, sir.</p><p>ALAN WEST, (R), FORMER CONGRESSMAN: Good evening, Greta. It's a pleasure to be with you.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Nice to have you.</p><p>Well, from all those sound bites, it sounds like the president's critics are really going heavy handed on calling him a liar.</p><p>WEST: Well, there is no doubt that the president did, I believe, purposefully deceive the American people in order for his, you know, signature policy, the Obamacare, to be able to get passed. And now, we see truth come to power in the fact that this thing is -- you know, we talked about it before, Greta. It's based upon very false premises and it's not going to be able to sustain itself and it's not ready to be rolled out. And the fact that you are having so many Americans being forced off of their private insurance plans to try to get them to go into these exchanges, which are not being well-run and well orchestrated, this is a calamity.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I will tell you that in putting together that opening, we actually looked to see if any Democrats supported the president today, said anything. It is a holiday in Washington today. You know, we can't even -- the Democrats are rather silent with what is going on except with the Congressman Debbie Wasserman Schultz on it. What in the world can the president do to bail himself out and bail the American people out so that those who are harmed are not harmed by it?</p><p>WEST: Well, first of all, you did see 15 Democrat Senators have impromptu meeting with the president last week for about two hours. And Alaska Senator Mark Begich called it a crisis in confidence. I think right now, the president has to take a page from Hillary Clinton and hit the restart button and go back to the start and say, OK, this thing is not ready for prime time, let's scrap this. Let's start truly having some bipartisanship and let's sit down and talk about free-market solutions. Let's, first of all, solve the crisis of 4.2 million Americans who have lost their private insurance plans. Let's see how we can work with the insurance industry and get those plans back.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Do you think he will do that or can do that because this is his signature accomplishment, what is he very proud of as president of the United States? There are other -- not to say that the Navy SEALs getting Usama bin Laden wasn't huge as well. But this is something that he has been very adamant that he was standing behind. Do you think that he has it in himself to say, look, it's not working for a lot of Americans, let's put it on hold and let's see if we can fix it?</p><p>WEST: Well, the short answer is. No, I believe that his arrogance precludes him from doing that and admitting that he was wrong, that he took the wrong approach with trying to have a government-centric health care solution to the problems that we see. And the American Health care Reform Act that the Republicans Study Committee has brought forth, Dr. Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, has done a great job. He is an orthopedic surgeon. I think the president should listen to him.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I will tell what you is so deeply disturbing about the law. Right now, a lot of Democrats are very upset. Republicans have always been upset about it. But a lot of Democrats are upset the medical device tax because a lot of them have hit their constituents. They are very upset about it. They're upset about individual policies, other constituents that have been canceled since they don't have -- meet the full requirements of Obamacare requirements. And they are upset about the website not working. Well, with the exception of the website not working -- and, of course, they are upset because of a funding problem, too. With the exception of the website not working, these problems were evident from day one. But not one of them bothered to read the bill or fully understand it. They just sort of signed off on it. Not a single person. And so I don't have a lot of sympathy because they should have known about these things if they had spent, you know, a little time looking at the bill.</p><p>WEST: Well, contrary to what the DNC chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, has said, the Democrats are upset with this whole rollout because of politics, not because of policy. Republicans are upset because it is bad policy. But the Democrats are concerned about what this will do for them, all of those members of the House and those Senators that are up for re-election in 2014. That's the only care and concern that they have. If this thing was going a little bit better, they would be all behind it. Now they are somewhat like the rats on the Titanic, seeking to jump off to save their own self-interest.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I must say, Senator Mary Landrieu -- and I'll probably talk about it later in the show -- put up a bill -- she is a Democrat -- in the Senate, which, even if it passed, it is absurd. It couldn't possibly work. What she wants is just something you can't do. You can't order insurance companies to do what she wants.</p><p>WEST: But that's -- that's her trying to show some type of care and concern because she is running in a tough re-election --</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: She is in trouble.</p><p>WEST: -- in a red state.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Yeah.</p><p>WEST: Absolutely.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Right.</p><p>WEST: So it's not about her caring about policies. It's about politics.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: \"Guardian of the Republic,\" a new book coming out by you, hitting the shelves in April.</p><p>WEST: Yeah.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Does that mean -- a lot of times, people write books to give us notice that they are running for office again?</p><p>WEST: Well, it's not so much about running for office again. I will continue to serve this country. And that's why I would say happy Veterans Day to all my brothers and sisters that are out there. We all took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. We are all guardians of this great republic. I want to talk about the early lessons of my life, the influence of my parents, my political philosophy, and what I see as far as a vision, a way ahead to go out of this crisis and restore this great republic to the greatness that it can be and should be. I think that it's so important that we have folks that will lay out a strategic plan and a blueprint for that to occur. If the American people call me back to serve, I will be happy to do it.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Congressman, happy Veterans Day, because you are, indeed, a vet.</p><p>To those who are watching, we are going to talk about Veterans Day later because this is a very important day to our country.</p><p>Congressman, thank you, sir.</p><p>WEST: Thank you. And it's an honor to serve. Take care, Greta.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: OK. Viewers, if you know someone sick, it can be really scary for them with all this Obamacare uncertainty. The very people who were supposed to get the most help, could be in the biggest trouble. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin is here next.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Time is running out for the people who need health insurance the most. In many states, seriously ill patients in high-risk pools are in danger of losing the coverage that they have. It gets worse, even scarier in that they may not be able to enroll for new plans in time.</p><p>Oklahoma is one of those states.</p><p>Governor Mary Fallin joins us.</p><p>Good evening, Governor.</p><p>MARY FALLIN, (R), GOVERNOR OF OKLAHOMA: Good evening, Greta.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Governor, the people who are in the high-risk pool are ones that we care so deeply about because they are the ones who are sick. What is going on in Oklahoma? What is this risk?</p><p>FALLIN: Well, we are very worried about those people because they are the ones who are the sickest, the ones that need health insurance coverage the most. They're the ones who might have cancer, leukemia, diabetes and heart problems. They are the ones in our risk pools, as they are in many other states. As we know, the health insurance exchanges haven't worked the way they were supposed to work. At the end of this year, December 31st, we have over 850 Oklahomans in that risk pool who at risk of losing insurance and they are the ones who need the health insurance coverage the worse because they're the sickest.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: So what are we going to do? What are you going to do? What is the president going to do?</p><p>FALLIN: Well, I don't know. But something needs to be done. And the administration needs to do something about this particular issue. You know, come December 31st, they may not have any coverage at all. It's a federal issue. And I think a lot of people in Congress have been saying that we should delay the implementation of the Obamacare health care law just because there are so many different glitches that are coming up. But it is a federal issue but it's affecting our states.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Is it more catastrophic than that? Because a lot of them are losing their insurance. They have had cancellations, right? They have got to get into this Obamacare and the high risk, am I right?</p><p>FALLIN: That's right. And they can't because the --</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: All right. So, here's the problem. If they have had their policies canceled, they are very sick, they are in the high risk, they are up against a deadline, they can't get the insurance, but even if we could get their old insurance back, it doesn't exist to get back. So we are really squeezing these people.</p><p>FALLIN: That's right. It is the people who don't need to be squeezed because they are already ill and needing health care coverage right now. It's just a very unfortunate circumstance. My hope is Congress and the administration will do something about this. Time is running out. It's December 31st.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Like what?</p><p>FALLIN: We'll they're going to have to either --</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Like what because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FALLIN: I want to delay the implementation of the law. Just delay the implementation.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: But even if they delay the implementation, because you have the law, the insurance company, a lot of them have gotten out of these policies to begin with, and you can't order the insurance companies --</p><p>FALLIN: That's right.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: You can't order the insurance companies -- you know that old policy you just canceled? Well, now, we want you to sell it and to sell it to a really sick person who is high-risk who going to cost you more than the premium. They don't even want those people. They don't want the high-risk ones.</p><p>FALLIN: That's exactly right. That's why this health care law has been such a mess. We knew it was going to be complicated. The president promised these people that if they liked their health insurance, they could keep it, they could keep their doctor, their premium rates would go down. And we're seeing all those things haven't worked out and, frankly, just weren't true.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Governor, one other note. Good news. I like to report it. The Feeding Oklahoma Food Drive.</p><p>FALLIN: Yes.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Your goal was 1.4 million meals. And according to what - - I was doing a lot of research on you today and on your program out there -- is that the state of Oklahoma and your Feeding Oklahoma Food Drive, 2.9 million meals to help the hungry in Oklahoma. That's more than twice than what you expected?</p><p>FALLIN: Well, thank you. Yes, it was. And, you know, this is a very challenging time when you go into the Thanksgiving holiday season, Christmas time, and people want to be with their families. And we have food insufficiency in America and certainly here in Oklahoma. This is my fourth year to do a Feeding Oklahoma Food Drive. It's one of the ways I can give back. I'm thrilled at our results. We had so many different companies, foundations, organizations and people that donated food and we worked on it for a month. So 2.9 million meals is a lot of meals. Thank you for recognizing that.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Indeed. It is, indeed, a lot of meals. A lot of citizens around this country really want to help people all the time, not just, you know, at the time of the holidays. I know you got hit so badly with that tornado and Oklahoma has been hurting pretty badly, so I thought I would give you a shout-out for that.</p><p>Governor, thank you. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>FALLIN: Thank you. I appreciate it.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: And <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>making another promise to the American people, saying he will help fix the problem with the canceled insurance. What in the world can he do? How can he possibly keep this promise in light of where we are? That's next.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: What would do you if a convicted felon showed up at your door demanding money? Two college students in Washington State had to think quickly when that happened to them. The criminal trying to barge into the students' Gonzaga University Apartments. That's when one of the students pulled out a gun. The convicted felon ran off when he saw the pistol. Police arrested him soon after. But the criminal is not the only one on trouble. The students are now on university probation and could face disciplinary action. The school says they violated a policy forbidding guns in university owned housing.</p><p>Now, you be the judge. Should the students be in trouble for having a gun or not? Go to Gretawire.com right now and vote in our poll.</p><p>And coming up, should a top tech official take time out from fixing healthcare.gov to testify in before of Congress? That is the fight heating up right now on Capitol Hill. The latest coming up.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>now insisting his administration will do everything it can to help Americans with canceled insurance plans. But think about it. Like what? Does the president have any options to fix this giant mess?</p><p>\"The Weekly Standard's\" John McCormack joins us.</p><p>OK. The president -- and I believe the president wants to fix this, but like what? What are the options?</p><p>MCCORMACK, REPORTER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: There aren't a lot of good options right now.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Are there any bad ones?</p><p>MCCORMACK: What health insurance experts are saying right now, industry officials are saying, there is a three-fold problem. First, you need federal law. An administrative fix can't do it. The law says plans that are after March of 2010, those plans are gone. You actually need a law to fix this. Secondly --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Wait a second. Stop.</p><p>MCCORMACK: Yes.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: If had you a plan that the insurance company dumped, let's say, for the high-risk pool that I talked about with Governor Fallin, the government can't change the law and order the insurance company to put that policy back in effect. They can't order insurance companies to do that. Secondly, an insurance company is not going to want to voluntarily do that. You are not going to put in a plan on the table that some high-risk person is going to be drawing a lot of costs out of it for medical care. They don't want to insure the high risk.</p><p>MCCORMACK: There are a lot of people who wouldn't have those problems that that couldn't (INAUDIBLE). Furthermore, there are millions of people who haven't had their plans canceled. If you a pass a law like Ron Johnson's bill that doesn't force insurers to issue the new plans but simply gave them the option, you would have a lot of insurers who want to continue selling their policies --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCCORMACK: -- losing them each month into next year.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I don't buy it. I think the insurance companies were happy to get out of a lot of these policies. Happy to get out of them. The ones where they have to pay out more in medical bills.</p><p>MCCORMACK: They're certainly regulated at the state level. But insurers aren't exactly doing this for charity. They are selling plans and they're making a profit on this. I have got to think if millions and millions of people are losing their plans -- it might take some times. That's the real issue. Is that if you pass a law allowing them to do, this then you have to have the state insurance commissioners approve these new plans. That usually takes up to a year in some case cases. But -- let's say that's state-level action. You have the states take extraordinary measures, pass laws there, let them waive these regulations. And then you have got the question of whether or not the insurers actually have the time to reconfigure their computers and reissue these plans, send a letter, and give people time to figure out, do I want to go back on my old plan or go into Obamacare? It's a huge mess for the millions of people losing their plans on January 1st. Just a complete disaster. It may be too late for them. That's what I am hearing.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: OK, January. They're losing on January 1st. What you are describing is going to take one, two years, three years to do, right?</p><p>MCCORMACK: It could take months. I don't think it would take years. But I think it will take months.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: All right.</p><p>MCCORMACK: There are people who are going to lose their plans at January to February, all the way to December of next year. You can actually renew your plan in some states through December of next year. For those people, there would be hope if you passed this law --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I tell you people there's very little hope for, the ones who have been canceled and they're in the middle of some regiment of some program, whether it's chemotherapy or whether it's other, some sort of serious medical treatment that they are getting. There is not a lot of hope for them right now under this scenario if they have to wait months.</p><p>MCCORMACK: It's looking like a disaster for them. There is no way to spin that. I don't know what the president going to do.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: You know what? Even Senator Mary Landrieu's bill introduced legislation, required insurers to keep offering current individual plans. That is one of the silliest things I ever heard because you can't order these insurance companies to do this. And it's it the states that regulate it and not the federal.</p><p>MCCORMACK: You can't do it.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: What in the world she introduced that for is beyond me.</p><p>MCCORMACK: It's a violation of state law. I spoke to Senator Ron Johnson today and his plan would merely allow people to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: -- allow. Not ordered. Allow.</p><p>MCCORMACK: -- which makes sense. He says, I don't want to mislead anyone and give people false hope and think that, oh, they can turn on a dime and reissue these plans on January 1st. For a lot of people, that's not going to happen. What he is trying to do is simply give them the chance. He might as well try.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Yeah.</p><p>MCCORMACK: At least try to give them the opportunity.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Right. And insurance companies are in business. They are not charities.</p><p>Anyway, John, thank you.</p><p>MCCORMACK: Thank you.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Coming up, a doctor who is not only losing his own insurance but there is so much more he is losing. A doctor's personal Obamacare nightmare is next.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Now get ready to \"Speed Read\" your way through the news.</p><p>Right now, the \"USS George Washington\" aircraft carrier getting ready to head to the Philippines. It will bring medical supplies, food, water and temporary shelters to the typhoon-ravaged nation. The aircraft carrier is expected to arrive in the next 48 to 72 hours. U.S. Marines, international agencies, including Samaritan's Purse are already on the ground with supplies. The killer storm leaving many roads impassable. The country's president declaring a state of national calamity. They government saying more than nine million people devastated by the typhoon. 10,000 feared dead. Dead bodies lining the streets and hundreds of thousands are homeless. Tonight, more bad news for the Philippines. Another tropical storm is headed their way. Also tonight, several deaths from Typhoon Haiyan reported in Vietnam.</p><p>Back in the United States, looks like governor and presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, has a new mission. Governor Romney working on bringing the Olympics to Boston in 2024. He's acting as advisor to a group exploring the Olympic bid. You will remember, in 2002, Governor Romney was the Salt Lake City Olympics Organizing Committee president. He tells the \"Boston Globe,\" \"Boston will be a fantastic place for the summer games.\"</p><p>And now to Oregon. Last week we told you about a middle school football coach who got fired for planning a team party at Hooters. Well, over the weekend, that controversial party happened, and we have the video. Hooters waitresses lining up to cheer for the young football players as they arrived for the post-season party. Hooters paid for the party and made a donation to the school's sports' program.</p><p>And that's tonight's \"Speed Read.\"</p><p>Get ready. A war is breaking out here in Washington. House Oversight Committee chair, Darrell Issa, taking no prisoners, has issued a subpoena to one of the top officials working to fix healthcare.gov. The <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>is furious and so is ranking Democrat, Elijah Cummings. Is he demanding Chairman Issa withdraw that subpoena.</p><p>Elise Viebeck joins us.</p><p>Nice to see you, Elise.</p><p>ELISE VIEBECK, REPORTER, THE HILL: Thanks, Greta.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Who has been subpoenaed and why.</p><p>VIEBECK: This is the chief technology officer of the United States who works in the White House, and he has been enlisted to help fix this struggling health care enrollment site. He is one of the main people helping to organize this effort.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I thought Jeffrey Zients was one of the maim people. And I thought his boss, where the buck stops, was HHS Secretary Sebelius. Who are these other people?</p><p>VIEBECK: You are right on both counts. But, no, they are bringing all the talent they have to the table fort his. This Todd Park is some guy who has done billions of dollars of work in health care I.T. They really trust him. They think is he going to be great. All his former colleagues have praised him to the skies and all kinds of papers. But now, Darrell Issa is saying that he needs to show up to Capitol Hill to tell lawmakers what's going on. Initially, he refused to do that.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: When was he tasked to fix the site?</p><p>VIEBECK: I believe in the beginning of October. As soon as they found out that all the problems were happening, that's when they brought the team in.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: And they can't find two hours where they can relieve this guy so he can testify before Congress, which has an obligation to do oversight?</p><p>VIEBECK: That's what they are saying, that it would be too disruptive to his efforts to fix the website for him to not only testify on Capitol Hill but also to prepare his testimony. Because, obviously, these officials don't just show up. They are coached beforehand on how to answer.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: If he has been working on this for six weeks, he ought to have it in the back of his mind. These answers ought to be pretty easy.</p><p>VIEBECK: I think it's a little bit hard to believe that a couple of hours can't be spared for an official. I'm not on the inside of these repairs. At the same time, this is an important hearing. Darrell Issa, it's his first one as Oversight Committee chairman. So we are going to find things out. Apparently, Todd Park is going to show up because he was subpoenaed.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: See, this is what I don't get. I mean, he doesn't need preparation time. I mean, I've done a bazillion depositions over my life and trials.. You want someone who isn't steeped in it if he is the one since the beginning and involved in it. You would think he hasn't been involved. Get it to you or bring an army of associates with him and dispatch somebody to get it.</p><p>VIEBECK: Right. So he has only been involved in the repair effort. The other people that they are calling to testify were involved in actually constructing the site.</p><p>SUSTEREN: But he is the only one who is resisting the subpoena.</p><p>VIEBECK: That's right. So the White House on his behalf sent Issa a letter saying listen it's really -- we are happy to reschedule they said. We will do it in December as long as the November 30th deadline has already passed and Park's time is a little bit more free. What this underscores is the fact that the White House and Darrell Issa do not get along.</p><p>I mean, that's the bottom line here. This is a spat and caused another spat with congressional Democrats who are batting back at Issa saying withdraw the subpoena and let this guy work. Now there is this big tech campaign saying \"Let Todd Work.\"</p><p>SUSTEREN: Does Todd work on weekends?</p><p>VIEBECK: I imagine they do.</p><p>SUSTEREN: Actually the shutdown for maintenance so maybe they are doing it over the weekend. Maybe he has the weekend free.</p><p>VIEBECK: Right, you would think so. We know Jeff Zients is working around the clock and apparently for no pay although I don't think he needs it.</p><p>SUSTEREN: So why is it so urgent to Issa that he come before November 30th? The he is willing to come after November 30th?</p><p>VIEBECK: This is Darrell Issa's big chance to look at the rollout.</p><p>SUSTEREN: He can look at it on December 1st.</p><p>VIEBECK: He can but he wants the answers now. There is a little bit of politics being played here. Of course, Darrell Issa has actually handled it very well. He has been leaking documents excessively throughout these weeks. Internal HHS memos, meeting notes all of us in the media have been very interested in because they shed light on the amount of chaos surrounding all of this in the first week of October.</p><p>SUSTEREN: Well, let me be a little sarcastic. So I take we weren't getting those documents through transparency of the administration?</p><p>VIEBECK: I don't know. Well, apparently, they finally gave them to Congress, but he has had to issue another subpoena for Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius to get those documents in advance.</p><p>SUSTEREN: Elise, thank you. It's nice to see you.</p><p>VIEBECK: Thanks, Greta.</p><p>SUSTEREN: Obamacare causing unthinkable problems for some doctors for themselves, their employees and their patients. Dr. Rick Henegan joins us. Good evening, sir.</p><p>DR. RICK HENEGAN, EMPLOYEES HEALTH INSURANCE CANCELED: Good evening, Greta.</p><p>SUSTEREN: As I understand it, you have lost your insurance, sir?</p><p>HENEGAN: That's correct our group health plan has been canceled as of about a month ago.</p><p>SUSTEREN: In terms of you have a number of employees and provide health insurance for them. Have you attempted to find out like go on the web site to see if there is some insurance you can get for them and what the cost would be?</p><p>HENEGAN: Well, right now we are waiting on our broker to get back with us. She is supposed to have some figures for us by the end of this week. The only time I went on the web site to check it out it was down.</p><p>SUSTEREN: And so what is this doing to your practice?</p><p>HENEGAN: The employees naturally are concerned as everybody. Just like the other millions of Americans that are uncertain about their health insurance as it's been canceled as ours has. We are just waiting to see what kind of premiums are going to be because I have been providing healthcare insurance for my employees for 30 years without a mandate as a benefit. I would like to be able to continue doing that.</p><p>SUSTEREN: Now, what about your parents? Are you still in a -- are they still able to go to-have you been tossed out of the network? Can they been tossed out of the exchange to see you?</p><p>HENEGAN: Right now, everybody still has their insurance until the end of this year. It's not affecting me at this point. We can't find our name anywhere on the exchange. Our patients can't that go on 00 exchange. We have no idea how to get on it. Nobody has contacted us about that. So we are looking into that right now.</p><p>SUSTEREN: About how many patients, what's the number of patients that might involve? People who are looking to find you on the exchange and can't at this point?</p><p>HENEGAN: Well, for our entire practice, there is six providers that would be thousands of people that would be looking.</p><p>SUSTEREN: And so what -- I mean, are you a little panicked? Are you making calls and saying look we have got to fix this? I'm a doctor not a business person. I would like to spend my time taking care of patients and not on hold listening to some healthcare hold line?</p><p>HENEGAN: Well, we're doing everything we can to try and contact the state exchange to find out what's going on. They are not very responsive. We haven't been given any information about it to begin with. But they definitely have enforced all regulations from Obamacare in terms of the electronic health records.</p><p>SUSTEREN: All right, in terms, and I know there is a major headache right now and very terrifying to a lot of people who have had their insurance canceled. I'm curious, overall do you have optimism for Obamacare or do you think it would be better to sort of scrap and it starts all over? What's your thought on it?</p><p>HENEGAN: I would like to scrap it and start all over. I just don't believe that anything that's not patient/doctor centered is going to work to the betterment of the healthcare of the American people. You know, when government gets involved as we have seen with this rollout, it's inefficient. It's going to be way more costly than it could have been and I think there is some very good ideas that other people have about how to reform healthcare in this country that are far better than what we are looking at now.</p><p>SUSTEREN: Doctor, thank you very much. I always thought there ought to be more discussion when developing a program, talked more to doctors and patients than sort of business people and insurance and politicians. And, you know, might be a little better in terms of how we treat people and how we take care of them. Doctor, thank you.</p><p>HENEGAN: Thank you. I would like to say Happy Veterans Day to my brother, Pat, and all the other veterans out there, thanks.</p><p>SUSTEREN: Indeed, happy Veterans Day to your brother and everybody else. Thank you, sir.</p><p>Straight ahead, something terribly wrong the state promising to build one of the best exchanges in the nation doesn't have a single enrollment. That's next.</p><p>Also Bill Cosby finally answering the question America's been asking for decades.

Use #greta on all your tweets and posts.</p><p>And coming up, a healthcare exchange with zero enrollment, that's right, zero, that story next.</p><p>SUSTEREN: All right, let's go off the record for a minute. What's going on? We have gone from what was our favorite national sport baseball to being poisoned by steroids, horrible? College football another favorite and now one of the most famous franchises, Penn State, is now scarred, all those sexual abuse charges known by coaches and simply ignored.</p><p>And now the NFL, are they ruing it for us? The nation has loved football. I love football, but the NFL is beginning to look bad. Former New England Patriot's tight end, Aaron Hernandez in jail on a murder charge and of course, the NFL knew he was in trouble long before the rest of us.</p><p>A history of violence and run in with police and there are lots of other players with criminal run-ins.

Here is Shannon Sharp talking about Richie Incognito's use of racial slurs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHANNON SHARPE, CBS AND DOTBALL ANALYST AND RETIRED NFL PLAYER: I'm so disappointed. I just hope that someone was misquoted. I hope I'm wrong and they didn't allow, Richie Incognito, to say this racially charged word in an open locker room and go unchecked. That's unacceptable. I'm embarrassed for -- because if he said that to Jonathan Martin, he didn't only say it he is talking to you too because if you are black, you know what that word means.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUSTEREN: I'm sure you all have a view on this current controversy and I know some of you non-African-Americans think African-Americans say it to each other so it must be OK. It's not. It's not OK. It's mean, it's degrading and you know what? African-Americans should stop saying it, too. And hip hop artists should stop using it in song lyrics. It's not funny and not clever.</p><p>It fuels the nonminority idiot ignorant of history is thinking it's OK to say it it's not. It's wrong no matter who is saying it and when. That's my off-the-record comment tonight. If you have an important story or issue you think I should take off-the-record go to gretawire.com and tell us about it.</p><p>Listen to this, if you thought the federal Obamacare web site was a mess, it is and has low enrollment. It has. You will be stunned to hear exchange even worse. The Oregon healthcare exchange has not enrolled a single person. A.P. reporter, Jonathan Cooper is here with more. Jonathan, is that correct? Not a single person?</p><p>JONATHAN COOPER, \"ASSOCIATED PRESS\": That's correct.</p><p>SUSTEREN: What happened? What's going on in Oregon?</p><p>COOPER: Well, they set the bar really high. They tried to do -- they thought they were going to get one of the nation's biggest and best exchanges and didn't have enough time to pull it off. So right now the online enrollment system doesn't even -- it's not even launched if you go to their web site, it's not there.</p><p>And that's because they say that it can't accurately determine whether you are eligible for Medicaid, children's health insurance program, how much tax credit you are eligible for especially in complex family situations. They say they're not going to launch it until it can work properly.</p><p>SUSTEREN: How can they not have enough time? I mean, you know, they have had, what, three and a half years? That's the first thing. Secondly, if it is such a disaster, did they notify HHS, Sebelius, saying, you know, let's put the brakes on it because we have the state exchange and we promised the people of Oregon and it's an abject failure.</p><p>COOPER: Well, they were -- the exchange had a risk consultant that issued monthly reports and, you know, going back at least a year of the consultant was saying that it's a real danger that October 1st isn't going to happen and they stuck with it. You know, they said that if -- it will be worth the extra headaches I guess to get this extra functionality. They want to, you know, they think that in the end if they -- it will be worth the wait.</p><p>SUSTEREN: You say they stuck with it. Who is the \"they,\" number one? Who is the one behind that and secondly, you are running up against a deadline in terms of insurance. So, you know, I don't know why they didn't listen to their risk consultant. I don't know why they bothered to pay risk consultant if they are not going to pay attention to them.</p><p>COOPER: They being the leaders of the health insurance exchange and you can still -- the online system doesn't work. So they have told everybody that wants to sign up to fill out these paper applications. They are 19 pages long. They ask a ton of questions about family background and income and then you have to mail that in and then a person human by hand they have hired 400 extra workers to help out, going through these by hand and trying to do the calculations to find out what you are qualify for as they mail that back to you.</p><p>Then you can kind of use that information to decide what you want. You mail it back. It's a multi-week process instead of the one hour or so that it would take, you know, to go on the web site and go through it like travelocity as it was.</p><p>SUSTEREN: Assuming beings of course, of course, the one hour to would take assuming it would work, but it doesn't. Jonathan, thank you and good luck in Oregon. I hope you can get it working. Having zero is pretty bad. Thank you, Jonathan.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p>SUSTEREN: And coming up, America's salutes its veterans, but many veterans finding a whole new battle when they come home to the United States. You are going to hear from them coming up you. Of course, don't forget to watch \"HANNITY\" tonight at 10 p.m. Eastern. Former Governor Sarah Palin is Sean's guest. That's tonight at 10:00 p.m. Eastern on \"HANNITY.\"</p><p>SUSTEREN: Now it's time to show you what we are watching.

You're going to hear from them next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAJOR ANDERSON, TUSKEGEE AIRMAN: The airmen the year 1944, the country -- Kentucky. My first time seeing so many black military officers being from the south and not having ever seen a black military officer. So I knew this was a very unusual type of organization as I learned many years later about the accomplishment of the Tuskegee airmen. So I'm just proud.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUSTEREN: That one of the very proud Tuskegee airmen, one of the first African-American pilots in the U.S. Armed Forces flying during World War II. The nation is paying tribute to them and all our veterans on Veterans Day. One of the best ways to honor them is to help veterans find work when they come home. Griff Jenkins spoke to many of them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHANNA PEREZ, VETERAN: My name is Johanna and I served two tours to Iraq. I was stationed at Fort Hood, Texas. And, yes, first deployment Baghdad and second was Kirkuk, the northern province.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS: And after two years since retiring from the Army, she is still finding it difficult to get work.</p><p>PEREZ: Well, without exaggerating I think I have filled out about 35 job applications, sent them out and haven't got any calls for any interviews. I have gone to the Veterans Affairs Office and they told me that right now the hiring freeze, you know, there is not much they could do. So they told me flat out, you know, it's just really hard.</p><p>JENKINS (on camera): How long have you been looking?</p><p>PEREZ: Since like a year now.</p><p>(voice-over): Unfortunately, Johanna isn't alone. After serving in the military for 13 years, Jerry Doye rejoined the Army National Guard because he was finding it hard to get by. He says it's just tough out there right now.</p><p>JERRY DOYE, VETERAN: My experience was it was just kind of hard to make it in Montgomery County without -- you know, it's just expensive to live there and with the National Guard it subsidizing a little bit of my income so that I can make it from month to month.</p><p>JENKINS (on camera): So you got out in 2000, you retired then you finally got into National Guard. How hard is the job market out there right now?</p><p>DOYE: It's kind of hard. Just especially for soldiers that are -- who are going to school and then soldiers that have families because, I mean, the pay is OK. But just finding a steady job that pays the bills is just very hard I went through driving a tow truck, working at temp agencies until I found a job pays the bills, but I'm still living check to check.</p><p>JENKINS (voice-over): Brenda Lutz, an Army sergeant who served in Iraq was able to find work after five months on the job market. She also thinks many veterans are struggling.</p><p>BRENDA LUTZ, VETERAN: What was more frustrating for me is that I had soldiers that didn't have the skills or support network that I had when I came back. I already had a bachelor's degree going into the military. I had that working for me when I left the military and then now I have a masters plus professional experiences.</p><p>But I have soldiers that I used to work with who are now leaving the military. They don't have that background and so they are trying to find the guidance and aren't receiving it as they should. I know that the VA is trying to improve helping veterans translate their skills from the military to the civilian world, but I think that's one difficulty for veterans.</p><p>Another difficulty for veterans right now is there is already a high unemployment rate so there is a competition level. But then on top of that, they spent the last decade of their life in a certain skill or a certain environment, certain job, and now that's finished so what do we do now? And we have to figure out a niche or a way that we can improve our personal skills. It takes time to do that translation of skills into the work place.</p><p>JENKINS: And Brenda says that employers should consider hiring veterans.</p><p>LUTZ: I will say hiring a veteran is wonderful because they have a certain work ethic and a support system and belief in themselves because of the training they have received through the military that can help them succeed in any task that they are put on.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSTEREN: And on this Veterans Day, we want to take a moment to salute all current and former members of the U.S. military for their brave service to our country and special thanks also to their families for holding down the fort here at home. See you tomorrow 7 p.m. Eastern. Good night.

But what constitutes 'data-misuse' is covered by a broad gamut of scenarios that reach beyond poor security hygiene. Online tracking and profiling is rife \u2014 it turns out there is a heap of money to be made from knowing where you are, what you do, and what you like. It all comes down to personalization: selling things, be it products, playlists, or a political ideology, based on who you are. </p><p>The Facebook and Cambridge Analytical[5], which highlighted how social networks armed with vast banks of personal data could be leveraged to profile voters and micro-target with personalized political ads, was something of a watershed moment in terms of elevating the issue of data-privacy and abuse into the public consciousness. Personalization permeates the digital sphere though, from video- and music-streaming services, to web-searches and e-commerce apps \u2014 and this usually comes at a cost. Companies vacuum up hordes of behavioral data, such as pages-viewed, links-clicked, videos-watched, songs listened-to, and often combine it with other data such as location, email address, and demographic information, to create a sort of virtual model of a person in the cloud. It's all about getting to 'know' you and predicting what else you might like. And this may not be to everyone's tastes. It's against that backdrop that Canopy[6] is setting out to carve its niche in a market ripe for privacy-focused tools. The New York-based company has created what it calls a 'private content recommendation system' that doesn't send personal data back-and-forth between a remote server and the user's device \u2014 all the data-processing and machine learning takes place on the device itself. Canopy was founded in 2017 by CEO Brian Whitman, formerly cofounder and chief technology officer (CTO) at music intelligence company The Echo Nest, which he sold to Spotify[7] in 2014 to power its music recommendation algorithms through a combination of data mining, machine learning, signal processing, among other mechanisms. Whitman left Spotify[8] in 2016 to work on 'personal projects and start something new in 2017,' he announced at the time. To showcase its new technology, Canopy today launched its first product \u2014 Tonic \u2014 an iPhone-only app[9] that uses on-device machine learning and differential privacy to suggest longer-form reads from across the internet.Just the tonicFrom the get-go, Tonic is all about letting the user know that it doesn't want any of their information. 'Our editors work with custom-made machine learning tools to tailor the internet's hidden gems to your vibe,' it proclaims, before noting that the user doesn't even have to log-in or create an account. 'We're trying to build a more private and ethical internet,' it continues. Above: Tonic by Canopy: Getting started As with other similar content-recommendation systems, Tonic first asks the users to select from a bunch of feature articles from the across the web, recommending that around 5 should be enough to get the ball rolling for future recommendations. Above: Tonic by Canopy: Choose some articles Inside the app, users can read all the articles they've just added. The personalized recommendations kick off in subsequent days via a daily dose of fresh articles delivered based on what Tonic thinks the user likes. Users can also guide this process by long-pressing on an article in their activity stream, and then sliding a little controller to indicate how much they like a particular article. Above: Tonic by Canopy: Reading list and activity When the user clicks to read an article, they're taken to the original publication's website which is accessed via an in-app browser that's effectively an incognito window that rejects all cookies. Above: Tonic by Canopy: In-app private browser At its core, Canopy is most interested in what types of content the user likes reading rather than really getting to know who you are as a person. Under the hood, its recommendation engine find similarities in what people are reading across the board, and makes other recommendations that might not be immediately obvious where the connection lies. This isn't a million miles away from how Spotify's popular algorithmic personalized Discovery Weekly[10] playlist works. Canopy uses what is known as differential privacy, which limits access to only aggregate information from a broader group of users. Differential privacy essentially enables organizations to learn from group patterns without distinguishing between individuals within it. So Tonic won't store IP addresses or device IDs, for example. Other content recommendation systems often aggregate all its data only after it arrives on their servers, something that Canopy is keen to avoid. It just doesn't want all that data to begin with. 'It's a crucial difference for our approach,' Whitman wrote in a co-authored blog post[11] explaining the technology earlier this year. 'Even in the worst case of the encryption failing, or our servers being hacked, no one could ever do anything with the private models because they do not represent any individual.' There is one downside to this approach though. If a user buys a new phone, or wants to access Tonic on a different device, they will need to start completely from scratch \u2014 there is no way to port their recommendations over.Echo chambersHeading up the broader Canopy product development is Matthew Ogle, who recently joined the company from Instagram where he worked[12] as a product manager. Before that, he was head of web product at early music-streaming pioneers Last.fm[13], before going on to join the Echo Nest and later Spotify, where he guided product development for Discover Weekly. So he knows a thing or two about tailored recommendations. According to Ogle, Canopy uses both machine learning and humans as part of its content recommendation engine. It has an editorial team, led by former New York Times' community editor Bassey Etim[14], which works in concert with the engineers to curate the automated recommendations \u2014 it's all about making sure that humans have given all the content a once-over before passing it into Tonic. 'There's a constant feedback loop between them [editors] and what the machine learning \u2014 the clustering[15], the logic \u2014 is doing,' Ogle told VentureBeat in an interview. The main reason for working this way, rather than giving over entirely to the machines, relates to echo chambers. 'We didn't want to take the entire internet and filter it using machine learning,' Ogle continued. 'We think we know the downsides of that and where that leads. One thing that we heard a lot during our research [was that] everyone loves personalization, but not to the point where it pigeonholes them.' Ultimately, it's all about ensuring quality and diversity. 'The best personalization products should reserve the right to surprise you, as well as gives you something that's really in your wheelhouse,' Ogle added. Canopy, which raised a small $4.5 million seed round of funding last year, hasn't given any indication as to whether it plans to monetize Tonic \u2014 or any subsequent similar apps it launches. The longer term goal, it seems, is to license the underlying architecture to third-party developers who can engineer privacy into their own apps and market themselves as the antithesis of Facebook and its ilk. 'This [Tonic] is a playground for experimenting with the tech,' explained Annika Goldman, Canopy's head of product strategy and former Spotify exec, to VentureBeat. 'We really have a vision of what a future internet ecosystem could look like. We're also currently in conversation with other companies about licensing the underlying private personalization technology to them.' While Tonic is very much is a proof-of-concept in many ways, designed to highlight its technology, the company was keen to point out that it sees a world with both 'Canopy-powered tech and Canopy-owned experiences,' as Ogle put it. In other words, we can expect to see Tonic get more bells and whistles in the future even if it signs deals with third-parties.AwarenessDespite some misguided claims[16] that there isn't any meaningful consumer backlash against big technology companies, high-profile scandals such as Facebook and Cambridge Analytica andcountless others, can only bolster a growing sentiment that companies' tracking our every digital move is not a good thing. 'Consumers are waking up to the idea that you don't have to trade your digital identity for a great experience online,' Whitman told VentureBeat. 'Until recently, there weren't any alternatives to big platforms, but now there is a movement of smaller tech companies giving people amazing experiences without exploiting their data.' For the best part of the last two decades, Whitman has been involved in some form of music recommendation work, but it was at the Echo Nest and latterly Spotify where it seems he became aware of how algorithms and personalization were shaping user-privacy. 'I'm especially reflective these days on the role of prediction, privacy, information retrieval, and machine learning on our culture,' he said at the time. Spotify hasn't exactly been engulfed in the kind of data-privacy scandals of its technology peers, such as Google, Facebook, or Amazon, but the company holds a wealth of personal and emotional data[17] that is tied to its users listening habits, and it can even target ads based on someone's mood[18]. More recently, Spotify also started to demand users' GPS data[19] to verify subscribers on its family plan. So while Spotify is seen as a relatively good actor in the privacy space, there is definitely the ingredients there for things to simmer over. Speaking at a VentureBeat conference several years ago, Spotify executive Brian Benedik agreed that the company collects[20] an 'enormous amount of data on what people are listening to, where, and in what context,' he said. 'It really gives us insight into what these people are doing.' For many, though, it was the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica episode that truly brought to light the full extent of how big tech platforms can be used to profile users. Most people were probably already aware that data they voluntarily gave to Facebook, such as when they 'like' a company's page or update their relationship status, can be used for advertising. But most people were probably not aware that Facebook could also track their off-Facebook activities, given that any website that has integrated Facebook's technology (such as the Like button) feeds into Facebook's gargantuan web-tracking operation. After Cambridge Analytica, people really started to pay attention to what was going on, even if they didn't make any immediate changes to how they use the web. More broadly, agrowing awareness of how the web works has made the topic of data-privacy top-of-mind for governments, companies, and at least some consumers. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR[21]), which launched last year, forced firms to rethink their data-harvesting practices or face mammoth penalties[22]. In turn, this has opened up a whole host of opportunities[23] for well-financed startups to capitalize on a fledgling industry built around privacy tools, while tech companies such as Firefox-creator Mozilla have pushed[24] to align themselves[25] with 'privacy' rather than 'privacy breaches.' Software that promise privacy as a core-selling point will likely explode in demand in the years ahead. 'We're seeing increasing regulation \u2014 GDPR is just the start \u2014 and we're seeing increasing scrutiny of technology,' Goldman said. 'And so a lot of companies are saying, 'I want to get ahead of that, I want to invest in technology that enables me to do all the amazing things I want to do, but keep data private and secured'.'

Elizabeth Warren speaks, every muscle in her body is activated \u2014her arms swing like a conductor's, her forefinger strikes up at the sky, her chin lifts or her shoulders shift to emphasize a point.</p><p>To her supporters, Warren's characteristic vitality shows she has the muster to deliver on promises of \"big structural change,\" her slogan as she campaigns to be the Democratic nominee for president.</p><p> To her critics, Warren's charisma and organizing prowess won't be enough to enact some of her boldest ideas, including her hallmark \"wealth tax\" on millionaires and billionaires.</p><p> But in Davenport on Sunday afternoon, Warren emphasized the ways she could use the many muscles of the federal government to \"improve the lives of hardworking people\" without needing Congressional buy-in.</p><p> According to Warren, the Secretary of Education can cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans. The president can bring down the prices of drugs still held under patent. Drilling and mining can stop on all federal lands. Federal regulators can break up big tech companies with existing antitrust laws.</p><p> \"I understand how these agencies work,\" Warren said, referring to her foundational work with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a watchdog group founded after the Great Recession. \"I'm the only candidate on the debate stage who has run a federal agency. I built one, from the ground up. I went from two employees to 1,000 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\"</p><p> In Davenport, Warren held a town hall at the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds and sat down for an exclusive interview with the editorial board of the Quad-City Times. Her weekend in Iowa included stops in Manchester and Dubuque on Saturday and Maquoketa on Sunday.</p><p> Warren rose to prominence after the Great Recession as the chair of a congressional panel overseeing mortgage foreclosures, the government bailout, banks and business, among other topics. A longtime professor at Harvard Law School, Warren had decided in the second grade that she wanted to become a public-school teacher.</p><p> Her Davenport speech before a crowd of 600 had the ease of a professor comfortable in front of a large lecture hall.</p><p> Significant time was spent on Warren's proposed wealth tax, what she calls the \"Ultra-Millionaire Tax.\" It works by taxing 2 cents on every dollar owned by households worth more than $50 million and 6 cents on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion. The tax would apply to fewer than 80,000 households, or the richest 0.1%, and generate an estimated $3 trillion over a decade.</p><p> The proposal has generated intense backlash, particularly from the richest Americans and from big companies. Warren points to surveys showing a majority of Americans \u2014 including Democrats, Independents and Republicans \u2014 support the wealth tax.</p><p> \"If you own a home, you've been paying a wealth tax\u2014it's just called a property tax,\" Warren told the fairgrounds crowd. \"All I'm saying is that for millionaires and billionaires, their property tax shouldn't just be real estate. It should also be stock portfolios, the diamonds, the Rembrandt and the yacht.\"</p><p> The wealth tax, she said, would generate enough money to fund universal childcare for young kids and universal pre-K, to invest $800 billion in public education, to eliminate tuition at public institutions for higher education and to cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans.</p><p> The wealth tax \u2014 and the tall task of muscling it through Congress \u2014 sounds too good to be true to many Iowans, even some caucus-goers who otherwise like Warren and her bold vision for a more equitable America.</p><p> \"They're great ideas,\" said Janet Martin, of Davenport. \"But can she get them done? That's my biggest concern.\" Martin is an undecided voter, and she left Warren's event without committing to the 70-year-old senator.</p><p> Warren told the Times editorial board she doesn't believe the Trump administration when it claimed that the killing of Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani was justified because Soleimani posed an \"imminent\" threat to the U.S.</p><p> Warren suggested Trump is trying to distract from his imminent impeachment trial, and that the killing was \"particularly dangerous because he brings us right to the edge of war. Our country is less safe today than it was before the president took these actions,\" she added.</p><p> Warren also took shots at fellow presidential contender Tom Steyer, the Democratic activist and billionaire. Although she did not name Steyer, Warren decried how \"a billionaire bought his way onto the Democratic debate stage\" while U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris dropped out due to fundraising concerns.</p><p> The event ended with Warren's signature selfie line, a human chain of volunteers who assist supporters snagging photos with the candidate. According to the campaign, Warren has taken more than 100,000 such selfies.</p><p> Throughout her hour-long appearance, children in the back corner of the crowd were sitting on the ground, using crayons to color in sheets of paper with Warren-inspired slogans: \"The Best President Money Can't Buy,\" read one; \"Warren Has a Plan For That\" read another.</p><p> In a campaign all about lofty principles and proposals, the coloring sheets gave new meaning to Warren's emphasis on ground-game.</p><p> \"Even if the big money doesn't like me, even if the big donors don't like me,\" Warren said, \"we need the big ideas to meet the big problems of our time.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUADCT-57f5d8a78f570ccb3dfc42097aeb779be6919f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUADCT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXK-GYG1-JBCN-44CF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">387677</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"901\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Lee Enterprises, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Elizabeth Warren speaks, every muscle in her body is activated\u2014her arms swing like a conductor's, her finger strikes up at the sky, her chin lifts or her shoulders shift to emphasize a point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To her supporters, Warren's characteristic vitality shows she has the muster to deliver on promises of \"big structural change,\" her slogan as she campaigns to be the Democratic nominee for president.</p><p> To her critics, Warren's charisma and organizing prowess won't be enough to enact some of her boldest ideas, including her hallmark \"wealth tax\" on millionaires and billionaires.</p><p> But in Davenport on Sunday afternoon, Warren emphasized the ways she could use the many muscles of the federal government to \"improve the lives of hardworking people\" without needing Congressional buy-in.</p><p> According to Warren, the Secretary of Education can cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans. The president can bring down the prices of drugs still held under patent. Drilling and mining can stop on all federal lands. Federal regulators can break up big tech companies with existing antitrust laws.</p><p> \"I understand how these agencies work,\" Warren said, referring to her foundational work with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a watchdog group founded after the Great Recession. \"I'm the only candidate on the debate stage who has run a federal agency. I built one, from the ground up. I went from two employees to 1,000 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\"</p><p> In Davenport, Warren held a town hall at the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds and sat down for an exclusive interview with the editorial board of the Quad-City Times. Her weekend in Iowa included stops in Manchester and Dubuque on Saturday and Maquoketa on Sunday.</p><p> Warren rose to prominence after the Great Recession as the chair of a congressional panel overseeing mortgage foreclosures, the government bailout, banks and business, among other topics. A longtime professor at Harvard Law School, Warren had decided in the second grade that she wanted to become a public-school teacher.</p><p> Her Davenport speech before a crowd of 600 had the ease of a professor comfortable in front of a large lecture hall.</p><p> Significant time was spent on Warren's proposed wealth tax, what she calls the \"Ultra-Millionaire Tax.\" It works by taxing 2 cents on every dollar owned by households worth more than $50 million and 6 cents on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion. The tax would apply to fewer than 80,000 households, or the richest 0.1%, and generate an estimated $3 trillion over a decade.</p><p> The proposal has generated intense backlash, particularly from the richest Americans and from big companies. Warren points to surveys showing a majority of Americans \u2014 including Democrats, Independents and Republicans \u2014 support the wealth tax.</p><p> \"If you own a home, you've been paying a wealth tax\u2014it's just called a property tax,\" Warren told the fairgrounds crowd. \"All I'm saying is that for millionaires and billionaires, their property tax shouldn't just be real estate. It should also be stock portfolios, the diamonds, the Rembrandt and the yacht.\"</p><p> The wealth tax, she said, would generate enough money to fund universal childcare for young kids and universal pre-K, to invest $800 billion in public education, to eliminate tuition at public institutions for higher education and to cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans.</p><p> The wealth tax \u2014 and the tall task of muscling it through Congress \u2014 sounds too good to be true to many Iowans, even some caucusgoers who otherwise like Warren and her bold vision for a more equitable America.</p><p> \"They're great ideas,\" said Janet Martin, of Davenport. \"But can she get them done? That's my biggest concern.\" Martin is an undecided voter, and she left Warren's event without committing to the 70-year-old senator.</p><p> Warren told the Times editorial board she doesn't believe the Trump administration when it claimed that the killing of Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani was justified because Soleimani posed an \"imminent\" threat to the U.S.</p><p> Warren suggested Trump is trying to distract from his imminent impeachment trial, and that the killing was \"particularly dangerous because he brings us right to the edge of war. Our country is less safe today than it was before the president took these actions,\" she added.</p><p> Warren also took shots at fellow presidential contender Tom Steyer, the Democratic activist and billionaire. Although she did not name Steyer, Warren decried how \"a billionaire bought his way onto the Democratic debate stage\" while U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris dropped out due to fundraising concerns.</p><p> The event ended with Warren's signature selfie line, a human chain of volunteers who assist supporters snagging photos with the candidate. According to the campaign, Warren has taken more than 100,000 such selfies.</p><p> Throughout her hour-long appearance, children in the back corner of the crowd were sitting on the ground, using crayons to color in sheets of paper with Warren-inspired slogans: \"The Best President Money Can't Buy,\" read one; \"Warren Has a Plan For That\" read another.</p><p> In a campaign all about lofty principles and proposals, the coloring sheets gave new meaning to Warren's emphasis on ground-game.</p><p> \"Even if the big money doesn't like me, even if the big donors don't like me,\" Warren said, \"we need the big ideas to meet the big problems of our time.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIL-9f4ceb6a71f73747f4554ff4f9eae618564cbbc3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28DACD91329AA1 NWBKIL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXM-B931-DXVP-V32J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399548</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"902\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Lee Enterprises, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It is now pursuing Google for abuse of market power for not agreeing to pay publishers for its use of their content.</p><p>In recent days the stakes got even higher for the government and Sims when US President Donald Trump pulled out of global talks to introduce a digital tax and threatened to impose tariffs on imports if the talks continued.</p><p>The OECD had been in discussions with 137 countries to introduce a global digital tax by the end of the year. The OECD will continue negotiating, despite the threats.</p><p>But if Sims comes up with a code - and a payment for media content - that Google and Facebook accept, it could provide a template for the rest of the world, avoiding an internet tax and potential trade wars.</p><p>In simple terms, the tech giants will need to weigh up whether they deal with Australia and accept a certain annual fee, which will set a global precedent, or take the risk of an internet tax imposed on them by a group of 136 countries, or have countries go it alone and levy huge charges on them.</p><p>Frydenberg has set an end of July deadline for Sims to deliver a draft report, followed by a final report and legislation shortly after.</p><p>Frydenberg told The Australian Financial Review the introduction of a mandatory code would support a sustainable media landscape by codifying the commercial relationship between digital platforms and news media businesses.</p><p>The code would respond to key issues identified by the ACCC in its Digital Platforms Inquiry, namely market dominance of Google and Facebook in their respective advertising markets, and an increasing risk of the diminution of certain types of journalism, as the traditional news business model continues to be eroded by more media being consumed online.</p><p>\"We are determined to implement a mandatory code that better protects and informs Australian consumers and addresses bargaining power imbalances between digital platforms and media companies,\" Frydenberg said.</p><p>A key challenge is to work out how much Google and Facebook should pay for the use of media content. The next challenge is how to distribute it to the various media players.</p><p>Australian media companies are split on the amount the tech giants should pay and how to deal with them.</p><p>News Corp wants to deal directly, while Nine (the owner of the Financial Review) favours a group approach.</p><p>Sims is likely to accommodate both options; allow media companies to deal directly with the tech giants or bargain collectively.</p><p>But he needs to reduce the risk of the code being gamed by ensuring it captures all media companies in the event that Google is tempted to pick off one media company from the rest and do a deal. It would leave the others out in the cold, financially and not listed in its Google news search. To allow that to happen would be catastrophic for an already weakened Australian media.</p><p>Sims also needs to find a way to incorporate far stronger penalties into the code than the typical maximum penalty of $60,000 for code breaches given the size of Google and Facebook.</p><p>Relying on competition law as a fallback for breaches won't work as it takes too long. Big tech needs to face fines of up to $10 million for each breach of the code, as other companies already face under consumer and competition law.</p><p>The code must work quickly and effectively because the media industry is running out of time.</p><p>To put it into perspective, the Public Interest Journalism Initiative is tracking changes to news production and availability through its Australian Newsroom Mapping Project.</p><p>According to the map data in the past couple of months, more than 21 titles have permanently closed. Dozens of rural and regional titles are temporarily suspended due to COVID-19 or the bushfires, with a fear that some will never reopen.</p><p>According to PIJI chairman Professor Allan Fels, a former chairman of the ACCC, the impact of media closures and cutbacks on local communities has been profound.</p><p>\"A survey we conducted showed that one-third of local councils no longer has local media reporting on them,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's a news desert out there and it means that council corruption, unjustified spending and local information such as sports news, isn't getting reported.\"</p><p>The big media companies - Nine and News Corp - believe Google and Facebook they should pay hundreds of millions of dollars a year for news content.</p><p>Nine believes it should be at least $600 million, which represents about 10 per cent of advertising revenue, while News Corp believes the figure should be closer to $1 billion.</p><p>PIJI commissioned Essential Media to conduct a survey of more than 1000 respondents in April to gauge how much the public was prepared to pay for news, including public interest journalism.</p><p>The survey found that Australians were prepared to pay an aggregate of between $380 million and $740 million a year, with a mid-point of $560 million.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Google sees it differently. It doesn't think the news content is worth anything and makes a paltry $10 million a year in advertising revenue from news in Australia.</p><p>It argues that its search engine drives traffic to media company websites. Facebook has a similar view.</p><p>What Google and Facebook think is irrelevant. They both have huge monopoly power to set the price terms they pay for news content, if there isn't regulation. For the big tech companies it is rough justice.</p><p>The ACCC will be looking for a figure in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>Frydenberg wrote an opinion piece in April that for every $100 spent by advertisers in Australia on online advertising, excluding classifieds, $47 goes to Google, $24 to Facebook and $29 to other participants. In Australia, this market is worth almost $9 billion a year and has grown more than eight-fold since 2005.</p><p>\"It is only fair that the search engines and social media giants pay for the original news content that they use to drive traffic to their sites,\" he said.</p><p>\"By way of example, the ACCC found that between 8 per cent and 14 per cent of Google search results included reports from news websites.\"</p><p>Frydenberg used fighting words. \"There is too is much at stake - nothing less than the future of our media landscape.\"</p><p>Given the poor track record of other countries to get the big tech companies to pay for content, Sims has his work cut out for him.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7b3zhucr29s15p29o5ko</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606N-D901-F0J6-J0FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1178\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Data is a significant driver of our economies and the backbone of the world\u2019s most powerful technology companies.</p><p>Tech giants like Facebook, Amazon, and Google have consolidated their data-driven empires and expanded into new markets, where data fuels everything from dating apps and cloud gaming to automated shopping and online payments.</p><p>The cities of the future are also being built on data. These aren\u2019t Jetsons-esque leaps to flying cars and robot assistants, but subtly significant changes to the hidden infrastructure and advanced systems that make cities work for millions of people every day.</p><p>Street sensors that reduce collisions and congestion, heated sidewalks that melt snow, buildings that predict when to heat, cool, and illuminate rooms, emergency and social services that know when and where people need help\u2014these are the kind of urban improvements made possible when data about the behavior of people and objects is collected.Image: Sidewalk Toronto</p><p>The debate around ethical use of personal data in civic development is affecting local communities and global markets, and it\u2019s heating up. It\u2019s been at the heart of the Sidewalk Labs smart city experiment in Toronto, the city where I live and work. The project, owned by Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet Inc., was announced 18 months ago with a proposal to build a $1.3 billion data-driven model smart city on a 12-acre waterfront land parcel known as Quayside. It has since been plagued by resignations, firings, civic resistance, legal action, and significant public concern. Waterfront Toronto, the tri-government body tasked with overseeing the project, stiffened its negotiating stance and on Oct. 31 pushed Sidewalk Labs to offer a deal with better terms for Torontonians on data governance and profit sharing, among other issues.</p><p>Public sector and tech community leaders around the globe have been watching. But while representatives of the city of Toronto held its own and reps from Sidewalk Labs listened to public pushback, the first-order question remains:</p><p>How can cities around the world benefit from data-enabled technologies without sacrificing privacy?</p><p>Privacy paranoia, or surveillance capitalism?</p><p>My job is to think about the future of smart cities. In Toronto, I\u2019ve worked with city, provincial, and federal governments, startups, corporates, academics, and civic activists to find workable solutions to this wicked question. Together, we\u2019ve been able to map some of the uncharted territory between the polarizing extremes of privacy paranoia and surveillance capitalism.</p><p>Here are some significant challenges, along with the seeds of possible solutions, that Sidewalk Lab\u2019s provocation has elicited from Toronto\u2019s data experts.</p><p>Meaningful consent in the public realm is currently impossible</p><p>Unlike an app, streets and parks can\u2019t require their users to check a dialog box consenting to how their personal information will be used before granting access. In public spaces where personal information is collected\u2014take video footage that records people\u2019s faces in a crowd\u2014there is no easy way for people to opt out of giving their consent. Former Ontario privacy commissioner Anne Cavoukian has an answer to this: Privacy By Design, an international standard she pioneered.</p><p>When data collection is minimized and \u201cde-identified\u201d (the process of anonymizing data) at source, the risk of privacy violations can be dramatically reduced. And when no personal information is collected, consent is not required.</p><p>The most valuable insights require access to personal information</p><p>De-identifying data at source eases many privacy concerns, but it also strips the data of its most valuable details. It\u2019s a bit like building a powerful telescope to see far into space, only to put frosted glass over the lens. University of Toronto professors David Lie and Lisa Austin have proposed a solution in what they call safe sharing sites, a type of technical and legal interface for privacy-protective sharing of personal information.</p><p>The trick they propose is to encrypt personal information in a way that preserves the ability to run queries on the encrypted data. Analysts can ask questions that link together personal data, but they only ever see anonymized, aggregated results. All the questions and answers are recorded, creating an audit trail that allows regulators and courts to inspect how the data has been used and to penalize misuse.</p><p>Privacy laws are inadequate</p><p>Canada\u2019s current privacy laws were passed between 1983 and 1990, before Google, Facebook, big data and the Internet of Things. Meaning our current laws and policies are founded on strong principles, but they are in need of a significant refresh.Have you read?</p><p>Why smart cities need to make sure they're inclusive A smart city is being built in Toronto</p><p>Digital strategies are under review in all three levels of Canada\u2019s government, but policy change is slow, and smart city technologies change much faster. Kristina Verner, vice president at Waterfront Toronto, has suggested a solution in the form of Intelligent Community Guidelines. Modelled after Waterfront Toronto\u2019s highly successful Minimum Green Building Requirements, the guidelines would set a new standard for responsible data use that conforms with and exceeds all existing privacy legislation. The guideline terms would be developed based on feedback from public consultation, and enforced through contract law.</p><p>Legitimate institutions capable of city-scale data governance do not yet exist</p><p>In the wake of Cambridge Analytica, citizens are far less trusting of big tech to control their data. Privacy advocates are equally concerned with concentrating citizen data under government control, with warnings of something that could look like China\u2019s controversial social credit scoring system.</p><p>Who decides what data is collected, who it is shared with, and for what uses? My team at MaRS\u2014the largest innovation hub in North America\u2014 has proposed a new kind of organization: a civic digital trust. Such a body would be characterized by its political and financial independence, democratic legitimacy, fiduciary duty to city residents, and technical capacity to securely share data. Residents would form citizen assemblies to deliberate on allowable public benefit uses of city data. The civic digital trust would also ensure that the benefits of smart city data were equitably distributed to all.</p><p>There may be no silver bullet solution, but each of these seeds of solutions have shown early promise. To build on these smaller successes, we may at least have some form of silver buckshot: a portfolio of small and mutually reinforcing experiments in data governance that each solve into different aspects of the challenge.</p><p>But we can\u2019t afford to shoot first and ask questions later. Experimenting in the cities where we live, work and play demands the highest ethical standards, careful experimental design, safe-to-fail experimental sandboxes, and independent monitoring and evaluation. Nor can these experiments be carried out in isolation if the bigger data governance challenge is to be solved.</p><p>Solutions need to be developed and tested together, and in combination with other solutions from around the world.</p><p>Just as important as what is tested is who is at the table. If Sidewalk Labs has taught us anything, it\u2019s that citizens need a central role in setting the agenda and a meaningful role in evaluating data governance solutions. Governments need deeper tech expertise and greater capacity in data governance and regulatory innovation to act as leaders in shaping our future cities. Developers need to operate with unprecedented transparency, openness, and responsiveness to gain and maintain the social license to operate.The Quayside initiative will continue to spin off lessons for cities around the world as it winds its way through evaluations and consultations toward a possible approval at the end of March 2020\u2014and almost certainly for years afterward.</p><p>One of the most important takeaways may be the development of a playbook for trusted data sharing based on a coordinated campaign of civic-public-private experimentation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2712078</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPT-0H51-F0YC-N55W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1426\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The answer (gulp) may be a liberal one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Matt Lewis</p><p>09.20.17 9:00 PM ET</p><p>Reports that Facebookhelped spread fake news brewed in Russia raises the question of whether Big Data has gotten too big and unaccountable.</p><p>According to the social network, the ads in question \u201cappeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum-touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.\u201d In other words, they featured hot-button issues that are ripping our social fabric apart at the seams.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Whether this \u201cmistake\u201d was generated by profit motive, nefarious greed, or gross negligence, Facebook\u2019s abdication of moral responsibility provides additional fodder for critics on both sides of the aisle. If liberals worry that innovation is unraveling privacy and worker protections, then patriotic conservatives should be worried about the impact on traditional institutions, including the efficacy of our elections.</p><p>This news also reinforces the position of right-wing populists like former White House senior adviser <person><nameText>Steve Bannon, </nameText></person>who wants to regulate Facebookand Google like public utilities.</p><p>Big tech companies are ostensibly \u201cprogressive\u201d (which might help explain why some on the populist right dislike them), but mainstream conservatives have cheered their entrepreneurial spirit (see Uber vs. regulations).</p><p>We are now entering into a phase where even free-market conservatives may have to rethink their tech utopian dreams.</p><p>Until recently, conservatives tended to view entrepreneurial progress as an unalloyed good-and the entrepreneur as a sort of hero. But this view is simplistic. There are always tradeoffs, and-in many ways-disruption is sometimes at odds with traditional conservative values-a point that has become more obvious in the era of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Steve Bannon.</nameText></person></p><p>Related in Politics</p><p>Trump Damaged Democracy, Silicon Valley Will Finish It Off</p><p>Exclusive: Russians Pushed Trump Rallies in 17 U.S. Cities</p><p>Congress Gets to See Russia's FacebookPropaganda. Will You?</p><p>This is not a new observation, however. In his classic book, The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism, writer and sociologist Daniel Bell observes that \u201cdelayed gratification, career orientation, devotion to enterprise\u201d are still valued attributes. \u201cYet,\u201d Bell notes, \u201con the marketing side, the sale of goods, packaged in the glossy images of glamour and sex, promotes a hedonistic way of life whose premise is the voluptuous gratification of the lineaments of desire. The consequence of this contradiction... is that a corporation finds its people straight by day and swingers by night.\u201d</p><p>Long before social media, social conservatives had to wrestle with an amoral capitalism that, left unchecked, undermines traditional values and institutions. The rise of companies like Facebookhas simply taken this struggle to a new level. Today, the challenge isn\u2019t merely defending traditional values, it is defending the American system itself.</p><p>The immediate question is: Should the government be regulating Facebook?</p><p>On Fox News Sunday last week, former Speaker Newt Gingrich and Townhall.com\u2019s Guy Benson-both conservatives-engaged in this internecine proxy battle. \u201cI think having the wild, wild West when companies are small is exactly right,\u201d Gingrich conceded, before adding, \u201cSeveral of these companies are so enormous that there\u2019s some sense of, what does it mean to us as a free society to have global corporations run by founding billionaires... and there\u2019s been almost no supervision...\u201d</p><p>Benson responded with a free-market argument. \u201cMy faith in the ability of government to respond to that well through regulation is very low,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is?government is slow-moving. It is the opposite of innovative. And the Internet is a miracle. And it wouldn\u2019t exist as it does today if the government\u2019s clumsy hand had been on its neck from day one.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not alone. I asked Zac Moffatt, CEO of Targeted Victory, a GOP firm that is prominent in the tech world, about regulating Facebook\u2019s political ads. \u201cTo me, this is Washington looking for a silver bullet to explain how something they could never imagine happening, actually happened,\u201d he said.</p><p>Technological advances have muddied the political waters, as is evidenced by how conservatives have viewed this issue from different perspectives. Whether it\u2019s free speech or free markets, it\u2019s increasingly difficult to be an absolutist in Trump\u2019s 21st century America.</p><p>Facebookhas abdicated its inherent and implied responsibility. Unless there\u2019s a better answer, I\u2019m afraid that Big Data has put out the welcome mat for Big Government.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-1941139839</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TKD-HB71-DY0W-4306-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 21, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

On Sep 17, Trump announced tariffs of 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods in a statement that is likely to take effect on Sep 24. However, Apple's shares still plummeted 2.7% on Monday.It's not only Apple but other tech majors too took a hit after the announcement of fresh tariffs. Tech stocks have been reeling under pressure for quite some time, particularly those that have significant exposure to China and generate substantial portion of their revenues from that country. </p><p>In fact, a few tech players, including Apple, had earlier this month stated that another round of tariffs could hurt them.Will Apple Escape Tariff Troubles?Apparently, yes. Per Bloomberg, Apple's Apple Watch and AirPods headphone have been spared the latest round of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, according to the office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The 10% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods is likely to come into effect on Sep 24. Also, similar smart watches like competitor Fitbit, Inc.FIT[2] are not on the list. However, both Apple and Fitbit's shares plummeted on Monday. Shares of Fitbit declined 1.1%.Moreover, smart watches that use Bluetooth wireless communications, the technology used in Apple Watch and AirPods, too might be exemptedfrom the latest round of tariffs. In fact, the Trump administration had removed proposals on flat-panel television sets from the first round of tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods in June.Earlier this month, Apple had said that some of its products, including Apple Watch, would be affected if another round of tariffs is imposed. This saw shares of Apple declining for most of last week. In response, Trump tweeted that there's an easy way of avoiding tariffs for Apple and that isby shifting its production to the United States. Apple has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[3].Per International Data Corp,Apple sold 4.7 billion smart watches in 2017, while Fitbit sold 2.7 billion. Apple does a bulk of its manufacturing in China via contract manufacturers. Hence higher tariffs mean importing its products to the United States at a higher cost. This could make Apple shift production to the United States and other markets.It is now to be seen how China retaliates. China is one of the biggest markets for Apple. The company shipped more than 41 million iPhones to China in 2017, generating around 20% of its total revenues. China could make things difficult for Apple if the trade war escalates via taxes and regulatory measures.What's in Store for Other Tech Companies?Apple isn't the only tech major worried about tariffs. Earlier this month, a number of big tech companies like Dell Technologies Inc. DVMT[4], Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCO[5] and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company HPE[6] had requested U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to reconsider White House's plan of imposing tariffs of up to 25% on Chinese imports as it would affect their business.On Monday, shares of Cisco Systems, Dell and Hewlett Packard declined 0.6%, 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively. According to a recent report by Morgan Stanley MS[7], tit-for-tat tariffs would have an increasingly detrimental effect on the global supply chain. Tech companies with significant exposure to China have been reeling since Trump announced tariffs in early March.This includes a number of chipmakerslike Skyworks Solutions, Inc.SWKS[8], Qualcomm, Inc.QCOM[9], Broadcom, Inc.AVGO[10] and Micron Technology, Inc.MU[11], which generate maximum revenues from China. Shares of Skyworks Solutions, Qualcomm, Broadcom and Micron declined 1.7%, 2.5%, 0.7% and 1.6%, respectively, on Sep 17. Tech companies, particularly chipmakers, will now be waiting to seehow China retaliates to these tariffs. 5 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007? Now 2018 looks to be a pivotal year to get in on another emerging technology expected to rock the market. Demand could soar from almost nothing to $42 billion by 2025. Reports suggest it could save 10 million lives per decade which could in turn save $200 billion in U.S. healthcare costs.

Before then, things that needed control were controlled by people on the spot. But as district heating systems, railway networks, electric grids and the like grew more complex, it began to make sense to put the controls all in one place. Dials and light bulbs brought the way the world was working into the room. Levers, stopcocks, switches and buttons sent decisions back out. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By the 1960s control rooms had become a powerful icon of the modern. At Mission Control in Houston, young men in horn rimmed glasses and crewcuts sent commands to spacecraft heading for the Moon. In the space seen through television sets, travellers exploring strange new worlds did so within an iconic control room of their own: the bridge of Star Trek's   USS     Enterprise. </p><p>A hexagonal room built in Santiago de Chile a decade later fitted right into the same philosophy\u2014and aesthetic. It had an array of screens full of numbers and arrows. It was linked to a powerful computer. It had futuristic swivel chairs, complete with geometric buttons in the armrests to control the displays. Unlike the Johnson Space Centre and the Enterprise, it even had a small bar where occupants could serve themselves drinks after a hard day's controlling.</p><p>The operations room of \"Project Cybersyn\" (short for \"cybernetics synergy\") was created by Chile's president Salvador Allende in the early 1970s as a place from which the country's newly nationalised and socialised economy could be directed. To build it, Allende had hired Stafford Beer, a British consultant, who requisitioned a mainframe computer and connected it to telex machines in factories. Industrial managers would input data which would then be centrally analysed; instructions for any necessary changes would be sent back.</p><p>Ironically, the socialist system's most notable success was in outmanoeuvring lorry drivers whose strike threatened to bring down Allende's government in 1972. After Chile's generals stormed the presidential palace on September 11th 1973 and Allende killed himself, Cybersyn was destroyed: a soldier is said to have stabbed all the screens in the operations room with a knife. </p><p>It was a bloody reprisal of a then half-century-old debate about how best to run an economy. Allende had thought that, with state-of-the-art 1970s communications and computers, it would be possible for government to optimise an industrial economy. The Chicago-school economists advising Pinochet in Chile thought that the far greater information-processing capacity of the market would do better. In Chile their opinion was imposed by force.</p><p>The success of market- and semi-market-based economies since then has made the notion of a planned economy seem like a thing of the past. But were a latter-day Allende to build a Cybersyn 2.0 it could now gather data via billions of sensors rather than a few telex machines, and crunch them in data centres packed with tens of thousands of servers. Given enough power, might it not replace the autonomous choices on which the market is based? </p><p>Already a sense of technological control is spreading through society. The control room has given way to the cloud as the site where decisions are made. There is no central headquarters at Uber sending out drivers, no Borgesian library at Google where things are looked up. Just algorithms that seem to manage more and more of the world's work, and make more and more decisions. Sometimes they run the software of the market, as when serving ads on your screen to the bidder who most wants your attention. But they could also run the software of the polis or the state. </p><p>As Jack Ma, until recently the executive chairman of Alibaba, a Chinese online conglomerate, put it at a conference in 2017: \"Over the past 100 years, we have come to believe that the market economy is the best system.\" But in the next three decades, \"because of access to all kinds of data, we may be able to find the invisible hand of the market.\" Find it and help it? Anticipate it? Disable it? That was not clear. </p><p>And if technology can outperform the invisible hand in  the economy, might it be able to do the same at the ballot box when it comes to politics? If computer systems can divine what voters want and help those in power deliver it, the mandate they have for that power may come to matter less.</p><p>One of the great arguments for democracy is what Fritz Schapf, a German scholar of politics, calls \"input legitimacy\". Even if a system does not give people what they want, the fact that those running it reflect a democratic choice is legitimising. Undemocratic governments have to develop some mixture of \"output legitimacy\"\u2014giving the people what they want\u2014and frank repression. Today's information technology can help with both. It can provide not just data on what people want and will tolerate, but also the means to manipulate those desires. When such means are available to actors within or outside a state the struggle to gain, or for that matter retain, a democracy which reflects a genuine popular will might become even harder than it is. </p><p>This is the sort of idea that leads thinkers like Yuval Harari, an Israeli historian, to suggest that ever more capable information technology means that not just free-market economics but also liberal democracy might \"become obsolete\" over the coming century. He argues this is particularly likely if information technology is partnered with biotechnology, allowing its algorithms to access and act on human thought. This does not necessarily have to entail tyranny. It might mean something even stranger. </p><p>On some of their adventures Star Trek's various starships encounter the Borg, a more-than-species which uses nanotechnology and computers to assimilate all those whom it encounters into its own collective. Its members all hear what each hears, all see what each sees, all will what each wills: there are no individuals; there are no aims but those of the collective. The demands of television drama mean that the Borg's shared will may be represented by a leader\u2014a queen for the spacefaring ant hill. The logic of the idea says otherwise, suggesting a truly equal, truly efficient hive that might persist with neither central control nor overt oppression, optimised only for assimilation. </p><p>The Borg are a fantasy of totalitarianism, not a technological prediction. But as data processing pervades more and more of human life, displacing and recasting all sorts of processes, experiences and relationships, is it really inconceivable that they might begin to impinge on the processes of choice central both to market economies and liberal democracy? All-pervading information technology of the sort the world is embracing does not have to lead to strict economic and political control. But the possibility needs to be examined to be avoided. </p><p>2. Costs and calculations</p><p>The industrial states which fought the first world war brought their economies under centralised control to a degree Europe had never seen before. And many observers thought it had worked rather well. In 1919 Otto Neurath, an Austrian-born economist who in his youth had studied the pre-monetary economy of ancient Egypt, argued that there were lessons from this success. If the state was able to calculate how many uniforms and munitions were needed in wartime\u2014which he knew it could, because he had been in charge of efforts to that end\u2014it could surely do so for other goods in peacetime.</p><p>Thus began what became known as the \"socialist calculation debate\", a now obscure episode which changed the way people thought about the economy. The thinkers who went on to shape the new market liberalism of the second half of the century were on the side of the debate which held that control by planners could not work. In making this case, they introduced the idea of the economy as an information-processing system. And it is precisely that idea which opens the possibility that Mr Ma of Alibaba invokes. If markets are a success because of the way they process information, the fact that the other ways of processing information developed over recent decades are now so incredibly powerful must surely have implications for their role in the future.</p><p>The calculation debate was not a matter of dry academic tit-for-tat. Soviet Marxism-Leninism was dedicated to the idea that an economy could be planned, and Russian industrialisation of a basically agrarian state seemed to many socialists in the West to bear the idea out. The Soviet Union made at least one theoretical contribution, too. In the 1930s Leonid Kantorovich, a Russian economist, saw how to manipulate a mathematical model of the economy so as to optimise its outputs through a technique called \"linear programming\". The idea earned him the only Nobel prize for economics ever won by a Soviet citizen. In 1937 Oskar Lange, a Polish economist who later taught at the University of Chicago, but also served communist Poland at the United Nations and on the council of state, proposed a mathematical way of importing some of the virtues of markets into such planned economies by using \"shadow prices\" for basic inputs to calculate the optimal allocation of resources.</p><p>In their responses to Neurath and Lange, respectively, Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich von Hayek, two Austrian economists, argued that using machinery for such calculations would never be able to beat the results achieved by markets, because markets were also machines\u2014and vastly better ones. They ceaselessly crunched through all the data an economy had to offer in order to calculate what was available and what was wanted; the output of their calculations was what things cost. The processing power they embodied was of a different order from that available through calculations or the rules planners used to control things. </p><p>When Glen Weyl, an economist who works for Microsoft, characterises the calculation debate as \"basically an argument about computational complexity before Alan Turing formalised the concept 20 years later\" he is hardly being anachronistic. By the time Hayek wrote his seminal essay, \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\", in 1945, he was able to write about the market in terms that directly evoke information technology: it was a \"machinery for registering change?a system of telecommunications which enables individual producers to watch merely the movement of a few pointers, as an engineer might watch the hands of a few dials.\" </p><p>But this machine, Hayek went on, did not just register change. It generated new information\u2014information which made the world intelligible, and thus informed the activity within it. What would happen was not merely unknown before the market got to work: it was unknowable. And an economy which cannot be predicted cannot be controlled.</p><p>There was another key difference between the market's calculation-in-the-world and the planners' calculation-in-the-calculator. The engineer looking at the screens in Hayek's analogy is not a member of the technocratic elite locked up in a control room. It is anyone with access to price data. As a calculator, the market is essentially decentralised and accessible to all: that is why, in the view of Hayek and his followers, it fits so well with liberal democracy. Everyone is free to make their own decisions.</p><p>For a period of time planning still seemed to work. During the post-Stalin \"thaw\" of the 1950s America saw its nuclear arsenal matched and was beaten into orbit, prompting real questions about which system worked better. Though the Soviet economy was never as strong as it hoped to look, that was a time when new ideas and the first computers allowed Kantorovich and his disciples to believe they might truly be able to turn the Soviet economy into \"its own self-victualling tablecloth\". Francis Spufford's book \"Red Plenty\" (2010), a blend of history, economics, science and fiction, reimagines that optimism\u2014and shows how it fell apart in the complexity, criminality and unintended consequences of Soviet life. Democratic and market processes act to even out human fallibility and explore all sorts of possibilities. Planned dictatorships narrow choices and amplify error.</p><p>The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, and China's subsequent decision to diminish the role of planning and embrace markets in much of its economy saw an unprecedented global boom. The market side of the debate seemed conclusively proved right. Some saw the Soviet collapse as making an allied point about politics; that decentralised freedom worked better. In 2012 Henry Farrell and Cosma Shazili, of George Washington University and Carnegie Mellon University, respectively, put this argument in a way that made it formally similar to the calculation debate. Democracy, they argued, has a \"capacity unmatched?in solving complex problems\".</p><p>To understand why this may be, consider the informational challenges faced by centralised or authoritarian regimes. They lack what Mr Shazili calls a \"feedback channel\". Just as markets generate information about what people want, so does open discussion. In autocracies, citizens have no interest in openly discussing problems or experimenting with solutions, lest they end up in jail or worse. As a result, an unelected government has a limited capacity to understand what is going on in its polity\u2014and thus tends to make bad decisions. Dictators maintain extensive security apparatuses not just to repress the people but to understand them; they serve as the feedback channel through which dictators get the information which they need to govern.</p><p>Such measures are not just an affront to human rights. They are politically destabilising. The head of an effective security service can easily become either a rival for the top spot or a self-censoring information block, neither of which bodes well for the boss. And for the dictatorships of the early- and mid-20th century, snooping was expensive. In 1989, the last year East Germany functioned as a state, more than 260,000 people worked full- or part-time for the Stasi, its security service. That was nearly 2% of the population.</p><p>3. The intoxications of technology</p><p>Despite its advantages, both in terms of economic growth and problem solving, 21st-century free-market liberal democracy has not enjoyed quite the apotheosis that some expected at the beginning of the 1990s. The setbacks to democratic norms at the level of the state have been well documented. The persistence of planning goes unnoticed because it is so familiar: it is the way that companies are run. </p><p>Around the time the cold war ended Herbert Simon, another Nobel-prize-winning economist and a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), argued that talking about economies purely in terms of market transactions left a huge amount of what actually goes on in the world unexamined. To make his point he offered up a thought experiment. Suppose an alien intelligence\u2014or, for that matter, the USS Enterprise, going into orbit, as is its wont, around an M-class planet\u2014were to study a strange world with \"a telescope which reveals social structures\". Pointed at the Earth, Simon argued, that telescope would show lots of solid green areas with faint interior contours linked by a network of thin red lines. Both colours would be dynamic; new red links would form and old ones perish; some green blobs would grow, others shrivel. Now or then one blob might engulf another. </p><p>The green blobs in Simon's vision were firms and other organisations in which people work; the red lines, market transactions. And if asked what the long-range scanner revealed, the observer would reply \"large green areas interconnected by red lines\" not \"a network of red lines connecting green spots\". By concentrating only on the red lines representing market transactions, Simon said, classical economics misses out a great deal of what happens in the world. And in that missing part of the world, decisions are routinely subject to a great deal of planning, the information processing for which takes place in management hierarchies. Simon would not have been at all surprised to find that, 30 years on, those hierarchies were increasingly enabled by, and dependent on, computers processing reams of data. </p><p> \"Internally, firms are planned economies no different to the Soviet Union: hierarchical, undemocratic planned economies,\" write Leigh Phillips and Michal Rozworski, two leftist activists, in \"The People's Republic of Walmart\" (2019), a highly readable romp through the history and possible futures of planning. The management, marketing, logistics and manufacturing functions of big companies all exhibit huge amounts of planning (some of which, in areas like the layout of factory floors or the design of supply chains, may well use linear programming and related techniques). Amazon and Walmart display levels of planning that Gosplan, the Soviet Union's central planning agency, could never have hoped to match. </p><p>Today, applied within firms, such planning is used to maximise profit\u2014and the tendency of such centralisation to produce corruption and other adverse effects is kept at bay through all manner of law and corporate-governance mechanisms. Messrs Phillips and Rozworski argue that if similar tools were applied more widely in an economy under democratic control other goals could also be taken into account and optimised: health; the environment; leisure time. It is a message that resonates with at least some on the left who are embracing anew the idea of a post-scarcity \"Fully Automated Luxury Communism\", to borrow the title of a book by Aaron Bastani, a left-wing media entrepreneur. </p><p>Actual existing communism, such as it is, is neither fully automated nor, for most people, luxurious. It is also little interested in putting the power to plan under democratic control. Indeed in pursuing its goal of actively managing a \"harmonious\" society, the Chinese Communist Party shows every sign of wanting more or less the reverse: not the democratisation of planning, but the sort of planning that permits democracy to be minimised. As Rogier Creemers of Leiden University explains it, the party (which, it should be noted, includes many engineers in its high ranks) thinks that, like the natural world, social reality is underpinned by objective laws. If a government understands these laws, it can predict how society will work, which will allow society to be controlled. \"It's a pure rejection of Hayek,\" says Mr Creemers.</p><p>With the tools at their disposal today, planners and controllers would seem to have no hope of competing with organically grown information-processing systems such as markets and democracy. But the power and reach of the tools available grows all the time.  More than half the people on Earth already carry a hand-held sensor-packed computer. Many millions can make things happen just by speaking into thin air, thanks to the fact that computers are always listening for their command\u2014and thus for anything else which may be going on. Few doubt that, barring some derailing catastrophe, the amount and variety of data gathered, processed and transmitted around the world will continue to grow. Let a thousand satellites bloom, a trillion sensors sense. There are already a thousand times as many transistors etched on to silicon every year than there are grains of rice and wheat grown in fields. Why should that multiplier not be a million? </p><p>It is not only the quantity of data that has changed since the days of Soviet planning and Stasi snooping. There have been huge qualitative changes, too. Gosplan had to make do mostly with production data, which were often wrong because factory managers had many reasons to over- or under-report. </p><p>Today's digital information comes in real-time streams, not static statistics, taken directly not just from machines but from people, for instance by tracking subconscious eye movements. And the programming techniques\u2014including self-programming techniques\u2014now bundled up under the catch-all term AI can derive all sorts of meaning from them. Such systems embody that with which Kantorovich and his planners could not cope: effects related to their causes in complex, non-linear ways.</p><p>Yet none of this means either efficient or effective planning is possible in the near term, or perhaps ever. For a start, a wider qualitative range of data does not equate to higher quality data; each new way of looking at the world through machinery is likely to bring its own biases, and in a data deluge these could become harder to spot.</p><p>It is also worth keeping in mind that, though Messrs Phillips and Rozworski are correct that companies do a lot of planning, they do it suboptimally; indeed, many of them do it so badly they go out of business. Competition assures you that when this happens other companies will keep going. But that redundancy would be hard to come by if planning took on more and more of the economy. </p><p>And economic planning really is hard. Inspired by Mr Spufford's \"Red Plenty\", in 2012 Mr Shazili published a fascinating mathematical exegesis of Soviet planning online. If Gosplan had been given a good modern computer and today's snazziest linear-programming software it would have taken a few minutes to solve the equations needed to optimally allocate resources over the 12m products the Soviet Union was making in 1983. But factor in a range of further relevant variables\u2014quality, technical specifications, delivery locations and the like\u2014for each product and the calculations get much much harder. If there are a thousand variables associated with every product, the computing power needed goes up by a factor of 30bn.</p><p>Suresh Naidu of Columbia University thinks such calculations may, from a planner's point of view, be overly pessimistic. You do not need to model the whole economy. Some entities\u2014industrial sectors, labour markets\u2014could be optimised separately, allowing separate planning problems to be solved in parallel. \"We're never going to plan the economy like the Soviets, with a giant matrix with every good in it,\" explains Mr Naidu, \"but we could get it right on average.\"</p><p>But could you plan a moving target? If the role of AI within the economy increases, so will the economy's complexity. As Alex Tabarrok, an economist at George Mason University, puts it: \"The problem of perfectly organising an economy does not become easier with greater computing power precisely because greater computing power also makes the economy more complex.\"</p><p>And there is the problem of Goodhart's Law, named for Charles Goodhart, an economist: data known to be used for planning purposes cease to be good measures of the way the world is. Yu Yong-ding, a Chinese economist, saw this in action during the Great Leap Forward. Chairman Mao decreed that China should produce more steel: as a result, much of the country's existing stocks of the metal were melted down in backyard furnaces which produced poor quality pig iron. Mr Yu is now an adviser to China's National Development and Reform Commission, which is in charge of developing the country's five-year plans, a reasonably broad-brush endeavour he supports. He is utterly sceptical about microeconomic planning. \"If you are not God, you cannot foresee everything,\" he says with a smile. Hayek could not have put it better. </p><p>4. A screen pressed up against a human face forever</p><p>China's leadership may be as convinced as Mr Yu that fine-grained economic prediction, and thus control, remain impossible. But when it comes to using computers for social and political control it seems, predictably, much more keen. </p><p>A lot of this is relatively straightforward repression, seen in its most extreme form in Xinjiang, a region in western China where most of the citizens are Uighurs, a Muslim minority. In cities, cameras are everywhere, as are checkpoints where residents must show ID cards and allow their faces to be scanned. They are also required to install a smartphone app that allows police to track them and access their data. This is not an alternative to the internment camps in which hundreds of thousands of Uighurs are confined. It is an extension of them.</p><p> There also are softer, but perhaps more far reaching, applications of information technology. To police public conversation, as China's censors are tasked to do all across the country, means listening to it. What people talk about on social media shows what they care about. It thus describes what the state needs to do to achieve \"output legitimacy\". Active manipulation of the public conversation provides another avenue for control. So does the \"social credit system\", which is meant to use a range of data to give citizens a trustworthiness score, though it is still a fragmentary work in progress, at best.</p><p>For a catastrophising imagination, it may seem only a few steps from here to the Borg. Add a few biological implants, AI which hears everything and draws conclusions about potential instabilities and an ability to provide for the basic needs of all, and you have your cybernetic ants' nest. But that is quite a stretch. Ultra-wired dictators would run into similar problems as economic planners. Even in relatively small countries it is exceedingly difficult, not least because of social media, to predict what will drive change where. Hong Kong is an excellent worked example. And social engineering via AI risks going badly wrong, as Mr Shazili's sometime co-author Mr Farrell points out in a recent blog post. AI systems make mistakes and develop biases. If the people the AI is being used on suffer as a result, that is bad for them; but it might be even worse for a government relying on the AI's insights for control. \"Machine learning ... may turn out to be a disaster for authoritarianism\", writes Mr Farrell. </p><p>When it comes to eroding an existing democracy, rather than shoring up a dictatorship, there are somewhat similar technologies on offer. Some are destructive. Social media, driven as its commercial interests are by the desire to \"go viral\", offers ways to inject the equivalent of computer viruses into the public's political information processing, degrading and distorting its output through misinformation, emotional incontinence and cognitive sabotage. </p><p>Some are less obviously abhorrent. Neither scoring for some sort of social credit nor sophisticated surveillance tools are the sole preserve of authoritarian states. Online, people happily allow firms to follow their every move\u2014where they are, what they buy, what they like and even what they think\u2014and build up profiles of them scored for any number of characteristics. State surveillance can gel with the self-administered form. More than 400 American police departments have agreements with Amazon that allow them to access the cameras associated with the company's video-doorbell service, Ring. The \"surveillance-based economic order\", as Shoshana Zuboff of Harvard Business School calls it, is not identical to what is growing in China. But the two systems have clear similarities. </p><p>A visit to the heart of one of Earth's greatest green splodges reinforces a sense of what is afoot. In many ways, Apple is on the side of the angels when it comes to surveillance; no other big tech company takes privacy so seriously. Employees are no longer as afraid of error as they were when the late Steve Jobs still ran the place. Even senior executives sport a relaxed untucked look, a faint echo of Apple's countercultural origins. </p><p>The great glass torus which houses the company's headquarters is bright, clean and beautiful, its processes hyper-efficient and environmentally friendly. But from within it feels more than slightly sect-like. The transparency is amazing\u2014the floors curve away into the distance, workers on the other side of the building can be seen across the central garden. But transparency does not mean openness. Doors let you through when you swipe the right badge. Cameras are everywhere, albeit well hidden. In 2017 an employee was fired after his young daughter took a video of him in the Apple cafeteria using an iPhone that had not been released and posted it online. </p><p>Designed by Norman Foster, an architect besotted with flight, the building is often likened to a spaceship\u2014an impression reinforced by the fact that its foundations are decoupled from Earth's crust by a system of 700 steel disks which allows it to move back and forth during an earthquake. But is it a flying saucer readying itself for launch? Or has it just touched down, the beachhead of a courteous, almost welcome invasion from the fully networked, algorithmically optimised and increasingly well controlled future? </p><p>5. Welcome to Planet Platform</p><p>One of the interesting things about the socialist calculation debate was the degree to which the two sides agreed. They shared the desideratum of machine-like efficiency; they differed about how to get it. It is harder to see the common ground between outrages such as the suppression of Xinjiang and busy people surrendering data and decisions to Alexa and Siri. But the desire for control and predictability in your own life shares some characteristics with the notion of controlling others. Thoughtlessly pursued it may open up similar possibilities. And thoughtlessness is the whole point of automation. </p><p>If you care about values, though, you can design systems with room for thoughtfulness\u2014systems which provide room for discussing the whys and to-what-ends that the how-wells of efficiency tend to silence. Consider again Chile's Project Cybersyn. Yes, its operations room was a place for control. But it was also a place for debate. As Eden Medina of MIT explains in \"Cybernetic Revolutionaries\" (2011) it was designed to bring humans and machines together in a way that promoted the discussion of ends, means and values. It was a platform for economic democracy that its creators wanted to replicate across the country, providing workers, managers and officials with the opportunity to understand their situation and decide what to do. Hence its use of big geometric buttons instead of traditional keyboards: working men with fat fingers would be able to use them as well as managers whose secretaries normally did the typing. </p><p>The concept of providing a platform for choice and for discussion is a crucial one, not least because carving up the world into platforms on the one hand and the things which run on them on the other is a near ubiquitous feature of tech-talk. The platform in question may vary\u2014it may be an operating system, an online marketplace, a social network. But it is always something on which other stuff sits, and which determines what that other stuff can do. </p><p>If planners\u2014or regulators, for that matter\u2014want to intervene in something, it is with the platform that they are best advised to start. It is the place where code becomes law, where the mechanisms by which a market works are specified. The canonical example is the early web. No startup had to ask if it could put up a website. But if it did not follow certain technical standards its offering simply would not work. </p><p>This way of thinking of things allows a new insight into the calculation debate. In treating both the planning system and the market as what might now be called computer programs it made them comparable. Take the next step of seeing the type of program in question as a platform, though, and they become very different. The market is a platform that can run lots of very different processes; the planned approach is much stricter. </p><p>Platforms are already a source of huge and increasing power, commercial and otherwise.  Politics needs to catch up with this, not just in terms of regulating commerce\u2014where the issue is already a hot one\u2014but also by opening up discussion of the values that platforms embody and encourage. In a recent paper entitled \"Digital Socialism?\" Evgeny Morozov, an American writer and researcher, calls on the left to push governments to take back control of the \"feedback infrastructure\" of the platform economy; Trebor Scholz, a researcher at the New School in New York, wants a lot more platforms run by co-operatives. Some will see problems with both approaches. But expecting a market that lacks both foresight and oversight to produce platforms fit for civic purpose on their own would be very optimistic.</p><p>Like most things, the platform world should be pluralistic. Some basic platforms, such as digital identity and digital currency, perhaps, should probably be owned by governments, or at the very least open to policing by them. Other platforms need to allow oversight by their users and civil society to ensure an absence of bias (the besetting sin of AI) and privacy infringements. A further set, such as the internet, Linux, an open-source operating system, and Wikipedia are best looked after by standards bodies or groups of volunteer developers. And many should be allowed essentially to own themselves, perhaps encoding what they are there for and how they are to be used in blockchains like those used by cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Mr Weyl, the economist at Microsoft, thinks a healthy federation of platforms will provide new ways to make decisions. That might allow new ways of planning; but it might do so on platforms that require democratic consent (Mr Weyl has a geeky new voting system he is itching to try out in such a world). </p><p>To see everything in terms of platforms is not a necessarily sunny outlook. An all-encompassing platform which required applications to embody a single set of values would be headed in a decidedly Borgish direction. Mr Weyl's healthy federation of platforms, like the mostly amiable and high minded United Federation of Planets which is responsible for the USS Enterprise, is a hope, not a certainty\u2014one that needs an engaged political process to bring it into being if it is to set off in search of new life, and new civilisation.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-FS895HV</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSJ-YRD1-DY2R-20NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5658\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

The selloff was likely fuelled by concerns that the tech sector's lofty valuations may prove unsustainable triggering a wave of profit-taking, which also left a trail of carnage in the options market.</p><p>From a technical perspective, the drop was necessary and healthy as it brought the Nasdaq's 14-day relative strength index (RSI) away from severely overbought levels. And such a move shouldn't come as a surprise. Since the index began bouncing out of a bear market in March, it has seen a pullback whenever its RSI has hit or crossed above the 70 threshold, which denotes overbought levels.</p><p>This week's drop may have been more violent given that the Nasdaq had been allowed to gather so much froth, as the RSI even breached 80 earlier this week.</p><p>Perhaps market participants are rebalancing or simply profit-taking ahead of the Labour Day weekend. How stock markets perform once trading resumes next week may be more indicative of whether a trend is truly forming.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether the tech titans have had their time in the sun and whether the rotation into the laggard sectors like financials could leave a big dent in Big Tech's near-term performance.</p><p>Even after Thursday's selloff, valuations remain stretched with the Nasdaq Composite Index's P/E ratio still above 60. However, should this pullback extend into a 10% correction that may prove too tempting a buying opportunity for fans of Big Tech, who could then swarm back in and restore bullish momentum to the Nasdaq.</p><p>After all, the fundamental backdrop still includes major elements that are conducive for the tech sector. The Federal Reserve is willing to let the US economy run hot which is supportive overall of equities, while the 'new normal' ensures the world remains reliant on Big Tech even as the pandemic rages on in major economies.</p><p>It's also important to note the looming potential catalysts.</p><p>A US non-farm payrolls report that reads better than the expected 1.35 million print could stop the bears in their tracks on Friday, prompting the resumption of equity gains. Focus will then turn to the next round of US fiscal stimulus, which if approved by the Senate that reconvenes next week could also reignite tailwinds in benchmark US indices.</p><p>For information, disclaimer and risk warning note visit: FXTM</p><p>FXTM Brand: ForexTime Limited is regulated by CySEC and licensed by the SA FSCA.

The placard reads: \"Copyright Pirates can't hide, not even on the internet\". Axel Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images Instead of breaking news, op-eds, and sports results, Europeans visiting the website of the venerable Chicago Tribune are seeing what has become an all-too-familiar notification: 'Unfortunately, our website is currently available in most European countries ' At last count[1], over 1,000 U.S. newspapers have voluntarily blocked access from Europe since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\u2014the law intended to protect the privacy and data of individuals within the European Union\u2014came into force[2] in 2018. These U.S. publishers have simply deemed compliance too cumbersome and costly, opting instead to abandon their European readership and forgo online revenues from the EU market altogether. GDPR is not the only online legal initiative taken by the European commissioners. This April, the EU approved a new directive on copyright. Article 13 of that directive makes operators like Facebook and YouTube legally liable for any content uploaded to their platforms that is in breach of copyright. </p><p>Article 11 (dubbed the 'Link Tax' by critics) allows publishers to charge platforms like Apple News and Google for displaying even snippets of their content. These measures have sent shockwaves throughout the online ecosystem and placed the EU at the forefront of internet regulation. Yet for all the disruption and discord, these initiatives represent the boldest and potentially most consequential attempt to shape the future of the internet in two decades. EU commissioners are officially overwriting the law of the jungle that has determined how data is used and how content is shared online. If all goes according to Brussels's plan, the biggest beneficiaries stand to be publishers, media outlets, and European consumers. *** That message hasn't reached much of the European public yet. GDPR is broadly popular, but the adoption of Article 13 is an altogether different story. While copyright is largely an arcane legal matter, the adoption of Article 13 was controversial enough to drive an estimated 200,000 protesters in dozens of German cities to the streets. More than 5 million people have signed an online petition in protest against it. Prominent critics such as the German politician Julia Reda argue that the strict enforcement of copyright online will have a chilling effect on speech, discouraging[3] certain kinds of content creation such as remixes, mashups, and memes\u2014although the directive does protect parodies. Meanwhile, the tech community and platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, and Twitter are bracing for the wave of claims that will no doubt be brought by artists, publishers, and music producers seeking payment under Article 13 when it becomes law in two years' time. To appreciate the significance of the EU's regulatory agenda, it is necessary to understand how the current online ecosystem evolved. In fact, European protesters are defending a legal framework that emerged from the United States and, inadvertently, became the global norm for the consumer internet. The two landmarks of critical legislation are the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. These acts of Congress came into law at a time of widespread libertarian enthusiasm for a free internet driven by private investment, unhampered by government interference, and governed\u2014if at all\u2014by its own users. The Telecommunications Act was the first piece of federal legislation to reference the internet and the first overhaul of U.S. telecoms law since 1934. It intended[4] to provide 'a pro-competitive, de-regulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced telecommunications and information technologies.' It also sought to safeguard the primacy of free speech. In what one commentator called[5] the 26 words that created the internet, Title V of the act states that 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.' This distinction between platform and publisher\u2014the former merely a conduit for content that is posted by others and therefore not liable for that content\u2014became the bedrock on which the business model of Facebook and Google (the so-called Digital Duopoly) would be built. Two years later, in 1998, the DMCA took the freewheeling spirit of the Telecommunications Act further still, explicitly creating a safe harbor for online service providers and shifting the burden of policing copyright infringement squarely onto the copyright holders themselves. Under the DMCA, it became incumbent on copyright holders to notify platforms of infringement and to substantiate their claim; only then would the platform be required to remove the offending content. The DMCA's light-touch guidance for platforms was embraced by the EU a year later in its own Electronic Commerce Directive of 2000, which likewise adopted the liability exemption for online service providers. The framework created by these laws has been unequivocally successful in fostering investment in broadband internet and the proliferation of digital services. It gave rise to a virtuous circle of technology development and value creation. But it did so at the literal expense of copyright holders and their content. DMCA advocates and critics alike acknowledge that the resulting regime has been a gift to tech platforms. The Telecommunications Act and the DMCA discarded the business model that had previously dominated the media world, which was founded on the requirement that exhibitors of copyrighted content first secure permission from its owners: No broadcaster or print publisher would air a TV program or republish a short story without first licensing the rights from the copyright holder. By exempting online platforms from that requirement, these laws served to turn copyright holders' revenue streams of 'analog dollars' into 'digital pennies'\u2014to use one media executive's famous formulation[6]. The recorded music industry, for example, saw its revenues shrink[7] from $25.2 billion to $16.9 billion in the decade following the DMCA. At the same time, platforms were able to fund their businesses by selling ads around content they neither owned nor paid for. The fundamental business model of the Facebook and Google duopoly is built on two products: content and audiences. The platforms use content created by others to aggregate an audience; they then track that audience's behavior online, segment the audience demographically by parsing the data, and sell those neatly targeted audience subsets to advertisers. The only guardrails guiding the use of this information are whatever protections are set forth in the private contract between the platform and its users\u2014i.e., the terms of use\u2014written unilaterally by each platform. Notably, the United States has never developed a single federal data protection law, relying instead on an ad hoc patchwork of private sector self-regulation and state laws to govern information privacy, many of them predating the internet. The safe harbor provision of the DMCA provided the platforms with free content to build their audience, and the lack of oversight on consumers' data has granted them an almost unfettered ability to monetize it through targeted advertising. The platforms have done this through their own use of that data and, often, by providing it to third parties through various commercial arrangements. The regulators' hands-off approach to technology, combined with the network effects inherent to the internet, created a near laboratory-perfect[8] setting for abuse\u2014and for the rapid growth of and business dominance by the leading online platforms. *** So far, the visible impact of EU regulation for consumers has been slight. Online users in the EU have certainly seen more popups displaying privacy policies and requesting consent to gather data\u2014or blocking them entirely from U.S.-based sites that have not yet found a way to comply. At the industry level, however, GDPR has been a game-changer. In the first four months after GDPR went into effect alone, the European Data Protection Board reported[9] that more than 42,000 data complaints were filed across Europe. The stakes in these cases are high. Violations can draw fines of up to 20 million euros (about $22 million) or 4 percent of a company's global turnover, whichever is higher. For Apple, that could represent more than 8 billion euros, for Amazon more than 6 billion euros, for YouTube nearly 4 billion euros. The economic risk has challenged online businesses to rethink how they engage with consumers across all customer touch points: websites, email, mobile apps, customer portals, and voice assistants. These challenges have laid bare how fundamentally unstable many of the business models and practices underpinning the consumer internet actually are, revealing the extent to which they rely on the absence of consumer protection laws to make money. Take the business of digital marketing. In a ruling[10] in Poland, one company was obliged to pay a 220,000 fine, about $250,000, and contact nearly 6 million people to alert them that the company had gathered\u2014or 'scraped'\u2014their data from online public sources without their knowledge. The company estimated it would cost nearly $9 million in postage alone to comply. If, subsequently, that company were to share or sell the data, it would have to contact those individuals once again. GDPR puts the underlying business model of this sort of digital intelligence-gathering in jeopardy. The bad news for marketers is that they will have smaller data sets to work with in the future. The good news for consumers is that there will be less spam and privacy abuse. Recall that Cambridge Analytica gathered the data it used in its 2016 Brexit and U.S. electoral social media campaigns by scraping Facebook. Nearly every online business is profoundly and fundamentally affected by GDPR. Certain online video games, for example, rely on concealing how much players spend in-game. They also sell that data to other companies that are seeking big online spenders. One gamer issued a GDPR request to Electronic Arts, the makers of FIFA Ultimate Team, for a record of his spending history on 'loot boxes'\u2014virtual stashes containing randomized content purchased in the game with real money. Loot boxes represent a monetization opportunity for game designers. But since their contents are hidden from the purchaser, their mechanics verge on gambling. Further, some games provide a more favorable outcome to players who purchase loot boxes, introducing a pay-to-win element in what is supposed to be a game of skill. Upon receiving his data from FIFA Ultimate Team, the gamer was shocked[11] to learn that he had spent over $10,000 on loot boxes over a two-year period. He then sought to peel back further layers of data to better understand how items he had received in loot boxes were assigned to him. Were they randomized, or had the game developer strategically withheld the most valuable items to encourage further purchases? Peel back too many layers and the business models that guide life online, whether in sharing pictures or playing games, can start to look distinctly nefarious. As online privacy takes center stage, other jurisdictions are modeling their own consumer data protection measures on GDPR. California's Consumer Privacy Act, passed into law in 2018, goes into effect in 2020. With Apple, Facebook, and Google now advocating legislation at a federal level, it seems inevitable that the United States will follow the EU's lead in safeguarding data privacy and harmonizing laws across state lines. And thus GDPR is setting a new global standard for consumer data protection: In the face of inevitable regulation, online service providers recognize the efficiency of ensuring a one-size-fits-all regime. If a company is going to make the requisite investment to comply with EU law, why not make GDPR's simple, if stringent, guidance the baseline for consumer data protection around the world? Likewise, the provisions of Articles 11 and 13 set a much higher bar for the practice of sharing or displaying copyrighted content online. No matter where they are domiciled, online service providers that wish to operate in the EU will be compelled to abide by these provisions once the new copyright directive goes into effect. As with data privacy, it is likely the platforms will ultimately advocate for a single unified solution for treating copyrighted content across all the markets in which they are present. This could end up giving global content creators and copyright holders the same protection as their EU counterparts. Critics of the EU copyright directive argue that Articles 11 and 13 will result in a distribution patchwork where only licensed content will be available online, further balkanizing an internet that's already fragmenting under pressure from the walled garden internet models of China and Russia. They contend that platforms will respond by creating automated tools to scan uploaded content for copyrighted material and preemptively remove it (the hypothetical 'upload filter'). Although copyright holders will be entitled to compensation for links to their work under the so-called Link Tax, these critics assert that copyrighted content will simply be filtered out[12], pointing to what happened previously with similar initiatives in Germany and Spain. EU regulators have sought to be responsive to these critics by creating a more flexible framework. To ensure that individual content creators' voices won't be stifled, the final text of Article 11 exempts 'private or non-commercial uses of press publications by individual users.' Rather than setting a draconian standard for implementation, the enforcement of Article 13 depends upon platforms' 'best efforts' to police copyright infringement. Most importantly, this time around, public opinion no longer favors Big Tech. Online businesses are now seen to have enjoyed a free ride by monetizing consumer attention and data through targeted advertising: Facebook and Google have effectively been running a restaurant without paying for the food. As the platforms' dominance has grown, the reading public and TV audiences have watched local news coverage and print publications shrink. The public has begun to understand that publishers and broadcasters must get a bigger piece of the online pie in order to survive. Recent headlines and congressional hearings about high-profile data abuse by technology companies merely put a match to the powder keg. The current backlash is a reaction against two decades of dubious business practices. Last week it was revealed that Facebook expects to pay a fine[13] of between $3 billion and 5 billion to the Federal Trade Commission for violating terms of a 2011 agreement with the agency to protect users' privacy. That may be relatively small for the company\u2014but much more could be coming down the pipeline. A regulatory revolution is now shaking the online world to its core, forcing all stakeholders to rethink their conduct, their businesses, and, in the case of consumers, their rights. Though unlikely revolutionaries, the EU commissioners understood that the time was right to rise in rebellion against our tech overlords. After all, the internet has always favored disruptors.

The ramifications will not be felt immediately, but eventually will be significant. One interesting issue is the impact on equipment that is used to monitor and control networks, because changes in the laws could lead to changes in how data flows and, subsequently, what the gear is called upon to do.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That\u2019s an interesting story for the future. In the here and now, good news and commentary were plentiful this week. Here are some of the highlights:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fragmentation Issue Lingers for Android</emphasis></p><p>NewsFactor offers a fresh look <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">at the very serious issue of Android fragmentation</emphasis>. The problem is that so many different versions of the operating system (OS) are available, each with somewhat unique capabilities, that confusion and in many cases user dissatisfaction results.</p><p>The story says that fragmentation is a \u201cmajor issue for developers\u201d who must satisfy multiple versions of Android. The numbers can seem extreme:</p><p>The best way to describe Android OS upgrade adoption is slow, as it has taken months for new versions to finally attain a small fraction of the overall market. Android 4.4 (KitKat) was released on October 31, 2013 and although it is just now rolling out to popular devices like the Galaxy Note 3, it has only been able to build a 1.4 percent market share over the past two months.</p><p>The story offers other similar numbers and says that the problem is worse in foreign markets than in the U.S.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cellular Companies: No Clear Number One</emphasis></p><p>CNET\u2019s Roger Cheng takes a look at the latest results from RootMetrics, which <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">periodically assesses the performance of wireless networks</emphasis>. As often is the case, the study, which tested in the second half last year in 125 markets, offers a split decision.</p><p>RootMetrics found that in 90 markets, AT&amp;T had the best overall performance, which takes into account a variety of metrics, such as speed and reliability for calls, data and texts. Verizon won or tied a new measure, the reliability index, in 102 markets. T-Mobile won the speed category in 16 markets, according to the story.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Another View on Net Neutrality</emphasis></p><p>Most of the communications media, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">including IT Business Edge</emphasis>, paid a lot of attention this week to the federal court ruling that eviscerated the net neutrality rules. Most of the coverage came from people who favored what the rules attempt to do and most suggested that powerful players would be empowered at the expense of the entrepreneurial class that has given the Internet some of its greatest technologies and services.</p><p>It\u2019s worth taking note that the gloom and doom was not universal. At <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">InformationWeek, Jonathan Feldman suggests</emphasis> that the market can compensate for the regulations:</p><p>Yet, I fundamentally disagree that Net neutrality is the right thing for the FCC or others to focus on. The right thing to focus on is encouraging a broadband free market. A true free market allows consumers to switch when they're not getting what they paid for. Even in today's market, where there are only two or three choices, if a large company's IP voice traffic starts getting messed with by AT&amp;T, let me assure you that AT&amp;T will be minus one customer.</p><p>One of the paths forward that net neutrality proponents are discussing is reclassifying broadband as a common carrier. Feldman suggests that the resulting higher scrutiny this approach would lead to could end up slowing innovation, which is precisely what net neutrality proponents fear will result from yesterday\u2019s ruling.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Intel Looks to Wearables, Mobile</emphasis></p><p>PC numbers have been dropping for a few years and Intel has been paying a price. Venture Beat reports that Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told analysts during an analysts\u2019 call that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">mobile and wearables will make up the difference</emphasis>. He told the analysts that the company\u2019s chips were part of about 10 million tablets that shipped last year. Microsoft Surface was the main customer.</p><p>The story says that in the year ahead, according to Krzanich\u2019s comments to the analysts and at CES, Intel will have flat revenues and that it will tweak the product mix. He mentioned Edison, a small chip aimed at wearables that is based on the Quark architecture, as an example of an innovation Intel will offer. The company is targeting hybrids, devices with tablet and laptop capabilities, and will bring products to market more quickly, the story said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Communication Breakdown</emphasis></p><p>And, finally, a story about <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">taking steps to maintain communications during crises</emphasis>. One sad reality is that these things happen on a regular basis. Another is that when such events occur, telecommunications systems and networks tend to break down.</p><p>An important step to enabling better communication is to understand calling and texting patterns during these hectic moments. Liang Gao at Jiaotong University in China did this, according to the MIT Technology Review.</p><p>Gao and his group studied people directly impacted by emergencies and the people they initially called, who presumably are friends and relatives. The first surprise is that no discernable time lapse occurs in the spikes of telecommunications activities between the first and second group. The other surprising finding was that the second thing done by the outside group wasn\u2019t to call others, but to call back the people nearer to the incident.</p><p>This kind of data can be used to model systems that are more resilient and responsive for both civilians and first responders when these unfortunate events occur.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITBCOM-168123010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITBCOM2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KJ9-0W31-JC90-T3P8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433695</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"912\"/><timeReceived>08:57 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Quinstreet, Inc.

Be it co-inventor of the Facebook \"Like\" button, Justin Rosenstein, or former Director of Monetization at Facebook, Tim Kendall, or other great minds of Silicon Valley.</p><p>So, with user's attention being a product that technology companies sell to advertisers, social media platform have continued knitting a fib to capture the audience with addictive elements and deep personalization technologies. Similar to a mirage, it is presented to users what they want to see, deploy more and more time there and then acknowledge advertisers.</p><p>WHY YOUR ORGANIC DIGITAL MARKETING ISN'T AS EFFECTIVE AS PAID ONE?</p><p>If you didn't know what happened behind the scenes and exactly how the social media brands like Facebook which is free for everyone, sells advertising to companies, then this may explain exactly why your organic ads aren't reaching many people. In the age of sponsored ads glorifying advertisements, Facebook has designed a structure to entice companies especially start-ups desperate for work to spend on promotions.</p><p>This explains essentially why more and more brands in their social media strategy are including a set budget for paid promotions along with hashtags and content.</p><p>THE POWER IMBALANCE</p><p>With billions of people and their data, big tech companies have too much market power to an extent where they can influence our personal and political environments. So, someone in charge of single-handedly determining how the internet will look like and innovation will offer in terms of news, visual media, cloud storage, communication like calls and messaging, and more, can be pretty terrifying.</p><p>The solution, regulations, with proper regulation of this diverse and unleashed wild demon, internet, can start-ups grow without fearing an imbalance power.</p><p>THE SOCIAL MEDIA ADDICTION AND ITS INFLUENCEON WORK</p><p>The documentary explains how social media creates a dilemma as it turns your \"psychology against you\" so that you stay stuck to the screen and that is why it has become an addictive activity with negative consequences. A start-up especially in it initial stages is defined by the leader's actions and undivided attention to work and to be that, you cannot choose to fight with another battle that can prove to be less productive.</p><p>As a start-up owner, your core values of productivity and useful tips like turning off desktop notifications, not downloading applications that restrict your daily use, etc, as a part of a non-judgemental open dialogue can be guiding light. The aim here to ensure a healthy mental state fo mind at work by all professionals.</p><p>FAKE NEWS AND START-UP OPPORTUNITY</p><p>While the documentary highlighted how fake news spreads 6 times faster than true news, making this the 'king' of online content and big tech companies like Facebook are unable to curb with the issue.</p><p>Facebook has found that they can affect real-world behaviours and emotions, without users even being aware of it, this all results in real-life (offline) effects such as governments and other organisations weaponising social media to incite political polarisation, conflicts, riots, and even violence.</p><p>The Social Dilemma offers a potential business idea for start-ups. Yes, one can use this market opportunity to start a brand that can help regulate fake news and misinformation.</p><p>You can help brands and their websites leveraging technologies like AI to mitigate the risks of misinformation spread in multiple languages, text-photos, and other forms.</p><p>ACT APPROPRIATELY</p><p>While the recent entry in Netflix's Top 10 list of most popular movies since its September 9 is creating a lot of buzzes and it offers the solution of abandoning social media altogether for which critics are calling out the show 'for slamming social media'.</p><p>It is indeed essential to understand if your business needs social media, for example at B2C brand may require it to connect to potential clients, but B2B brand won't. Now, essentially as an entrepreneur is how these problems can dismay your start-up and while one cannot ensure that this documentary affects these companies at the bottom line, but it can steer somethings for start-ups.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CEOMAG-0054620919</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CEOMAG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6104-TWV1-DXMP-K1YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">469003</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"869\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Indiamanthan Publications &amp; Media Pvt.

The czars of Big Tech it seems have answers to the world's problems, thanks to their wealth. Billionaires are flaunting their money for charitable and green causes, but that's okay, because politicians have corrupted governance, and plundered the earth's resources. The rich are being wooed to help turn the tide, literally. Shelling out large sums for the earth may have little impact on their revenues and profits. Corporate social responsibility is serious business with a whole industry built around it. People and governments often tend to make some subtle demands on these High Net Worth Individuals. Heads turn when they write out fat cheques for the planet, and for the meek and weak who walk the earth. Their wealth grabs more attention when the cause is greater, when the scale is grander - like climate change.</p><p><br/><br/>How did we get here? The planet is in crisis because we are burning fuel and making it warm. This is causing floods, heat waves and extreme cold weather conditions. Livelihoods are under threat, food becomes scarce and people, the poor in particular, are being forced out of their homes. Governments didn't see it coming, and when they did, they find themselves short of funds, the will and resources to stem the tide. Hence they are happy outsourcing environment protection efforts to the superrich who drill it into us that climate change is indeed real, hoping that poor folks will listen. When the political class fails, bring in the technocrats, the rich and famous who believe they know a thing or two about how to get things back on track. That's the general idea. They want people to know they are doing something about it, like setting aside sums from their vast fortunes to prevent a climate catastrophe. The world's richest man has thrown himself into the climate movement with a $10 billion fund. Amazon chief Jeff Bezos's cash is no small change in the race to save the planet. In fact, it's the biggest donation by any individual billionaire. Last year, Michael Bloomberg shelled out $500 million, a pittance when compared with what Bezos has pledged. The Amazon chief has timed it well after the bad publicity he received following his divorce and his flop Indian visit. Amazon is also facing the heat for allegedly crushing rivals as it expands aggressively. Regulators in the US and Europe are keeping a close watch on its rapid growth trajectory. The $10 billion could be a diversion, yet is welcome for the earth. There are complaints that global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few. Now the superrich are in charge of charity too. They are the gifts that keep on giving.</p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHATIM-167619233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHATIM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7K-8951-JDJN-609W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338756</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"465\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Khaleej Times - Galadari Printing and Publishing Co.

It is happy hour and the cosmopolitans are half price. Like most young Chinese, the two twentysomethings' conversation is punctuated by frantic bursts of tapping on their mobile phones. It's a scene repeated the world over - with one difference. Few of us would recognise a single thing on their touchscreens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The blinking apps they are checking have unfamiliar names and logos. Toutiao or Douyin, anyone? There are none of the symbols we are used to here: no Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google. Nor Snapchat, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube, Skype or Uber.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is a simple explanation, of course. \"Most are banned,\" Shi said, forcing an embarrassed smile. Most western firms are still unable to breach the great firewall of China, Beijing's strict censorship barrier.</p><p>That is no problem, however. Indeed, many Chinese think it a blessing because it has forced local firms to stop copying western rivals and innovate. As a result, many Chinese apps and services are now better than their foreign counterparts. Huawei handsets outperform Apple's and China is ahead on 5G, mobile money and artificial intelligence (AI), prompting US tech bible Wired to run a cover story headlined: \"It's time to copy China.\"</p><p>Amid all the whizziness, there is a dark side. You see it the moment you check into your hotel. Notices list some of the websites you \"might have difficulty accessing due to Chinese internet regulations\". They include the BBC, Wikipedia and Bloomberg.</p><p>And you don't have to be paranoid to wonder whether it is a great idea for the multipurpose WeChat app that almost everyone in China uses to have a record of pretty much everything they do.</p><p>Beijing confirmed last week it plans to use citizens' digital footprints to create \"social credit\" ratings. Those with high scores - earned by, say, paying bills on time and avoiding parking fines - will be given speedier access to state services. It has been condemnded as Big Brother made real.</p><p>What exercises investors, however, is whether the Chinese firms will be able to vault the great firewall and expand across the world - or whether Silicon Valley can succeed in China. The prize - global tech domination - could scarcely be greater.</p><p>Chinese tech is fizzing. Mobile phone and telecoms giant Huawei - second only to Samsung in global handset sales - is setting new standards with the best triple-lens Leica camera and battery charging technology. It will launch the first mobile phone with a folding screen next year, and is leading the race to develop 5G, the next-generation mobile standard offering download speed 100 times faster than 4G - a leap forward essential to the development of \"the internet of things\".</p><p>The apps on Ju's handset are worthy of the epithet \"killer\". WeChat blends voice calls, email, ecommerce, social media, banking, insurance, text messaging, video conferencing, gaming, music, news and weather, smart city services, dating, doctor and hospital appointments, transport, government and local authority services and restaurant booking. She can do or find pretty much anything in seconds. \"It keeps my life easy and fast,\" she said.</p><p>Chinese consumers spend an average of three hours a day on WeChat's \"magic button\", which earlier this year helped to catapult its creator, Tencent - run by Ma Huateng, known as Pony Ma - to fifth spot in the list of the world's largest tech companies by market capitalisation, overtaking Facebook and behind only Apple, Google's parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon. It has since fallen back. Electronic payment systems - notably Alipay, a spinoff from Alibaba, China's Amazon, which Shi uses to buy the cocktails - are streets ahead of anything in Europe or America. Mobile phone payments are now so popular (they reached $12.7 trillion, or \u00a39.9 trillion, in China last year) that cash is a rare sight on the streets of many large cities.</p><p>Add in drones, robotics and self-driving car technology - sectors in which Chinese firms are bounding ahead - and it is easy to see why Alpha Xu, 33, who runs a global internet marketing firm, ASAP+, rates Chinese tech as \"9 out of 10 while the US is 6-7\". Why such a low score for the US? \"Lots of people in America are not very digital. They still use cheques,\" he replied, laughing. When did he last write a cheque? \"More than 10 years ago.\"</p><p>How have China's \"Bats\" - Baidu, the dominant search engine, Alibaba and Tencent - expanded so far, so fast? China offers structural advantages. Its vast population - it has 800m internet users - encourages entrepreneurs to think big.</p><p>Take Wanxiang, a huge car-parts manufacturer. To help develop autonomous cars, it is building a \u00a323bn \"smart city\" in Hangzhou. Try doing that in Coventry.</p><p>Beijing is four-square behind big tech.</p><p>President Xi Jinping has made AI one of the central pillars of the Communist Party's \"Made in China 2025\" plan to transform the economy.</p><p>Chinese attitudes to data privacy are very different from those in Europe or America. \"The government can see everything, but we think it is not to monitor us, but to protect us,\" said Xu. This gives innovators a free hand to develop whatever products they want, safe in the knowledge that, if consumers like them, they will not hesitate to snap them up.</p><p>Entrepreneurs and staff work punishing hours. Chinese start-ups have adopted a schedule called 996 - 9am to 9pm, six days a <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.week.No\">www.week.No</url> one walks out in protest against workplace injustice, as Google staff worldwide did recently.</p><p>If Chinese firms are to expand globally, they will have to convince western governments and consumers that their kit and apps are not a back door for Beijing's spies. Chinese firms have a bad record when it comes to techno-snooping.</p><p>Huawei and telecoms equipment firm ZTE are trying to break into the 5G market in Europe and the US, with some success. In Britain, Huawei is trialling 5G with mobile provider Three.</p><p>Alipay has signed a deal with US payment infrastructure company First Data to install Alipay devices in the stores of some US retailers. Its rival, WeChat Pay, is expanding partnerships with shopping malls in Paris and in Hokkaido, Japan.</p><p>But Washington, irked by what it sees as intellectual property theft as much as fear of espionage, is using tech as a key weapon in its broader trade war with Beijing. US telecoms networks have been banned from buying Huawei equipment, and mobile companies ordered not to sell Huawei handsets with data contracts.</p><p>Earlier this year, President Donald Trump torpedoed a $1.2bn bid by Ant Financial, the payments arm of Alibaba, to buy Dallas-based MoneyGram. He also blocked a $142bn hostile bid for US chipmaker Qualcomm by Singapore-based Broadcom after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States warned that the deal could end up giving Chinese firms an advantage in 5G technology.</p><p>If western firms are to make it in the world's biggest, fastest-growing consumer tech market, they are going to have to compromise with Beijing's censors, which many of their staff and shareholders bitterly oppose.</p><p>Apple has opened stores all over China but has been criticised for agreeing to stop selling VPN software, which enables users to access banned websites, on its Chinese app store.</p><p>The Cupertino-based giant has also agreed to comply with a new local law and hand over the management of customers' data on iCloud in China to a state company. Tim Cook, Apple's boss, insists that \"no back doors will be created into any of our systems\" and it will ensure \"strong data privacy\".</p><p>Waymo, the autonomous driving unit of Alphabet, recently won approval to operate self-driving cars in Shanghai. Google is considering following that success by launching a partially censored version of its search engine, reversing its decision in 2010 to pull out in protest at Beijing's censorship and attempts to hack into the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. The move has prompted staff protests and resignations.</p><p>Both China's Greater Bay Area - a network of southern tech hubs - and America's San Francisco Bay Area are ready for the future. The question is: whose?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ma Huateng, head of Tencent, and Apple chief executive Tim CookILLUSTRATION: JAMES COWEN</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-143952294</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSG-W371-DYTY-C2R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1361\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 25, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;
