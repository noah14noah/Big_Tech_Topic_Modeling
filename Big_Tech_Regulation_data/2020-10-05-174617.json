The FCC regulates broadcast stations in the public interest, and these networks have certain provisions against issuing false information. Facebook is under no such regulations, and it is not liable for posted content, as protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. However, experts say Facebook could one day face a similar set of rules as broadcast stations, as FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and bipartisan leaders have expressed a strong desire to introduce regulation. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] What is Facebook? Depending on where and when it's asked, sometimes it's a publisher[4], and sometimes it's a platform. But in its latest controversy \u2014 the decision to not fact-check ads[5] from politicians \u2014 Facebook is positioning itself as most like a broadcast station.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1183162508846215168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw @ewarren[6] looks like broadcast stations across the country have aired this ad nearly 1,000 times, as required by law. FCC doesn't want broadcast companies censoring candidates' speech. We agree it's better to let voters\u2014not companies\u2014decide. #FCC[7] #candidateuse[8] <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/WlWePjh1vZ\">https://t.co/WlWePjh1vZ</url>[9] Federal Communication Commission regulations state that[10] broadcast stations \u2014 the local TV or radio stations that are often network affiliates \u2014 have to accept ads from political candidates, regardless if they are true or false. Broadcast stations are classified separately from cable networks, who have discretion; CNN chose not to run the Trump ad in question because it had been proven false. According to Philip Napoli, the author of \"Social Media and Public Interest: Media Regulation in the Disinformation Age,\" courts have historically ruled in favor of counterspeech when it comes to ads from politicians. Instead of taking down false ads, which has been viewed as censorship, the government generally lets politicians issue all ads, believing that the public will make a reasonable decision on who to vote for. Similarly, Facebook has said it doesn't believe[11] it should \"prevent a politcian's speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny.\" For both the FCC and Facebook, the solution to false speech is usually considered to be more speech, it seems. \"Facebook is acting like a broadcast station in this case,\" Napoli told Business Insider. \"The irony, of course, is that there is no existing regulation that applies to them.\"What if the FCC regulated Facebook?The FCC regulates broadcast stations in the public interest. Those regulations have certain provisions[12] against issuing false information, among other lengthy rules and guidelines[13].       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/public-and-broadcastingBut\">https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/public-and-broadcastingBut</url>Facebook is subject to no such regulation \u2014 it generally follows whatever rules it wants to \u2014 and it is not liable for any content posted via the service, as protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. If Facebook were actually a broadcast station, it would be subject to FCC regulation.;Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1183366817831641088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Wow, @fbnewsroom[14] is comparing Facebook to federally regulated networks. If they want to go that route, they'll want to be reminded broadcasters are also liable for the content that appears on their networks.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/rTTLtXKiBa\">https://t.co/rTTLtXKiBa</url>[15]; Still, the FCC is quite limited in media regulation, as it cannot generally infringe on the free press rights guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. But there are exceptions. According to Napoli, the most common exception made is when there are implications for the public interest. For example, the FCC can regulate broadcast stations because they utlilize the broadcast spectrum, which is considered a public resource that is \"owned by the people.\" Currently, this public interest framework isn't applied to social media. But Napoli argues[16] that Facebook is also built on a public resource \u2014 our user data \u2014 and it's the only reason Facebook has been able to gain so much influence in the first place. If Facebook is powered by this public resource, shouldn't it be regulated in the public interest? This is how the FCC regulates broadcast stations, and Facebook is clearly acting like one in this case. Of course, it would take a lot to enforce these regulations. The US currently lacks any guarantee of individual rights to their user data, and it seems like an even further jump to recognize aggregated user data as a public resource. But it's a sensible argument, and FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has also suggested[17] regulation, calling out companies like Facebook at a hearing in June[18]. \"The greatest threat to a free and open internet has been the unregulated Silicon Valley tech giants that do, in fact, today decide what you see and what you don't. There's no transparency. There's no consumer protections and I think bipartisan members of both congressional chambers have now come to that realization.\" The FCC and Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Most of the calls for regulating Facebook, including Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's, are from an antitrust perspective \u2014 Facebook should be broken up[19] because it is too big and harms competition, she argues. While this regulation may also be necessary, Napoli points out another problem entirely. The FCC's current regulations are entirely insufficient for social media, and our society is in dire need of an update, he says. \"We've just never had communications platforms operating on this scale, by a long shot,\" Napoli said. \"And we have this weird patchwork of regulations that becomes more fragmented every time a new technology becomes more important.\"NOW WATCH: Here's why phone

Facebook, Google, and Amazon[21]Facebook made the unusual decision to push back directly on Elizabeth Warren and her criticism of the company, but its attempt to defend itself backfired spectacularly[22]A Chinese engineer says he was fired from Facebook after discussing a colleague's death, and it's caused outrage in China[23] [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url

Regulators have opened investigations into Facebook's power in social networking. Even one of Facebook's own founders has laid out a case for why the company needs to be split up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the world's biggest social network has started to modify its behavior -- in both pre-emptive and defensive ways -- to deal with those threats. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Late last year, Facebook halted acquisition talks with Houseparty, a video-focused social network in Silicon Valley, for fear of inciting antitrust concerns, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Acquiring another social network after Facebook was already such a dominant player in that market was too risky, said the people, who spoke on the condition they not be identified because the discussions were confidential.</p><p>Facebook has also begun internal changes that make itself harder to break up. The company has been knitting together the messaging systems of Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp and has reorganized the departments so that Facebook is more clearly in charge, said two people briefed on the matter. Executives have also worked on rebranding Instagram and WhatsApp to more prominently associate them with Facebook.</p><p>  The social network's changes are now prompting a debate about whether a more knitted-together Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram is just smart business or helps strengthen potential anticompetitive practices. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive, has repeatedly said his company faces competition on all sides and is loath to accept a fragmented version of the social giant. He does not want to lose Instagram and WhatsApp, which are enormous and have the ability to continue fueling Facebook's $56 billion business.</p><p>  ''The big question is, is this a logical business plan?'' said Gene Kimmelman, a former antitrust official in the Obama administration and senior adviser to Public Knowledge, a nonprofit think tank in Washington. ''For a social network with enormous growth in photos and messaging, there's probably significant business justification for combining the units.''</p><p>  But Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and the chairman of the House antitrust subcommittee, said Facebook's moves needed to be scrutinized.</p><p>  ''The combination of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp into the single largest communications platform in history is a clear attempt to evade effective antitrust enforcement by making it harder for the company to be broken up,'' he said. ''We need to hit the pause button.''</p><p>Facebook has pushed back on the idea that the company's moves -- particularly in private messaging -- are in anticipation of a potential breakup.</p><p>  ''Building more ways for people to communicate through our messaging apps has always been about creating benefits for people -- plain and simple,'' said Stan Chudnovsky, a vice president at Facebook overseeing messaging. ''People want to be able to reach as many people as they can with the messaging app they choose.''</p><p>  In Washington, Facebook has its eye particularly on the Federal Trade Commission, the agency that is now investigating it for anticompetitive practices, said two of the people with knowledge of the social network.</p><p>  The F.T.C. became interested in looking at Facebook and its power last year when the agency's investigators were separately examining the company for privacy violations, said two people close to the process. At the time, the F.T.C.'s investigators uncovered internal Facebook documents that prompted concerns around how the company was acquiring rivals, they said.</p><p>Facebook's long string of acquisitions -- it bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, among many others -- have been targeted by academics and policymakers for reducing competition. They have argued that the company engaged in ''serial defensive acquisitions'' to protect its dominant position in social networking.</p><p>  This year, the F.T.C. sought clearance from the Justice Department to open an antitrust investigation into potentially anticompetitive behavior at Facebook, the people close to the process said. The F.T.C. was cleared to do so, and notified Facebook in June. By late July, the agency had contacted at least a half-dozen founders of companies that Facebook had bought over the past 15 years for information on its acquisition practices, said four people with knowledge of the outreach.</p><p>  Around the time that the F.T.C. activity on Facebook ramped up, the company also stepped back on at least one potential acquisition.</p><p>  Last December, Facebook executives were in advanced discussions to buy Houseparty, a social networking app that lets multiple people video chat on their mobile phones at once, said two people with knowledge of the talks. Houseparty, founded in 2016 by a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, Ben Rubin, was especially popular with audiences under the age of 24. Facebook, whose members are getting older, has coveted younger users.</p><p>  But weeks into the discussions, Facebook's corporate development team killed the talks with Houseparty, the people said. Houseparty's executives were told that a deal would draw unwelcome federal government scrutiny to Facebook, they said. Houseparty was later purchased by Epic Games, the makers of the video game Fortnite.</p><p>Facebook's changes that appear to make a breakup of its apps more difficult began more than a year ago. Mr. Zuckerberg focused on combining the underlying infrastructure of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger. The project, called ''interoperability,'' requires years of deeply technical and difficult engineering work.</p><p>  The aim, in part, was to create less of a hodgepodge of companies and more of a unified network, said people briefed on the strategy. Publicly, Mr. Zuckerberg has said the initiative will help build a more ''private'' version of Facebook so customers can ''communicate across networks easily and securely,'' as users flock to messaging services en masse. People will also get a better and more streamlined user experience, he has said. Mr. Zuckerberg has added that a unified messaging system would better lend itself to moneymaking efforts on WhatsApp, which today brings in little revenue.</p><p>  But the idea of ''interoperability'' was a departure for Facebook. While Facebook and Instagram have long shared much of the same infrastructure, its different messaging products generally operated independently.</p><p>  Though employees at Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are in separate physical buildings, executives have also pushed for them to share more internal resources and have reorganized their reporting lines. In one instance, Facebook executives ordered a change in the messaging teams, two of the people said, requiring the Instagram messenger division to report to the leaders at Facebook's Messenger app. Bloomberg earlier reported on the internal reorganization.</p><p>  Last year, Facebook also began a rebranding project, tapping at least one outside agency for help, said three people familiar with the initiative. The agency, Prophet Brand Strategy, was asked to make Facebook into a ''branded house,'' where Facebook's moniker always preceded the names of WhatsApp and Instagram, they said. The rebranding mandate came from Mr. Zuckerberg and Antonio Lucio, Facebook's chief marketing officer, they said.</p><p>  In March, Jane Manchun Wong, an independent security researcher, spotted the new branding ''Instagram from Facebook'' -- in some unreleased lines of code.</p><p>  Employees at both Instagram and WhatsApp, who have been accustomed to greater autonomy, have chafed at the coming changes, said three people familiar with the divisions.</p><p>  In hindsight, Facebook had quietly signaled that unification was afoot more than a year ago. In June 2018, the company introduced a combined metric that drew attention away from any individual product. It tallied the number of people who used one or more of any of Facebook's services, including WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>  The name of the new metric? Facebook's Family of apps.</p><p>  Interested in All Things Tech? Get the Bits newsletter for the latest from Silicon Valley.

Some lawmakers are downright hostile to the idea that a company that has broken public trust repeatedly, especially in its handling of user data, would venture into high-stakes global finance. NPR's Aarti Shahani reports on today's hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AARTI SHAHANI:                 Facebook has proposed with partners to create digital money, a currency called the Libra. The move requires approval by regulators who are overseen by lawmakers who were on fire at today's hearing and using fire metaphors.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>SHERROD BROWN:                 Facebook is dangerous.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Senator Sherrod Brown, Ohio Democrat...             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>SHERROD BROWN:                 Like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the house over and over and called every arson a learning experience.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Money is a massive experiment in trust. We trust the dollar. We use it and don't burn it because we trust that it's backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Facebook does not have a great track record in trust, as David Marcus, the man at the company who oversees the new currency project, admitted repeatedly as he sat in the hot seat.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DAVID MARCUS:                 Trust is primordial, and we've made mistakes in the past. And we have been working and are continuing to work really hard to get better.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Primordial, meaning from the beginning of time. The endearing origin story of Facebook, the miracle of capitalism - started in a college dorm - was absent. Senators offered an alternative origin story that early on, Facebook killed the local newspapers that keep those with power accountable; that by making hate speech go viral, it helped fuel genocide in the country Myanmar; that Facebook turned a blind eye to Russian interference in the 2016 elections; that the company has lied repeatedly about how it handles users' personal data. Senator Martha McSally, Arizona Republican...             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>MARTHA MCSALLY:                 Mr. Marcus, I don't trust Facebook, and it's because of the repeated violations of your users' privacy, repeated deceit. And I am not alone.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Facebook's Marcus promised that if given permission to mint money, the company would monitor and report money laundering, but Facebook would not exploit users' spending data to target ads though Facebook has said one thing and done another before. The company promised to keep customer data private. Then, charged with lying, it entered a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011. And now caught up again, Facebook faces a $5 billion fine.             </p><p>                Marcus made this case. Digital currency is not a data grab. Rather, it will make Facebook more popular by making it a shopping destination kind of like Amazon. As he tried to explain to Senator McSally, that is a service to an estimated 90 million businesses on Facebook.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DAVID MARCUS:                 If they now have the ability to sell to more constituents across the Facebook platform and more people have access to the services and products of those 90 million businesses, then more commerce will happen on the Facebook platform.             </p><p>MARTHA MCSALLY:                 Oh, that's wonderful public good that you guys are committed to. I know I'm way over time here, and that was extremely sarcastic. Thank you.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Timing matters. The announcement by Facebook that it plans to create its own currency may be too soon after Wall Street's financial crisis or too soon after Facebook's data scandals, which are still ongoing. Though Senator Pat Toomey, Pennsylvania Republican, did offer some encouragement for the tech giant's foray into digital currency.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>PAT TOOMEY:                 To announce in advance that we have to strangle this baby in the crib I think is wildly premature.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Tomorrow Facebook's Marcus appears before the House Financial Services Committee.

Facebook AI chip could help power an intelligent digital assistant.     It could also help in content moderation.<br/>Facebook's AI scientists are working on a new kind of chip which is aimed at powering an Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant-like digital assistant. The AI chip is also being designed to help Facebook's human content moderators sift through and regulate videos and posts on the platform. The disclosure was made by Facebook's Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun, in an interview with Financial Times. LeCun, who is known for his work in machine learning, computer vision and computational neuroscience, told FT that Facebook's AI chip will have enough common sense to be able to talk to any human being and hold a conversation on any subject.</p><p><br/>Facebook has over 7,500 content moderators that review everything being posted on the platform, around the globe. The AI chip being developed by the company aims to assist these moderators and help implement Facebook's specific content policies.<br/> While Facebook is hoping to work with a \"number of chip companies\", including Intel which is already a Facebook partner, the company is also reportedly developing its proprietary ASIC (Application-specific integrated circuit) chips for its AI efforts. ASIC chips are designed to carry out specific tasks and Facebook says that it will not leave any stone unturned when it comes to its ambition of making such chips.<br/> As of now, it seems like Facebook is not planning to compete with the likes of Nvidia to provide enterprise grade chips for data centers. Once developed, the company could open source these chips. As LeCun puts it, \"The objective is to give it away.\"<br/> FT's report also highlights a surge in investment in AI Chip startups across the globe. The likes of Google, Amazon and Apple are also known to be investing in the space heavily as AI becomes the next big tech battle ground.<br/> Beyond chips, Facebook is also working towards creating new designs for neural networks based on recent breakthroughs in image and language recognition.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DGTFTK-n10900936</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DGTFTK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHV-CSG1-JBYT-H0FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410714</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"350\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digit Fast Track</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 20, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001YLV</classCode><className>NVIDIA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

It will now take a Herculean effort to restore public trust in Facebook's commitment to privacy and data protection, they said. Outside observers think regulation has suddenly become more likely, and yet CEO Mark Zuckerberg appears missing in action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scandal also highlights a problem that is built into the company's DNA: Its business is data exploitation. Facebook makes money by, among other things, harvesting your data and selling it to app developers and advertisers. Preventing those buyers from passing that data to third parties with ulterior motives may ultimately be impossible.</p><p>Indeed, the most alarming aspect of Cambridge Analytica's \"breach\" is that it wasn't a breach at all. It happened almost entirely above board and in line with Facebook policy.</p><p>Aleksandr Kogan, a University of Cambridge professor, accessed the data of more than 50 million Facebook users simply by creating a survey filled out by 270,000 people. Facebook provided Kogan with the data of anyone who took the survey, as well as their friends' data. In a statement, Facebook said, \"Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time.\"</p><p>The one rule Kogan violated, according to Facebook, was passing the user data to third parties, including Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm founded by former Trump aide Steve Bannon and conservative donor Robert Mercer.</p><p>But even Facebook sources acknowledged to CNN that it is impossible to completely monitor what developers and advertisers do with the data once it's in their hands. It's like selling cigarettes to someone and telling them not to share the cigarettes with their friends.</p><p>The limits of Facebook's ability to enforce compliance with data usage was highlighted by Facebook's own response to Kogan's violation. Facebook says it learned of Kogan's violation in 2015 and was subsequently assured by all parties that the data had been destroyed. But Facebook also says it learned just days ago that \"not all data was deleted.\"</p><p>In a statement, Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal said \"protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do.\" That may be a hard argument for the public to accept given that Facebook's business is providing people's information to outside parties whose ultimate goals are unknowable.</p><p>Facebook says that starting in 2014 it gave users greater control over what parts of their information are shared with app developers and advertisers. It also says it has enhanced its app review process to require developers \"to justify the data they're looking to collect and how they're going to use it - before they're allowed to even ask people for it.\"</p><p>Still, the sources inside Facebook acknowledge that such measures cannot guarantee that some people won't succeed in mining Facebook data and passing it off to third parties.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, the talk of regulation is growing louder. Lawmakers seeking tighter restrictions on big tech feel even more emboldened than they did in the wake of revelations about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, a source on Capitol Hill told CNN. </p><p>Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar has called on Zuckerberg to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which she serves, to explain \"what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Zuckerberg and the rest of the Facebook leadership seem conspicuously absent. Neither the Facebook CEO nor his top deputy, Sheryl Sandberg, have commented publicly on the matter. They have left that task to Grewal, a lawyer. No one has provided an adequate explanation for why Facebook did not disclose Kogan's violation to the more than 50 million users who were affected when the company first learned about it in 2015.</p><p>\"We are conducting a comprehensive internal and external review and are working to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information,\" Grewal said in a statement Sunday. </p><p>All of this comes as Facebook is already getting questions about the long-term appeal of its platform, at least in the United States. The number of daily active users in the United States - a whopping 184 million - declined for the first time last quarter. Facebook also lost 2.8 million users under the age of 25 last year, and is set to lose another 2 million this year, according to eMarketer. </p><p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal is likely to hasten user disenchantment with the network, sources inside Facebook acknowledged. Facebook is increasingly being seen as a platform vulnerable to manipulation by political groups, foreign governments, or worse. </p><p>Ultimately, however, the real culprit in the eyes of the American public may not be Cambridge Analytica or the Russians, but rather Facebook itself.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

It will now take a Herculean effort to restore public trust in Facebook's commitment to privacy and data protection, they said. Outside observers think regulation has suddenly become more likely, and yet CEO Mark Zuckerberg appears missing in action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Subscribe to PACIFIC</p><p>The scandal also highlights a problem that is built into the company's DNA: Its business is data exploitation. Facebook makes money by, among other things, harvesting your data and selling it to app developers and advertisers. Preventing those buyers from passing that data to third parties with ulterior motives may ultimately be impossible.</p><p>Indeed, the most alarming aspect of Cambridge Analytica's \"breach\" is that it wasn't a breach at all. It happened almost entirely above board and in line with Facebook policy.</p><p>Aleksandr Kogan, a University of Cambridge professor, accessed the data of more than 50 million Facebook users simply by creating a survey filled out by 270,000 people. Facebook provided Kogan with the data of anyone who took the survey, as well as their friends' data. In a statement, Facebook said, \"Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time.\"</p><p/><p>The one rule Kogan violated, according to Facebook, was passing the user data to third parties, including Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm founded by former Trump aide Steve Bannon and conservative donor Robert Mercer.</p><p>But even Facebook sources acknowledged to CNN that it is impossible to completely monitor what developers and advertisers do with the data once it's in their hands. It's like selling cigarettes to someone and telling them not to share the cigarettes with their friends.</p><p>The limits of Facebook's ability to enforce compliance with data usage was highlighted by Facebook's own response to Kogan's violation. Facebook says it learned of Kogan's violation in 2015 and was subsequently assured by all parties that the data had been destroyed. But Facebook also says it learned just days ago that \"not all data was deleted.\"</p><p>In a statement, Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal said \"protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do.\" That may be a hard argument for the public to accept given that Facebook's business is providing people's information to outside parties whose ultimate goals are unknowable.</p><p/><p>Facebook says that starting in 2014 it gave users greater control over what parts of their information are shared with app developers and advertisers. It also says it has enhanced its app review process to require developers \"to justify the data they're looking to collect and how they're going to use it ? before they're allowed to even ask people for it.\"</p><p>Still, the sources inside Facebook acknowledge that such measures cannot guarantee that some people won't succeed in mining Facebook data and passing it off to third parties.</p><p/><p>On Capitol Hill, the talk of regulation is growing louder. Lawmakers seeking tighter restrictions on big tech feel even more emboldened than they did in the wake of revelations about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, a source on Capitol Hill told CNN.</p><p>Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar has called on Zuckerberg to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which she serves, to explain \"what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Zuckerberg and the rest of the Facebook leadership seem conspicuously absent. Neither the Facebook CEO nor his top deputy, Sheryl Sandberg, have commented publicly on the matter. They have left that task to Grewal, a lawyer. No one has provided an adequate explanation for why Facebook did not disclose Kogan's violation to the more than 50 million users who were affected when the company first learned about it in 2015.</p><p>\"We are conducting a comprehensive internal and external review and are working to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information,\" Grewal said in a statement Sunday.</p><p>All of this comes as Facebook is already getting questions about the long-term appeal of its platform, at least in the United States. The number of daily active users in the United States ? a whopping 184 million ? declined for the first time last quarter. Facebook also lost 2.8 million users under the age of 25 last year, and is set to lose another 2 million this year, according to eMarketer.</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal is likely to hasten user disenchantment with the network, sources inside Facebook acknowledged. Facebook is increasingly being seen as a platform vulnerable to manipulation by political groups, foreign governments, or worse.</p><p>Ultimately, however, the real culprit in the eyes of the American public may not be Cambridge Analytica or the Russians, but rather Facebook itself.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20180319facebook-data-privacy-crisis1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX6-PY01-JBPX-W067-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><timeReceived>10:40 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 19, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That sounds comforting \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but a lot of people worry these days that they've centralised power - around themselves. This has become more obvious since Russian agents used Facebook in an attempt to man-ipulate the US public in the 2016 election. It's clearer every time somebody searches about dogs, only to find their feeds inundated with dog food ads.</p><p>Lying is bad, apparently, Mark Ritson, The Australian, Monday: Challenged further about the obvious unfairness of (not fact-checking ads), Zuckerberg countered with a now--infamous reply. \"Well, congresswoman, I think lying is bad, and I think if you were to run an ad that had a lie in it, that would be bad.\"</p><p>Criminal liability? Christopher Carbone, Fox News, Wednesday: A civil rights organisation has warned Mark Zuckerberg he could face criminal liability under certain laws. The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law claimed the social network is potentially liable under several state and federal statutes protecting consumers, preventing discrimination and promoting voting rights.</p><p>Fourth estate gone? Alan Kohler, The Australian, November 2: In his speech (at Georgetown University), Mark Zuckerberg came up with the expression \"the fifth estate\", as in: \"People having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world - a fifth estate alongside the other power structures of society. People no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers in politics or media to make their voices heard, and that has important consequences.\" Important consequences was something of an understatement.</p><p>Flimsy defence, Howard Dean, The Guardian Australia, Tuesday: Mark Zuckerberg, in refusing to ban false political advertising from his platform, is in effect defending the far right's approach. Zuckerberg \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 says he does not believe a platform should regulate political content \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Facebook is a private platform, not subject to first amendment protections. Every media platform \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 has an obligation to try to mitigate lies and propaganda.</p><p>Historical precedent, editorial, The New York Sun, Tuesday:Could Mark Zuckerberg go down in history as the next John Peter Zenger? We ask because of what Associ-ated Press calls the \"bipartisan hostility against Facebook\" that has \"been building for months\". Democrats \"especially\", the AP reckons, are homing in on Facebook's \"refusal to fact-check political ads and remove false ones\". That would have brought a grimace of irony from old Zenger. The pesky printer was put on trial back in the day - 1735 - for libelling the governor of New York, William Cosby, whom Zenger accused of corruption. At the time, libel law was the opposite of what it is now. The doctrine then was \"the greater the truth, the greater the libel\" \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The Democrats are up in arms because some of the ads Facebook has run have, they aver, contained falsehoods. Mr Zuckerberg doesn't want to police the advertising people pay him to publish. This is being ridiculed by the Democratic press, including in a column last week by The New York Times's Thomas Friedman.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-1a886ea201be11ea921e6921898911751a6671eff5f9219c4699c3ab2bcc74ee</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFT-H111-F0JP-W0R0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"629\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 9, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook dragging tech stock lower.</p><p>This, after reports that the personal Facebook data of an estimated 50 million people were harvested without their permission for political ad. You will not believe what we found that Facebook has on you. One hundred separate bits of information. We're going to show you what Facebook is collecting about you. E.U. also threatening a whopping 3 percent tax on tech company sales as well.</p><p>And this now breaking. The Connecticut Attorney General's office is initiating an inquiry into Facebook data policy after that report.</p><p>Also tonight, could Andrew McCabe, the fired former FBI deputy director incriminate the fired FBI James Comey, not just release to the media but for also lying to Congress. We got the sound and the debate coming up. We're on it.</p><p>And a tiny California town now defiantly fighting back against California sanctuary policy, saying it will instead follow their sworn oath to defend the Constitution and uphold immigration laws. It's the City of Los Alamitos it's voted tonight to not be a sanctuary city. It faces the threat of lawsuits in California condemnation as well. The mayor of that town here to talk about the fight.</p><p>Plus, driverless robot cars, now they were supposed to reduce traffic fatalities by eliminating human error.

The NASDAQ taking hits, that was down as well. Facebook stocks ending more than 6 percent down or 12 points lower after suspending a political analysis firm Cambridge Analytics after reports that the research firm harvested personal Facebook data on 270,000 Facebook users without their permission.</p><p>Now you can't Facebook friends and family. The breach may affect an estimated 50 million people. It's being Facebook Equifax breach. The research firm also reportedly told Facebook it did delete the user info when it did not. Pretty scary stuff.</p><p>There's actually a really long list of things that Facebook knows about you. We counted a hundred different things. For example, where you live, your age, your education, income, net worth, your wedding anniversary birthday whether you recently moved.</p><p>If you're in a long-distance relationship, whether you are conservative or liberal, whether you like would you're likely to buy your next car, how many workers your company has, whether you carry a credit card balance.

Wow, Lori.</p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: One, two punch against the tech sector today and that just drag down the broad market. We had the Dow closing down 335 points today, believe it or not that's well, well more than a hundred points off the session low for the Dow. Down now negative temperature territory for 2018.</p><p>The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ didn't fare much better. The NASDAQ was the worst in the benchmark three but it's still holding up for the year. There you see on your screen the NASDAQ fell 137 points blame Facebook.</p><p>But here is the thing that's got everyone here on Wall Street thinking. If Facebook is misusing customer data, user data, well, all of these tech companies use our data. They mine our data. We plug our data in. How do they get it, what do they do with it when they have it. And really how do they protect every day users.</p><p>So, a lot of the big tech company CEO's have been called upon by both Democrats and Republicans to testify about that. And then you mention this potential tax 3 percent by the E.U. on the tech company revenue.</p><p>So the good times may be over for tech. That was the thinking and the concern today on Wall Street, obviously nothing for sure on that front but any news of that degree again. Again, a one-two punch. The Facebook news and then the tax. My goodness. You're going to have some trouble.</p><p>And then of course you can talk about the ongoing trade and tariff controversy as well. So we did have a broad base rally, it wasn't just technology. All 10 S&amp;P sectors were in the red today.</p><p>We do want to bring you up-to-date on some mergers, merger Monday. Well, actually this one in particular is going nowhere. I'm talking about AT&amp;T and Time Warner shares both down in excess of 1 percent. AT&amp;T tried today to get a judge to throw out evidence. It seems to show its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner is bad for consumers and competition.</p><p>Now the Justice Department as you know did file a lawsuit back in November to stop this combination opening arguments in this case are still scheduled to begin on Wednesday. We're following it. Liz, back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Good to see you, Lori. Thank you so much.</p><p>ROTHMAN: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now this firm that's denying claims of abusing and have taking without consent the data of millions of Facebook users. That's called Cambridge Analytics. This as Facebook hired a digital forensic firm to do an audit of Cambridge Analytica systems.</p><p>Politicians now pressuring Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg for answers on what's going on. The word is Mark Zuckerberg may have to testify before Congress. Remember he has political leanings.</p><p>Gerri Willis has more. Gerri?</p><p>WILLIS: Hi, Liz. That's right. You know, just the latest on the latest on this incredibly fast moving story. Here's what Facebook had to say about hiring a digital forensics firm. Listen to this. \"We hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg to conduct a comprehensive audit, they say, of Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica has agreed to comply and afford the firm complete access to their servers and systems.\"</p><p>So that's a move forward here I supposed for Facebook. The other thing that's going on and this again, this is just out moments ago. Connecticut is launching, the attorney general there, a probe into what's gone on with Facebook. So that's something new. Reaction was swift and then you have on two continents with both the E.U. and the Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey launching probes. Yet Facebook says the situation is unlike data breaches, breaches that have plagued American companies.</p><p>For years now, here's what Facebook said. The claim that this is data breach is completely false. People knowingly provided their information. No systems were infiltrated. No passwords or sensitive pieces of information. We're still and or hack. At issues that hundreds of thousands of a Facebook users were paid to download to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected, they agreed to it. The app was called this is your digital life.</p><p>Facebook later change its policy and didn't allow this kind of scraping to be done. But Cambridge had retained access to the data as late as 2015. Cambridge now says no info from the company that provided the data was used in the 2016 election. Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook terms of service.</p><p>And back to you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Wow, what a story, Gerri. Thank you so much for coming on. We really appreciate it.</p><p>Now remember Mark Zuckerberg's New Year's resolution. He vowed to fix Facebook and to correct persistent problems that had dogged the networks. Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Now we're going to explore ways that we can share more information about anyone attempting to interfere with elections. We are working proactively to strengthen the democratic process. Beyond pushing back against threats we will also create more services to protect our community while engaging in political discourse.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's bring in the economist and author of \"The Capitalist Code\" Ben Stein. You know, Ben, this is kind of making people unsettled and uncomfortable. It's astonishing how much information Facebook has on you and also your kids.</p><p>BEN STEIN, ECONOMIST: It is astonishing in a way but it doesn't really affect Facebook as an investment. I mean, Facebook is still a very powerful company filling an enormously large niche and void in the American life. Facebook in a way has become an almost spiritual guide to human companionship and human fellowship. And almost spiritual guide and antidote to human loneliness.</p><p>I don't think that one day's notes about somebody misusing data or maybe not using data are going to change that. I can still consider stocks a fantastically important part of anyone's portfolio.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, I know what you mean that people could connect with their family and their friends. But the fact remains that this looks like Facebook's equivalent of the Equifax breach.</p><p>If info is going to help political campaigns the allegation was the Trump campaign benefit. Also a former Obama campaign staffer candidly admits, Ben, that Facebook let the Obama campaign quote, \"improperly access Facebook user dater -- data. The staffer, her name is Carol Davidson. She said this. \"Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they did not stop us once they realized that what we were doing. They came to office in the days after the election recruiting and were very candid that they let us do things they would not have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.\"</p><p>That was back in 2012. I mean, that's six years ago, Ben. Now Facebook is returning itself as sort of discomforted by all thing, all this. But you know, that was Obama's campaign. We don't want to get too political about this. But what is going on with Silicon Valley companies letting people access data.</p><p>STEIN: Well, what's going on is that it's going to, it's bound to happen. The internet is not a closed system. The internet is a system that people can get into, a very clever people can get into even if it's tightly sealed up. We know that the Russians and the Chinese are able to get into it even if we think it's sealed tightly as a drum.</p><p>What I want to go after is, is it still a good investment. And I say it's still is a very good investment. And the fact that people are upset about their data being accessed is too bad. And it's upsetting. And we don't want it to happen. And we want people's privacy to be respected. But we also want to be realistic about this. How is it possibly going to affect their earnings unless there's absolutely stupendous fine. I think --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. But you know, they're so, you know, they have so much information, Ben, they could pretty much accurately predict what kind of car you are going to buy, what kind of house you're going to buy, and where your kids are going to college.</p><p>STEIN: Absolutely.</p><p>MACDONALD: I'm not sure Americans realize how much Facebook knows about them.</p><p>STEIN: I'm not sure they do either, but I'm going to what the show is about, what you are wonderfully about in Fox Business is about which is making money. And that is I don't think anything we've learned in the last several days is going to affect whether or not Facebook is going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Ben, stay on that for a second. Hang on one second. Because some Americans want Facebook fined, hit with penalties for its role in the Russian meddling during the election.</p><p>Remember, you and I were talking about this, Ben, how Russian internet trolls loaded Facebook up with fake news. Even fake Facebook Russia-backed political rallies. Should Facebook be fined for that?</p><p>STEIN: Maybe they should be and maybe they shouldn't be. I don't think the Russia Trump collusion has improved to that any meaningful effect on the campaign at all on way or the other. And I think the more they push that the more they find that there's nothing at the end of the string. You can only push the string so far.</p><p>I'm not worried about that Russia Trump collusion because I don't it ever happen. If it did happened, it happen as such a minor scale that hardly matters at all. What I'm concerned about is this, is it still a good business to be in a business of providing communication for hundreds of millions and billions of people all around the world who would otherwise be sitting on lonely twiddling their thumbs.</p><p>And I think they're still a very, very good business. And the fact that they can access all of this information about all kinds of people in America or in Mexico or in Cuba or probably not Cuba, or anywhere tells us that this is still a very, very strong investment.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>STEIN: This stick on me that it's just an absolutely a house on fire in terms of power and I don't think there's going to be any stopping short of abolishing it. I don't anyone dares to abolish them.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Ben Stein, good to see you. Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p>STEIN: It's an honor as always.</p><p>MACDONALD: Same here. It appears to be the first driverless, well, there was a driver but this is on automatic mode. It was on robot mode. A robot car killed somebody in Tempe, Arizona. Ridesharing company Uber that it was this car it now stopped its self-driving car program. An Arizona woman struck and killed by one of the robot vehicles. It happened last night around 10 o'clock.</p><p>Coming up, we're bringing in an expert who is saying who is responsible. We're going to get to the bottom on who's to blame and who could face liability. Is it the car company Uber or is it the software.</p><p>Also this. One tiny Southern California town now sitting up in defiance to the big and powerful in the sanctuary state. It's the town of Los Alamitos in Orange County. It wants to opt out of California's sanctuary laws. The mayor of that town here to talk about it.</p><p>But first, could Andrew McCabe the fired former FBI deputy director, could he incriminate the fired FBI former Director James Comey, not just release to the media but for also for lying to Congress. We got the sound, we're going to drill into this debate, coming up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ANGUS KING (I), MAINE: It just seem mean-spirited to come down on a guy within 48 hours of his scheduled retirement. It was clearly rushed and I think there are questions about that and whether the administration was putting pressure on the Justice Department to take this action.</p><p>SEN. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA: It was a horrible day for democracy. To have firings like this happening at the top from the president and the attorney general does not speak well for what's going on.</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA: I don't like it happened. He should have been allowed to finish through the weekend.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: You know, his firing may be justified, there's no way for us to know at this point. But though it may have been justified it can also be tainted.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: A number of congressmen and senators up and arms of the firing of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. It was a recommendation from the FBI's own Office of Professional Responsibility they said yes, fire him.</p><p>Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy reminding everyone it was McCabe's fault.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Andy McCabe was undercut his credibility all by himself. he didn't any help doing that and I thought it richly ironic that he is lamenting that those are attacking the FBI when he himself does the exact same thing. It was the FBI who said he made an unauthorized disclosure and then a lied about it.</p><p>That wasn't President Trump, it wasn't me, it wasn't the crazy House Republicans. It was his own fellow FBI agents the said he leaked and then lied about it. So if he's got credibility issues he need look no further than himself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Joining me now former special assistant to Present Trump, Marc Lotter. Marc, what's your take on McCabe's firing?</p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: I think it sounds it was completely justified. You had an inspector general report the Office of Professional Responsibility and then the senior career official at the department all made these recommendations so that's what the attorney general acted on.</p><p>And I think what we're seeing right now is a case of many other Democrats and some of their friends in the mainstream media are trying to have it both ways. When someone pleads guilty to lying to investigators that are on the Republican side it's breaking news and it's proof that something is amiss except when someone is accused of doing the same thing to federal officials on the other side will then they're just trying to play \"Cry Me a River,\" so they can't have it both ways.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. People go to prison for misleading the FBI. I mean, McCabe is accused of misleading Justice Department investigating -- in investigators about his leaking of sensitive information to Wall Street Journal reporter about the FBI's investigation of pay to play at the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.</p><p>McCabe now says, Marc, that he had authority to quote share that information with the media and Director James Comey knew about that. But Marc, the issue is really covering up the leak, right? So is there anything wrong with the way he was fired?</p><p>LOTTER: Well, obviously the inspector general report which we have not seen yet does suggest that there were some sort of improprieties in the way he was conducting his business. And when you follow that on with the Office of professional Responsibility and the senior career official in the department all making me this conclusion then something there is amiss and it may just be lying or misleading investigators or maybe something more to it.</p><p>But we got to be honest here. We can't -- we cannot, as a country, tolerate any kind of impropriety when it comes to members of law enforcement at any level. We place our trust in them to act honorably within the bounds of their oath. If they don't, we need to get to that right away.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, former FBI Director James Comey is coming out with his book right at the same time this I.G. report is coming up from the Justice Department. But here's the problem for James Comey. The firing of Andrew McCabe may cause problems for James Comey.</p><p>Remember when Comey said this under oath last year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR: Never.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Question 21 relatively related. Have you ever authorize someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source is news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?</p><p>COMEY: No.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. So Comey said under oath he never was a source of the media nor authorize any FBI officials to talk to the media. But look at this. An Andrew McCabe's statement after getting fired he wrote this. \"The I.G. investigation is focused on information I chose to share with a reporter who my public affairs officer and legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret place, it took place, and others including the director, meaning James Comey were aware of the interaction with the reporter.</p><p>So Marc, did you catch that. The director meaning Comey was aware. So what -- how does that stuck up with Comey saying what he said to Congress last year about he didn't allow -- he never allow any of this.</p><p>LOTTER: Clearly they've got contradicting stories and I think this is why so many Republicans are saying we need another special investigator to look at the way the FBI's conducted itself in a very small group at the highest levels. We cannot have these inconsistencies if partisanship if things were taking place in the Clinton investigation that was not aboveboard, that was not inconsistent -- that was not consistent with their oath then when you look into it.</p><p>And right now as you pointed out we see it happening where they are contradicting each other and who said what and when.</p><p>MACDONALD: Marc Lotter, great to see you. Thanks for coming on.</p><p>LOTTER: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Breaking news. Fox News confirming that the president is hiring a new legal defense team to official to help in dealing with the special counsel's Russia probe. Former Bush U.S. attorney Joseph DiGenova will join President Trump's legal team. He has previously suggested that the Justice Department and FBI framed the president. The edition that Mr. DiGenova as the first change with legal teams since last summer.</p><p>Next up, one tiny Southern California it is standing up in defiance to the big and the powerful in the sanctuary state of California. It's Los Alamitos in Orange County. It wants to opt out of California sanctuary laws that restrict cooperation between local police and federal immigration. They are saying in Los Alamitos that swore an oath to uphold the Constitution and what state is asking them to do is violating that oath.</p><p>We're bringing the mayor of that town Troy Edgar to speak out after this.</p><p>MACDONALD: One tiny Southern California town now standing up in defiance to being powerful in the state of California. Los Alamitos wants to opt out of California sanctuary laws that restrict cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents.</p><p>Council members in the city now say they have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and that California so-called sanctuary laws undercuts that oath as well as federal law.</p><p>Let's bring in the mayor Los Alamitos, he's Troy Edgar. Good to see you, mayor.</p><p>TROY EDGAR, MAYOR, LOST ALAMITOS, CALIFORNIA: Hi, Liz. How are you doing?</p><p>MACDONALD: Thanks for coming on. Can you spell out this fight and what officials in your town are saying because we've got university professors in California saying, you know what, you're right in the crosshairs of lawsuits.</p><p>EDGAR: Yes. You know, this is a small city in Southern California what we're really trying to do is we're telling the state is, look, at this point, you know, we are conflicted with the U.S. Constitution and Los Alamitos we firmly believe that the U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the land and that the SP 54 sanctuary law is in conflict. And at this point we're going to vote tonight to see if we will exempt ourselves from that.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, we've got -- we've run on the show, mayor, sheriffs in California who are twisted into pretzel knots trying to abide by the Constitution the federal law and what the state is telling them to do.</p><p>What I would like you know and I think the viewer wants to have you spoken to other mayors in California, are there other cities like yours who do not want to be part of the sanctuary state policies?</p><p>EDGAR: Yes, there's a lot of mayors in California that don't want to be a part of it, but you know it's a really tough situation because in our state lot of this legislation comes out of Sacramento just seems disconnected that they're not attached. You know, when you're mayor of a small town immediately your constituents tell you how they feel where they're at and, you know, you're going to find out that evening in the grocery store whether you're doing a good job or not.</p><p>And I think a lot of the stuff is going on Sacramento people this constantly saying to all of us on the council what is going on.</p><p>MACDONALD: Have you experienced crime from illegal immigrants in your town?</p><p>EDGAR: No, I would say that we don't have a significant amount of crime problems with illegal immigrants. I think for us this is a constitutional issue that we're looking at and saying look, we are consistently being held to different standards by the state. A lot of them unfunded this is another one where they pass a law and now they're asking us to choose between the U.S. Constitution and the state Constitution.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>EDGAR: And I think based on our oath, you now, many of us want to stay and focus on the U.S. Constitution.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, we're wondering if your vote tonight will set up a chain reaction. Which other mayors are telling you that they agree with you and want to opt out? What are the mayors of what town?</p><p>EDGAR: Well, you know what, I think right now I think a lot of the mayors are going to wait and see and how this is going to go.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: But do you know they found?</p><p>EDGAR: I do. But I I want to give them an opportunity to bring this upon themselves and I've also talked to a different staff and city attorneys at different city specially the elected city attorneys that the definitely have a perspective on which direction they or their city may want to go.</p><p>MACDONALD: Mayor, we have Sheriff Margaret Mims, she's in Fresno, California. She's been speaking out against California sanctuary laws. I'd like your reaction to what the sheriff said. Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARGARET MIMS, SHERIFF, FRESNO COUNTY: We need to stop vilifying our hard- working ICE agents and our federal law enforcement partners. They are doing their jobs. Law enforcement has to enforce the law, teachers have to teach, and preachers have to preach and we're not going to apologize any of us for doing our jobs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: So, mayor, do you hear from your local law enforcement the same thing that the sheriff just said?</p><p>EDGAR: You know what, I think that there is kind of two different jurisdictions. The sheriff definitely deals with the county, Orange County level and at L.A. County for us, but you know, the sheriff is little bit different than the police chief.</p><p>And so, within our cities we all have police chiefs and we across the different cities so have a lot of different types of things that are going on. And I think tonight what we will hear --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: But are your cops upset about it, are your cops upset about two different standards they are dealing with?</p><p>EDGAR: Now. You know what, I think at this point it's probably more the counsel, you know, Mayor Pro Tem Kusumot has been really focused on this and him and I together really want to kind of bring this up and have an open discussion with the city council and start bringing stuff into this on more formal basis.</p><p>MACDONALD: Mayor Troy Edgar of Los Alamitos standing up in defiance against California laws. Good to see you, mayor. Thanks you so much for coming on.</p><p>EDGAR: Thank you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now -- you, too. It appears to be the first driverless car fatality on a public road it involved ridesharing company Uber. It has now stop its self driving robot car program after a woman in Tempe, Arizona was struck and killed by one of its robots cars.</p><p>Coming up, an attorney on who could be responsible, is it Uber or is it the software?</p><p>But first, forget about distancing themselves. Reverend Al Sharpton is now saying we are going to do a protest in support and in defense of anti- Semite and racist Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.</p><p>We're bringing on Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz to react after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LOUIS FARRAKHAN, LEADER, NATION OF ISLAM: Hitler was a very great man. The Satanic Jews. White folks are going down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FARRAKHAN: Hear the Jews they don't like Farrakhan so they call me Hitler. That's a good name. Hitler was a very great man.</p><p>Your country has been taken from you by the synagogue of Satan. The Satanic Jews. White folks are going down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Black activist groups including Al Sharpton's national action network also Black Lives Matters -- matter and the New Black Panther Party now organizing a protest in support of and in defense of the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan. The groups are protesting a congressional resolution condemning Farrakhan.</p><p>With me now Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz. First of all, Alan, professor, rather, there are some other comments made by Farrakhan. Here's one of them. The Jews talk about never again. You cannot say never again to God because when he puts you in the oven you're in one indeed.</p><p>He also said the Jews of control over those agency -- agency of the government. He also said this. When a woman does not know how to cook and the right foods to cook she's preparing death for herself, her husband and her children.</p><p>You know, Professor, Democrats like Maxine Waters, Al Green, Keith Ellison, they also have links to Farrakhan. What's going on here?</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL: Well, first of all, Farrakhan is not only an anti-Semite, he's anti-white, he's anti-woman, he's anti-gay. He's anti everything decent in this country and when you get bigots supporting him and people like Al Sharpton was has his own history of anti-Semitism.</p><p>Black Lives Matter which singled out only Israel called genocide to an apartheid country which was anti-Semitic as well. What we have in this country as people who believe in an affirmative action program for racism for African Americans. That if you're an African-American you can get away with supporting anti-Semitism, anti-gay, anti-white --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: But wait a minute, wait, wait, wait. Because you know, Trump is being accused of racism but now we've got an MSNBC host Al Sharpton defending this anti, you know, this anti-Semite, this racist anti-gay individual. I don't understand why more people are not condemning Farrakhan including Democrats.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Well, the Democrats should condemn him, the women's movement should condemn him, gay rights movement should condemn him, everybody should condemn him. And I don't never have understood why Al Sharpton was a history of anti-Semitism, the history about lying and falsely accusing people of crime should be on the major network.</p><p>If you had a white person who is equivalently racist against blacks and who defended David Duke he would never ever get on the air on a national network. And yet, we have affirmative action for black races and that's just unjustified. We have zero tolerance for bigotry, racism, and anti- Semitism and under the standard at zero-tolerance are not only doesn't Farrakhan satisfy it but neither does Sharpton, neither does Black Lives Matter, and neither to the congressmen who were now standing in support of a big anti-Semite.</p><p>Imagine if Republican congressmen standing in support of David Duke and Farrakhan is much, much, much more dangerous than David Duke. Because Farrakhan has the support of hundreds of thousands of African-Americans. What's my source to that? My source to that is Sharpton who says that he has massive support in the African-American community.</p><p>David Duke doesn't have any support and so we should not have a double standard. And Democrats and all decent people should come out not only against Farrakhan but any congressperson who supports Farrakhan.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, so let's get to one of those congressmen, professor. It's Democrat Congressman of Illinois, he's Danny Davis. He tried to clarify his position, he and his praise. Danny Davis has praise Farrakhan and has met with Farrakhan.</p><p>Here's what he saying now. Quote, \"I disagree with Minister Farrakhan in terms of white people being devils and Jewish people being Satanic. But I also protect his right as a free individual to say and do whatever he wants to do. I think he does outstanding things for, especially blacks who are unsure about themselves and people who've been in prison.\"</p><p>Your reaction to that.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: People said the same thing about Adolf Hitler that he did good things for the German people. You cannot justify this kind of bigotry by saying that he also does some decent things. And I think it's a scandal that the Democratic Party and liberals and the New York Times lets a black bigots off the hook. Only a text to bigotry on the right.</p><p>Today the danger of bigotry is far greater from the hard left, from the African-American community from the Muslim community, from many other communities which tolerated (AUDIO GAP) bigotry than it is from the right. Look, anti-Semitism was wrong for both the right and the left. We all condemn it from the right, let's join together to condemn it from the left regardless of the race of the person behind it.</p><p>MACDONALD: Professor Alan Dershowitz, we love having you on. Come back soon, sir.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Any time. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. The robot cars are supposed to stop fatalities. But now it appears to be the first death caused by the robot car in a public road. Ridesharing company Uber stopping its self-driving car program after a woman in Arizona was struck and killed by one of its robot cars last night.</p><p>We're bringing in an attorney on what this means for the car industry and Silicon Valley.</p><p>But first, Hillary Clinton now backtracking now her none-apologize -- apology after implying last week that women who cast a ballot who voted for Trump for this all due to pressure from their husbands.</p><p>My all-female power panel is here to react after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS: It's not helpful at all. And in fact, my friend Hillary Clinton is wrong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We do not do well with white men and we don't do well with married white women. And part of that is a -- an identification with the Republican Party and a sort of ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son, whoever believes you should.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Hillary Clinton putting up a lengthy 861-word non-apology on Facebook, trying to defend and explain her controversial comments about the Trump campaign. It's called backwards that the state that didn't vote for her are not optimistic, diverse or dynamic, and that white women vote like their husband. She made those comments a week and a half ago in India.</p><p>But now Hillary Clinton says this. \"I also mentioned something in passing that's got a lot of attention.\" She's saying now that she said in passing, \"that there is anecdotal level and some research to suggest that women are unfortunately more swayed by men than the other way around. As much as I hate the possibility and hate saying it, it's not that crazy when you think about our ongoing struggle to reach the gender balance even within the same household.</p><p>I understand how some of what I said upset people and can be misinterpreted. I mean, meant no disrespect to any individual or group. I want to look to the future not just anybody.\"</p><p>With me now, the Federalist, Britt McHenry, and Democrat strategist, Danielle McLaughlin. Britt, are you satisfied what is not apology. I mean, why is Hillary even bringing up these things, why get into it?</p><p>BRITT MCHENRY, CONTRIBUTOR, THE FEDERALIST: Absolutely not. Hillary Clinton is like that relative, that strange relative that comes to family gatherings and you just know that she's just going to say something patronizing and offensive which she did.</p><p>Donald Trump 52 percent of white women votes, so she's right about that, 61 percent of white women without college degree. So in her non-apology she is trying to say that those white women anyone watching this program right now don't have gender equality in their household. It's ridiculous. And she can't get out of her own way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: And that they can't think for themselves --</p><p>MCHENRY: Exactly.</p><p>MACDONALD: -- they just follow what their husbands are doing. OK. Danielle, Democrat Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin speaking out against Clinton's comment. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DURBIN: It's not helpful at all. And in fact, my friend Hillary Clinton is wrong. Thirty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump had voted for President Obama. Why? The same people who look for change with President Obama thought wasn't enough for us, their personal lives were concerned and they supported Donald Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: How come more Democrats, Danielle are not joining Dick Durbin and condemning comments like Hillary made?</p><p>DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think because Dick Durbin is right. You know, I don't think that what she said on that face --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: But how come more Democrats -- how come more Democrats are not stepping out and saying you know what, Hillary, you're wrong?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Well, I think plenty have in all honesty and they don't because they probably wants to draw much attention to it.</p><p>MACDONALD: Who?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: But I will give the person credit for apologizing.</p><p>MACDONALD: Who besides Dick Durbin has stepped up?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: There have been a number of Democrats, there have been a number of people on television who have said this as well.</p><p>MACDONALD: Who?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: I can name for you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Go ahead.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: I mean, this is clearly something that you would never say and shouldn't even say. But you know what? I give her credit for apologizing. We have a president who has insulted many number of people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: It wasn't an apology. Have you read it? Have you read it? Danielle, have you read it? It was a non-apology.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: And she said very much that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: She didn't say she was sorry anywhere in that Facebook post.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Well, I mean, she said I mean I meant no disrespect. She did not meant to hurt people or harm people that as far more that Donald Trump has ever said when he talked about John McCain or Judge Curiel --</p><p>MACDONALD: Understood. But we're talking about -- understood. I get what you're saying. H has said an extraordinary inflammatory things.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: We get that and we've covered it here on the show.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: I know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: We're talking about Hillary right now. Britt, she's no apology there.</p><p>MCHENRY: There's no apology. And if Democrats want success they need more moderate Democrats like we saw with Conor Lamb who won in a congressional district that won by 20 points for Trump in Trump's favor in 2016. That's going to send their message not that I particularly wanted to go over the Democrats instead of this identity politics and just offensive rhetoric from Hillary Clinton.</p><p>MACDONALD: Britt and Danielle, thank you so much for coming on. I really appreciate it.</p><p>MCHENRY: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Breaking news. Washington Post reporting that President Trump is preparing by this Friday to hit China with tariffs on $60 billion worth of goods that would double the what was earlier thought to be 30 billion, now it's going to 60 billion. It could be 100 different types of products hit with tariffs by this Friday.</p><p>This amid the escalation of trade tensions is going to four anonymous senior administration officials. We're staying on that story for you.</p><p>Now it appears to be the first robot car death on a public road. Ridesharing company Uber stopping its self-driving car program after a woman in Arizona was struck and killed by one of its robot vehicle.</p><p>Attorney Emily Compagno on whether this is basically upends the entire robot car industry. That's after this.</p><p>MACDONALD: Cars are supposed to stop traffic fatalities but now a bombshell. The first driverless robot car death in a public road evolving ridesharing company Uber. It's now suspending its robot car program after woman was struck and killed by one of its robot cars at 10 o'clock last night in Tempe, Arizona.</p><p>Attorney Emily Compagno, I mean, how worried are you about robot cars killing people? We thought they were supposed to stop traffic fatalities.</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY: Right. And it's hard because in this field which is noble one death is one death too many but in the larger picture we see over -- we see up to 50 million disabled and injury results from car crashes a year and millions death, right, it's the highest -- it's the highest cause of death in the country.</p><p>But again, the argument for autonomous vehicle in part is that it's supposed to be safer because it removes that human element. But in situations like this is it possible that the human element the ability to be malleable and to react to things that that ultimately what would render an autonomous vehicle safer.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: So it kind of begs a larger question, right? But what we're seeing this play out is going to be in a regulatory field. The reason that Arizona has so many tech companies playing in that field now it's because they've said they taking an accommodating approach to not regulate the autonomous riding field there.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. You know, Emily, I hear what you're saying. We hear so many glowing statements about how great robot cars are going to be. But you know what's not being discussed, Emily, is this. Robot cars have been found to not properly read highway signs if those highway signs have been slightly altered. They don't know how to read it. And some of these were about cars don't even network and talk to other robot cars.</p><p>That's the big deal for Apple. Apple can have its own Apple closed system in these cars. So the thing is, Emily, we still haven't figured out who is going to be liable for robot car death. Is it companies like Uber or the software?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Right. Well, in every case it's going to be a different analysis as to who or what is responsible, right? So we saw in a large accident earlier that didn't involve a fatality that human driver that was in the autonomous vehicle he was ultimately held responsible because of that.</p><p>In another major crash it was the other driver of the car that T-bone the autonomous driving vehicle. And I think the larger answer to your question is that this is why test phase is so important. This is why we're not ready to hit the road yet. This is why kind of a phase physical area for these cars to be tested is so crucial.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Right. Bingo.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Because otherwise of course now we'll see more fatalities.</p><p>MACDONALD: You just nailed it. That's the thing, Emily. Because this is like a -- we're just at the beginning stages of this and now we have a woman killed by a robot car, right? I mean, this is a big deal.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. And note that just next month or in April, California has maintained that they will now allow test writing of these autonomous vehicles without the human driver inside, right? Up until now it's just been Arizona. So that's something that we're going to see now a huge test zone there, that's a physical fight at the Silicon Valley, right. So we'll see a lot more.</p><p>MACDONALD: Emily, we need you back on. We love having you on to break it all down and drill into this. You're terrific. Please come back on the show. Good to see you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: More after the break. Don't go away.</p><p>MACDONALD: Breaking news on the Facebook data mining breach. Cambridge Analytica they're accused of abusing the Facebook data of potentially millions of Facebook users. Now Great Britain wants to seek a warrant to get into the computer servers of that data mining firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>We're going to stay on that story for you tomorrow. Mondays are big night on Fox Business. Tune to two new episodes of Strange Inheritance tonight at 9 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Thank you so much for watching. Charles Payne here now with Making Money.

This industry darling led the market up last year and through  much of this year quite a different take today. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Cambridge Analytica was able to  can collect the data from 50 million people's profiles without permission.  In the U.S., in Europe, in the U.K. are calling for investigations Facebook  is in the crosshairs. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Social media companies are trading  lower today. I guess in sympathy. Twitter, Snap, Google all lower.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  People are starting to grow tired of social media. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Facebook basically can't be escape. This is something  that as far --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Everybody in their mother now saying we are going to  investigate.</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Facebook privacy hitting markets  really hard today. Facebook having its worst day in five and half years.  The Dow also are down nearly 500 points at session lows at tech is drag  down in sympathy. The NASDAQ slid nearly 2 percent. Facebook dragging tech  stock lower.</p><p>This, after reports that the personal Facebook data of an estimated 50  million people were harvested without their permission for political ad.  You will not believe what we found that Facebook has on you. One hundred  separate bits of information. We're going to show you what Facebook is  collecting about you. E.U. also threatening a whopping 3 percent tax on  tech company sales as well.</p><p>And this now breaking. The Connecticut Attorney General's office is  initiating an inquiry into Facebook data policy after that report. </p><p>Also tonight, could Andrew McCabe, the fired former FBI deputy director  incriminate the fired FBI James Comey, not just release to the media but  for also lying to Congress. We got the sound and the debate coming up.  We're on it. </p><p>And a tiny California town now defiantly fighting back against California  sanctuary policy, saying it will instead follow their sworn oath to defend  the Constitution and uphold immigration laws. It's the City of Los Alamitos  it's voted tonight to not be a sanctuary city. It faces the threat of  lawsuits in California condemnation as well. The mayor of that town here to  talk about the fight. </p><p>Plus, driverless robot cars, now they were supposed to reduce traffic  fatalities by eliminating human error. But now a robot car from ridesharing  company Uber has killed a pedestrian in Arizona. It happened last night. So  what will happen to the robot revolution? That's now in the works of a slew  of auto companies like Tesla, G.M. Ford and also Silicon Valley. We're  bringing an expert to weigh in.</p><p>Tonight, an all-guest lineup. Economist Ben Stein, former special assistant  to President Trump, Marc Lotter, legal eagle Harvard Law professor Alan  Dershowitz, the Federalist Britt McHenry, all here all tonight. </p><p>Politics, money, we got you covered. I'm Elizabeth McDonald. Risk and  Reward starts right now. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  I wish I could tell you that we're going  to be able to stop all interference but that just wouldn't be realistic.  There will always be bad actors in the world and we can't prevent all  governments from all interference. But we can make it harder. We can make  it much harder and that's what we're going to focus on doing. </p><p>We won't catch everyone immediately but we can make it harder to try to  determine (Ph).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  The Dow down 335 points closing to that 24,610. The NASDAQ  taking hits, that was down as well. Facebook stocks ending more than 6  percent down or 12 points lower after suspending a political analysis firm  Cambridge Analytics after reports that the research firm harvested personal  Facebook data on 270,000 Facebook users without their permission. </p><p>Now you can't Facebook friends and family. The breach may affect an  estimated 50 million people. It's being Facebook Equifax breach. The  research firm also reportedly told Facebook it did delete the user info  when it did not. Pretty scary stuff. </p><p>There's actually a really long list of things that Facebook knows about  you. We counted a hundred different things. For example, where you live,  your age, your education, income, net worth, your wedding anniversary  birthday whether you recently moved. </p><p>If you're in a long-distance relationship, whether you are conservative or  liberal, whether you like would you're likely to buy your next car, how  many workers your company has, whether you carry a credit card balance. The  time of year your household shops and the most types of vacations you take,  the pets you have, and so on, and so on, and so on, more and more and more. </p><p>But first, Lori Rothman on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on the  market drop after reports of this privacy breach at Facebook. You know,  Lori, Facebook faces a threat of federal fines. The tech sector also  dropping after the E.U. threaten to slap U.S. tech companies with a 3  percent tax of sales and revenues. Wow, Lori.</p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  One, two punch against the tech  sector today and that just drag down the broad market. We had the Dow  closing down 335 points today, believe it or not that's well, well more  than a hundred points off the session low for the Dow. Down now negative  temperature territory for 2018. </p><p>The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ didn't fare much better. The NASDAQ was the worst in  the benchmark three but it's still holding up for the year. There you see  on your screen the NASDAQ fell 137 points blame Facebook. </p><p>But here is the thing that's got everyone here on Wall Street thinking. If  Facebook is misusing customer data, user data, well, all of these tech  companies use our data. They mine our data. We plug our data in. How do  they get it, what do they do with it when they have it. And really how do  they protect every day users. </p><p>So, a lot of the big tech company CEO's have been called upon by both  Democrats and Republicans to testify about that. And then you mention this  potential tax 3 percent by the E.U. on the tech company revenue. </p><p>So the good times may be over for tech. That was the thinking and the  concern today on Wall Street, obviously nothing for sure on that front but  any news of that degree again. Again, a one-two punch. The Facebook news  and then the tax. My goodness. You're going to have some trouble. </p><p>And then of course you can talk about the ongoing trade and tariff  controversy as well. So we did have a broad base rally, it wasn't just  technology. All 10 S&amp;P sectors were in the red today. </p><p>We do want to bring you up-to-date on some mergers, merger Monday. Well,  actually this one in particular is going nowhere. I'm talking about AT&amp;T  and Time Warner shares both down in excess of 1 percent. AT&amp;T tried today  to get a judge to throw out evidence. It seems to show its $85 billion  acquisition of Time Warner is bad for consumers and competition. </p><p>Now the Justice Department as you know did file a lawsuit back in November  to stop this combination opening arguments in this case are still scheduled  to begin on Wednesday. We're following it. Liz, back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Lori. Thank you so much.</p><p>ROTHMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now this firm that's denying claims of abusing and have taking  without consent the data of millions of Facebook users. That's called  Cambridge Analytics. This as Facebook hired a digital forensic firm to do  an audit of Cambridge Analytica systems. </p><p>Politicians now pressuring Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg for answers on what's  going on. The word is Mark Zuckerberg may have to testify before Congress.  Remember he has political leanings. </p><p>Gerri Willis has more. Gerri?</p><p>WILLIS:  Hi, Liz. That's right. You know, just the latest on the latest on  this incredibly fast moving story. Here's what Facebook had to say about  hiring a digital forensics firm. Listen to this. \"We hired a digital  forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg to conduct a comprehensive audit, they say,  of Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica has agreed to comply and afford  the firm complete access to their servers and systems.\" </p><p>So that's a move forward here I supposed for Facebook. The other thing  that's going on and this again, this is just out moments ago. Connecticut  is launching, the attorney general there, a probe into what's gone on with  Facebook. So that's something new. Reaction was swift and then you have on  two continents with both the E.U. and the Massachusetts Attorney General  Maura Healey launching probes. Yet Facebook says the situation is unlike  data breaches, breaches that have plagued American companies. </p><p>For years now, here's what Facebook said. The claim that this is data  breach is completely false. People knowingly provided their information. No  systems were infiltrated. No passwords or sensitive pieces of information.  We're still and or hack. At issues that hundreds of thousands of a Facebook  users were paid to download to take a personality test and agreed to have  their data collected, they agreed to it. The app was called this is your  digital life. </p><p>Facebook later change its policy and didn't allow this kind of scraping to  be done. But Cambridge had retained access to the data as late as 2015.  Cambridge now says no info from the company that provided the data was used  in the 2016 election. Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook  terms of service.</p><p>And back to you, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Wow, what a story, Gerri. Thank you so much for coming on.  We really appreciate it. </p><p>Now remember Mark Zuckerberg's New Year's resolution. He vowed to fix  Facebook and to correct persistent problems that had dogged the networks.  Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Now we're going to explore ways that we can share more  information about anyone attempting to interfere with elections. We are  working proactively to strengthen the democratic process. Beyond pushing  back against threats we will also create more services to protect our  community while engaging in political discourse.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's bring in the economist and author of \"The Capitalist  Code\" Ben Stein. You know, Ben, this is kind of making people unsettled and  uncomfortable. It's astonishing how much information Facebook has on you  and also your kids. </p><p>BEN STEIN, ECONOMIST:  It is astonishing in a way but it doesn't really  affect Facebook as an investment. I mean, Facebook is still a very powerful  company filling an enormously large niche and void in the American life.  Facebook in a way has become an almost spiritual guide to human  companionship and human fellowship. And almost spiritual guide and antidote  to human loneliness. </p><p>I don't think that one day's notes about somebody misusing data or maybe  not using data are going to change that. I can still consider stocks a  fantastically important part of anyone's portfolio.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, I know what you mean that people could connect with their  family and their friends. But the fact remains that this looks like  Facebook's equivalent of the Equifax breach.</p><p>If info is going to help political campaigns the allegation was the Trump  campaign benefit. Also a former Obama campaign staffer candidly admits,  Ben, that Facebook let the Obama campaign quote, \"improperly access  Facebook user dater -- data. The staffer, her name is Carol Davidson. She  said this. \"Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole  social graph, but they did not stop us once they realized that what we were  doing. They came to office in the days after the election recruiting and  were very candid that they let us do things they would not have allowed  someone else to do because they were on our side.\" </p><p>That was back in 2012. I mean, that's six years ago, Ben. Now Facebook is  returning itself as sort of discomforted by all thing, all this. But you  know, that was Obama's campaign. We don't want to get too political about  this. But what is going on with Silicon Valley companies letting people  access data. </p><p>STEIN:  Well, what's going on is that it's going to, it's bound to happen.  The internet is not a closed system. The internet is a system that people  can get into, a very clever people can get into even if it's tightly sealed  up. We know that the Russians and the Chinese are able to get into it even  if we think it's sealed tightly as a drum.</p><p>What I want to go after is, is it still a good investment. And I say it's  still is a very good investment. And the fact that people are upset about  their data being accessed is too bad. And it's upsetting. And we don't want  it to happen. And we want people's privacy to be respected. But we also  want to be realistic about this. How is it possibly going to affect their  earnings unless there's absolutely stupendous fine. I think --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. But you know, they're so, you know, they have so much  information, Ben, they could pretty much accurately predict what kind of  car you are going to buy, what kind of house you're going to buy, and where  your kids are going to college. </p><p>STEIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm not sure Americans realize how much Facebook knows about  them. </p><p>STEIN:  I'm not sure they do either, but I'm going to what the show is  about, what you are wonderfully about in Fox Business is about which is  making money. And that is I don't think anything we've learned in the last  several days is going to affect whether or not Facebook is going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Ben, stay on that for a second. Hang on one second.  Because some Americans want Facebook fined, hit with penalties for its role  in the Russian meddling during the election. </p><p>Remember, you and I were talking about this, Ben, how Russian internet  trolls loaded Facebook up with fake news. Even fake Facebook Russia-backed  political rallies. Should Facebook be fined for that?</p><p>STEIN:  Maybe they should be and maybe they shouldn't be. I don't think the  Russia Trump collusion has improved to that any meaningful effect on the  campaign at all on way or the other. And I think the more they push that  the more they find that there's nothing at the end of the string. You can  only push the string so far. </p><p>I'm not worried about that Russia Trump collusion because I don't it ever  happen. If it did happened, it happen as such a minor scale that hardly  matters at all. What I'm concerned about is this, is it still a good  business to be in a business of providing communication for hundreds of  millions and billions of people all around the world who would otherwise be  sitting on lonely twiddling their thumbs. </p><p>And I think they're still a very, very good business. And the fact that  they can access all of this information about all kinds of people in  America or in Mexico or in Cuba or probably not Cuba, or anywhere tells us  that this is still a very, very strong investment. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>STEIN:  This stick on me that it's just an absolutely a house on fire in  terms of power and I don't think there's going to be any stopping short of  abolishing it. I don't anyone dares to abolish them. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Ben Stein, good to see you. Thank you so much for  coming on. </p><p>STEIN:  It's an honor as always.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Same here. It appears to be the first driverless, well, there  was a driver but this is on automatic mode. It was on robot mode. A robot  car killed somebody in Tempe, Arizona. Ridesharing company Uber that it was  this car it now stopped its self-driving car program. An Arizona woman  struck and killed by one of the robot vehicles. It happened last night  around 10 o'clock.</p><p>Coming up, we're bringing in an expert who is saying who is responsible.  We're going to get to the bottom on who's to blame and who could face  liability. Is it the car company Uber or is it the software.</p><p>Also this. One tiny Southern California town now sitting up in defiance to  the big and powerful in the sanctuary state. It's the town of Los Alamitos  in Orange County. It wants to opt out of California's sanctuary laws. The  mayor of that town here to talk about it. </p><p>But first, could Andrew McCabe the fired former FBI deputy director, could  he incriminate the fired FBI former Director James Comey, not just release  to the media but for also for lying to Congress. We got the sound, we're  going to drill into this debate, coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ANGUS KING (I), MAINE: It just seem mean-spirited to come down on a  guy within 48 hours of his scheduled retirement. It was clearly rushed and  I think there are questions about that and whether the administration was  putting pressure on the Justice Department to take this action. </p><p>SEN. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA:  It was a horrible day for democracy. To have  firings like this happening at the top from the president and the attorney  general does not speak well for what's going on. </p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA:  I don't like it happened. He should have  been allowed to finish through the weekend.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA:  You know, his firing may be justified,  there's no way for us to know at this point. But though it may have been  justified it can also be tainted.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  A number of congressmen and senators up and arms of the firing  of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. It was a recommendation from the  FBI's own Office of Professional Responsibility they said yes, fire him.</p><p>Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy reminding everyone it was McCabe's fault.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Andy McCabe was undercut his  credibility all by himself. he didn't any help doing that and I thought it  richly ironic that he is lamenting that those are attacking the FBI when he  himself does the exact same thing. It was the FBI who said he made an  unauthorized disclosure and then a lied about it. </p><p>That wasn't President Trump, it wasn't me, it wasn't the crazy House  Republicans. It was his own fellow FBI agents the said he leaked and then  lied about it. So if he's got credibility issues he need look no further  than himself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Joining me now former special assistant to Present Trump, Marc  Lotter. Marc, what's your take on McCabe's firing?</p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think it sounds it was  completely justified. You had an inspector general report the Office of  Professional Responsibility and then the senior career official at the  department all made these recommendations so that's what the attorney  general acted on. </p><p>And I think what we're seeing right now is a case of many other Democrats  and some of their friends in the mainstream media are trying to have it  both ways. When someone pleads guilty to lying to investigators that are on  the Republican side it's breaking news and it's proof that something is  amiss except when someone is accused of doing the same thing to federal  officials on the other side will then they're just trying to play \"Cry Me a  River,\" so they can't have it both ways.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. People go to prison for misleading the FBI. I mean, McCabe  is accused of misleading Justice Department investigating -- in  investigators about his leaking of sensitive information to Wall Street  Journal reporter about the FBI's investigation of pay to play at the  Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. </p><p>McCabe now says, Marc, that he had authority to quote share that  information with the media and Director James Comey knew about that. But  Marc, the issue is really covering up the leak, right? So is there anything  wrong with the way he was fired?</p><p>LOTTER:  Well, obviously the inspector general report which we have not  seen yet does suggest that there were some sort of improprieties in the way  he was conducting his business. And when you follow that on with the Office  of professional Responsibility and the senior career official in the  department all making me this conclusion then something there is amiss and  it may just be lying or misleading investigators or maybe something more to  it.</p><p>But we got to be honest here. We can't -- we cannot, as a country, tolerate  any kind of impropriety when it comes to members of law enforcement at any  level. We place our trust in them to act honorably within the bounds of  their oath. If they don't, we need to get to that right away.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, former FBI Director James Comey is coming out with  his book right at the same time this I.G. report is coming up from the  Justice Department. But here's the problem for James Comey. The firing of  Andrew McCabe may cause problems for James Comey.</p><p>Remember when Comey said this under oath last year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source  in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the  Clinton investigation?</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  Never.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Question 21 relatively related. Have you ever authorize  someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source is news reports about the  Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?</p><p>COMEY:  No.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. So Comey said under oath he never was a source of the media  nor authorize any FBI officials to talk to the media. But look at this. An  Andrew McCabe's statement after getting fired he wrote this. \"The I.G.  investigation is focused on information I chose to share with a reporter  who my public affairs officer and legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I  was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a  secret place, it took place, and others including the director, meaning  James Comey were aware of the interaction with the reporter.</p><p>So Marc, did you catch that. The director meaning Comey was aware. So what  -- how does that stuck up with Comey saying what he said to Congress last  year about he didn't allow -- he never allow any of this.</p><p>LOTTER:  Clearly they've got contradicting stories and I think this is why  so many Republicans are saying we need another special investigator to look  at the way the FBI's conducted itself in a very small group at the highest  levels. We cannot have these inconsistencies if partisanship if things were  taking place in the Clinton investigation that was not aboveboard, that was  not inconsistent -- that was not consistent with their oath then when you  look into it.</p><p>And right now as you pointed out we see it happening where they are  contradicting each other and who said what and when.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Marc Lotter, great to see you. Thanks for coming on.</p><p>LOTTER:  Thanks, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news. Fox News confirming that the president is hiring  a new legal defense team to official to help in dealing with the special  counsel's Russia probe. Former Bush U.S. attorney Joseph DiGenova will join  President Trump's legal team. He has previously suggested that the Justice  Department and FBI framed the president. The edition that Mr. DiGenova as  the first change with legal teams since last summer.</p><p>Next up, one tiny Southern California it is standing up in defiance to the  big and the powerful in the sanctuary state of California. It's Los  Alamitos in Orange County. It wants to opt out of California sanctuary laws  that restrict cooperation between local police and federal immigration.  They are saying in Los Alamitos that swore an oath to uphold the  Constitution and what state is asking them to do is violating that oath. </p><p>We're bringing the mayor of that town Troy Edgar to speak out after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  One tiny Southern California town now standing up in defiance  to being powerful in the state of California. Los Alamitos wants to opt out  of California sanctuary laws that restrict cooperation between local police  and federal immigration agents.</p><p>Council members in the city now say they have sworn an oath to uphold the  Constitution and that California so-called sanctuary laws undercuts that  oath as well as federal law.</p><p>Let's bring in the mayor Los Alamitos, he's Troy Edgar. Good to see you,  mayor.</p><p>TROY EDGAR, MAYOR, LOST ALAMITOS, CALIFORNIA:  Hi, Liz. How are you doing?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thanks for coming on. Can you spell out this fight and what  officials in your town are saying because we've got university professors  in California saying, you know what, you're right in the crosshairs of  lawsuits.</p><p>EDGAR:  Yes. You know, this is a small city in Southern California what  we're really trying to do is we're telling the state is, look, at this  point, you know, we are conflicted with the U.S. Constitution and Los  Alamitos we firmly believe that the U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of  the land and that the SP 54 sanctuary law is in conflict. And at this point  we're going to vote tonight to see if we will exempt ourselves from that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, we've got -- we've run on the show, mayor, sheriffs  in California who are twisted into pretzel knots trying to abide by the  Constitution the federal law and what the state is telling them to do.</p><p>What I would like you know and I think the viewer wants to have you spoken  to other mayors in California, are there other cities like yours who do not  want to be part of the sanctuary state policies?</p><p>EDGAR:  Yes, there's a lot of mayors in California that don't want to be a  part of it, but you know it's a really tough situation because in our state  lot of this legislation comes out of Sacramento just seems disconnected  that they're not attached. You know, when you're mayor of a small town  immediately your constituents tell you how they feel where they're at and,  you know, you're going to find out that evening in the grocery store  whether you're doing a good job or not.</p><p>And I think a lot of the stuff is going on Sacramento people this  constantly saying to all of us on the council what is going on.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Have you experienced crime from illegal immigrants in your  town?</p><p>EDGAR:  No, I would say that we don't have a significant amount of crime  problems with illegal immigrants. I think for us this is a constitutional  issue that we're looking at and saying look, we are consistently being held  to different standards by the state. A lot of them unfunded this is another  one where they pass a law and now they're asking us to choose between the  U.S. Constitution and the state Constitution.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>EDGAR:  And I think based on our oath, you now, many of us want to stay and  focus on the U.S. Constitution.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, we're wondering if your vote tonight will set up a  chain reaction. Which other mayors are telling you that they agree with you  and want to opt out? What are the mayors of what town?</p><p>EDGAR:  Well, you know what, I think right now I think a lot of the mayors  are going to wait and see and how this is going to go.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But do you know they found?</p><p>EDGAR:  I do. But I I want to give them an opportunity to bring this upon  themselves and I've also talked to a different staff and city attorneys at  different city specially the elected city attorneys that the definitely  have a perspective on which direction they or their city may want to go.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Mayor, we have Sheriff Margaret Mims, she's in Fresno,  California. She's been speaking out against California sanctuary laws. I'd  like your reaction to what the sheriff said. Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARGARET MIMS, SHERIFF, FRESNO COUNTY:  We need to stop vilifying our hard- working ICE agents and our federal law enforcement partners. They are doing  their jobs. Law enforcement has to enforce the law, teachers have to teach,  and preachers have to preach and we're not going to apologize any of us for  doing our jobs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So, mayor, do you hear from your local law enforcement the same  thing that the sheriff just said?</p><p>EDGAR:  You know what, I think that there is kind of two different  jurisdictions. The sheriff definitely deals with the county, Orange County  level and at L.A. County for us, but you know, the sheriff is little bit  different than the police chief. </p><p>And so, within our cities we all have police chiefs and we across the  different cities so have a lot of different types of things that are going  on. And I think tonight what we will hear --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But are your cops upset about it, are your cops upset about two  different standards they are dealing with?</p><p>EDGAR:  Now. You know what, I think at this point it's probably more the  counsel, you know, Mayor Pro Tem Kusumot has been really focused on this  and him and I together really want to kind of bring this up and have an  open discussion with the city council and start bringing stuff into this on  more formal basis.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Mayor Troy Edgar of Los Alamitos standing up in defiance  against California laws. Good to see you, mayor. Thanks you so much for  coming on.</p><p>EDGAR:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now -- you, too. It appears to be the first driverless car  fatality on a public road it involved ridesharing company Uber. It has now  stop its self driving robot car program after a woman in Tempe, Arizona was  struck and killed by one of its robots cars. </p><p>Coming up, an attorney on who could be responsible, is it Uber or is it the  software? </p><p>But first, forget about distancing themselves. Reverend Al Sharpton is now  saying we are going to do a protest in support and in defense of anti- Semite and racist Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. </p><p>We're bringing on Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz to react after  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LOUIS FARRAKHAN, LEADER, NATION OF ISLAM:  Hitler was a very great man. The  Satanic Jews. White folks are going down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FARRAKHAN:  Hear the Jews they don't like Farrakhan so they call me Hitler.  That's a good name. Hitler was a very great man.</p><p>Your country has been taken from you by the synagogue of Satan. The Satanic  Jews. White folks are going down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Black activist groups including Al Sharpton's national action  network also Black Lives Matters -- matter and the New Black Panther Party  now organizing a protest in support of and in defense of the controversial  leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan. The groups are protesting a  congressional resolution condemning Farrakhan.</p><p>With me now Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz. First of all, Alan,  professor, rather, there are some other comments made by Farrakhan. Here's  one of them. The Jews talk about never again. You cannot say never again to  God because when he puts you in the oven you're in one indeed.</p><p>He also said the Jews of control over those agency -- agency of the  government. He also said this. When a woman does not know how to cook and  the right foods to cook she's preparing death for herself, her husband and  her children.</p><p>You know, Professor, Democrats like Maxine Waters, Al Green, Keith Ellison,  they also have links to Farrakhan. What's going on here?</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL:  Well, first of all,  Farrakhan is not only an anti-Semite, he's anti-white, he's anti-woman,  he's anti-gay. He's anti everything decent in this country and when you get  bigots supporting him and people like Al Sharpton was has his own history  of anti-Semitism. </p><p>Black Lives Matter which singled out only Israel called genocide to an  apartheid country which was anti-Semitic as well. What we have in this  country as people who believe in an affirmative action program for racism  for African Americans. That if you're an African-American you can get away  with supporting anti-Semitism, anti-gay, anti-white --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But wait a minute, wait, wait, wait. Because you know, Trump is  being accused of racism but now we've got an MSNBC host Al Sharpton  defending this anti, you know, this anti-Semite, this racist anti-gay  individual. I don't understand why more people are not condemning Farrakhan  including Democrats.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, the Democrats should condemn him, the women's movement  should condemn him, gay rights movement should condemn him, everybody  should condemn him. And I don't never have understood why Al Sharpton was a  history of anti-Semitism, the history about lying and falsely accusing  people of crime should be on the major network.</p><p>If you had a white person who is equivalently racist against blacks and who  defended David Duke he would never ever get on the air on a national  network. And yet, we have affirmative action for black races and that's  just unjustified. We have zero tolerance for bigotry, racism, and anti- Semitism and under the standard at zero-tolerance are not only doesn't  Farrakhan satisfy it but neither does Sharpton, neither does Black Lives  Matter, and neither to the congressmen who were now standing in support of  a big anti-Semite.</p><p>Imagine if Republican congressmen standing in support of David Duke and  Farrakhan is much, much, much more dangerous than David Duke. Because  Farrakhan has the support of hundreds of thousands of African-Americans.  What's my source to that? My source to that is Sharpton who says that he  has massive support in the African-American community. </p><p>David Duke doesn't have any support and so we should not have a double  standard. And Democrats and all decent people should come out not only  against Farrakhan but any congressperson who supports Farrakhan.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, so let's get to one of those congressmen, professor. It's  Democrat Congressman of Illinois, he's Danny Davis. He tried to clarify his  position, he and his praise. Danny Davis has praise Farrakhan and has met  with Farrakhan.</p><p>Here's what he saying now. Quote, \"I disagree with Minister Farrakhan in  terms of white people being devils and Jewish people being Satanic. But I  also protect his right as a free individual to say and do whatever he wants  to do. I think he does outstanding things for, especially blacks who are  unsure about themselves and people who've been in prison.\"</p><p>Your reaction to that.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  People said the same thing about Adolf Hitler that he did good  things for the German people. You cannot justify this kind of bigotry by  saying that he also does some decent things. And I think it's a scandal  that the Democratic Party and liberals and the New York Times lets a black  bigots off the hook. Only a text to bigotry on the right. </p><p>Today the danger of bigotry is far greater from the hard left, from the  African-American community from the Muslim community, from many other  communities which tolerated (AUDIO GAP) bigotry than it is from the right.  Look, anti-Semitism was wrong for both the right and the left. We all  condemn it from the right, let's join together to condemn it from the left  regardless of the race of the person behind it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Professor Alan Dershowitz, we love having you on. Come back  soon, sir. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Any time. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. The robot cars are supposed to stop fatalities. But  now it appears to be the first death caused by the robot car in a public  road. Ridesharing company Uber stopping its self-driving car program after  a woman in Arizona was struck and killed by one of its robot cars last  night.</p><p>We're bringing in an attorney on what this means for the car industry and  Silicon Valley.</p><p>But first, Hillary Clinton now backtracking now her none-apologize --  apology after implying last week that women who cast a ballot who voted for  Trump for this all due to pressure from their husbands. </p><p>My all-female power panel is here to react after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS: It's not helpful at all. And in fact, my  friend Hillary Clinton is wrong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We do not do  well with white men and we don't do well with married white women. And part  of that is a -- an identification with the Republican Party and a sort of  ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son,  whoever believes you should.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Hillary Clinton putting up a lengthy 861-word non-apology on  Facebook, trying to defend and explain her controversial comments about the  Trump campaign. It's called backwards that the state that didn't vote for  her are not optimistic, diverse or dynamic, and that white women vote like  their husband. She made those comments a week and a half ago in India.</p><p>But now Hillary Clinton says this. \"I also mentioned something in passing  that's got a lot of attention.\" She's saying now that she said in passing,  \"that there is anecdotal level and some research to suggest that women are  unfortunately more swayed by men than the other way around. As much as I  hate the possibility and hate saying it, it's not that crazy when you think  about our ongoing struggle to reach the gender balance even within the same  household. </p><p>I understand how some of what I said upset people and can be  misinterpreted. I mean, meant no disrespect to any individual or group. I  want to look to the future not just anybody.\"</p><p>With me now, the Federalist, Britt McHenry, and Democrat strategist,  Danielle McLaughlin. Britt, are you satisfied what is not apology. I mean,  why is Hillary even bringing up these things, why get into it?</p><p>BRITT MCHENRY, CONTRIBUTOR, THE FEDERALIST:  Absolutely not. Hillary  Clinton is like that relative, that strange relative that comes to family  gatherings and you just know that she's just going to say something  patronizing and offensive which she did.</p><p>Donald Trump 52 percent of white women votes, so she's right about that, 61  percent of white women without college degree. So in her non-apology she is  trying to say that those white women anyone watching this program right now  don't have gender equality in their household. It's ridiculous. And she  can't get out of her own way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  And that they can't think for themselves --</p><p>MCHENRY:  Exactly.</p><p>MACDONALD:  -- they just follow what their husbands are doing. OK.  Danielle, Democrat Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin speaking out against  Clinton's comment. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DURBIN:  It's not helpful at all. And in fact, my friend Hillary Clinton is  wrong. Thirty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump had voted  for President Obama. Why? The same people who look for change with  President Obama thought wasn't enough for us, their personal lives were  concerned and they supported Donald Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  How come more Democrats, Danielle are not joining Dick Durbin  and condemning comments like Hillary made?</p><p>DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I think because Dick  Durbin is right. You know, I don't think that what she said on that face --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But how come more Democrats -- how come more Democrats are not  stepping out and saying you know what, Hillary, you're wrong?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Well, I think plenty have in all honesty and they don't  because they probably wants to draw much attention to it. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Who?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  But I will give the person credit for apologizing.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Who besides Dick Durbin has stepped up?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  There have been a number of Democrats, there have been a  number of people on television who have said this as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Who?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I can name for you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Go ahead.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I mean, this is clearly something that you would never say and  shouldn't even say. But you know what? I give her credit for apologizing.  We have a president who has insulted many number of people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  It wasn't an apology. Have you read it? Have you read it?  Danielle, have you read it? It was a non-apology.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  And she said very much that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  She didn't say she was sorry anywhere in that Facebook post.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Well, I mean, she said I mean I meant no disrespect. She did  not meant to hurt people or harm people that as far more that Donald Trump  has ever said when he talked about John McCain or Judge Curiel --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Understood. But we're talking about -- understood. I get what  you're saying. H has said an extraordinary inflammatory things.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We get that and we've covered it here on the show.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  We're talking about Hillary right now. Britt, she's no apology  there.</p><p>MCHENRY:  There's no apology. And if Democrats want success they need more  moderate Democrats like we saw with Conor Lamb who won in a congressional  district that won by 20 points for Trump in Trump's favor in 2016. That's  going to send their message not that I particularly wanted to go over the  Democrats instead of this identity politics and just offensive rhetoric  from Hillary Clinton.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Britt and Danielle, thank you so much for coming on. I really  appreciate it.</p><p>MCHENRY:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news. Washington Post reporting that President Trump  is preparing by this Friday to hit China with tariffs on $60 billion worth  of goods that would double the what was earlier thought to be 30 billion,  now it's going to 60 billion. It could be 100 different types of products  hit with tariffs by this Friday.</p><p>This amid the escalation of trade tensions is going to four anonymous  senior administration officials. We're staying on that story for you.</p><p>Now it appears to be the first robot car death on a public road.  Ridesharing company Uber stopping its self-driving car program after a  woman in Arizona was struck and killed by one of its robot vehicle.</p><p>Attorney Emily Compagno on whether this is basically upends the entire  robot car industry. That's after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Cars are supposed to stop traffic fatalities but now a  bombshell. The first driverless robot car death in a public road evolving  ridesharing company Uber. It's now suspending its robot car program after  woman was struck and killed by one of its robot cars at 10 o'clock last  night in Tempe, Arizona.</p><p>Attorney Emily Compagno, I mean, how worried are you about robot cars  killing people? We thought they were supposed to stop traffic fatalities.</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  Right. And it's hard because in this field which  is noble one death is one death too many but in the larger picture we see  over -- we see up to 50 million disabled and injury results from car  crashes a year and millions death, right, it's the highest -- it's the  highest cause of death in the country.</p><p>But again, the argument for autonomous vehicle in part is that it's  supposed to be safer because it removes that human element. But in  situations like this is it possible that the human element the ability to  be malleable and to react to things that that ultimately what would render  an autonomous vehicle safer.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  So it kind of begs a larger question, right? But what we're  seeing this play out is going to be in a regulatory field. The reason that  Arizona has so many tech companies playing in that field now it's because  they've said they taking an accommodating approach to not regulate the  autonomous riding field there.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. You know, Emily, I hear what you're saying. We hear  so many glowing statements about how great robot cars are going to be. But  you know what's not being discussed, Emily, is this. Robot cars have been  found to not properly read highway signs if those highway signs have been  slightly altered. They don't know how to read it. And some of these were  about cars don't even network and talk to other robot cars.</p><p>That's the big deal for Apple. Apple can have its own Apple closed system  in these cars. So the thing is, Emily, we still haven't figured out who is  going to be liable for robot car death. Is it companies like Uber or the  software?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right. Well, in every case it's going to be a different analysis  as to who or what is responsible, right? So we saw in a large accident  earlier that didn't involve a fatality that human driver that was in the  autonomous vehicle he was ultimately held responsible because of that. </p><p>In another major crash it was the other driver of the car that T-bone the  autonomous driving vehicle. And I think the larger answer to your question  is that this is why test phase is so important. This is why we're not ready  to hit the road yet. This is why kind of a phase physical area for these  cars to be tested is so crucial.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right. Bingo.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Because otherwise of course now we'll see more fatalities.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You just nailed it. That's the thing, Emily. Because this is  like a -- we're just at the beginning stages of this and now we have a  woman killed by a robot car, right? I mean, this is a big deal.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes. And note that just next month or in April, California has  maintained that they will now allow test writing of these autonomous  vehicles without the human driver inside, right? Up until now it's just  been Arizona. So that's something that we're going to see now a huge test  zone there, that's a physical fight at the Silicon Valley, right. So we'll  see a lot more.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Emily, we need you back on. We love having you on to break it  all down and drill into this. You're terrific. Please come back on the  show. Good to see you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  More after the break. Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news on the Facebook data mining breach. Cambridge  Analytica they're accused of abusing the Facebook data of potentially  millions of Facebook users. Now Great Britain wants to seek a warrant to  get into the computer servers of that data mining firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>We're going to stay on that story for you tomorrow.

This industry darling led the market up last year and through  much of this year quite a different take today. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Cambridge Analytica was able to  can collect the data from 50 million people's profiles without permission.  In the U.S., in Europe, in the U.K. are calling for investigations Facebook  is in the crosshairs. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Social media companies are trading  lower today. I guess in sympathy. Twitter, Snap, Google all lower.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  People are starting to grow tired of social media. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Facebook basically can't be escape. This is something  that as far --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Everybody in their mother now saying we are going to  investigate.</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Facebook privacy hitting markets  really hard today. Facebook having its worst day in five and half years.  The Dow also are down nearly 500 points at session lows at tech is drag  down in sympathy. The NASDAQ slid nearly 2 percent. Facebook dragging tech  stock lower.</p><p>This, after reports that the personal Facebook data of an estimated 50  million people were harvested without their permission for political ad.  You will not believe what we found that Facebook has on you. One hundred  separate bits of information. We're going to show you what Facebook is  collecting about you. E.U. also threatening a whopping 3 percent tax on  tech company sales as well.</p><p>And this now breaking. The Connecticut Attorney General's office is  initiating an inquiry into Facebook data policy after that report. </p><p>Also tonight, could Andrew McCabe, the fired former FBI deputy director  incriminate the fired FBI James Comey, not just release to the media but  for also lying to Congress. We got the sound and the debate coming up.  We're on it. </p><p>And a tiny California town now defiantly fighting back against California  sanctuary policy, saying it will instead follow their sworn oath to defend  the Constitution and uphold immigration laws. It's the City of Los Alamitos  it's voted tonight to not be a sanctuary city. It faces the threat of  lawsuits in California condemnation as well. The mayor of that town here to  talk about the fight. </p><p>Plus, driverless robot cars, now they were supposed to reduce traffic  fatalities by eliminating human error. But now a robot car from ridesharing  company Uber has killed a pedestrian in Arizona. It happened last night. So  what will happen to the robot revolution? That's now in the works of a slew  of auto companies like Tesla, G.M. Ford and also Silicon Valley. We're  bringing an expert to weigh in.</p><p>Tonight, an all-guest lineup. Economist Ben Stein, former special assistant  to President Trump, Marc Lotter, legal eagle Harvard Law professor Alan  Dershowitz, the Federalist Britt McHenry, all here all tonight. </p><p>Politics, money, we got you covered. I'm Elizabeth McDonald. Risk and  Reward starts right now. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  I wish I could tell you that we're going  to be able to stop all interference but that just wouldn't be realistic.  There will always be bad actors in the world and we can't prevent all  governments from all interference. But we can make it harder. We can make  it much harder and that's what we're going to focus on doing. </p><p>We won't catch everyone immediately but we can make it harder to try to  determine (Ph).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  The Dow down 335 points closing to that 24,610. The NASDAQ  taking hits, that was down as well. Facebook stocks ending more than 6  percent down or 12 points lower after suspending a political analysis firm  Cambridge Analytics after reports that the research firm harvested personal  Facebook data on 270,000 Facebook users without their permission. </p><p>Now you can't Facebook friends and family. The breach may affect an  estimated 50 million people. It's being Facebook Equifax breach. The  research firm also reportedly told Facebook it did delete the user info  when it did not. Pretty scary stuff. </p><p>There's actually a really long list of things that Facebook knows about  you. We counted a hundred different things. For example, where you live,  your age, your education, income, net worth, your wedding anniversary  birthday whether you recently moved. </p><p>If you're in a long-distance relationship, whether you are conservative or  liberal, whether you like would you're likely to buy your next car, how  many workers your company has, whether you carry a credit card balance. The  time of year your household shops and the most types of vacations you take,  the pets you have, and so on, and so on, and so on, more and more and more. </p><p>But first, Lori Rothman on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on the  market drop after reports of this privacy breach at Facebook. You know,  Lori, Facebook faces a threat of federal fines. The tech sector also  dropping after the E.U. threaten to slap U.S. tech companies with a 3  percent tax of sales and revenues. Wow, Lori.</p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  One, two punch against the tech  sector today and that just drag down the broad market. We had the Dow  closing down 335 points today, believe it or not that's well, well more  than a hundred points off the session low for the Dow. Down now negative  temperature territory for 2018. </p><p>The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ didn't fare much better. The NASDAQ was the worst in  the benchmark three but it's still holding up for the year. There you see  on your screen the NASDAQ fell 137 points blame Facebook. </p><p>But here is the thing that's got everyone here on Wall Street thinking. If  Facebook is misusing customer data, user data, well, all of these tech  companies use our data. They mine our data. We plug our data in. How do  they get it, what do they do with it when they have it. And really how do  they protect every day users. </p><p>So, a lot of the big tech company CEO's have been called upon by both  Democrats and Republicans to testify about that. And then you mention this  potential tax 3 percent by the E.U. on the tech company revenue. </p><p>So the good times may be over for tech. That was the thinking and the  concern today on Wall Street, obviously nothing for sure on that front but  any news of that degree again. Again, a one-two punch. The Facebook news  and then the tax. My goodness. You're going to have some trouble. </p><p>And then of course you can talk about the ongoing trade and tariff  controversy as well. So we did have a broad base rally, it wasn't just  technology. All 10 S&amp;P sectors were in the red today. </p><p>We do want to bring you up-to-date on some mergers, merger Monday. Well,  actually this one in particular is going nowhere. I'm talking about AT&amp;T  and Time Warner shares both down in excess of 1 percent. AT&amp;T tried today  to get a judge to throw out evidence. It seems to show its $85 billion  acquisition of Time Warner is bad for consumers and competition. </p><p>Now the Justice Department as you know did file a lawsuit back in November  to stop this combination opening arguments in this case are still scheduled  to begin on Wednesday. We're following it. Liz, back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Lori. Thank you so much.</p><p>ROTHMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now this firm that's denying claims of abusing and have taking  without consent the data of millions of Facebook users. That's called  Cambridge Analytics. This as Facebook hired a digital forensic firm to do  an audit of Cambridge Analytica systems. </p><p>Politicians now pressuring Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg for answers on what's  going on. The word is Mark Zuckerberg may have to testify before Congress.  Remember he has political leanings. </p><p>Gerri Willis has more. Gerri?</p><p>WILLIS:  Hi, Liz. That's right. You know, just the latest on the latest on  this incredibly fast moving story. Here's what Facebook had to say about  hiring a digital forensics firm. Listen to this. \"We hired a digital  forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg to conduct a comprehensive audit, they say,  of Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica has agreed to comply and afford  the firm complete access to their servers and systems.\" </p><p>So that's a move forward here I supposed for Facebook. The other thing  that's going on and this again, this is just out moments ago. Connecticut  is launching, the attorney general there, a probe into what's gone on with  Facebook. So that's something new. Reaction was swift and then you have on  two continents with both the E.U. and the Massachusetts Attorney General  Maura Healey launching probes. Yet Facebook says the situation is unlike  data breaches, breaches that have plagued American companies. </p><p>For years now, here's what Facebook said. The claim that this is data  breach is completely false. People knowingly provided their information. No  systems were infiltrated. No passwords or sensitive pieces of information.  We're still and or hack. At issues that hundreds of thousands of a Facebook  users were paid to download to take a personality test and agreed to have  their data collected, they agreed to it. The app was called this is your  digital life. </p><p>Facebook later change its policy and didn't allow this kind of scraping to  be done. But Cambridge had retained access to the data as late as 2015.  Cambridge now says no info from the company that provided the data was used  in the 2016 election. Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook  terms of service.</p><p>And back to you, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Wow, what a story, Gerri. Thank you so much for coming on.  We really appreciate it. </p><p>Now remember Mark Zuckerberg's New Year's resolution. He vowed to fix  Facebook and to correct persistent problems that had dogged the networks.  Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Now we're going to explore ways that we can share more  information about anyone attempting to interfere with elections. We are  working proactively to strengthen the democratic process. Beyond pushing  back against threats we will also create more services to protect our  community while engaging in political discourse.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's bring in the economist and author of \"The Capitalist  Code\" Ben Stein. You know, Ben, this is kind of making people unsettled and  uncomfortable. It's astonishing how much information Facebook has on you  and also your kids. </p><p>BEN STEIN, ECONOMIST:  It is astonishing in a way but it doesn't really  affect Facebook as an investment. I mean, Facebook is still a very powerful  company filling an enormously large niche and void in the American life.  Facebook in a way has become an almost spiritual guide to human  companionship and human fellowship. And almost spiritual guide and antidote  to human loneliness. </p><p>I don't think that one day's notes about somebody misusing data or maybe  not using data are going to change that. I can still consider stocks a  fantastically important part of anyone's portfolio.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, I know what you mean that people could connect with their  family and their friends. But the fact remains that this looks like  Facebook's equivalent of the Equifax breach.</p><p>If info is going to help political campaigns the allegation was the Trump  campaign benefit. Also a former Obama campaign staffer candidly admits,  Ben, that Facebook let the Obama campaign quote, \"improperly access  Facebook user dater -- data. The staffer, her name is Carol Davidson. She  said this. \"Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole  social graph, but they did not stop us once they realized that what we were  doing. They came to office in the days after the election recruiting and  were very candid that they let us do things they would not have allowed  someone else to do because they were on our side.\" </p><p>That was back in 2012. I mean, that's six years ago, Ben. Now Facebook is  returning itself as sort of discomforted by all thing, all this. But you  know, that was Obama's campaign. We don't want to get too political about  this. But what is going on with Silicon Valley companies letting people  access data. </p><p>STEIN:  Well, what's going on is that it's going to, it's bound to happen.  The internet is not a closed system. The internet is a system that people  can get into, a very clever people can get into even if it's tightly sealed  up. We know that the Russians and the Chinese are able to get into it even  if we think it's sealed tightly as a drum.</p><p>What I want to go after is, is it still a good investment. And I say it's  still is a very good investment. And the fact that people are upset about  their data being accessed is too bad. And it's upsetting. And we don't want  it to happen. And we want people's privacy to be respected. But we also  want to be realistic about this. How is it possibly going to affect their  earnings unless there's absolutely stupendous fine. I think --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. But you know, they're so, you know, they have so much  information, Ben, they could pretty much accurately predict what kind of  car you are going to buy, what kind of house you're going to buy, and where  your kids are going to college. </p><p>STEIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm not sure Americans realize how much Facebook knows about  them. </p><p>STEIN:  I'm not sure they do either, but I'm going to what the show is  about, what you are wonderfully about in Fox Business is about which is  making money. And that is I don't think anything we've learned in the last  several days is going to affect whether or not Facebook is going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Ben, stay on that for a second. Hang on one second.  Because some Americans want Facebook fined, hit with penalties for its role  in the Russian meddling during the election. </p><p>Remember, you and I were talking about this, Ben, how Russian internet  trolls loaded Facebook up with fake news. Even fake Facebook Russia-backed  political rallies. Should Facebook be fined for that?</p><p>STEIN:  Maybe they should be and maybe they shouldn't be. I don't think the  Russia Trump collusion has improved to that any meaningful effect on the  campaign at all on way or the other. And I think the more they push that  the more they find that there's nothing at the end of the string. You can  only push the string so far. </p><p>I'm not worried about that Russia Trump collusion because I don't it ever  happen. If it did happened, it happen as such a minor scale that hardly  matters at all. What I'm concerned about is this, is it still a good  business to be in a business of providing communication for hundreds of  millions and billions of people all around the world who would otherwise be  sitting on lonely twiddling their thumbs. </p><p>And I think they're still a very, very good business. And the fact that  they can access all of this information about all kinds of people in  America or in Mexico or in Cuba or probably not Cuba, or anywhere tells us  that this is still a very, very strong investment. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>STEIN:  This stick on me that it's just an absolutely a house on fire in  terms of power and I don't think there's going to be any stopping short of  abolishing it. I don't anyone dares to abolish them. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Ben Stein, good to see you. Thank you so much for  coming on. </p><p>STEIN:  It's an honor as always.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Same here. It appears to be the first driverless, well, there  was a driver but this is on automatic mode. It was on robot mode. A robot  car killed somebody in Tempe, Arizona. Ridesharing company Uber that it was  this car it now stopped its self-driving car program. An Arizona woman  struck and killed by one of the robot vehicles. It happened last night  around 10 o'clock.</p><p>Coming up, we're bringing in an expert who is saying who is responsible.  We're going to get to the bottom on who's to blame and who could face  liability. Is it the car company Uber or is it the software.</p><p>Also this. One tiny Southern California town now sitting up in defiance to  the big and powerful in the sanctuary state. It's the town of Los Alamitos  in Orange County. It wants to opt out of California's sanctuary laws. The  mayor of that town here to talk about it. </p><p>But first, could Andrew McCabe the fired former FBI deputy director, could  he incriminate the fired FBI former Director James Comey, not just release  to the media but for also for lying to Congress. We got the sound, we're  going to drill into this debate, coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ANGUS KING (I), MAINE: It just seem mean-spirited to come down on a  guy within 48 hours of his scheduled retirement. It was clearly rushed and  I think there are questions about that and whether the administration was  putting pressure on the Justice Department to take this action. </p><p>SEN. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA:  It was a horrible day for democracy. To have  firings like this happening at the top from the president and the attorney  general does not speak well for what's going on. </p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA:  I don't like it happened. He should have  been allowed to finish through the weekend.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA:  You know, his firing may be justified,  there's no way for us to know at this point. But though it may have been  justified it can also be tainted.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  A number of congressmen and senators up and arms of the firing  of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. It was a recommendation from the  FBI's own Office of Professional Responsibility they said yes, fire him.</p><p>Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy reminding everyone it was McCabe's fault.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Andy McCabe was undercut his  credibility all by himself. he didn't any help doing that and I thought it  richly ironic that he is lamenting that those are attacking the FBI when he  himself does the exact same thing. It was the FBI who said he made an  unauthorized disclosure and then a lied about it. </p><p>That wasn't President Trump, it wasn't me, it wasn't the crazy House  Republicans. It was his own fellow FBI agents the said he leaked and then  lied about it. So if he's got credibility issues he need look no further  than himself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Joining me now former special assistant to Present Trump, Marc  Lotter. Marc, what's your take on McCabe's firing?</p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think it sounds it was  completely justified. You had an inspector general report the Office of  Professional Responsibility and then the senior career official at the  department all made these recommendations so that's what the attorney  general acted on. </p><p>And I think what we're seeing right now is a case of many other Democrats  and some of their friends in the mainstream media are trying to have it  both ways. When someone pleads guilty to lying to investigators that are on  the Republican side it's breaking news and it's proof that something is  amiss except when someone is accused of doing the same thing to federal  officials on the other side will then they're just trying to play \"Cry Me a  River,\" so they can't have it both ways.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. People go to prison for misleading the FBI. I mean, McCabe  is accused of misleading Justice Department investigating -- in  investigators about his leaking of sensitive information to Wall Street  Journal reporter about the FBI's investigation of pay to play at the  Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. </p><p>McCabe now says, Marc, that he had authority to quote share that  information with the media and Director James Comey knew about that. But  Marc, the issue is really covering up the leak, right? So is there anything  wrong with the way he was fired?</p><p>LOTTER:  Well, obviously the inspector general report which we have not  seen yet does suggest that there were some sort of improprieties in the way  he was conducting his business. And when you follow that on with the Office  of professional Responsibility and the senior career official in the  department all making me this conclusion then something there is amiss and  it may just be lying or misleading investigators or maybe something more to  it.</p><p>But we got to be honest here. We can't -- we cannot, as a country, tolerate  any kind of impropriety when it comes to members of law enforcement at any  level. We place our trust in them to act honorably within the bounds of  their oath. If they don't, we need to get to that right away.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, former FBI Director James Comey is coming out with  his book right at the same time this I.G. report is coming up from the  Justice Department. But here's the problem for James Comey. The firing of  Andrew McCabe may cause problems for James Comey.</p><p>Remember when Comey said this under oath last year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source  in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the  Clinton investigation?</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  Never.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Question 21 relatively related. Have you ever authorize  someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source is news reports about the  Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?</p><p>COMEY:  No.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. So Comey said under oath he never was a source of the media  nor authorize any FBI officials to talk to the media. But look at this. An  Andrew McCabe's statement after getting fired he wrote this. \"The I.G.  investigation is focused on information I chose to share with a reporter  who my public affairs officer and legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I  was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a  secret place, it took place, and others including the director, meaning  James Comey were aware of the interaction with the reporter.</p><p>So Marc, did you catch that. The director meaning Comey was aware. So what  -- how does that stuck up with Comey saying what he said to Congress last  year about he didn't allow -- he never allow any of this.</p><p>LOTTER:  Clearly they've got contradicting stories and I think this is why  so many Republicans are saying we need another special investigator to look  at the way the FBI's conducted itself in a very small group at the highest  levels. We cannot have these inconsistencies if partisanship if things were  taking place in the Clinton investigation that was not aboveboard, that was  not inconsistent -- that was not consistent with their oath then when you  look into it.</p><p>And right now as you pointed out we see it happening where they are  contradicting each other and who said what and when.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Marc Lotter, great to see you. Thanks for coming on.</p><p>LOTTER:  Thanks, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news. Fox News confirming that the president is hiring  a new legal defense team to official to help in dealing with the special  counsel's Russia probe. Former Bush U.S. attorney Joseph DiGenova will join  President Trump's legal team. He has previously suggested that the Justice  Department and FBI framed the president. The edition that Mr. DiGenova as  the first change with legal teams since last summer.</p><p>Next up, one tiny Southern California it is standing up in defiance to the  big and the powerful in the sanctuary state of California. It's Los  Alamitos in Orange County. It wants to opt out of California sanctuary laws  that restrict cooperation between local police and federal immigration.  They are saying in Los Alamitos that swore an oath to uphold the  Constitution and what state is asking them to do is violating that oath. </p><p>We're bringing the mayor of that town Troy Edgar to speak out after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  One tiny Southern California town now standing up in defiance  to being powerful in the state of California. Los Alamitos wants to opt out  of California sanctuary laws that restrict cooperation between local police  and federal immigration agents.</p><p>Council members in the city now say they have sworn an oath to uphold the  Constitution and that California so-called sanctuary laws undercuts that  oath as well as federal law.</p><p>Let's bring in the mayor Los Alamitos, he's Troy Edgar. Good to see you,  mayor.</p><p>TROY EDGAR, MAYOR, LOST ALAMITOS, CALIFORNIA:  Hi, Liz. How are you doing?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thanks for coming on. Can you spell out this fight and what  officials in your town are saying because we've got university professors  in California saying, you know what, you're right in the crosshairs of  lawsuits.</p><p>EDGAR:  Yes. You know, this is a small city in Southern California what  we're really trying to do is we're telling the state is, look, at this  point, you know, we are conflicted with the U.S. Constitution and Los  Alamitos we firmly believe that the U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of  the land and that the SP 54 sanctuary law is in conflict. And at this point  we're going to vote tonight to see if we will exempt ourselves from that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, we've got -- we've run on the show, mayor, sheriffs  in California who are twisted into pretzel knots trying to abide by the  Constitution the federal law and what the state is telling them to do.</p><p>What I would like you know and I think the viewer wants to have you spoken  to other mayors in California, are there other cities like yours who do not  want to be part of the sanctuary state policies?</p><p>EDGAR:  Yes, there's a lot of mayors in California that don't want to be a  part of it, but you know it's a really tough situation because in our state  lot of this legislation comes out of Sacramento just seems disconnected  that they're not attached. You know, when you're mayor of a small town  immediately your constituents tell you how they feel where they're at and,  you know, you're going to find out that evening in the grocery store  whether you're doing a good job or not.</p><p>And I think a lot of the stuff is going on Sacramento people this  constantly saying to all of us on the council what is going on.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Have you experienced crime from illegal immigrants in your  town?</p><p>EDGAR:  No, I would say that we don't have a significant amount of crime  problems with illegal immigrants. I think for us this is a constitutional  issue that we're looking at and saying look, we are consistently being held  to different standards by the state. A lot of them unfunded this is another  one where they pass a law and now they're asking us to choose between the  U.S. Constitution and the state Constitution.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>EDGAR:  And I think based on our oath, you now, many of us want to stay and  focus on the U.S. Constitution.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, we're wondering if your vote tonight will set up a  chain reaction. Which other mayors are telling you that they agree with you  and want to opt out? What are the mayors of what town?</p><p>EDGAR:  Well, you know what, I think right now I think a lot of the mayors  are going to wait and see and how this is going to go.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But do you know they found?</p><p>EDGAR:  I do. But I I want to give them an opportunity to bring this upon  themselves and I've also talked to a different staff and city attorneys at  different city specially the elected city attorneys that the definitely  have a perspective on which direction they or their city may want to go.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Mayor, we have Sheriff Margaret Mims, she's in Fresno,  California. She's been speaking out against California sanctuary laws. I'd  like your reaction to what the sheriff said. Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARGARET MIMS, SHERIFF, FRESNO COUNTY:  We need to stop vilifying our hard- working ICE agents and our federal law enforcement partners. They are doing  their jobs. Law enforcement has to enforce the law, teachers have to teach,  and preachers have to preach and we're not going to apologize any of us for  doing our jobs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So, mayor, do you hear from your local law enforcement the same  thing that the sheriff just said?</p><p>EDGAR:  You know what, I think that there is kind of two different  jurisdictions. The sheriff definitely deals with the county, Orange County  level and at L.A. County for us, but you know, the sheriff is little bit  different than the police chief. </p><p>And so, within our cities we all have police chiefs and we across the  different cities so have a lot of different types of things that are going  on. And I think tonight what we will hear --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But are your cops upset about it, are your cops upset about two  different standards they are dealing with?</p><p>EDGAR:  Now. You know what, I think at this point it's probably more the  counsel, you know, Mayor Pro Tem Kusumot has been really focused on this  and him and I together really want to kind of bring this up and have an  open discussion with the city council and start bringing stuff into this on  more formal basis.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Mayor Troy Edgar of Los Alamitos standing up in defiance  against California laws. Good to see you, mayor. Thanks you so much for  coming on.</p><p>EDGAR:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now -- you, too. It appears to be the first driverless car  fatality on a public road it involved ridesharing company Uber. It has now  stop its self driving robot car program after a woman in Tempe, Arizona was  struck and killed by one of its robots cars. </p><p>Coming up, an attorney on who could be responsible, is it Uber or is it the  software? </p><p>But first, forget about distancing themselves. Reverend Al Sharpton is now  saying we are going to do a protest in support and in defense of anti- Semite and racist Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. </p><p>We're bringing on Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz to react after  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LOUIS FARRAKHAN, LEADER, NATION OF ISLAM:  Hitler was a very great man. The  Satanic Jews. White folks are going down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FARRAKHAN:  Hear the Jews they don't like Farrakhan so they call me Hitler.  That's a good name. Hitler was a very great man.</p><p>Your country has been taken from you by the synagogue of Satan. The Satanic  Jews. White folks are going down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Black activist groups including Al Sharpton's national action  network also Black Lives Matters -- matter and the New Black Panther Party  now organizing a protest in support of and in defense of the controversial  leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan. The groups are protesting a  congressional resolution condemning Farrakhan.</p><p>With me now Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz. First of all, Alan,  professor, rather, there are some other comments made by Farrakhan. Here's  one of them. The Jews talk about never again. You cannot say never again to  God because when he puts you in the oven you're in one indeed.</p><p>He also said the Jews of control over those agency -- agency of the  government. He also said this. When a woman does not know how to cook and  the right foods to cook she's preparing death for herself, her husband and  her children.</p><p>You know, Professor, Democrats like Maxine Waters, Al Green, Keith Ellison,  they also have links to Farrakhan. What's going on here?</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL:  Well, first of all,  Farrakhan is not only an anti-Semite, he's anti-white, he's anti-woman,  he's anti-gay. He's anti everything decent in this country and when you get  bigots supporting him and people like Al Sharpton was has his own history  of anti-Semitism. </p><p>Black Lives Matter which singled out only Israel called genocide to an  apartheid country which was anti-Semitic as well. What we have in this  country as people who believe in an affirmative action program for racism  for African Americans. That if you're an African-American you can get away  with supporting anti-Semitism, anti-gay, anti-white --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But wait a minute, wait, wait, wait. Because you know, Trump is  being accused of racism but now we've got an MSNBC host Al Sharpton  defending this anti, you know, this anti-Semite, this racist anti-gay  individual. I don't understand why more people are not condemning Farrakhan  including Democrats.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, the Democrats should condemn him, the women's movement  should condemn him, gay rights movement should condemn him, everybody  should condemn him. And I don't never have understood why Al Sharpton was a  history of anti-Semitism, the history about lying and falsely accusing  people of crime should be on the major network.</p><p>If you had a white person who is equivalently racist against blacks and who  defended David Duke he would never ever get on the air on a national  network. And yet, we have affirmative action for black races and that's  just unjustified. We have zero tolerance for bigotry, racism, and anti- Semitism and under the standard at zero-tolerance are not only doesn't  Farrakhan satisfy it but neither does Sharpton, neither does Black Lives  Matter, and neither to the congressmen who were now standing in support of  a big anti-Semite.</p><p>Imagine if Republican congressmen standing in support of David Duke and  Farrakhan is much, much, much more dangerous than David Duke. Because  Farrakhan has the support of hundreds of thousands of African-Americans.  What's my source to that? My source to that is Sharpton who says that he  has massive support in the African-American community. </p><p>David Duke doesn't have any support and so we should not have a double  standard. And Democrats and all decent people should come out not only  against Farrakhan but any congressperson who supports Farrakhan.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, so let's get to one of those congressmen, professor. It's  Democrat Congressman of Illinois, he's Danny Davis. He tried to clarify his  position, he and his praise. Danny Davis has praise Farrakhan and has met  with Farrakhan.</p><p>Here's what he saying now. Quote, \"I disagree with Minister Farrakhan in  terms of white people being devils and Jewish people being Satanic. But I  also protect his right as a free individual to say and do whatever he wants  to do. I think he does outstanding things for, especially blacks who are  unsure about themselves and people who've been in prison.\"</p><p>Your reaction to that.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  People said the same thing about Adolf Hitler that he did good  things for the German people. You cannot justify this kind of bigotry by  saying that he also does some decent things. And I think it's a scandal  that the Democratic Party and liberals and the New York Times lets a black  bigots off the hook. Only a text to bigotry on the right. </p><p>Today the danger of bigotry is far greater from the hard left, from the  African-American community from the Muslim community, from many other  communities which tolerated (AUDIO GAP) bigotry than it is from the right.  Look, anti-Semitism was wrong for both the right and the left. We all  condemn it from the right, let's join together to condemn it from the left  regardless of the race of the person behind it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Professor Alan Dershowitz, we love having you on. Come back  soon, sir. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Any time. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. The robot cars are supposed to stop fatalities. But  now it appears to be the first death caused by the robot car in a public  road. Ridesharing company Uber stopping its self-driving car program after  a woman in Arizona was struck and killed by one of its robot cars last  night.</p><p>We're bringing in an attorney on what this means for the car industry and  Silicon Valley.</p><p>But first, Hillary Clinton now backtracking now her none-apologize --  apology after implying last week that women who cast a ballot who voted for  Trump for this all due to pressure from their husbands. </p><p>My all-female power panel is here to react after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS: It's not helpful at all. And in fact, my  friend Hillary Clinton is wrong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We do not do  well with white men and we don't do well with married white women. And part  of that is a -- an identification with the Republican Party and a sort of  ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son,  whoever believes you should.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Hillary Clinton putting up a lengthy 861-word non-apology on  Facebook, trying to defend and explain her controversial comments about the  Trump campaign. It's called backwards that the state that didn't vote for  her are not optimistic, diverse or dynamic, and that white women vote like  their husband. She made those comments a week and a half ago in India.</p><p>But now Hillary Clinton says this. \"I also mentioned something in passing  that's got a lot of attention.\" She's saying now that she said in passing,  \"that there is anecdotal level and some research to suggest that women are  unfortunately more swayed by men than the other way around. As much as I  hate the possibility and hate saying it, it's not that crazy when you think  about our ongoing struggle to reach the gender balance even within the same  household. </p><p>I understand how some of what I said upset people and can be  misinterpreted. I mean, meant no disrespect to any individual or group. I  want to look to the future not just anybody.\"</p><p>With me now, the Federalist, Britt McHenry, and Democrat strategist,  Danielle McLaughlin. Britt, are you satisfied what is not apology. I mean,  why is Hillary even bringing up these things, why get into it?</p><p>BRITT MCHENRY, CONTRIBUTOR, THE FEDERALIST:  Absolutely not. Hillary  Clinton is like that relative, that strange relative that comes to family  gatherings and you just know that she's just going to say something  patronizing and offensive which she did.</p><p>Donald Trump 52 percent of white women votes, so she's right about that, 61  percent of white women without college degree. So in her non-apology she is  trying to say that those white women anyone watching this program right now  don't have gender equality in their household. It's ridiculous. And she  can't get out of her own way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  And that they can't think for themselves --</p><p>MCHENRY:  Exactly.</p><p>MACDONALD:  -- they just follow what their husbands are doing. OK.  Danielle, Democrat Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin speaking out against  Clinton's comment. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DURBIN:  It's not helpful at all. And in fact, my friend Hillary Clinton is  wrong. Thirty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump had voted  for President Obama. Why? The same people who look for change with  President Obama thought wasn't enough for us, their personal lives were  concerned and they supported Donald Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  How come more Democrats, Danielle are not joining Dick Durbin  and condemning comments like Hillary made?</p><p>DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I think because Dick  Durbin is right. You know, I don't think that what she said on that face --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But how come more Democrats -- how come more Democrats are not  stepping out and saying you know what, Hillary, you're wrong?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Well, I think plenty have in all honesty and they don't  because they probably wants to draw much attention to it. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Who?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  But I will give the person credit for apologizing.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Who besides Dick Durbin has stepped up?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  There have been a number of Democrats, there have been a  number of people on television who have said this as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Who?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I can name for you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Go ahead.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I mean, this is clearly something that you would never say and  shouldn't even say. But you know what? I give her credit for apologizing.  We have a president who has insulted many number of people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  It wasn't an apology. Have you read it? Have you read it?  Danielle, have you read it? It was a non-apology.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  And she said very much that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  She didn't say she was sorry anywhere in that Facebook post.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Well, I mean, she said I mean I meant no disrespect. She did  not meant to hurt people or harm people that as far more that Donald Trump  has ever said when he talked about John McCain or Judge Curiel --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Understood. But we're talking about -- understood. I get what  you're saying. H has said an extraordinary inflammatory things.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We get that and we've covered it here on the show.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  We're talking about Hillary right now. Britt, she's no apology  there.</p><p>MCHENRY:  There's no apology. And if Democrats want success they need more  moderate Democrats like we saw with Conor Lamb who won in a congressional  district that won by 20 points for Trump in Trump's favor in 2016. That's  going to send their message not that I particularly wanted to go over the  Democrats instead of this identity politics and just offensive rhetoric  from Hillary Clinton.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Britt and Danielle, thank you so much for coming on. I really  appreciate it.</p><p>MCHENRY:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news. Washington Post reporting that President Trump  is preparing by this Friday to hit China with tariffs on $60 billion worth  of goods that would double the what was earlier thought to be 30 billion,  now it's going to 60 billion. It could be 100 different types of products  hit with tariffs by this Friday.</p><p>This amid the escalation of trade tensions is going to four anonymous  senior administration officials. We're staying on that story for you.</p><p>Now it appears to be the first robot car death on a public road.  Ridesharing company Uber stopping its self-driving car program after a  woman in Arizona was struck and killed by one of its robot vehicle.</p><p>Attorney Emily Compagno on whether this is basically upends the entire  robot car industry. That's after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Cars are supposed to stop traffic fatalities but now a  bombshell. The first driverless robot car death in a public road evolving  ridesharing company Uber. It's now suspending its robot car program after  woman was struck and killed by one of its robot cars at 10 o'clock last  night in Tempe, Arizona.</p><p>Attorney Emily Compagno, I mean, how worried are you about robot cars  killing people? We thought they were supposed to stop traffic fatalities.</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  Right. And it's hard because in this field which  is noble one death is one death too many but in the larger picture we see  over -- we see up to 50 million disabled and injury results from car  crashes a year and millions death, right, it's the highest -- it's the  highest cause of death in the country.</p><p>But again, the argument for autonomous vehicle in part is that it's  supposed to be safer because it removes that human element. But in  situations like this is it possible that the human element the ability to  be malleable and to react to things that that ultimately what would render  an autonomous vehicle safer.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  So it kind of begs a larger question, right? But what we're  seeing this play out is going to be in a regulatory field. The reason that  Arizona has so many tech companies playing in that field now it's because  they've said they taking an accommodating approach to not regulate the  autonomous riding field there.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. You know, Emily, I hear what you're saying. We hear  so many glowing statements about how great robot cars are going to be. But  you know what's not being discussed, Emily, is this. Robot cars have been  found to not properly read highway signs if those highway signs have been  slightly altered. They don't know how to read it. And some of these were  about cars don't even network and talk to other robot cars.</p><p>That's the big deal for Apple. Apple can have its own Apple closed system  in these cars. So the thing is, Emily, we still haven't figured out who is  going to be liable for robot car death. Is it companies like Uber or the  software?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right. Well, in every case it's going to be a different analysis  as to who or what is responsible, right? So we saw in a large accident  earlier that didn't involve a fatality that human driver that was in the  autonomous vehicle he was ultimately held responsible because of that. </p><p>In another major crash it was the other driver of the car that T-bone the  autonomous driving vehicle. And I think the larger answer to your question  is that this is why test phase is so important. This is why we're not ready  to hit the road yet. This is why kind of a phase physical area for these  cars to be tested is so crucial.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right. Bingo.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Because otherwise of course now we'll see more fatalities.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You just nailed it. That's the thing, Emily. Because this is  like a -- we're just at the beginning stages of this and now we have a  woman killed by a robot car, right? I mean, this is a big deal.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes. And note that just next month or in April, California has  maintained that they will now allow test writing of these autonomous  vehicles without the human driver inside, right? Up until now it's just  been Arizona. So that's something that we're going to see now a huge test  zone there, that's a physical fight at the Silicon Valley, right. So we'll  see a lot more.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Emily, we need you back on. We love having you on to break it  all down and drill into this. You're terrific. Please come back on the  show. Good to see you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  More after the break. Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news on the Facebook data mining breach.

This industry darling led the market up last year and through  much of this year quite a different take today. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Cambridge Analytica was able to  can collect the data from 50 million people's profiles without permission.  In the U.S., in Europe, in the U.K. are calling for investigations Facebook  is in the crosshairs. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Social media companies are trading  lower today. I guess in sympathy. Twitter, Snap, Google all lower.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  People are starting to grow tired of social media. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, yes.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Facebook basically can't be escape. This is something  that as far --</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Everybody in their mother now saying we are going to  investigate.</p><p> ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Facebook privacy hitting markets  really hard today. Facebook having its worst day in five and half years.  The Dow also are down nearly 500 points at session lows at tech is drag  down in sympathy. The NASDAQ slid nearly 2 percent. Facebook dragging tech  stock lower.</p><p> This, after reports that the personal Facebook data of an estimated 50  million people were harvested without their permission for political ad.  You will not believe what we found that Facebook has on you. One hundred  separate bits of information. We're going to show you what Facebook is  collecting about you. E.U. also threatening a whopping 3 percent tax on  tech company sales as well.</p><p> And this now breaking. The Connecticut Attorney General's office is  initiating an inquiry into Facebook data policy after that report. </p><p> Also tonight, could Andrew McCabe, the fired former FBI deputy director  incriminate the fired FBI James Comey, not just release to the media but  for also lying to Congress. We got the sound and the debate coming up.  We're on it. </p><p> And a tiny California town now defiantly fighting back against California  sanctuary policy, saying it will instead follow their sworn oath to defend  the Constitution and uphold immigration laws. It's the City of Los Alamitos  it's voted tonight to not be a sanctuary city. It faces the threat of  lawsuits in California condemnation as well. The mayor of that town here to  talk about the fight. </p><p> Plus, driverless robot cars, now they were supposed to reduce traffic  fatalities by eliminating human error. But now a robot car from ridesharing  company Uber has killed a pedestrian in Arizona. It happened last night. So  what will happen to the robot revolution? That's now in the works of a slew  of auto companies like Tesla, G.M. Ford and also Silicon Valley. We're  bringing an expert to weigh in.</p><p> Tonight, an all-guest lineup. Economist Ben Stein, former special assistant  to President Trump, Marc Lotter, legal eagle Harvard Law professor Alan  Dershowitz, the Federalist Britt McHenry, all here all tonight. </p><p> Politics, money, we got you covered. I'm Elizabeth McDonald. Risk and  Reward starts right now. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  I wish I could tell you that we're going  to be able to stop all interference but that just wouldn't be realistic.  There will always be bad actors in the world and we can't prevent all  governments from all interference. But we can make it harder. We can make  it much harder and that's what we're going to focus on doing. </p><p> We won't catch everyone immediately but we can make it harder to try to  determine (Ph).</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MACDONALD:  The Dow down 335 points closing to that 24,610. The NASDAQ  taking hits, that was down as well. Facebook stocks ending more than 6  percent down or 12 points lower after suspending a political analysis firm  Cambridge Analytics after reports that the research firm harvested personal  Facebook data on 270,000 Facebook users without their permission. </p><p> Now you can't Facebook friends and family. The breach may affect an  estimated 50 million people. It's being Facebook Equifax breach. The  research firm also reportedly told Facebook it did delete the user info  when it did not. Pretty scary stuff. </p><p> There's actually a really long list of things that Facebook knows about  you. We counted a hundred different things. For example, where you live,  your age, your education, income, net worth, your wedding anniversary  birthday whether you recently moved. </p><p> If you're in a long-distance relationship, whether you are conservative or  liberal, whether you like would you're likely to buy your next car, how  many workers your company has, whether you carry a credit card balance. The  time of year your household shops and the most types of vacations you take,  the pets you have, and so on, and so on, and so on, more and more and more. </p><p> But first, Lori Rothman on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on the  market drop after reports of this privacy breach at Facebook. You know,  Lori, Facebook faces a threat of federal fines. The tech sector also  dropping after the E.U. threaten to slap U.S. tech companies with a 3  percent tax of sales and revenues. Wow, Lori.</p><p> LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  One, two punch against the tech  sector today and that just drag down the broad market. We had the Dow  closing down 335 points today, believe it or not that's well, well more  than a hundred points off the session low for the Dow. Down now negative  temperature territory for 2018. </p><p> The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ didn't fare much better. The NASDAQ was the worst in  the benchmark three but it's still holding up for the year. There you see  on your screen the NASDAQ fell 137 points blame Facebook. </p><p> But here is the thing that's got everyone here on Wall Street thinking. If  Facebook is misusing customer data, user data, well, all of these tech  companies use our data. They mine our data. We plug our data in. How do  they get it, what do they do with it when they have it. And really how do  they protect every day users. </p><p> So, a lot of the big tech company CEO's have been called upon by both  Democrats and Republicans to testify about that. And then you mention this  potential tax 3 percent by the E.U. on the tech company revenue. </p><p> So the good times may be over for tech. That was the thinking and the  concern today on Wall Street, obviously nothing for sure on that front but  any news of that degree again. Again, a one-two punch. The Facebook news  and then the tax. My goodness. You're going to have some trouble. </p><p> And then of course you can talk about the ongoing trade and tariff  controversy as well. So we did have a broad base rally, it wasn't just  technology. All 10 S&amp;P sectors were in the red today. </p><p> We do want to bring you up-to-date on some mergers, merger Monday. Well,  actually this one in particular is going nowhere. I'm talking about AT&amp;T  and Time Warner shares both down in excess of 1 percent. AT&amp;T tried today  to get a judge to throw out evidence. It seems to show its $85 billion  acquisition of Time Warner is bad for consumers and competition. </p><p> Now the Justice Department as you know did file a lawsuit back in November  to stop this combination opening arguments in this case are still scheduled  to begin on Wednesday. We're following it. Liz, back to you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Lori. Thank you so much.</p><p> ROTHMAN:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Now this firm that's denying claims of abusing and have taking  without consent the data of millions of Facebook users. That's called  Cambridge Analytics. This as Facebook hired a digital forensic firm to do  an audit of Cambridge Analytica systems. </p><p> Politicians now pressuring Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg for answers on what's  going on. The word is Mark Zuckerberg may have to testify before Congress.  Remember he has political leanings. </p><p> Gerri Willis has more. Gerri?</p><p> WILLIS:  Hi, Liz. That's right. You know, just the latest on the latest on  this incredibly fast moving story. Here's what Facebook had to say about  hiring a digital forensics firm. Listen to this. \"We hired a digital  forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg to conduct a comprehensive audit, they say,  of Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica has agreed to comply and afford  the firm complete access to their servers and systems.\" </p><p> So that's a move forward here I supposed for Facebook. The other thing  that's going on and this again, this is just out moments ago. Connecticut  is launching, the attorney general there, a probe into what's gone on with  Facebook. So that's something new. Reaction was swift and then you have on  two continents with both the E.U. and the Massachusetts Attorney General  Maura Healey launching probes. Yet Facebook says the situation is unlike  data breaches, breaches that have plagued American companies. </p><p> For years now, here's what Facebook said. The claim that this is data  breach is completely false. People knowingly provided their information. No  systems were infiltrated. No passwords or sensitive pieces of information.  We're still and or hack. At issues that hundreds of thousands of a Facebook  users were paid to download to take a personality test and agreed to have  their data collected, they agreed to it. The app was called this is your  digital life. </p><p> Facebook later change its policy and didn't allow this kind of scraping to  be done. But Cambridge had retained access to the data as late as 2015.  Cambridge now says no info from the company that provided the data was used  in the 2016 election. Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook  terms of service.</p><p> And back to you, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. Wow, what a story, Gerri. Thank you so much for coming on.  We really appreciate it. </p><p> Now remember Mark Zuckerberg's New Year's resolution. He vowed to fix  Facebook and to correct persistent problems that had dogged the networks.  Let's take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Now we're going to explore ways that we can share more  information about anyone attempting to interfere with elections. We are  working proactively to strengthen the democratic process. Beyond pushing  back against threats we will also create more services to protect our  community while engaging in political discourse.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's bring in the economist and author of \"The Capitalist  Code\" Ben Stein. You know, Ben, this is kind of making people unsettled and  uncomfortable. It's astonishing how much information Facebook has on you  and also your kids. </p><p> BEN STEIN, ECONOMIST:  It is astonishing in a way but it doesn't really  affect Facebook as an investment. I mean, Facebook is still a very powerful  company filling an enormously large niche and void in the American life.  Facebook in a way has become an almost spiritual guide to human  companionship and human fellowship. And almost spiritual guide and antidote  to human loneliness. </p><p> I don't think that one day's notes about somebody misusing data or maybe  not using data are going to change that. I can still consider stocks a  fantastically important part of anyone's portfolio.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, I know what you mean that people could connect with their  family and their friends. But the fact remains that this looks like  Facebook's equivalent of the Equifax breach.</p><p> If info is going to help political campaigns the allegation was the Trump  campaign benefit. Also a former Obama campaign staffer candidly admits,  Ben, that Facebook let the Obama campaign quote, \"improperly access  Facebook user dater -- data. The staffer, her name is Carol Davidson. She  said this. \"Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole  social graph, but they did not stop us once they realized that what we were  doing. They came to office in the days after the election recruiting and  were very candid that they let us do things they would not have allowed  someone else to do because they were on our side.\" </p><p> That was back in 2012. I mean, that's six years ago, Ben. Now Facebook is  returning itself as sort of discomforted by all thing, all this. But you  know, that was Obama's campaign. We don't want to get too political about  this. But what is going on with Silicon Valley companies letting people  access data. </p><p> STEIN:  Well, what's going on is that it's going to, it's bound to happen.  The internet is not a closed system. The internet is a system that people  can get into, a very clever people can get into even if it's tightly sealed  up. We know that the Russians and the Chinese are able to get into it even  if we think it's sealed tightly as a drum.</p><p> What I want to go after is, is it still a good investment. And I say it's  still is a very good investment. And the fact that people are upset about  their data being accessed is too bad. And it's upsetting. And we don't want  it to happen. And we want people's privacy to be respected. But we also  want to be realistic about this. How is it possibly going to affect their  earnings unless there's absolutely stupendous fine. I think --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. But you know, they're so, you know, they have so much  information, Ben, they could pretty much accurately predict what kind of  car you are going to buy, what kind of house you're going to buy, and where  your kids are going to college. </p><p> STEIN:  Absolutely.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'm not sure Americans realize how much Facebook knows about  them. </p><p> STEIN:  I'm not sure they do either, but I'm going to what the show is  about, what you are wonderfully about in Fox Business is about which is  making money. And that is I don't think anything we've learned in the last  several days is going to affect whether or not Facebook is going to --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Ben, stay on that for a second. Hang on one second.  Because some Americans want Facebook fined, hit with penalties for its role  in the Russian meddling during the election. </p><p> Remember, you and I were talking about this, Ben, how Russian internet  trolls loaded Facebook up with fake news. Even fake Facebook Russia-backed  political rallies. Should Facebook be fined for that?</p><p> STEIN:  Maybe they should be and maybe they shouldn't be. I don't think the  Russia Trump collusion has improved to that any meaningful effect on the  campaign at all on way or the other. And I think the more they push that  the more they find that there's nothing at the end of the string. You can  only push the string so far. </p><p> I'm not worried about that Russia Trump collusion because I don't it ever  happen. If it did happened, it happen as such a minor scale that hardly  matters at all. What I'm concerned about is this, is it still a good  business to be in a business of providing communication for hundreds of  millions and billions of people all around the world who would otherwise be  sitting on lonely twiddling their thumbs. </p><p> And I think they're still a very, very good business. And the fact that  they can access all of this information about all kinds of people in  America or in Mexico or in Cuba or probably not Cuba, or anywhere tells us  that this is still a very, very strong investment. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> STEIN:  This stick on me that it's just an absolutely a house on fire in  terms of power and I don't think there's going to be any stopping short of  abolishing it. I don't anyone dares to abolish them. </p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Ben Stein, good to see you. Thank you so much for  coming on. </p><p> STEIN:  It's an honor as always.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Same here. It appears to be the first driverless, well, there  was a driver but this is on automatic mode. It was on robot mode. A robot  car killed somebody in Tempe, Arizona. Ridesharing company Uber that it was  this car it now stopped its self-driving car program. An Arizona woman  struck and killed by one of the robot vehicles. It happened last night  around 10 o'clock.</p><p> Coming up, we're bringing in an expert who is saying who is responsible.  We're going to get to the bottom on who's to blame and who could face  liability. Is it the car company Uber or is it the software.</p><p> Also this. One tiny Southern California town now sitting up in defiance to  the big and powerful in the sanctuary state. It's the town of Los Alamitos  in Orange County. It wants to opt out of California's sanctuary laws. The  mayor of that town here to talk about it. </p><p> But first, could Andrew McCabe the fired former FBI deputy director, could  he incriminate the fired FBI former Director James Comey, not just release  to the media but for also for lying to Congress. We got the sound, we're  going to drill into this debate, coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. ANGUS KING (I), MAINE: It just seem mean-spirited to come down on a  guy within 48 hours of his scheduled retirement. It was clearly rushed and  I think there are questions about that and whether the administration was  putting pressure on the Justice Department to take this action. </p><p> SEN. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA:  It was a horrible day for democracy. To have  firings like this happening at the top from the president and the attorney  general does not speak well for what's going on. </p><p> SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA:  I don't like it happened. He should have  been allowed to finish through the weekend.</p><p> REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA:  You know, his firing may be justified,  there's no way for us to know at this point. But though it may have been  justified it can also be tainted.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  A number of congressmen and senators up and arms of the firing  of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. It was a recommendation from the  FBI's own Office of Professional Responsibility they said yes, fire him.</p><p> Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy reminding everyone it was McCabe's fault.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Andy McCabe was undercut his  credibility all by himself. he didn't any help doing that and I thought it  richly ironic that he is lamenting that those are attacking the FBI when he  himself does the exact same thing. It was the FBI who said he made an  unauthorized disclosure and then a lied about it. </p><p> That wasn't President Trump, it wasn't me, it wasn't the crazy House  Republicans. It was his own fellow FBI agents the said he leaked and then  lied about it. So if he's got credibility issues he need look no further  than himself.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Joining me now former special assistant to Present Trump, Marc  Lotter. Marc, what's your take on McCabe's firing?</p><p> MARC LOTTER, FORMER ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think it sounds it was  completely justified. You had an inspector general report the Office of  Professional Responsibility and then the senior career official at the  department all made these recommendations so that's what the attorney  general acted on. </p><p> And I think what we're seeing right now is a case of many other Democrats  and some of their friends in the mainstream media are trying to have it  both ways. When someone pleads guilty to lying to investigators that are on  the Republican side it's breaking news and it's proof that something is  amiss except when someone is accused of doing the same thing to federal  officials on the other side will then they're just trying to play \"Cry Me a  River,\" so they can't have it both ways.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. People go to prison for misleading the FBI. I mean, McCabe  is accused of misleading Justice Department investigating -- in  investigators about his leaking of sensitive information to Wall Street  Journal reporter about the FBI's investigation of pay to play at the  Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. </p><p> McCabe now says, Marc, that he had authority to quote share that  information with the media and Director James Comey knew about that. But  Marc, the issue is really covering up the leak, right? So is there anything  wrong with the way he was fired?</p><p> LOTTER:  Well, obviously the inspector general report which we have not  seen yet does suggest that there were some sort of improprieties in the way  he was conducting his business. And when you follow that on with the Office  of professional Responsibility and the senior career official in the  department all making me this conclusion then something there is amiss and  it may just be lying or misleading investigators or maybe something more to  it.</p><p> But we got to be honest here. We can't -- we cannot, as a country, tolerate  any kind of impropriety when it comes to members of law enforcement at any  level. We place our trust in them to act honorably within the bounds of  their oath. If they don't, we need to get to that right away.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, former FBI Director James Comey is coming out with  his book right at the same time this I.G. report is coming up from the  Justice Department. But here's the problem for James Comey. The firing of  Andrew McCabe may cause problems for James Comey.</p><p> Remember when Comey said this under oath last year.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source  in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the  Clinton investigation?</p><p> JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  Never.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Question 21 relatively related. Have you ever authorize  someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source is news reports about the  Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?</p><p> COMEY:  No.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. So Comey said under oath he never was a source of the media  nor authorize any FBI officials to talk to the media. But look at this. An  Andrew McCabe's statement after getting fired he wrote this. \"The I.G.  investigation is focused on information I chose to share with a reporter  who my public affairs officer and legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I  was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a  secret place, it took place, and others including the director, meaning  James Comey were aware of the interaction with the reporter.</p><p> So Marc, did you catch that. The director meaning Comey was aware. So what  -- how does that stuck up with Comey saying what he said to Congress last  year about he didn't allow -- he never allow any of this.</p><p> LOTTER:  Clearly they've got contradicting stories and I think this is why  so many Republicans are saying we need another special investigator to look  at the way the FBI's conducted itself in a very small group at the highest  levels. We cannot have these inconsistencies if partisanship if things were  taking place in the Clinton investigation that was not aboveboard, that was  not inconsistent -- that was not consistent with their oath then when you  look into it.</p><p> And right now as you pointed out we see it happening where they are  contradicting each other and who said what and when.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Marc Lotter, great to see you. Thanks for coming on.</p><p> LOTTER:  Thanks, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Breaking news. Fox News confirming that the president is hiring  a new legal defense team to official to help in dealing with the special  counsel's Russia probe. Former Bush U.S. attorney Joseph DiGenova will join  President Trump's legal team. He has previously suggested that the Justice  Department and FBI framed the president. The edition that Mr. DiGenova as  the first change with legal teams since last summer.</p><p> Next up, one tiny Southern California it is standing up in defiance to the  big and the powerful in the sanctuary state of California. It's Los  Alamitos in Orange County. It wants to opt out of California sanctuary laws  that restrict cooperation between local police and federal immigration.  They are saying in Los Alamitos that swore an oath to uphold the  Constitution and what state is asking them to do is violating that oath. </p><p> We're bringing the mayor of that town Troy Edgar to speak out after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  One tiny Southern California town now standing up in defiance  to being powerful in the state of California. Los Alamitos wants to opt out  of California sanctuary laws that restrict cooperation between local police  and federal immigration agents.</p><p> Council members in the city now say they have sworn an oath to uphold the  Constitution and that California so-called sanctuary laws undercuts that  oath as well as federal law.</p><p> Let's bring in the mayor Los Alamitos, he's Troy Edgar. Good to see you,  mayor.</p><p> TROY EDGAR, MAYOR, LOST ALAMITOS, CALIFORNIA:  Hi, Liz. How are you doing?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Thanks for coming on. Can you spell out this fight and what  officials in your town are saying because we've got university professors  in California saying, you know what, you're right in the crosshairs of  lawsuits.</p><p> EDGAR:  Yes. You know, this is a small city in Southern California what  we're really trying to do is we're telling the state is, look, at this  point, you know, we are conflicted with the U.S. Constitution and Los  Alamitos we firmly believe that the U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of  the land and that the SP 54 sanctuary law is in conflict. And at this point  we're going to vote tonight to see if we will exempt ourselves from that.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, we've got -- we've run on the show, mayor, sheriffs  in California who are twisted into pretzel knots trying to abide by the  Constitution the federal law and what the state is telling them to do.</p><p> What I would like you know and I think the viewer wants to have you spoken  to other mayors in California, are there other cities like yours who do not  want to be part of the sanctuary state policies?</p><p> EDGAR:  Yes, there's a lot of mayors in California that don't want to be a  part of it, but you know it's a really tough situation because in our state  lot of this legislation comes out of Sacramento just seems disconnected  that they're not attached. You know, when you're mayor of a small town  immediately your constituents tell you how they feel where they're at and,  you know, you're going to find out that evening in the grocery store  whether you're doing a good job or not.</p><p> And I think a lot of the stuff is going on Sacramento people this  constantly saying to all of us on the council what is going on.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Have you experienced crime from illegal immigrants in your  town?</p><p> EDGAR:  No, I would say that we don't have a significant amount of crime  problems with illegal immigrants. I think for us this is a constitutional  issue that we're looking at and saying look, we are consistently being held  to different standards by the state. A lot of them unfunded this is another  one where they pass a law and now they're asking us to choose between the  U.S. Constitution and the state Constitution.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> EDGAR:  And I think based on our oath, you now, many of us want to stay and  focus on the U.S. Constitution.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, we're wondering if your vote tonight will set up a  chain reaction. Which other mayors are telling you that they agree with you  and want to opt out? What are the mayors of what town?</p><p> EDGAR:  Well, you know what, I think right now I think a lot of the mayors  are going to wait and see and how this is going to go.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But do you know they found?</p><p> EDGAR:  I do. But I I want to give them an opportunity to bring this upon  themselves and I've also talked to a different staff and city attorneys at  different city specially the elected city attorneys that the definitely  have a perspective on which direction they or their city may want to go.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Mayor, we have Sheriff Margaret Mims, she's in Fresno,  California. She's been speaking out against California sanctuary laws. I'd  like your reaction to what the sheriff said. Let's take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARGARET MIMS, SHERIFF, FRESNO COUNTY:  We need to stop vilifying our hard- working ICE agents and our federal law enforcement partners. They are doing  their jobs. Law enforcement has to enforce the law, teachers have to teach,  and preachers have to preach and we're not going to apologize any of us for  doing our jobs.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  So, mayor, do you hear from your local law enforcement the same  thing that the sheriff just said?</p><p> EDGAR:  You know what, I think that there is kind of two different  jurisdictions. The sheriff definitely deals with the county, Orange County  level and at L.A. County for us, but you know, the sheriff is little bit  different than the police chief. </p><p> And so, within our cities we all have police chiefs and we across the  different cities so have a lot of different types of things that are going  on. And I think tonight what we will hear --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But are your cops upset about it, are your cops upset about two  different standards they are dealing with?</p><p> EDGAR:  Now. You know what, I think at this point it's probably more the  counsel, you know, Mayor Pro Tem Kusumot has been really focused on this  and him and I together really want to kind of bring this up and have an  open discussion with the city council and start bringing stuff into this on  more formal basis.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Mayor Troy Edgar of Los Alamitos standing up in defiance  against California laws. Good to see you, mayor. Thanks you so much for  coming on.</p><p> EDGAR:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Now -- you, too. It appears to be the first driverless car  fatality on a public road it involved ridesharing company Uber. It has now  stop its self driving robot car program after a woman in Tempe, Arizona was  struck and killed by one of its robots cars. </p><p> Coming up, an attorney on who could be responsible, is it Uber or is it the  software? </p><p> But first, forget about distancing themselves. Reverend Al Sharpton is now  saying we are going to do a protest in support and in defense of anti- Semite and racist Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. </p><p> We're bringing on Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz to react after  this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LOUIS FARRAKHAN, LEADER, NATION OF ISLAM:  Hitler was a very great man. The  Satanic Jews. White folks are going down.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> FARRAKHAN:  Hear the Jews they don't like Farrakhan so they call me Hitler.  That's a good name. Hitler was a very great man.</p><p> Your country has been taken from you by the synagogue of Satan. The Satanic  Jews. White folks are going down.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Black activist groups including Al Sharpton's national action  network also Black Lives Matters -- matter and the New Black Panther Party  now organizing a protest in support of and in defense of the controversial  leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan. The groups are protesting a  congressional resolution condemning Farrakhan.</p><p> With me now Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz. First of all, Alan,  professor, rather, there are some other comments made by Farrakhan. Here's  one of them. The Jews talk about never again. You cannot say never again to  God because when he puts you in the oven you're in one indeed.</p><p> He also said the Jews of control over those agency -- agency of the  government. He also said this. When a woman does not know how to cook and  the right foods to cook she's preparing death for herself, her husband and  her children.</p><p> You know, Professor, Democrats like Maxine Waters, Al Green, Keith Ellison,  they also have links to Farrakhan. What's going on here?</p><p> ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL:  Well, first of all,  Farrakhan is not only an anti-Semite, he's anti-white, he's anti-woman,  he's anti-gay. He's anti everything decent in this country and when you get  bigots supporting him and people like Al Sharpton was has his own history  of anti-Semitism. </p><p> Black Lives Matter which singled out only Israel called genocide to an  apartheid country which was anti-Semitic as well. What we have in this  country as people who believe in an affirmative action program for racism  for African Americans. That if you're an African-American you can get away  with supporting anti-Semitism, anti-gay, anti-white --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But wait a minute, wait, wait, wait. Because you know, Trump is  being accused of racism but now we've got an MSNBC host Al Sharpton  defending this anti, you know, this anti-Semite, this racist anti-gay  individual. I don't understand why more people are not condemning Farrakhan  including Democrats.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Well, the Democrats should condemn him, the women's movement  should condemn him, gay rights movement should condemn him, everybody  should condemn him. And I don't never have understood why Al Sharpton was a  history of anti-Semitism, the history about lying and falsely accusing  people of crime should be on the major network.</p><p> If you had a white person who is equivalently racist against blacks and who  defended David Duke he would never ever get on the air on a national  network. And yet, we have affirmative action for black races and that's  just unjustified. We have zero tolerance for bigotry, racism, and anti- Semitism and under the standard at zero-tolerance are not only doesn't  Farrakhan satisfy it but neither does Sharpton, neither does Black Lives  Matter, and neither to the congressmen who were now standing in support of  a big anti-Semite.</p><p> Imagine if Republican congressmen standing in support of David Duke and  Farrakhan is much, much, much more dangerous than David Duke. Because  Farrakhan has the support of hundreds of thousands of African-Americans.  What's my source to that? My source to that is Sharpton who says that he  has massive support in the African-American community. </p><p> David Duke doesn't have any support and so we should not have a double  standard. And Democrats and all decent people should come out not only  against Farrakhan but any congressperson who supports Farrakhan.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, so let's get to one of those congressmen, professor. It's  Democrat Congressman of Illinois, he's Danny Davis. He tried to clarify his  position, he and his praise. Danny Davis has praise Farrakhan and has met  with Farrakhan.</p><p> Here's what he saying now. Quote, \"I disagree with Minister Farrakhan in  terms of white people being devils and Jewish people being Satanic. But I  also protect his right as a free individual to say and do whatever he wants  to do. I think he does outstanding things for, especially blacks who are  unsure about themselves and people who've been in prison.\"</p><p> Your reaction to that.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  People said the same thing about Adolf Hitler that he did good  things for the German people. You cannot justify this kind of bigotry by  saying that he also does some decent things. And I think it's a scandal  that the Democratic Party and liberals and the New York Times lets a black  bigots off the hook. Only a text to bigotry on the right. </p><p> Today the danger of bigotry is far greater from the hard left, from the  African-American community from the Muslim community, from many other  communities which tolerated (AUDIO GAP) bigotry than it is from the right.  Look, anti-Semitism was wrong for both the right and the left. We all  condemn it from the right, let's join together to condemn it from the left  regardless of the race of the person behind it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Professor Alan Dershowitz, we love having you on. Come back  soon, sir. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Any time. Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. The robot cars are supposed to stop fatalities. But  now it appears to be the first death caused by the robot car in a public  road. Ridesharing company Uber stopping its self-driving car program after  a woman in Arizona was struck and killed by one of its robot cars last  night.</p><p> We're bringing in an attorney on what this means for the car industry and  Silicon Valley.</p><p> But first, Hillary Clinton now backtracking now her none-apologize --  apology after implying last week that women who cast a ballot who voted for  Trump for this all due to pressure from their husbands. </p><p> My all-female power panel is here to react after this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS: It's not helpful at all. And in fact, my  friend Hillary Clinton is wrong.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We do not do  well with white men and we don't do well with married white women. And part  of that is a -- an identification with the Republican Party and a sort of  ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son,  whoever believes you should.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Hillary Clinton putting up a lengthy 861-word non-apology on  Facebook, trying to defend and explain her controversial comments about the  Trump campaign. It's called backwards that the state that didn't vote for  her are not optimistic, diverse or dynamic, and that white women vote like  their husband. She made those comments a week and a half ago in India.</p><p> But now Hillary Clinton says this. \"I also mentioned something in passing  that's got a lot of attention.\" She's saying now that she said in passing,  \"that there is anecdotal level and some research to suggest that women are  unfortunately more swayed by men than the other way around. As much as I  hate the possibility and hate saying it, it's not that crazy when you think  about our ongoing struggle to reach the gender balance even within the same  household. </p><p> I understand how some of what I said upset people and can be  misinterpreted. I mean, meant no disrespect to any individual or group. I  want to look to the future not just anybody.\"</p><p> With me now, the Federalist, Britt McHenry, and Democrat strategist,  Danielle McLaughlin. Britt, are you satisfied what is not apology. I mean,  why is Hillary even bringing up these things, why get into it?</p><p> BRITT MCHENRY, CONTRIBUTOR, THE FEDERALIST:  Absolutely not. Hillary  Clinton is like that relative, that strange relative that comes to family  gatherings and you just know that she's just going to say something  patronizing and offensive which she did.</p><p> Donald Trump 52 percent of white women votes, so she's right about that, 61  percent of white women without college degree. So in her non-apology she is  trying to say that those white women anyone watching this program right now  don't have gender equality in their household. It's ridiculous. And she  can't get out of her own way.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  And that they can't think for themselves --</p><p> MCHENRY:  Exactly.</p><p> MACDONALD:  -- they just follow what their husbands are doing. OK.  Danielle, Democrat Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin speaking out against  Clinton's comment. Let's listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DURBIN:  It's not helpful at all. And in fact, my friend Hillary Clinton is  wrong. Thirty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump had voted  for President Obama. Why? The same people who look for change with  President Obama thought wasn't enough for us, their personal lives were  concerned and they supported Donald Trump.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  How come more Democrats, Danielle are not joining Dick Durbin  and condemning comments like Hillary made?</p><p> DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I think because Dick  Durbin is right. You know, I don't think that what she said on that face --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But how come more Democrats -- how come more Democrats are not  stepping out and saying you know what, Hillary, you're wrong?</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  Well, I think plenty have in all honesty and they don't  because they probably wants to draw much attention to it. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Who?</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  But I will give the person credit for apologizing.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Who besides Dick Durbin has stepped up?</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  There have been a number of Democrats, there have been a  number of people on television who have said this as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Who?</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  I can name for you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Go ahead.</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  I mean, this is clearly something that you would never say and  shouldn't even say. But you know what? I give her credit for apologizing.  We have a president who has insulted many number of people.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  It wasn't an apology. Have you read it? Have you read it?  Danielle, have you read it? It was a non-apology.</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  And she said very much that --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  She didn't say she was sorry anywhere in that Facebook post.</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  Well, I mean, she said I mean I meant no disrespect. She did  not meant to hurt people or harm people that as far more that Donald Trump  has ever said when he talked about John McCain or Judge Curiel --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Understood. But we're talking about -- understood. I get what  you're saying. H has said an extraordinary inflammatory things.</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We get that and we've covered it here on the show.</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  I know --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  We're talking about Hillary right now. Britt, she's no apology  there.</p><p> MCHENRY:  There's no apology. And if Democrats want success they need more  moderate Democrats like we saw with Conor Lamb who won in a congressional  district that won by 20 points for Trump in Trump's favor in 2016. That's  going to send their message not that I particularly wanted to go over the  Democrats instead of this identity politics and just offensive rhetoric  from Hillary Clinton.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Britt and Danielle, thank you so much for coming on. I really  appreciate it.</p><p> MCHENRY:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Breaking news. Washington Post reporting that President Trump  is preparing by this Friday to hit China with tariffs on $60 billion worth  of goods that would double the what was earlier thought to be 30 billion,  now it's going to 60 billion. It could be 100 different types of products  hit with tariffs by this Friday.</p><p> This amid the escalation of trade tensions is going to four anonymous  senior administration officials. We're staying on that story for you.</p><p> Now it appears to be the first robot car death on a public road.  Ridesharing company Uber stopping its self-driving car program after a  woman in Arizona was struck and killed by one of its robot vehicle.</p><p> Attorney Emily Compagno on whether this is basically upends the entire  robot car industry. That's after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Cars are supposed to stop traffic fatalities but now a  bombshell. The first driverless robot car death in a public road evolving  ridesharing company Uber. It's now suspending its robot car program after  woman was struck and killed by one of its robot cars at 10 o'clock last  night in Tempe, Arizona.</p><p> Attorney Emily Compagno, I mean, how worried are you about robot cars  killing people? We thought they were supposed to stop traffic fatalities.</p><p> EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  Right. And it's hard because in this field which  is noble one death is one death too many but in the larger picture we see  over -- we see up to 50 million disabled and injury results from car  crashes a year and millions death, right, it's the highest -- it's the  highest cause of death in the country.</p><p> But again, the argument for autonomous vehicle in part is that it's  supposed to be safer because it removes that human element. But in  situations like this is it possible that the human element the ability to  be malleable and to react to things that that ultimately what would render  an autonomous vehicle safer.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> COMPAGNO:  So it kind of begs a larger question, right? But what we're  seeing this play out is going to be in a regulatory field. The reason that  Arizona has so many tech companies playing in that field now it's because  they've said they taking an accommodating approach to not regulate the  autonomous riding field there.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. You know, Emily, I hear what you're saying. We hear  so many glowing statements about how great robot cars are going to be. But  you know what's not being discussed, Emily, is this. Robot cars have been  found to not properly read highway signs if those highway signs have been  slightly altered. They don't know how to read it. And some of these were  about cars don't even network and talk to other robot cars.</p><p> That's the big deal for Apple. Apple can have its own Apple closed system  in these cars. So the thing is, Emily, we still haven't figured out who is  going to be liable for robot car death. Is it companies like Uber or the  software?</p><p> COMPAGNO:  Right. Well, in every case it's going to be a different analysis  as to who or what is responsible, right? So we saw in a large accident  earlier that didn't involve a fatality that human driver that was in the  autonomous vehicle he was ultimately held responsible because of that. </p><p> In another major crash it was the other driver of the car that T-bone the  autonomous driving vehicle. And I think the larger answer to your question  is that this is why test phase is so important. This is why we're not ready  to hit the road yet. This is why kind of a phase physical area for these  cars to be tested is so crucial.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right. Bingo.</p><p> COMPAGNO:  Because otherwise of course now we'll see more fatalities.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You just nailed it. That's the thing, Emily. Because this is  like a -- we're just at the beginning stages of this and now we have a  woman killed by a robot car, right? I mean, this is a big deal.</p><p> COMPAGNO:  Yes. And note that just next month or in April, California has  maintained that they will now allow test writing of these autonomous  vehicles without the human driver inside, right? Up until now it's just  been Arizona. So that's something that we're going to see now a huge test  zone there, that's a physical fight at the Silicon Valley, right. So we'll  see a lot more.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Emily, we need you back on. We love having you on to break it  all down and drill into this. You're terrific. Please come back on the  show. Good to see you.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  More after the break. Don't go away.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Breaking news on the Facebook data mining breach. Cambridge  Analytica they're accused of abusing the Facebook data of potentially  millions of Facebook users. Now Great Britain wants to seek a warrant to  get into the computer servers of that data mining firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p> We're going to stay on that story for you tomorrow. Mondays are big night  on Fox Business. Tune to two new episodes of Strange Inheritance tonight at  9 p.m. Eastern Time. </p><p> Thank you so much for watching.

This industry darling led the market up last year and through  much of this year quite a different take today. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Cambridge Analytica was able to  can collect the data from 50 million people's profiles without permission.  In the U.S., in Europe, in the U.K. are calling for investigations Facebook  is in the crosshairs. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Social media companies are trading  lower today. I guess in sympathy. Twitter, Snap, Google all lower.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  People are starting to grow tired of social media. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Facebook basically can't be escape. This is something  that as far --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Everybody in their mother now saying we are going to  investigate.</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Facebook privacy hitting markets  really hard today. Facebook having its worst day in five and half years.  The Dow also are down nearly 500 points at session lows at tech is drag  down in sympathy. The NASDAQ slid nearly 2 percent. Facebook dragging tech  stock lower.</p><p>This, after reports that the personal Facebook data of an estimated 50  million people were harvested without their permission for political ad.  You will not believe what we found that Facebook has on you. One hundred  separate bits of information. We're going to show you what Facebook is  collecting about you. E.U. also threatening a whopping 3 percent tax on  tech company sales as well.</p><p>And this now breaking. The Connecticut Attorney General's office is  initiating an inquiry into Facebook data policy after that report. </p><p>Also tonight, could Andrew McCabe, the fired former FBI deputy director  incriminate the fired FBI James Comey, not just release to the media but  for also lying to Congress. We got the sound and the debate coming up.  We're on it. </p><p>And a tiny California town now defiantly fighting back against California  sanctuary policy, saying it will instead follow their sworn oath to defend  the Constitution and uphold immigration laws. It's the City of Los Alamitos  it's voted tonight to not be a sanctuary city. It faces the threat of  lawsuits in California condemnation as well. The mayor of that town here to  talk about the fight. </p><p>Plus, driverless robot cars, now they were supposed to reduce traffic  fatalities by eliminating human error. But now a robot car from ridesharing  company Uber has killed a pedestrian in Arizona. It happened last night. So  what will happen to the robot revolution? That's now in the works of a slew  of auto companies like Tesla, G.M. Ford and also Silicon Valley. We're  bringing an expert to weigh in.</p><p>Tonight, an all-guest lineup. Economist Ben Stein, former special assistant  to President Trump, Marc Lotter, legal eagle Harvard Law professor Alan  Dershowitz, the Federalist Britt McHenry, all here all tonight. </p><p>Politics, money, we got you covered. I'm Elizabeth McDonald. Risk and  Reward starts right now. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  I wish I could tell you that we're going  to be able to stop all interference but that just wouldn't be realistic.  There will always be bad actors in the world and we can't prevent all  governments from all interference. But we can make it harder. We can make  it much harder and that's what we're going to focus on doing. </p><p>We won't catch everyone immediately but we can make it harder to try to  determine (Ph).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  The Dow down 335 points closing to that 24,610. The NASDAQ  taking hits, that was down as well. Facebook stocks ending more than 6  percent down or 12 points lower after suspending a political analysis firm  Cambridge Analytics after reports that the research firm harvested personal  Facebook data on 270,000 Facebook users without their permission. </p><p>Now you can't Facebook friends and family. The breach may affect an  estimated 50 million people. It's being Facebook Equifax breach. The  research firm also reportedly told Facebook it did delete the user info  when it did not. Pretty scary stuff. </p><p>There's actually a really long list of things that Facebook knows about  you. We counted a hundred different things. For example, where you live,  your age, your education, income, net worth, your wedding anniversary  birthday whether you recently moved. </p><p>If you're in a long-distance relationship, whether you are conservative or  liberal, whether you like would you're likely to buy your next car, how  many workers your company has, whether you carry a credit card balance. The  time of year your household shops and the most types of vacations you take,  the pets you have, and so on, and so on, and so on, more and more and more. </p><p>But first, Lori Rothman on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on the  market drop after reports of this privacy breach at Facebook. You know,  Lori, Facebook faces a threat of federal fines. The tech sector also  dropping after the E.U. threaten to slap U.S. tech companies with a 3  percent tax of sales and revenues. Wow, Lori.</p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  One, two punch against the tech  sector today and that just drag down the broad market. We had the Dow  closing down 335 points today, believe it or not that's well, well more  than a hundred points off the session low for the Dow. Down now negative  temperature territory for 2018. </p><p>The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ didn't fare much better. The NASDAQ was the worst in  the benchmark three but it's still holding up for the year. There you see  on your screen the NASDAQ fell 137 points blame Facebook. </p><p>But here is the thing that's got everyone here on Wall Street thinking. If  Facebook is misusing customer data, user data, well, all of these tech  companies use our data. They mine our data. We plug our data in. How do  they get it, what do they do with it when they have it. And really how do  they protect every day users. </p><p>So, a lot of the big tech company CEO's have been called upon by both  Democrats and Republicans to testify about that. And then you mention this  potential tax 3 percent by the E.U. on the tech company revenue. </p><p>So the good times may be over for tech. That was the thinking and the  concern today on Wall Street, obviously nothing for sure on that front but  any news of that degree again. Again, a one-two punch. The Facebook news  and then the tax. My goodness. You're going to have some trouble. </p><p>And then of course you can talk about the ongoing trade and tariff  controversy as well. So we did have a broad base rally, it wasn't just  technology. All 10 S&amp;P sectors were in the red today. </p><p>We do want to bring you up-to-date on some mergers, merger Monday. Well,  actually this one in particular is going nowhere. I'm talking about AT&amp;T  and Time Warner shares both down in excess of 1 percent. AT&amp;T tried today  to get a judge to throw out evidence. It seems to show its $85 billion  acquisition of Time Warner is bad for consumers and competition. </p><p>Now the Justice Department as you know did file a lawsuit back in November  to stop this combination opening arguments in this case are still scheduled  to begin on Wednesday. We're following it. Liz, back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Lori. Thank you so much.</p><p>ROTHMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now this firm that's denying claims of abusing and have taking  without consent the data of millions of Facebook users. That's called  Cambridge Analytics. This as Facebook hired a digital forensic firm to do  an audit of Cambridge Analytica systems. </p><p>Politicians now pressuring Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg for answers on what's  going on. The word is Mark Zuckerberg may have to testify before Congress.  Remember he has political leanings. </p><p>Gerri Willis has more. Gerri?</p><p>WILLIS:  Hi, Liz. That's right. You know, just the latest on the latest on  this incredibly fast moving story. Here's what Facebook had to say about  hiring a digital forensics firm. Listen to this. \"We hired a digital  forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg to conduct a comprehensive audit, they say,  of Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica has agreed to comply and afford  the firm complete access to their servers and systems.\" </p><p>So that's a move forward here I supposed for Facebook. The other thing  that's going on and this again, this is just out moments ago. Connecticut  is launching, the attorney general there, a probe into what's gone on with  Facebook. So that's something new. Reaction was swift and then you have on  two continents with both the E.U. and the Massachusetts Attorney General  Maura Healey launching probes. Yet Facebook says the situation is unlike  data breaches, breaches that have plagued American companies. </p><p>For years now, here's what Facebook said. The claim that this is data  breach is completely false. People knowingly provided their information. No  systems were infiltrated. No passwords or sensitive pieces of information.  We're still and or hack. At issues that hundreds of thousands of a Facebook  users were paid to download to take a personality test and agreed to have  their data collected, they agreed to it. The app was called this is your  digital life. </p><p>Facebook later change its policy and didn't allow this kind of scraping to  be done. But Cambridge had retained access to the data as late as 2015.  Cambridge now says no info from the company that provided the data was used  in the 2016 election. Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook  terms of service.</p><p>And back to you, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Wow, what a story, Gerri. Thank you so much for coming on.  We really appreciate it. </p><p>Now remember Mark Zuckerberg's New Year's resolution. He vowed to fix  Facebook and to correct persistent problems that had dogged the networks.  Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Now we're going to explore ways that we can share more  information about anyone attempting to interfere with elections. We are  working proactively to strengthen the democratic process. Beyond pushing  back against threats we will also create more services to protect our  community while engaging in political discourse.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's bring in the economist and author of \"The Capitalist  Code\" Ben Stein. You know, Ben, this is kind of making people unsettled and  uncomfortable. It's astonishing how much information Facebook has on you  and also your kids. </p><p>BEN STEIN, ECONOMIST:  It is astonishing in a way but it doesn't really  affect Facebook as an investment. I mean, Facebook is still a very powerful  company filling an enormously large niche and void in the American life.  Facebook in a way has become an almost spiritual guide to human  companionship and human fellowship. And almost spiritual guide and antidote  to human loneliness. </p><p>I don't think that one day's notes about somebody misusing data or maybe  not using data are going to change that. I can still consider stocks a  fantastically important part of anyone's portfolio.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, I know what you mean that people could connect with their  family and their friends. But the fact remains that this looks like  Facebook's equivalent of the Equifax breach.</p><p>If info is going to help political campaigns the allegation was the Trump  campaign benefit. Also a former Obama campaign staffer candidly admits,  Ben, that Facebook let the Obama campaign quote, \"improperly access  Facebook user dater -- data. The staffer, her name is Carol Davidson. She  said this. \"Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole  social graph, but they did not stop us once they realized that what we were  doing. They came to office in the days after the election recruiting and  were very candid that they let us do things they would not have allowed  someone else to do because they were on our side.\" </p><p>That was back in 2012. I mean, that's six years ago, Ben. Now Facebook is  returning itself as sort of discomforted by all thing, all this. But you  know, that was Obama's campaign. We don't want to get too political about  this. But what is going on with Silicon Valley companies letting people  access data. </p><p>STEIN:  Well, what's going on is that it's going to, it's bound to happen.  The internet is not a closed system. The internet is a system that people  can get into, a very clever people can get into even if it's tightly sealed  up. We know that the Russians and the Chinese are able to get into it even  if we think it's sealed tightly as a drum.</p><p>What I want to go after is, is it still a good investment. And I say it's  still is a very good investment. And the fact that people are upset about  their data being accessed is too bad. And it's upsetting. And we don't want  it to happen. And we want people's privacy to be respected. But we also  want to be realistic about this. How is it possibly going to affect their  earnings unless there's absolutely stupendous fine. I think --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. But you know, they're so, you know, they have so much  information, Ben, they could pretty much accurately predict what kind of  car you are going to buy, what kind of house you're going to buy, and where  your kids are going to college. </p><p>STEIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm not sure Americans realize how much Facebook knows about  them. </p><p>STEIN:  I'm not sure they do either, but I'm going to what the show is  about, what you are wonderfully about in Fox Business is about which is  making money. And that is I don't think anything we've learned in the last  several days is going to affect whether or not Facebook is going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Ben, stay on that for a second. Hang on one second.  Because some Americans want Facebook fined, hit with penalties for its role  in the Russian meddling during the election. </p><p>Remember, you and I were talking about this, Ben, how Russian internet  trolls loaded Facebook up with fake news. Even fake Facebook Russia-backed  political rallies. Should Facebook be fined for that?</p><p>STEIN:  Maybe they should be and maybe they shouldn't be. I don't think the  Russia Trump collusion has improved to that any meaningful effect on the  campaign at all on way or the other. And I think the more they push that  the more they find that there's nothing at the end of the string. You can  only push the string so far. </p><p>I'm not worried about that Russia Trump collusion because I don't it ever  happen. If it did happened, it happen as such a minor scale that hardly  matters at all. What I'm concerned about is this, is it still a good  business to be in a business of providing communication for hundreds of  millions and billions of people all around the world who would otherwise be  sitting on lonely twiddling their thumbs. </p><p>And I think they're still a very, very good business. And the fact that  they can access all of this information about all kinds of people in  America or in Mexico or in Cuba or probably not Cuba, or anywhere tells us  that this is still a very, very strong investment. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>STEIN:  This stick on me that it's just an absolutely a house on fire in  terms of power and I don't think there's going to be any stopping short of  abolishing it. I don't anyone dares to abolish them. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Ben Stein, good to see you. Thank you so much for  coming on. </p><p>STEIN:  It's an honor as always.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Same here. It appears to be the first driverless, well, there  was a driver but this is on automatic mode. It was on robot mode. A robot  car killed somebody in Tempe, Arizona. Ridesharing company Uber that it was  this car it now stopped its self-driving car program. An Arizona woman  struck and killed by one of the robot vehicles. It happened last night  around 10 o'clock.</p><p>Coming up, we're bringing in an expert who is saying who is responsible.  We're going to get to the bottom on who's to blame and who could face  liability. Is it the car company Uber or is it the software.</p><p>Also this. One tiny Southern California town now sitting up in defiance to  the big and powerful in the sanctuary state. It's the town of Los Alamitos  in Orange County. It wants to opt out of California's sanctuary laws. The  mayor of that town here to talk about it. </p><p>But first, could Andrew McCabe the fired former FBI deputy director, could  he incriminate the fired FBI former Director James Comey, not just release  to the media but for also for lying to Congress. We got the sound, we're  going to drill into this debate, coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ANGUS KING (I), MAINE: It just seem mean-spirited to come down on a  guy within 48 hours of his scheduled retirement. It was clearly rushed and  I think there are questions about that and whether the administration was  putting pressure on the Justice Department to take this action. </p><p>SEN. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA:  It was a horrible day for democracy. To have  firings like this happening at the top from the president and the attorney  general does not speak well for what's going on. </p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA:  I don't like it happened. He should have  been allowed to finish through the weekend.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA:  You know, his firing may be justified,  there's no way for us to know at this point. But though it may have been  justified it can also be tainted.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  A number of congressmen and senators up and arms of the firing  of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. It was a recommendation from the  FBI's own Office of Professional Responsibility they said yes, fire him.</p><p>Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy reminding everyone it was McCabe's fault.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Andy McCabe was undercut his  credibility all by himself. he didn't any help doing that and I thought it  richly ironic that he is lamenting that those are attacking the FBI when he  himself does the exact same thing. It was the FBI who said he made an  unauthorized disclosure and then a lied about it. </p><p>That wasn't President Trump, it wasn't me, it wasn't the crazy House  Republicans. It was his own fellow FBI agents the said he leaked and then  lied about it. So if he's got credibility issues he need look no further  than himself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Joining me now former special assistant to Present Trump, Marc  Lotter. Marc, what's your take on McCabe's firing?</p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think it sounds it was  completely justified. You had an inspector general report the Office of  Professional Responsibility and then the senior career official at the  department all made these recommendations so that's what the attorney  general acted on. </p><p>And I think what we're seeing right now is a case of many other Democrats  and some of their friends in the mainstream media are trying to have it  both ways. When someone pleads guilty to lying to investigators that are on  the Republican side it's breaking news and it's proof that something is  amiss except when someone is accused of doing the same thing to federal  officials on the other side will then they're just trying to play \"Cry Me a  River,\" so they can't have it both ways.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. People go to prison for misleading the FBI. I mean, McCabe  is accused of misleading Justice Department investigating -- in  investigators about his leaking of sensitive information to Wall Street  Journal reporter about the FBI's investigation of pay to play at the  Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. </p><p>McCabe now says, Marc, that he had authority to quote share that  information with the media and Director James Comey knew about that. But  Marc, the issue is really covering up the leak, right? So is there anything  wrong with the way he was fired?</p><p>LOTTER:  Well, obviously the inspector general report which we have not  seen yet does suggest that there were some sort of improprieties in the way  he was conducting his business. And when you follow that on with the Office  of professional Responsibility and the senior career official in the  department all making me this conclusion then something there is amiss and  it may just be lying or misleading investigators or maybe something more to  it.</p><p>But we got to be honest here. We can't -- we cannot, as a country, tolerate  any kind of impropriety when it comes to members of law enforcement at any  level. We place our trust in them to act honorably within the bounds of  their oath. If they don't, we need to get to that right away.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, former FBI Director James Comey is coming out with  his book right at the same time this I.G. report is coming up from the  Justice Department. But here's the problem for James Comey. The firing of  Andrew McCabe may cause problems for James Comey.</p><p>Remember when Comey said this under oath last year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source  in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the  Clinton investigation?</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  Never.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Question 21 relatively related. Have you ever authorize  someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source is news reports about the  Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?</p><p>COMEY:  No.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. So Comey said under oath he never was a source of the media  nor authorize any FBI officials to talk to the media. But look at this. An  Andrew McCabe's statement after getting fired he wrote this. \"The I.G.  investigation is focused on information I chose to share with a reporter  who my public affairs officer and legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I  was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a  secret place, it took place, and others including the director, meaning  James Comey were aware of the interaction with the reporter.</p><p>So Marc, did you catch that. The director meaning Comey was aware. So what  -- how does that stuck up with Comey saying what he said to Congress last  year about he didn't allow -- he never allow any of this.</p><p>LOTTER:  Clearly they've got contradicting stories and I think this is why  so many Republicans are saying we need another special investigator to look  at the way the FBI's conducted itself in a very small group at the highest  levels. We cannot have these inconsistencies if partisanship if things were  taking place in the Clinton investigation that was not aboveboard, that was  not inconsistent -- that was not consistent with their oath then when you  look into it.</p><p>And right now as you pointed out we see it happening where they are  contradicting each other and who said what and when.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Marc Lotter, great to see you. Thanks for coming on.</p><p>LOTTER:  Thanks, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news. Fox News confirming that the president is hiring  a new legal defense team to official to help in dealing with the special  counsel's Russia probe. Former Bush U.S. attorney Joseph DiGenova will join  President Trump's legal team. He has previously suggested that the Justice  Department and FBI framed the president. The edition that Mr. DiGenova as  the first change with legal teams since last summer.</p><p>Next up, one tiny Southern California it is standing up in defiance to the  big and the powerful in the sanctuary state of California. It's Los  Alamitos in Orange County. It wants to opt out of California sanctuary laws  that restrict cooperation between local police and federal immigration.  They are saying in Los Alamitos that swore an oath to uphold the  Constitution and what state is asking them to do is violating that oath. </p><p>We're bringing the mayor of that town Troy Edgar to speak out after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  One tiny Southern California town now standing up in defiance  to being powerful in the state of California. Los Alamitos wants to opt out  of California sanctuary laws that restrict cooperation between local police  and federal immigration agents.</p><p>Council members in the city now say they have sworn an oath to uphold the  Constitution and that California so-called sanctuary laws undercuts that  oath as well as federal law.</p><p>Let's bring in the mayor Los Alamitos, he's Troy Edgar. Good to see you,  mayor.</p><p>TROY EDGAR, MAYOR, LOST ALAMITOS, CALIFORNIA:  Hi, Liz. How are you doing?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thanks for coming on. Can you spell out this fight and what  officials in your town are saying because we've got university professors  in California saying, you know what, you're right in the crosshairs of  lawsuits.</p><p>EDGAR:  Yes. You know, this is a small city in Southern California what  we're really trying to do is we're telling the state is, look, at this  point, you know, we are conflicted with the U.S. Constitution and Los  Alamitos we firmly believe that the U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of  the land and that the SP 54 sanctuary law is in conflict. And at this point  we're going to vote tonight to see if we will exempt ourselves from that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, we've got -- we've run on the show, mayor, sheriffs  in California who are twisted into pretzel knots trying to abide by the  Constitution the federal law and what the state is telling them to do.</p><p>What I would like you know and I think the viewer wants to have you spoken  to other mayors in California, are there other cities like yours who do not  want to be part of the sanctuary state policies?</p><p>EDGAR:  Yes, there's a lot of mayors in California that don't want to be a  part of it, but you know it's a really tough situation because in our state  lot of this legislation comes out of Sacramento just seems disconnected  that they're not attached. You know, when you're mayor of a small town  immediately your constituents tell you how they feel where they're at and,  you know, you're going to find out that evening in the grocery store  whether you're doing a good job or not.</p><p>And I think a lot of the stuff is going on Sacramento people this  constantly saying to all of us on the council what is going on.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Have you experienced crime from illegal immigrants in your  town?</p><p>EDGAR:  No, I would say that we don't have a significant amount of crime  problems with illegal immigrants. I think for us this is a constitutional  issue that we're looking at and saying look, we are consistently being held  to different standards by the state. A lot of them unfunded this is another  one where they pass a law and now they're asking us to choose between the  U.S. Constitution and the state Constitution.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>EDGAR:  And I think based on our oath, you now, many of us want to stay and  focus on the U.S. Constitution.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, we're wondering if your vote tonight will set up a  chain reaction. Which other mayors are telling you that they agree with you  and want to opt out? What are the mayors of what town?</p><p>EDGAR:  Well, you know what, I think right now I think a lot of the mayors  are going to wait and see and how this is going to go.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But do you know they found?</p><p>EDGAR:  I do. But I I want to give them an opportunity to bring this upon  themselves and I've also talked to a different staff and city attorneys at  different city specially the elected city attorneys that the definitely  have a perspective on which direction they or their city may want to go.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Mayor, we have Sheriff Margaret Mims, she's in Fresno,  California. She's been speaking out against California sanctuary laws. I'd  like your reaction to what the sheriff said. Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARGARET MIMS, SHERIFF, FRESNO COUNTY:  We need to stop vilifying our hard- working ICE agents and our federal law enforcement partners. They are doing  their jobs. Law enforcement has to enforce the law, teachers have to teach,  and preachers have to preach and we're not going to apologize any of us for  doing our jobs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So, mayor, do you hear from your local law enforcement the same  thing that the sheriff just said?</p><p>EDGAR:  You know what, I think that there is kind of two different  jurisdictions. The sheriff definitely deals with the county, Orange County  level and at L.A. County for us, but you know, the sheriff is little bit  different than the police chief. </p><p>And so, within our cities we all have police chiefs and we across the  different cities so have a lot of different types of things that are going  on. And I think tonight what we will hear --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But are your cops upset about it, are your cops upset about two  different standards they are dealing with?</p><p>EDGAR:  Now. You know what, I think at this point it's probably more the  counsel, you know, Mayor Pro Tem Kusumot has been really focused on this  and him and I together really want to kind of bring this up and have an  open discussion with the city council and start bringing stuff into this on  more formal basis.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Mayor Troy Edgar of Los Alamitos standing up in defiance  against California laws. Good to see you, mayor. Thanks you so much for  coming on.</p><p>EDGAR:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now -- you, too. It appears to be the first driverless car  fatality on a public road it involved ridesharing company Uber. It has now  stop its self driving robot car program after a woman in Tempe, Arizona was  struck and killed by one of its robots cars. </p><p>Coming up, an attorney on who could be responsible, is it Uber or is it the  software? </p><p>But first, forget about distancing themselves. Reverend Al Sharpton is now  saying we are going to do a protest in support and in defense of anti- Semite and racist Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. </p><p>We're bringing on Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz to react after  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LOUIS FARRAKHAN, LEADER, NATION OF ISLAM:  Hitler was a very great man. The  Satanic Jews. White folks are going down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FARRAKHAN:  Hear the Jews they don't like Farrakhan so they call me Hitler.  That's a good name. Hitler was a very great man.</p><p>Your country has been taken from you by the synagogue of Satan. The Satanic  Jews. White folks are going down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Black activist groups including Al Sharpton's national action  network also Black Lives Matters -- matter and the New Black Panther Party  now organizing a protest in support of and in defense of the controversial  leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan. The groups are protesting a  congressional resolution condemning Farrakhan.</p><p>With me now Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz. First of all, Alan,  professor, rather, there are some other comments made by Farrakhan. Here's  one of them. The Jews talk about never again. You cannot say never again to  God because when he puts you in the oven you're in one indeed.</p><p>He also said the Jews of control over those agency -- agency of the  government. He also said this. When a woman does not know how to cook and  the right foods to cook she's preparing death for herself, her husband and  her children.</p><p>You know, Professor, Democrats like Maxine Waters, Al Green, Keith Ellison,  they also have links to Farrakhan. What's going on here?</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL:  Well, first of all,  Farrakhan is not only an anti-Semite, he's anti-white, he's anti-woman,  he's anti-gay. He's anti everything decent in this country and when you get  bigots supporting him and people like Al Sharpton was has his own history  of anti-Semitism. </p><p>Black Lives Matter which singled out only Israel called genocide to an  apartheid country which was anti-Semitic as well. What we have in this  country as people who believe in an affirmative action program for racism  for African Americans. That if you're an African-American you can get away  with supporting anti-Semitism, anti-gay, anti-white --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But wait a minute, wait, wait, wait. Because you know, Trump is  being accused of racism but now we've got an MSNBC host Al Sharpton  defending this anti, you know, this anti-Semite, this racist anti-gay  individual. I don't understand why more people are not condemning Farrakhan  including Democrats.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, the Democrats should condemn him, the women's movement  should condemn him, gay rights movement should condemn him, everybody  should condemn him. And I don't never have understood why Al Sharpton was a  history of anti-Semitism, the history about lying and falsely accusing  people of crime should be on the major network.</p><p>If you had a white person who is equivalently racist against blacks and who  defended David Duke he would never ever get on the air on a national  network. And yet, we have affirmative action for black races and that's  just unjustified. We have zero tolerance for bigotry, racism, and anti- Semitism and under the standard at zero-tolerance are not only doesn't  Farrakhan satisfy it but neither does Sharpton, neither does Black Lives  Matter, and neither to the congressmen who were now standing in support of  a big anti-Semite.</p><p>Imagine if Republican congressmen standing in support of David Duke and  Farrakhan is much, much, much more dangerous than David Duke. Because  Farrakhan has the support of hundreds of thousands of African-Americans.  What's my source to that? My source to that is Sharpton who says that he  has massive support in the African-American community. </p><p>David Duke doesn't have any support and so we should not have a double  standard. And Democrats and all decent people should come out not only  against Farrakhan but any congressperson who supports Farrakhan.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, so let's get to one of those congressmen, professor. It's  Democrat Congressman of Illinois, he's Danny Davis. He tried to clarify his  position, he and his praise. Danny Davis has praise Farrakhan and has met  with Farrakhan.</p><p>Here's what he saying now. Quote, \"I disagree with Minister Farrakhan in  terms of white people being devils and Jewish people being Satanic. But I  also protect his right as a free individual to say and do whatever he wants  to do. I think he does outstanding things for, especially blacks who are  unsure about themselves and people who've been in prison.\"</p><p>Your reaction to that.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  People said the same thing about Adolf Hitler that he did good  things for the German people. You cannot justify this kind of bigotry by  saying that he also does some decent things. And I think it's a scandal  that the Democratic Party and liberals and the New York Times lets a black  bigots off the hook. Only a text to bigotry on the right. </p><p>Today the danger of bigotry is far greater from the hard left, from the  African-American community from the Muslim community, from many other  communities which tolerated (AUDIO GAP) bigotry than it is from the right.  Look, anti-Semitism was wrong for both the right and the left. We all  condemn it from the right, let's join together to condemn it from the left  regardless of the race of the person behind it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Professor Alan Dershowitz, we love having you on. Come back  soon, sir. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Any time. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. The robot cars are supposed to stop fatalities. But  now it appears to be the first death caused by the robot car in a public  road. Ridesharing company Uber stopping its self-driving car program after  a woman in Arizona was struck and killed by one of its robot cars last  night.</p><p>We're bringing in an attorney on what this means for the car industry and  Silicon Valley.</p><p>But first, Hillary Clinton now backtracking now her none-apologize --  apology after implying last week that women who cast a ballot who voted for  Trump for this all due to pressure from their husbands. </p><p>My all-female power panel is here to react after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS: It's not helpful at all. And in fact, my  friend Hillary Clinton is wrong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We do not do  well with white men and we don't do well with married white women. And part  of that is a -- an identification with the Republican Party and a sort of  ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son,  whoever believes you should.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Hillary Clinton putting up a lengthy 861-word non-apology on  Facebook, trying to defend and explain her controversial comments about the  Trump campaign. It's called backwards that the state that didn't vote for  her are not optimistic, diverse or dynamic, and that white women vote like  their husband. She made those comments a week and a half ago in India.</p><p>But now Hillary Clinton says this. \"I also mentioned something in passing  that's got a lot of attention.\" She's saying now that she said in passing,  \"that there is anecdotal level and some research to suggest that women are  unfortunately more swayed by men than the other way around. As much as I  hate the possibility and hate saying it, it's not that crazy when you think  about our ongoing struggle to reach the gender balance even within the same  household. </p><p>I understand how some of what I said upset people and can be  misinterpreted. I mean, meant no disrespect to any individual or group. I  want to look to the future not just anybody.\"</p><p>With me now, the Federalist, Britt McHenry, and Democrat strategist,  Danielle McLaughlin. Britt, are you satisfied what is not apology. I mean,  why is Hillary even bringing up these things, why get into it?</p><p>BRITT MCHENRY, CONTRIBUTOR, THE FEDERALIST:  Absolutely not. Hillary  Clinton is like that relative, that strange relative that comes to family  gatherings and you just know that she's just going to say something  patronizing and offensive which she did.</p><p>Donald Trump 52 percent of white women votes, so she's right about that, 61  percent of white women without college degree. So in her non-apology she is  trying to say that those white women anyone watching this program right now  don't have gender equality in their household. It's ridiculous. And she  can't get out of her own way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  And that they can't think for themselves --</p><p>MCHENRY:  Exactly.</p><p>MACDONALD:  -- they just follow what their husbands are doing. OK.  Danielle, Democrat Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin speaking out against  Clinton's comment. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DURBIN:  It's not helpful at all. And in fact, my friend Hillary Clinton is  wrong. Thirty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump had voted  for President Obama. Why? The same people who look for change with  President Obama thought wasn't enough for us, their personal lives were  concerned and they supported Donald Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  How come more Democrats, Danielle are not joining Dick Durbin  and condemning comments like Hillary made?</p><p>DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I think because Dick  Durbin is right. You know, I don't think that what she said on that face --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But how come more Democrats -- how come more Democrats are not  stepping out and saying you know what, Hillary, you're wrong?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Well, I think plenty have in all honesty and they don't  because they probably wants to draw much attention to it. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Who?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  But I will give the person credit for apologizing.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Who besides Dick Durbin has stepped up?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  There have been a number of Democrats, there have been a  number of people on television who have said this as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Who?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I can name for you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Go ahead.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I mean, this is clearly something that you would never say and  shouldn't even say. But you know what? I give her credit for apologizing.  We have a president who has insulted many number of people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  It wasn't an apology. Have you read it? Have you read it?  Danielle, have you read it? It was a non-apology.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  And she said very much that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  She didn't say she was sorry anywhere in that Facebook post.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Well, I mean, she said I mean I meant no disrespect. She did  not meant to hurt people or harm people that as far more that Donald Trump  has ever said when he talked about John McCain or Judge Curiel --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Understood. But we're talking about -- understood. I get what  you're saying. H has said an extraordinary inflammatory things.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We get that and we've covered it here on the show.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  We're talking about Hillary right now. Britt, she's no apology  there.</p><p>MCHENRY:  There's no apology. And if Democrats want success they need more  moderate Democrats like we saw with Conor Lamb who won in a congressional  district that won by 20 points for Trump in Trump's favor in 2016. That's  going to send their message not that I particularly wanted to go over the  Democrats instead of this identity politics and just offensive rhetoric  from Hillary Clinton.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Britt and Danielle, thank you so much for coming on. I really  appreciate it.</p><p>MCHENRY:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news. Washington Post reporting that President Trump  is preparing by this Friday to hit China with tariffs on $60 billion worth  of goods that would double the what was earlier thought to be 30 billion,  now it's going to 60 billion. It could be 100 different types of products  hit with tariffs by this Friday.</p><p>This amid the escalation of trade tensions is going to four anonymous  senior administration officials. We're staying on that story for you.</p><p>Now it appears to be the first robot car death on a public road.  Ridesharing company Uber stopping its self-driving car program after a  woman in Arizona was struck and killed by one of its robot vehicle.</p><p>Attorney Emily Compagno on whether this is basically upends the entire  robot car industry. That's after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Cars are supposed to stop traffic fatalities but now a  bombshell. The first driverless robot car death in a public road evolving  ridesharing company Uber. It's now suspending its robot car program after  woman was struck and killed by one of its robot cars at 10 o'clock last  night in Tempe, Arizona.</p><p>Attorney Emily Compagno, I mean, how worried are you about robot cars  killing people? We thought they were supposed to stop traffic fatalities.</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  Right. And it's hard because in this field which  is noble one death is one death too many but in the larger picture we see  over -- we see up to 50 million disabled and injury results from car  crashes a year and millions death, right, it's the highest -- it's the  highest cause of death in the country.</p><p>But again, the argument for autonomous vehicle in part is that it's  supposed to be safer because it removes that human element. But in  situations like this is it possible that the human element the ability to  be malleable and to react to things that that ultimately what would render  an autonomous vehicle safer.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  So it kind of begs a larger question, right? But what we're  seeing this play out is going to be in a regulatory field. The reason that  Arizona has so many tech companies playing in that field now it's because  they've said they taking an accommodating approach to not regulate the  autonomous riding field there.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. You know, Emily, I hear what you're saying. We hear  so many glowing statements about how great robot cars are going to be. But  you know what's not being discussed, Emily, is this. Robot cars have been  found to not properly read highway signs if those highway signs have been  slightly altered. They don't know how to read it. And some of these were  about cars don't even network and talk to other robot cars.</p><p>That's the big deal for Apple. Apple can have its own Apple closed system  in these cars. So the thing is, Emily, we still haven't figured out who is  going to be liable for robot car death. Is it companies like Uber or the  software?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right. Well, in every case it's going to be a different analysis  as to who or what is responsible, right? So we saw in a large accident  earlier that didn't involve a fatality that human driver that was in the  autonomous vehicle he was ultimately held responsible because of that. </p><p>In another major crash it was the other driver of the car that T-bone the  autonomous driving vehicle. And I think the larger answer to your question  is that this is why test phase is so important. This is why we're not ready  to hit the road yet. This is why kind of a phase physical area for these  cars to be tested is so crucial.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right. Bingo.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Because otherwise of course now we'll see more fatalities.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You just nailed it. That's the thing, Emily. Because this is  like a -- we're just at the beginning stages of this and now we have a  woman killed by a robot car, right? I mean, this is a big deal.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes. And note that just next month or in April, California has  maintained that they will now allow test writing of these autonomous  vehicles without the human driver inside, right? Up until now it's just  been Arizona. So that's something that we're going to see now a huge test  zone there, that's a physical fight at the Silicon Valley, right. So we'll  see a lot more.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Emily, we need you back on. We love having you on to break it  all down and drill into this. You're terrific. Please come back on the  show. Good to see you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  More after the break. Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news on the Facebook data mining breach. Cambridge  Analytica they're accused of abusing the Facebook data of potentially  millions of Facebook users. Now Great Britain wants to seek a warrant to  get into the computer servers of that data mining firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>We're going to stay on that story for you tomorrow.

This industry darling led the market up last year and through  much of this year quite a different take today. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Cambridge Analytica was able to  can collect the data from 50 million people's profiles without permission.  In the U.S., in Europe, in the U.K. are calling for investigations Facebook  is in the crosshairs. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Social media companies are trading  lower today. I guess in sympathy. Twitter, Snap, Google all lower.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  People are starting to grow tired of social media. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, yes.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Facebook basically can't be escape. This is something  that as far --</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Everybody in their mother now saying we are going to  investigate.</p><p> ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Facebook privacy hitting markets  really hard today. Facebook having its worst day in five and half years.  The Dow also are down nearly 500 points at session lows at tech is drag  down in sympathy. The NASDAQ slid nearly 2 percent. Facebook dragging tech  stock lower.</p><p> This, after reports that the personal Facebook data of an estimated 50  million people were harvested without their permission for political ad.  You will not believe what we found that Facebook has on you. One hundred  separate bits of information. We're going to show you what Facebook is  collecting about you. E.U. also threatening a whopping 3 percent tax on  tech company sales as well.</p><p> And this now breaking. The Connecticut Attorney General's office is  initiating an inquiry into Facebook data policy after that report. </p><p> Also tonight, could Andrew McCabe, the fired former FBI deputy director  incriminate the fired FBI James Comey, not just release to the media but  for also lying to Congress. We got the sound and the debate coming up.  We're on it. </p><p> And a tiny California town now defiantly fighting back against California  sanctuary policy, saying it will instead follow their sworn oath to defend  the Constitution and uphold immigration laws. It's the City of Los Alamitos  it's voted tonight to not be a sanctuary city. It faces the threat of  lawsuits in California condemnation as well. The mayor of that town here to  talk about the fight. </p><p> Plus, driverless robot cars, now they were supposed to reduce traffic  fatalities by eliminating human error. But now a robot car from ridesharing  company Uber has killed a pedestrian in Arizona. It happened last night. So  what will happen to the robot revolution? That's now in the works of a slew  of auto companies like Tesla, G.M. Ford and also Silicon Valley. We're  bringing an expert to weigh in.</p><p> Tonight, an all-guest lineup. Economist Ben Stein, former special assistant  to President Trump, Marc Lotter, legal eagle Harvard Law professor Alan  Dershowitz, the Federalist Britt McHenry, all here all tonight. </p><p> Politics, money, we got you covered. I'm Elizabeth McDonald. Risk and  Reward starts right now. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  I wish I could tell you that we're going  to be able to stop all interference but that just wouldn't be realistic.  There will always be bad actors in the world and we can't prevent all  governments from all interference. But we can make it harder. We can make  it much harder and that's what we're going to focus on doing. </p><p> We won't catch everyone immediately but we can make it harder to try to  determine (Ph).</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MACDONALD:  The Dow down 335 points closing to that 24,610. The NASDAQ  taking hits, that was down as well. Facebook stocks ending more than 6  percent down or 12 points lower after suspending a political analysis firm  Cambridge Analytics after reports that the research firm harvested personal  Facebook data on 270,000 Facebook users without their permission. </p><p> Now you can't Facebook friends and family. The breach may affect an  estimated 50 million people. It's being Facebook Equifax breach. The  research firm also reportedly told Facebook it did delete the user info  when it did not. Pretty scary stuff. </p><p> There's actually a really long list of things that Facebook knows about  you. We counted a hundred different things. For example, where you live,  your age, your education, income, net worth, your wedding anniversary  birthday whether you recently moved. </p><p> If you're in a long-distance relationship, whether you are conservative or  liberal, whether you like would you're likely to buy your next car, how  many workers your company has, whether you carry a credit card balance. The  time of year your household shops and the most types of vacations you take,  the pets you have, and so on, and so on, and so on, more and more and more. </p><p> But first, Lori Rothman on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on the  market drop after reports of this privacy breach at Facebook. You know,  Lori, Facebook faces a threat of federal fines. The tech sector also  dropping after the E.U. threaten to slap U.S. tech companies with a 3  percent tax of sales and revenues. Wow, Lori.</p><p> LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  One, two punch against the tech  sector today and that just drag down the broad market. We had the Dow  closing down 335 points today, believe it or not that's well, well more  than a hundred points off the session low for the Dow. Down now negative  temperature territory for 2018. </p><p> The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ didn't fare much better. The NASDAQ was the worst in  the benchmark three but it's still holding up for the year. There you see  on your screen the NASDAQ fell 137 points blame Facebook. </p><p> But here is the thing that's got everyone here on Wall Street thinking. If  Facebook is misusing customer data, user data, well, all of these tech  companies use our data. They mine our data. We plug our data in. How do  they get it, what do they do with it when they have it. And really how do  they protect every day users. </p><p> So, a lot of the big tech company CEO's have been called upon by both  Democrats and Republicans to testify about that. And then you mention this  potential tax 3 percent by the E.U. on the tech company revenue. </p><p> So the good times may be over for tech. That was the thinking and the  concern today on Wall Street, obviously nothing for sure on that front but  any news of that degree again. Again, a one-two punch. The Facebook news  and then the tax. My goodness. You're going to have some trouble. </p><p> And then of course you can talk about the ongoing trade and tariff  controversy as well. So we did have a broad base rally, it wasn't just  technology. All 10 S&amp;P sectors were in the red today. </p><p> We do want to bring you up-to-date on some mergers, merger Monday. Well,  actually this one in particular is going nowhere. I'm talking about AT&amp;T  and Time Warner shares both down in excess of 1 percent. AT&amp;T tried today  to get a judge to throw out evidence. It seems to show its $85 billion  acquisition of Time Warner is bad for consumers and competition. </p><p> Now the Justice Department as you know did file a lawsuit back in November  to stop this combination opening arguments in this case are still scheduled  to begin on Wednesday. We're following it. Liz, back to you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Lori. Thank you so much.</p><p> ROTHMAN:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Now this firm that's denying claims of abusing and have taking  without consent the data of millions of Facebook users. That's called  Cambridge Analytics. This as Facebook hired a digital forensic firm to do  an audit of Cambridge Analytica systems. </p><p> Politicians now pressuring Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg for answers on what's  going on. The word is Mark Zuckerberg may have to testify before Congress.  Remember he has political leanings. </p><p> Gerri Willis has more. Gerri?</p><p> WILLIS:  Hi, Liz. That's right. You know, just the latest on the latest on  this incredibly fast moving story. Here's what Facebook had to say about  hiring a digital forensics firm. Listen to this. \"We hired a digital  forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg to conduct a comprehensive audit, they say,  of Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica has agreed to comply and afford  the firm complete access to their servers and systems.\" </p><p> So that's a move forward here I supposed for Facebook. The other thing  that's going on and this again, this is just out moments ago. Connecticut  is launching, the attorney general there, a probe into what's gone on with  Facebook. So that's something new. Reaction was swift and then you have on  two continents with both the E.U. and the Massachusetts Attorney General  Maura Healey launching probes. Yet Facebook says the situation is unlike  data breaches, breaches that have plagued American companies. </p><p> For years now, here's what Facebook said. The claim that this is data  breach is completely false. People knowingly provided their information. No  systems were infiltrated. No passwords or sensitive pieces of information.  We're still and or hack. At issues that hundreds of thousands of a Facebook  users were paid to download to take a personality test and agreed to have  their data collected, they agreed to it. The app was called this is your  digital life. </p><p> Facebook later change its policy and didn't allow this kind of scraping to  be done. But Cambridge had retained access to the data as late as 2015.  Cambridge now says no info from the company that provided the data was used  in the 2016 election. Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook  terms of service.</p><p> And back to you, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. Wow, what a story, Gerri. Thank you so much for coming on.  We really appreciate it. </p><p> Now remember Mark Zuckerberg's New Year's resolution. He vowed to fix  Facebook and to correct persistent problems that had dogged the networks.  Let's take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Now we're going to explore ways that we can share more  information about anyone attempting to interfere with elections. We are  working proactively to strengthen the democratic process. Beyond pushing  back against threats we will also create more services to protect our  community while engaging in political discourse.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's bring in the economist and author of \"The Capitalist  Code\" Ben Stein. You know, Ben, this is kind of making people unsettled and  uncomfortable. It's astonishing how much information Facebook has on you  and also your kids. </p><p> BEN STEIN, ECONOMIST:  It is astonishing in a way but it doesn't really  affect Facebook as an investment. I mean, Facebook is still a very powerful  company filling an enormously large niche and void in the American life.  Facebook in a way has become an almost spiritual guide to human  companionship and human fellowship. And almost spiritual guide and antidote  to human loneliness. </p><p> I don't think that one day's notes about somebody misusing data or maybe  not using data are going to change that. I can still consider stocks a  fantastically important part of anyone's portfolio.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, I know what you mean that people could connect with their  family and their friends. But the fact remains that this looks like  Facebook's equivalent of the Equifax breach.</p><p> If info is going to help political campaigns the allegation was the Trump  campaign benefit. Also a former Obama campaign staffer candidly admits,  Ben, that Facebook let the Obama campaign quote, \"improperly access  Facebook user dater -- data. The staffer, her name is Carol Davidson. She  said this. \"Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole  social graph, but they did not stop us once they realized that what we were  doing. They came to office in the days after the election recruiting and  were very candid that they let us do things they would not have allowed  someone else to do because they were on our side.\" </p><p> That was back in 2012. I mean, that's six years ago, Ben. Now Facebook is  returning itself as sort of discomforted by all thing, all this. But you  know, that was Obama's campaign. We don't want to get too political about  this. But what is going on with Silicon Valley companies letting people  access data. </p><p> STEIN:  Well, what's going on is that it's going to, it's bound to happen.  The internet is not a closed system. The internet is a system that people  can get into, a very clever people can get into even if it's tightly sealed  up. We know that the Russians and the Chinese are able to get into it even  if we think it's sealed tightly as a drum.</p><p> What I want to go after is, is it still a good investment. And I say it's  still is a very good investment. And the fact that people are upset about  their data being accessed is too bad. And it's upsetting. And we don't want  it to happen. And we want people's privacy to be respected. But we also  want to be realistic about this. How is it possibly going to affect their  earnings unless there's absolutely stupendous fine. I think --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. But you know, they're so, you know, they have so much  information, Ben, they could pretty much accurately predict what kind of  car you are going to buy, what kind of house you're going to buy, and where  your kids are going to college. </p><p> STEIN:  Absolutely.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'm not sure Americans realize how much Facebook knows about  them. </p><p> STEIN:  I'm not sure they do either, but I'm going to what the show is  about, what you are wonderfully about in Fox Business is about which is  making money. And that is I don't think anything we've learned in the last  several days is going to affect whether or not Facebook is going to --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Ben, stay on that for a second. Hang on one second.  Because some Americans want Facebook fined, hit with penalties for its role  in the Russian meddling during the election. </p><p> Remember, you and I were talking about this, Ben, how Russian internet  trolls loaded Facebook up with fake news. Even fake Facebook Russia-backed  political rallies. Should Facebook be fined for that?</p><p> STEIN:  Maybe they should be and maybe they shouldn't be. I don't think the  Russia Trump collusion has improved to that any meaningful effect on the  campaign at all on way or the other. And I think the more they push that  the more they find that there's nothing at the end of the string. You can  only push the string so far. </p><p> I'm not worried about that Russia Trump collusion because I don't it ever  happen. If it did happened, it happen as such a minor scale that hardly  matters at all. What I'm concerned about is this, is it still a good  business to be in a business of providing communication for hundreds of  millions and billions of people all around the world who would otherwise be  sitting on lonely twiddling their thumbs. </p><p> And I think they're still a very, very good business. And the fact that  they can access all of this information about all kinds of people in  America or in Mexico or in Cuba or probably not Cuba, or anywhere tells us  that this is still a very, very strong investment. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> STEIN:  This stick on me that it's just an absolutely a house on fire in  terms of power and I don't think there's going to be any stopping short of  abolishing it. I don't anyone dares to abolish them. </p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Ben Stein, good to see you. Thank you so much for  coming on. </p><p> STEIN:  It's an honor as always.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Same here. It appears to be the first driverless, well, there  was a driver but this is on automatic mode. It was on robot mode. A robot  car killed somebody in Tempe, Arizona. Ridesharing company Uber that it was  this car it now stopped its self-driving car program. An Arizona woman  struck and killed by one of the robot vehicles. It happened last night  around 10 o'clock.</p><p> Coming up, we're bringing in an expert who is saying who is responsible.  We're going to get to the bottom on who's to blame and who could face  liability. Is it the car company Uber or is it the software.</p><p> Also this. One tiny Southern California town now sitting up in defiance to  the big and powerful in the sanctuary state. It's the town of Los Alamitos  in Orange County. It wants to opt out of California's sanctuary laws. The  mayor of that town here to talk about it. </p><p> But first, could Andrew McCabe the fired former FBI deputy director, could  he incriminate the fired FBI former Director James Comey, not just release  to the media but for also for lying to Congress. We got the sound, we're  going to drill into this debate, coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. ANGUS KING (I), MAINE: It just seem mean-spirited to come down on a  guy within 48 hours of his scheduled retirement. It was clearly rushed and  I think there are questions about that and whether the administration was  putting pressure on the Justice Department to take this action. </p><p> SEN. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA:  It was a horrible day for democracy. To have  firings like this happening at the top from the president and the attorney  general does not speak well for what's going on. </p><p> SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA:  I don't like it happened. He should have  been allowed to finish through the weekend.</p><p> REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA:  You know, his firing may be justified,  there's no way for us to know at this point. But though it may have been  justified it can also be tainted.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  A number of congressmen and senators up and arms of the firing  of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. It was a recommendation from the  FBI's own Office of Professional Responsibility they said yes, fire him.</p><p> Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy reminding everyone it was McCabe's fault.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Andy McCabe was undercut his  credibility all by himself. he didn't any help doing that and I thought it  richly ironic that he is lamenting that those are attacking the FBI when he  himself does the exact same thing. It was the FBI who said he made an  unauthorized disclosure and then a lied about it. </p><p> That wasn't President Trump, it wasn't me, it wasn't the crazy House  Republicans. It was his own fellow FBI agents the said he leaked and then  lied about it. So if he's got credibility issues he need look no further  than himself.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Joining me now former special assistant to Present Trump, Marc  Lotter. Marc, what's your take on McCabe's firing?</p><p> MARC LOTTER, FORMER ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think it sounds it was  completely justified. You had an inspector general report the Office of  Professional Responsibility and then the senior career official at the  department all made these recommendations so that's what the attorney  general acted on. </p><p> And I think what we're seeing right now is a case of many other Democrats  and some of their friends in the mainstream media are trying to have it  both ways. When someone pleads guilty to lying to investigators that are on  the Republican side it's breaking news and it's proof that something is  amiss except when someone is accused of doing the same thing to federal  officials on the other side will then they're just trying to play \"Cry Me a  River,\" so they can't have it both ways.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. People go to prison for misleading the FBI. I mean, McCabe  is accused of misleading Justice Department investigating -- in  investigators about his leaking of sensitive information to Wall Street  Journal reporter about the FBI's investigation of pay to play at the  Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. </p><p> McCabe now says, Marc, that he had authority to quote share that  information with the media and Director James Comey knew about that. But  Marc, the issue is really covering up the leak, right? So is there anything  wrong with the way he was fired?</p><p> LOTTER:  Well, obviously the inspector general report which we have not  seen yet does suggest that there were some sort of improprieties in the way  he was conducting his business. And when you follow that on with the Office  of professional Responsibility and the senior career official in the  department all making me this conclusion then something there is amiss and  it may just be lying or misleading investigators or maybe something more to  it.</p><p> But we got to be honest here. We can't -- we cannot, as a country, tolerate  any kind of impropriety when it comes to members of law enforcement at any  level. We place our trust in them to act honorably within the bounds of  their oath. If they don't, we need to get to that right away.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, former FBI Director James Comey is coming out with  his book right at the same time this I.G. report is coming up from the  Justice Department. But here's the problem for James Comey. The firing of  Andrew McCabe may cause problems for James Comey.</p><p> Remember when Comey said this under oath last year.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source  in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the  Clinton investigation?</p><p> JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  Never.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Question 21 relatively related. Have you ever authorize  someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source is news reports about the  Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?</p><p> COMEY:  No.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. So Comey said under oath he never was a source of the media  nor authorize any FBI officials to talk to the media. But look at this. An  Andrew McCabe's statement after getting fired he wrote this. \"The I.G.  investigation is focused on information I chose to share with a reporter  who my public affairs officer and legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I  was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a  secret place, it took place, and others including the director, meaning  James Comey were aware of the interaction with the reporter.</p><p> So Marc, did you catch that. The director meaning Comey was aware. So what  -- how does that stuck up with Comey saying what he said to Congress last  year about he didn't allow -- he never allow any of this.</p><p> LOTTER:  Clearly they've got contradicting stories and I think this is why  so many Republicans are saying we need another special investigator to look  at the way the FBI's conducted itself in a very small group at the highest  levels. We cannot have these inconsistencies if partisanship if things were  taking place in the Clinton investigation that was not aboveboard, that was  not inconsistent -- that was not consistent with their oath then when you  look into it.</p><p> And right now as you pointed out we see it happening where they are  contradicting each other and who said what and when.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Marc Lotter, great to see you. Thanks for coming on.</p><p> LOTTER:  Thanks, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Breaking news. Fox News confirming that the president is hiring  a new legal defense team to official to help in dealing with the special  counsel's Russia probe. Former Bush U.S. attorney Joseph DiGenova will join  President Trump's legal team. He has previously suggested that the Justice  Department and FBI framed the president. The edition that Mr. DiGenova as  the first change with legal teams since last summer.</p><p> Next up, one tiny Southern California it is standing up in defiance to the  big and the powerful in the sanctuary state of California. It's Los  Alamitos in Orange County. It wants to opt out of California sanctuary laws  that restrict cooperation between local police and federal immigration.  They are saying in Los Alamitos that swore an oath to uphold the  Constitution and what state is asking them to do is violating that oath. </p><p> We're bringing the mayor of that town Troy Edgar to speak out after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  One tiny Southern California town now standing up in defiance  to being powerful in the state of California. Los Alamitos wants to opt out  of California sanctuary laws that restrict cooperation between local police  and federal immigration agents.</p><p> Council members in the city now say they have sworn an oath to uphold the  Constitution and that California so-called sanctuary laws undercuts that  oath as well as federal law.</p><p> Let's bring in the mayor Los Alamitos, he's Troy Edgar. Good to see you,  mayor.</p><p> TROY EDGAR, MAYOR, LOST ALAMITOS, CALIFORNIA:  Hi, Liz. How are you doing?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Thanks for coming on. Can you spell out this fight and what  officials in your town are saying because we've got university professors  in California saying, you know what, you're right in the crosshairs of  lawsuits.</p><p> EDGAR:  Yes. You know, this is a small city in Southern California what  we're really trying to do is we're telling the state is, look, at this  point, you know, we are conflicted with the U.S. Constitution and Los  Alamitos we firmly believe that the U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of  the land and that the SP 54 sanctuary law is in conflict. And at this point  we're going to vote tonight to see if we will exempt ourselves from that.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, we've got -- we've run on the show, mayor, sheriffs  in California who are twisted into pretzel knots trying to abide by the  Constitution the federal law and what the state is telling them to do.</p><p> What I would like you know and I think the viewer wants to have you spoken  to other mayors in California, are there other cities like yours who do not  want to be part of the sanctuary state policies?</p><p> EDGAR:  Yes, there's a lot of mayors in California that don't want to be a  part of it, but you know it's a really tough situation because in our state  lot of this legislation comes out of Sacramento just seems disconnected  that they're not attached. You know, when you're mayor of a small town  immediately your constituents tell you how they feel where they're at and,  you know, you're going to find out that evening in the grocery store  whether you're doing a good job or not.</p><p> And I think a lot of the stuff is going on Sacramento people this  constantly saying to all of us on the council what is going on.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Have you experienced crime from illegal immigrants in your  town?</p><p> EDGAR:  No, I would say that we don't have a significant amount of crime  problems with illegal immigrants. I think for us this is a constitutional  issue that we're looking at and saying look, we are consistently being held  to different standards by the state. A lot of them unfunded this is another  one where they pass a law and now they're asking us to choose between the  U.S. Constitution and the state Constitution.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> EDGAR:  And I think based on our oath, you now, many of us want to stay and  focus on the U.S. Constitution.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, we're wondering if your vote tonight will set up a  chain reaction. Which other mayors are telling you that they agree with you  and want to opt out? What are the mayors of what town?</p><p> EDGAR:  Well, you know what, I think right now I think a lot of the mayors  are going to wait and see and how this is going to go.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But do you know they found?</p><p> EDGAR:  I do. But I I want to give them an opportunity to bring this upon  themselves and I've also talked to a different staff and city attorneys at  different city specially the elected city attorneys that the definitely  have a perspective on which direction they or their city may want to go.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Mayor, we have Sheriff Margaret Mims, she's in Fresno,  California. She's been speaking out against California sanctuary laws. I'd  like your reaction to what the sheriff said. Let's take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARGARET MIMS, SHERIFF, FRESNO COUNTY:  We need to stop vilifying our hard- working ICE agents and our federal law enforcement partners. They are doing  their jobs. Law enforcement has to enforce the law, teachers have to teach,  and preachers have to preach and we're not going to apologize any of us for  doing our jobs.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  So, mayor, do you hear from your local law enforcement the same  thing that the sheriff just said?</p><p> EDGAR:  You know what, I think that there is kind of two different  jurisdictions. The sheriff definitely deals with the county, Orange County  level and at L.A. County for us, but you know, the sheriff is little bit  different than the police chief. </p><p> And so, within our cities we all have police chiefs and we across the  different cities so have a lot of different types of things that are going  on. And I think tonight what we will hear --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But are your cops upset about it, are your cops upset about two  different standards they are dealing with?</p><p> EDGAR:  Now. You know what, I think at this point it's probably more the  counsel, you know, Mayor Pro Tem Kusumot has been really focused on this  and him and I together really want to kind of bring this up and have an  open discussion with the city council and start bringing stuff into this on  more formal basis.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Mayor Troy Edgar of Los Alamitos standing up in defiance  against California laws. Good to see you, mayor. Thanks you so much for  coming on.</p><p> EDGAR:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Now -- you, too. It appears to be the first driverless car  fatality on a public road it involved ridesharing company Uber. It has now  stop its self driving robot car program after a woman in Tempe, Arizona was  struck and killed by one of its robots cars. </p><p> Coming up, an attorney on who could be responsible, is it Uber or is it the  software? </p><p> But first, forget about distancing themselves. Reverend Al Sharpton is now  saying we are going to do a protest in support and in defense of anti- Semite and racist Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. </p><p> We're bringing on Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz to react after  this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LOUIS FARRAKHAN, LEADER, NATION OF ISLAM:  Hitler was a very great man. The  Satanic Jews. White folks are going down.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> FARRAKHAN:  Hear the Jews they don't like Farrakhan so they call me Hitler.  That's a good name. Hitler was a very great man.</p><p> Your country has been taken from you by the synagogue of Satan. The Satanic  Jews. White folks are going down.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Black activist groups including Al Sharpton's national action  network also Black Lives Matters -- matter and the New Black Panther Party  now organizing a protest in support of and in defense of the controversial  leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan. The groups are protesting a  congressional resolution condemning Farrakhan.</p><p> With me now Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz. First of all, Alan,  professor, rather, there are some other comments made by Farrakhan. Here's  one of them. The Jews talk about never again. You cannot say never again to  God because when he puts you in the oven you're in one indeed.</p><p> He also said the Jews of control over those agency -- agency of the  government. He also said this. When a woman does not know how to cook and  the right foods to cook she's preparing death for herself, her husband and  her children.</p><p> You know, Professor, Democrats like Maxine Waters, Al Green, Keith Ellison,  they also have links to Farrakhan. What's going on here?</p><p> ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL:  Well, first of all,  Farrakhan is not only an anti-Semite, he's anti-white, he's anti-woman,  he's anti-gay. He's anti everything decent in this country and when you get  bigots supporting him and people like Al Sharpton was has his own history  of anti-Semitism. </p><p> Black Lives Matter which singled out only Israel called genocide to an  apartheid country which was anti-Semitic as well. What we have in this  country as people who believe in an affirmative action program for racism  for African Americans. That if you're an African-American you can get away  with supporting anti-Semitism, anti-gay, anti-white --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But wait a minute, wait, wait, wait. Because you know, Trump is  being accused of racism but now we've got an MSNBC host Al Sharpton  defending this anti, you know, this anti-Semite, this racist anti-gay  individual. I don't understand why more people are not condemning Farrakhan  including Democrats.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Well, the Democrats should condemn him, the women's movement  should condemn him, gay rights movement should condemn him, everybody  should condemn him. And I don't never have understood why Al Sharpton was a  history of anti-Semitism, the history about lying and falsely accusing  people of crime should be on the major network.</p><p> If you had a white person who is equivalently racist against blacks and who  defended David Duke he would never ever get on the air on a national  network. And yet, we have affirmative action for black races and that's  just unjustified. We have zero tolerance for bigotry, racism, and anti- Semitism and under the standard at zero-tolerance are not only doesn't  Farrakhan satisfy it but neither does Sharpton, neither does Black Lives  Matter, and neither to the congressmen who were now standing in support of  a big anti-Semite.</p><p> Imagine if Republican congressmen standing in support of David Duke and  Farrakhan is much, much, much more dangerous than David Duke. Because  Farrakhan has the support of hundreds of thousands of African-Americans.  What's my source to that? My source to that is Sharpton who says that he  has massive support in the African-American community. </p><p> David Duke doesn't have any support and so we should not have a double  standard. And Democrats and all decent people should come out not only  against Farrakhan but any congressperson who supports Farrakhan.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, so let's get to one of those congressmen, professor. It's  Democrat Congressman of Illinois, he's Danny Davis. He tried to clarify his  position, he and his praise. Danny Davis has praise Farrakhan and has met  with Farrakhan.</p><p> Here's what he saying now. Quote, \"I disagree with Minister Farrakhan in  terms of white people being devils and Jewish people being Satanic. But I  also protect his right as a free individual to say and do whatever he wants  to do. I think he does outstanding things for, especially blacks who are  unsure about themselves and people who've been in prison.\"</p><p> Your reaction to that.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  People said the same thing about Adolf Hitler that he did good  things for the German people. You cannot justify this kind of bigotry by  saying that he also does some decent things. And I think it's a scandal  that the Democratic Party and liberals and the New York Times lets a black  bigots off the hook. Only a text to bigotry on the right. </p><p> Today the danger of bigotry is far greater from the hard left, from the  African-American community from the Muslim community, from many other  communities which tolerated (AUDIO GAP) bigotry than it is from the right.  Look, anti-Semitism was wrong for both the right and the left. We all  condemn it from the right, let's join together to condemn it from the left  regardless of the race of the person behind it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Professor Alan Dershowitz, we love having you on. Come back  soon, sir. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Any time. Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. The robot cars are supposed to stop fatalities. But  now it appears to be the first death caused by the robot car in a public  road. Ridesharing company Uber stopping its self-driving car program after  a woman in Arizona was struck and killed by one of its robot cars last  night.</p><p> We're bringing in an attorney on what this means for the car industry and  Silicon Valley.</p><p> But first, Hillary Clinton now backtracking now her none-apologize --  apology after implying last week that women who cast a ballot who voted for  Trump for this all due to pressure from their husbands. </p><p> My all-female power panel is here to react after this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS: It's not helpful at all. And in fact, my  friend Hillary Clinton is wrong.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We do not do  well with white men and we don't do well with married white women. And part  of that is a -- an identification with the Republican Party and a sort of  ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son,  whoever believes you should.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Hillary Clinton putting up a lengthy 861-word non-apology on  Facebook, trying to defend and explain her controversial comments about the  Trump campaign. It's called backwards that the state that didn't vote for  her are not optimistic, diverse or dynamic, and that white women vote like  their husband. She made those comments a week and a half ago in India.</p><p> But now Hillary Clinton says this. \"I also mentioned something in passing  that's got a lot of attention.\" She's saying now that she said in passing,  \"that there is anecdotal level and some research to suggest that women are  unfortunately more swayed by men than the other way around. As much as I  hate the possibility and hate saying it, it's not that crazy when you think  about our ongoing struggle to reach the gender balance even within the same  household. </p><p> I understand how some of what I said upset people and can be  misinterpreted. I mean, meant no disrespect to any individual or group. I  want to look to the future not just anybody.\"</p><p> With me now, the Federalist, Britt McHenry, and Democrat strategist,  Danielle McLaughlin. Britt, are you satisfied what is not apology. I mean,  why is Hillary even bringing up these things, why get into it?</p><p> BRITT MCHENRY, CONTRIBUTOR, THE FEDERALIST:  Absolutely not. Hillary  Clinton is like that relative, that strange relative that comes to family  gatherings and you just know that she's just going to say something  patronizing and offensive which she did.</p><p> Donald Trump 52 percent of white women votes, so she's right about that, 61  percent of white women without college degree. So in her non-apology she is  trying to say that those white women anyone watching this program right now  don't have gender equality in their household. It's ridiculous. And she  can't get out of her own way.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  And that they can't think for themselves --</p><p> MCHENRY:  Exactly.</p><p> MACDONALD:  -- they just follow what their husbands are doing. OK.  Danielle, Democrat Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin speaking out against  Clinton's comment. Let's listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DURBIN:  It's not helpful at all. And in fact, my friend Hillary Clinton is  wrong. Thirty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump had voted  for President Obama. Why? The same people who look for change with  President Obama thought wasn't enough for us, their personal lives were  concerned and they supported Donald Trump.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  How come more Democrats, Danielle are not joining Dick Durbin  and condemning comments like Hillary made?</p><p> DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I think because Dick  Durbin is right. You know, I don't think that what she said on that face --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But how come more Democrats -- how come more Democrats are not  stepping out and saying you know what, Hillary, you're wrong?</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  Well, I think plenty have in all honesty and they don't  because they probably wants to draw much attention to it. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Who?</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  But I will give the person credit for apologizing.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Who besides Dick Durbin has stepped up?</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  There have been a number of Democrats, there have been a  number of people on television who have said this as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Who?</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  I can name for you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Go ahead.</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  I mean, this is clearly something that you would never say and  shouldn't even say. But you know what? I give her credit for apologizing.  We have a president who has insulted many number of people.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  It wasn't an apology. Have you read it? Have you read it?  Danielle, have you read it? It was a non-apology.</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  And she said very much that --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  She didn't say she was sorry anywhere in that Facebook post.</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  Well, I mean, she said I mean I meant no disrespect. She did  not meant to hurt people or harm people that as far more that Donald Trump  has ever said when he talked about John McCain or Judge Curiel --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Understood. But we're talking about -- understood. I get what  you're saying. H has said an extraordinary inflammatory things.</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We get that and we've covered it here on the show.</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  I know --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  We're talking about Hillary right now. Britt, she's no apology  there.</p><p> MCHENRY:  There's no apology. And if Democrats want success they need more  moderate Democrats like we saw with Conor Lamb who won in a congressional  district that won by 20 points for Trump in Trump's favor in 2016. That's  going to send their message not that I particularly wanted to go over the  Democrats instead of this identity politics and just offensive rhetoric  from Hillary Clinton.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Britt and Danielle, thank you so much for coming on. I really  appreciate it.</p><p> MCHENRY:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Breaking news. Washington Post reporting that President Trump  is preparing by this Friday to hit China with tariffs on $60 billion worth  of goods that would double the what was earlier thought to be 30 billion,  now it's going to 60 billion. It could be 100 different types of products  hit with tariffs by this Friday.</p><p> This amid the escalation of trade tensions is going to four anonymous  senior administration officials. We're staying on that story for you.</p><p> Now it appears to be the first robot car death on a public road.  Ridesharing company Uber stopping its self-driving car program after a  woman in Arizona was struck and killed by one of its robot vehicle.</p><p> Attorney Emily Compagno on whether this is basically upends the entire  robot car industry. That's after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Cars are supposed to stop traffic fatalities but now a  bombshell. The first driverless robot car death in a public road evolving  ridesharing company Uber. It's now suspending its robot car program after  woman was struck and killed by one of its robot cars at 10 o'clock last  night in Tempe, Arizona.</p><p> Attorney Emily Compagno, I mean, how worried are you about robot cars  killing people? We thought they were supposed to stop traffic fatalities.</p><p> EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  Right. And it's hard because in this field which  is noble one death is one death too many but in the larger picture we see  over -- we see up to 50 million disabled and injury results from car  crashes a year and millions death, right, it's the highest -- it's the  highest cause of death in the country.</p><p> But again, the argument for autonomous vehicle in part is that it's  supposed to be safer because it removes that human element. But in  situations like this is it possible that the human element the ability to  be malleable and to react to things that that ultimately what would render  an autonomous vehicle safer.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> COMPAGNO:  So it kind of begs a larger question, right? But what we're  seeing this play out is going to be in a regulatory field. The reason that  Arizona has so many tech companies playing in that field now it's because  they've said they taking an accommodating approach to not regulate the  autonomous riding field there.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. You know, Emily, I hear what you're saying. We hear  so many glowing statements about how great robot cars are going to be. But  you know what's not being discussed, Emily, is this. Robot cars have been  found to not properly read highway signs if those highway signs have been  slightly altered. They don't know how to read it. And some of these were  about cars don't even network and talk to other robot cars.</p><p> That's the big deal for Apple. Apple can have its own Apple closed system  in these cars. So the thing is, Emily, we still haven't figured out who is  going to be liable for robot car death. Is it companies like Uber or the  software?</p><p> COMPAGNO:  Right. Well, in every case it's going to be a different analysis  as to who or what is responsible, right? So we saw in a large accident  earlier that didn't involve a fatality that human driver that was in the  autonomous vehicle he was ultimately held responsible because of that. </p><p> In another major crash it was the other driver of the car that T-bone the  autonomous driving vehicle. And I think the larger answer to your question  is that this is why test phase is so important. This is why we're not ready  to hit the road yet. This is why kind of a phase physical area for these  cars to be tested is so crucial.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right. Bingo.</p><p> COMPAGNO:  Because otherwise of course now we'll see more fatalities.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You just nailed it. That's the thing, Emily. Because this is  like a -- we're just at the beginning stages of this and now we have a  woman killed by a robot car, right? I mean, this is a big deal.</p><p> COMPAGNO:  Yes. And note that just next month or in April, California has  maintained that they will now allow test writing of these autonomous  vehicles without the human driver inside, right? Up until now it's just  been Arizona. So that's something that we're going to see now a huge test  zone there, that's a physical fight at the Silicon Valley, right. So we'll  see a lot more.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Emily, we need you back on. We love having you on to break it  all down and drill into this. You're terrific. Please come back on the  show. Good to see you.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  More after the break. Don't go away.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Breaking news on the Facebook data mining breach. Cambridge  Analytica they're accused of abusing the Facebook data of potentially  millions of Facebook users.

This industry darling led the market up last year and through  much of this year quite a different take today. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Cambridge Analytica was able to  can collect the data from 50 million people's profiles without permission.  In the U.S., in Europe, in the U.K. are calling for investigations Facebook  is in the crosshairs. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Social media companies are trading  lower today. I guess in sympathy. Twitter, Snap, Google all lower.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  People are starting to grow tired of social media. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, yes.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Facebook basically can't be escape. This is something  that as far --</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Everybody in their mother now saying we are going to  investigate.</p><p> ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Facebook privacy hitting markets  really hard today. Facebook having its worst day in five and half years.  The Dow also are down nearly 500 points at session lows at tech is drag  down in sympathy. The NASDAQ slid nearly 2 percent. Facebook dragging tech  stock lower.</p><p> This, after reports that the personal Facebook data of an estimated 50  million people were harvested without their permission for political ad.  You will not believe what we found that Facebook has on you. One hundred  separate bits of information. We're going to show you what Facebook is  collecting about you. E.U. also threatening a whopping 3 percent tax on  tech company sales as well.</p><p> And this now breaking. The Connecticut Attorney General's office is  initiating an inquiry into Facebook data policy after that report. </p><p> Also tonight, could Andrew McCabe, the fired former FBI deputy director  incriminate the fired FBI James Comey, not just release to the media but  for also lying to Congress. We got the sound and the debate coming up.  We're on it. </p><p> And a tiny California town now defiantly fighting back against California  sanctuary policy, saying it will instead follow their sworn oath to defend  the Constitution and uphold immigration laws. It's the City of Los Alamitos  it's voted tonight to not be a sanctuary city. It faces the threat of  lawsuits in California condemnation as well. The mayor of that town here to  talk about the fight. </p><p> Plus, driverless robot cars, now they were supposed to reduce traffic  fatalities by eliminating human error. But now a robot car from ridesharing  company Uber has killed a pedestrian in Arizona. It happened last night. So  what will happen to the robot revolution? That's now in the works of a slew  of auto companies like Tesla, G.M. Ford and also Silicon Valley. We're  bringing an expert to weigh in.</p><p> Tonight, an all-guest lineup. Economist Ben Stein, former special assistant  to President Trump, Marc Lotter, legal eagle Harvard Law professor Alan  Dershowitz, the Federalist Britt McHenry, all here all tonight. </p><p> Politics, money, we got you covered. I'm Elizabeth McDonald. Risk and  Reward starts right now. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  I wish I could tell you that we're going  to be able to stop all interference but that just wouldn't be realistic.  There will always be bad actors in the world and we can't prevent all  governments from all interference. But we can make it harder. We can make  it much harder and that's what we're going to focus on doing. </p><p> We won't catch everyone immediately but we can make it harder to try to  determine (Ph).</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MACDONALD:  The Dow down 335 points closing to that 24,610. The NASDAQ  taking hits, that was down as well. Facebook stocks ending more than 6  percent down or 12 points lower after suspending a political analysis firm  Cambridge Analytics after reports that the research firm harvested personal  Facebook data on 270,000 Facebook users without their permission. </p><p> Now you can't Facebook friends and family. The breach may affect an  estimated 50 million people. It's being Facebook Equifax breach. The  research firm also reportedly told Facebook it did delete the user info  when it did not. Pretty scary stuff. </p><p> There's actually a really long list of things that Facebook knows about  you. We counted a hundred different things. For example, where you live,  your age, your education, income, net worth, your wedding anniversary  birthday whether you recently moved. </p><p> If you're in a long-distance relationship, whether you are conservative or  liberal, whether you like would you're likely to buy your next car, how  many workers your company has, whether you carry a credit card balance. The  time of year your household shops and the most types of vacations you take,  the pets you have, and so on, and so on, and so on, more and more and more. </p><p> But first, Lori Rothman on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on the  market drop after reports of this privacy breach at Facebook. You know,  Lori, Facebook faces a threat of federal fines. The tech sector also  dropping after the E.U. threaten to slap U.S. tech companies with a 3  percent tax of sales and revenues. Wow, Lori.</p><p> LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  One, two punch against the tech  sector today and that just drag down the broad market. We had the Dow  closing down 335 points today, believe it or not that's well, well more  than a hundred points off the session low for the Dow. Down now negative  temperature territory for 2018. </p><p> The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ didn't fare much better. The NASDAQ was the worst in  the benchmark three but it's still holding up for the year. There you see  on your screen the NASDAQ fell 137 points blame Facebook. </p><p> But here is the thing that's got everyone here on Wall Street thinking. If  Facebook is misusing customer data, user data, well, all of these tech  companies use our data. They mine our data. We plug our data in. How do  they get it, what do they do with it when they have it. And really how do  they protect every day users. </p><p> So, a lot of the big tech company CEO's have been called upon by both  Democrats and Republicans to testify about that. And then you mention this  potential tax 3 percent by the E.U. on the tech company revenue. </p><p> So the good times may be over for tech. That was the thinking and the  concern today on Wall Street, obviously nothing for sure on that front but  any news of that degree again. Again, a one-two punch. The Facebook news  and then the tax. My goodness. You're going to have some trouble. </p><p> And then of course you can talk about the ongoing trade and tariff  controversy as well. So we did have a broad base rally, it wasn't just  technology. All 10 S&amp;P sectors were in the red today. </p><p> We do want to bring you up-to-date on some mergers, merger Monday. Well,  actually this one in particular is going nowhere. I'm talking about AT&amp;T  and Time Warner shares both down in excess of 1 percent. AT&amp;T tried today  to get a judge to throw out evidence. It seems to show its $85 billion  acquisition of Time Warner is bad for consumers and competition. </p><p> Now the Justice Department as you know did file a lawsuit back in November  to stop this combination opening arguments in this case are still scheduled  to begin on Wednesday. We're following it. Liz, back to you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Lori. Thank you so much.</p><p> ROTHMAN:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Now this firm that's denying claims of abusing and have taking  without consent the data of millions of Facebook users. That's called  Cambridge Analytics. This as Facebook hired a digital forensic firm to do  an audit of Cambridge Analytica systems. </p><p> Politicians now pressuring Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg for answers on what's  going on. The word is Mark Zuckerberg may have to testify before Congress.  Remember he has political leanings. </p><p> Gerri Willis has more. Gerri?</p><p> WILLIS:  Hi, Liz. That's right. You know, just the latest on the latest on  this incredibly fast moving story. Here's what Facebook had to say about  hiring a digital forensics firm. Listen to this. \"We hired a digital  forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg to conduct a comprehensive audit, they say,  of Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica has agreed to comply and afford  the firm complete access to their servers and systems.\" </p><p> So that's a move forward here I supposed for Facebook. The other thing  that's going on and this again, this is just out moments ago. Connecticut  is launching, the attorney general there, a probe into what's gone on with  Facebook. So that's something new. Reaction was swift and then you have on  two continents with both the E.U. and the Massachusetts Attorney General  Maura Healey launching probes. Yet Facebook says the situation is unlike  data breaches, breaches that have plagued American companies. </p><p> For years now, here's what Facebook said. The claim that this is data  breach is completely false. People knowingly provided their information. No  systems were infiltrated. No passwords or sensitive pieces of information.  We're still and or hack. At issues that hundreds of thousands of a Facebook  users were paid to download to take a personality test and agreed to have  their data collected, they agreed to it. The app was called this is your  digital life. </p><p> Facebook later change its policy and didn't allow this kind of scraping to  be done. But Cambridge had retained access to the data as late as 2015.  Cambridge now says no info from the company that provided the data was used  in the 2016 election. Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook  terms of service.</p><p> And back to you, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. Wow, what a story, Gerri. Thank you so much for coming on.  We really appreciate it. </p><p> Now remember Mark Zuckerberg's New Year's resolution. He vowed to fix  Facebook and to correct persistent problems that had dogged the networks.  Let's take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Now we're going to explore ways that we can share more  information about anyone attempting to interfere with elections. We are  working proactively to strengthen the democratic process. Beyond pushing  back against threats we will also create more services to protect our  community while engaging in political discourse.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's bring in the economist and author of \"The Capitalist  Code\" Ben Stein. You know, Ben, this is kind of making people unsettled and  uncomfortable. It's astonishing how much information Facebook has on you  and also your kids. </p><p> BEN STEIN, ECONOMIST:  It is astonishing in a way but it doesn't really  affect Facebook as an investment. I mean, Facebook is still a very powerful  company filling an enormously large niche and void in the American life.  Facebook in a way has become an almost spiritual guide to human  companionship and human fellowship. And almost spiritual guide and antidote  to human loneliness. </p><p> I don't think that one day's notes about somebody misusing data or maybe  not using data are going to change that. I can still consider stocks a  fantastically important part of anyone's portfolio.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, I know what you mean that people could connect with their  family and their friends. But the fact remains that this looks like  Facebook's equivalent of the Equifax breach.</p><p> If info is going to help political campaigns the allegation was the Trump  campaign benefit. Also a former Obama campaign staffer candidly admits,  Ben, that Facebook let the Obama campaign quote, \"improperly access  Facebook user dater -- data. The staffer, her name is Carol Davidson. She  said this. \"Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole  social graph, but they did not stop us once they realized that what we were  doing. They came to office in the days after the election recruiting and  were very candid that they let us do things they would not have allowed  someone else to do because they were on our side.\" </p><p> That was back in 2012. I mean, that's six years ago, Ben. Now Facebook is  returning itself as sort of discomforted by all thing, all this. But you  know, that was Obama's campaign. We don't want to get too political about  this. But what is going on with Silicon Valley companies letting people  access data. </p><p> STEIN:  Well, what's going on is that it's going to, it's bound to happen.  The internet is not a closed system. The internet is a system that people  can get into, a very clever people can get into even if it's tightly sealed  up. We know that the Russians and the Chinese are able to get into it even  if we think it's sealed tightly as a drum.</p><p> What I want to go after is, is it still a good investment. And I say it's  still is a very good investment. And the fact that people are upset about  their data being accessed is too bad. And it's upsetting. And we don't want  it to happen. And we want people's privacy to be respected. But we also  want to be realistic about this. How is it possibly going to affect their  earnings unless there's absolutely stupendous fine. I think --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. But you know, they're so, you know, they have so much  information, Ben, they could pretty much accurately predict what kind of  car you are going to buy, what kind of house you're going to buy, and where  your kids are going to college. </p><p> STEIN:  Absolutely.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'm not sure Americans realize how much Facebook knows about  them. </p><p> STEIN:  I'm not sure they do either, but I'm going to what the show is  about, what you are wonderfully about in Fox Business is about which is  making money. And that is I don't think anything we've learned in the last  several days is going to affect whether or not Facebook is going to --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Ben, stay on that for a second. Hang on one second.  Because some Americans want Facebook fined, hit with penalties for its role  in the Russian meddling during the election. </p><p> Remember, you and I were talking about this, Ben, how Russian internet  trolls loaded Facebook up with fake news. Even fake Facebook Russia-backed  political rallies. Should Facebook be fined for that?</p><p> STEIN:  Maybe they should be and maybe they shouldn't be. I don't think the  Russia Trump collusion has improved to that any meaningful effect on the  campaign at all on way or the other. And I think the more they push that  the more they find that there's nothing at the end of the string. You can  only push the string so far. </p><p> I'm not worried about that Russia Trump collusion because I don't it ever  happen. If it did happened, it happen as such a minor scale that hardly  matters at all. What I'm concerned about is this, is it still a good  business to be in a business of providing communication for hundreds of  millions and billions of people all around the world who would otherwise be  sitting on lonely twiddling their thumbs. </p><p> And I think they're still a very, very good business. And the fact that  they can access all of this information about all kinds of people in  America or in Mexico or in Cuba or probably not Cuba, or anywhere tells us  that this is still a very, very strong investment. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> STEIN:  This stick on me that it's just an absolutely a house on fire in  terms of power and I don't think there's going to be any stopping short of  abolishing it. I don't anyone dares to abolish them. </p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Ben Stein, good to see you. Thank you so much for  coming on. </p><p> STEIN:  It's an honor as always.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Same here. It appears to be the first driverless, well, there  was a driver but this is on automatic mode. It was on robot mode. A robot  car killed somebody in Tempe, Arizona. Ridesharing company Uber that it was  this car it now stopped its self-driving car program. An Arizona woman  struck and killed by one of the robot vehicles. It happened last night  around 10 o'clock.</p><p> Coming up, we're bringing in an expert who is saying who is responsible.  We're going to get to the bottom on who's to blame and who could face  liability. Is it the car company Uber or is it the software.</p><p> Also this. One tiny Southern California town now sitting up in defiance to  the big and powerful in the sanctuary state. It's the town of Los Alamitos  in Orange County. It wants to opt out of California's sanctuary laws. The  mayor of that town here to talk about it. </p><p> But first, could Andrew McCabe the fired former FBI deputy director, could  he incriminate the fired FBI former Director James Comey, not just release  to the media but for also for lying to Congress. We got the sound, we're  going to drill into this debate, coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. ANGUS KING (I), MAINE: It just seem mean-spirited to come down on a  guy within 48 hours of his scheduled retirement. It was clearly rushed and  I think there are questions about that and whether the administration was  putting pressure on the Justice Department to take this action. </p><p> SEN. JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA:  It was a horrible day for democracy. To have  firings like this happening at the top from the president and the attorney  general does not speak well for what's going on. </p><p> SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA:  I don't like it happened. He should have  been allowed to finish through the weekend.</p><p> REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA:  You know, his firing may be justified,  there's no way for us to know at this point. But though it may have been  justified it can also be tainted.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  A number of congressmen and senators up and arms of the firing  of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. It was a recommendation from the  FBI's own Office of Professional Responsibility they said yes, fire him.</p><p> Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy reminding everyone it was McCabe's fault.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Andy McCabe was undercut his  credibility all by himself. he didn't any help doing that and I thought it  richly ironic that he is lamenting that those are attacking the FBI when he  himself does the exact same thing. It was the FBI who said he made an  unauthorized disclosure and then a lied about it. </p><p> That wasn't President Trump, it wasn't me, it wasn't the crazy House  Republicans. It was his own fellow FBI agents the said he leaked and then  lied about it. So if he's got credibility issues he need look no further  than himself.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Joining me now former special assistant to Present Trump, Marc  Lotter. Marc, what's your take on McCabe's firing?</p><p> MARC LOTTER, FORMER ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think it sounds it was  completely justified. You had an inspector general report the Office of  Professional Responsibility and then the senior career official at the  department all made these recommendations so that's what the attorney  general acted on. </p><p> And I think what we're seeing right now is a case of many other Democrats  and some of their friends in the mainstream media are trying to have it  both ways. When someone pleads guilty to lying to investigators that are on  the Republican side it's breaking news and it's proof that something is  amiss except when someone is accused of doing the same thing to federal  officials on the other side will then they're just trying to play \"Cry Me a  River,\" so they can't have it both ways.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. People go to prison for misleading the FBI. I mean, McCabe  is accused of misleading Justice Department investigating -- in  investigators about his leaking of sensitive information to Wall Street  Journal reporter about the FBI's investigation of pay to play at the  Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. </p><p> McCabe now says, Marc, that he had authority to quote share that  information with the media and Director James Comey knew about that. But  Marc, the issue is really covering up the leak, right? So is there anything  wrong with the way he was fired?</p><p> LOTTER:  Well, obviously the inspector general report which we have not  seen yet does suggest that there were some sort of improprieties in the way  he was conducting his business. And when you follow that on with the Office  of professional Responsibility and the senior career official in the  department all making me this conclusion then something there is amiss and  it may just be lying or misleading investigators or maybe something more to  it.</p><p> But we got to be honest here. We can't -- we cannot, as a country, tolerate  any kind of impropriety when it comes to members of law enforcement at any  level. We place our trust in them to act honorably within the bounds of  their oath. If they don't, we need to get to that right away.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, former FBI Director James Comey is coming out with  his book right at the same time this I.G. report is coming up from the  Justice Department. But here's the problem for James Comey. The firing of  Andrew McCabe may cause problems for James Comey.</p><p> Remember when Comey said this under oath last year.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source  in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the  Clinton investigation?</p><p> JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  Never.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Question 21 relatively related. Have you ever authorize  someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source is news reports about the  Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?</p><p> COMEY:  No.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. So Comey said under oath he never was a source of the media  nor authorize any FBI officials to talk to the media. But look at this. An  Andrew McCabe's statement after getting fired he wrote this. \"The I.G.  investigation is focused on information I chose to share with a reporter  who my public affairs officer and legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I  was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a  secret place, it took place, and others including the director, meaning  James Comey were aware of the interaction with the reporter.</p><p> So Marc, did you catch that. The director meaning Comey was aware. So what  -- how does that stuck up with Comey saying what he said to Congress last  year about he didn't allow -- he never allow any of this.</p><p> LOTTER:  Clearly they've got contradicting stories and I think this is why  so many Republicans are saying we need another special investigator to look  at the way the FBI's conducted itself in a very small group at the highest  levels. We cannot have these inconsistencies if partisanship if things were  taking place in the Clinton investigation that was not aboveboard, that was  not inconsistent -- that was not consistent with their oath then when you  look into it.</p><p> And right now as you pointed out we see it happening where they are  contradicting each other and who said what and when.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Marc Lotter, great to see you. Thanks for coming on.</p><p> LOTTER:  Thanks, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Breaking news. Fox News confirming that the president is hiring  a new legal defense team to official to help in dealing with the special  counsel's Russia probe. Former Bush U.S. attorney Joseph DiGenova will join  President Trump's legal team. He has previously suggested that the Justice  Department and FBI framed the president. The edition that Mr. DiGenova as  the first change with legal teams since last summer.</p><p> Next up, one tiny Southern California it is standing up in defiance to the  big and the powerful in the sanctuary state of California. It's Los  Alamitos in Orange County. It wants to opt out of California sanctuary laws  that restrict cooperation between local police and federal immigration.  They are saying in Los Alamitos that swore an oath to uphold the  Constitution and what state is asking them to do is violating that oath. </p><p> We're bringing the mayor of that town Troy Edgar to speak out after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  One tiny Southern California town now standing up in defiance  to being powerful in the state of California. Los Alamitos wants to opt out  of California sanctuary laws that restrict cooperation between local police  and federal immigration agents.</p><p> Council members in the city now say they have sworn an oath to uphold the  Constitution and that California so-called sanctuary laws undercuts that  oath as well as federal law.</p><p> Let's bring in the mayor Los Alamitos, he's Troy Edgar. Good to see you,  mayor.</p><p> TROY EDGAR, MAYOR, LOST ALAMITOS, CALIFORNIA:  Hi, Liz. How are you doing?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Thanks for coming on. Can you spell out this fight and what  officials in your town are saying because we've got university professors  in California saying, you know what, you're right in the crosshairs of  lawsuits.</p><p> EDGAR:  Yes. You know, this is a small city in Southern California what  we're really trying to do is we're telling the state is, look, at this  point, you know, we are conflicted with the U.S. Constitution and Los  Alamitos we firmly believe that the U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of  the land and that the SP 54 sanctuary law is in conflict. And at this point  we're going to vote tonight to see if we will exempt ourselves from that.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, we've got -- we've run on the show, mayor, sheriffs  in California who are twisted into pretzel knots trying to abide by the  Constitution the federal law and what the state is telling them to do.</p><p> What I would like you know and I think the viewer wants to have you spoken  to other mayors in California, are there other cities like yours who do not  want to be part of the sanctuary state policies?</p><p> EDGAR:  Yes, there's a lot of mayors in California that don't want to be a  part of it, but you know it's a really tough situation because in our state  lot of this legislation comes out of Sacramento just seems disconnected  that they're not attached. You know, when you're mayor of a small town  immediately your constituents tell you how they feel where they're at and,  you know, you're going to find out that evening in the grocery store  whether you're doing a good job or not.</p><p> And I think a lot of the stuff is going on Sacramento people this  constantly saying to all of us on the council what is going on.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Have you experienced crime from illegal immigrants in your  town?</p><p> EDGAR:  No, I would say that we don't have a significant amount of crime  problems with illegal immigrants. I think for us this is a constitutional  issue that we're looking at and saying look, we are consistently being held  to different standards by the state. A lot of them unfunded this is another  one where they pass a law and now they're asking us to choose between the  U.S. Constitution and the state Constitution.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> EDGAR:  And I think based on our oath, you now, many of us want to stay and  focus on the U.S. Constitution.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, we're wondering if your vote tonight will set up a  chain reaction. Which other mayors are telling you that they agree with you  and want to opt out? What are the mayors of what town?</p><p> EDGAR:  Well, you know what, I think right now I think a lot of the mayors  are going to wait and see and how this is going to go.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But do you know they found?</p><p> EDGAR:  I do. But I I want to give them an opportunity to bring this upon  themselves and I've also talked to a different staff and city attorneys at  different city specially the elected city attorneys that the definitely  have a perspective on which direction they or their city may want to go.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Mayor, we have Sheriff Margaret Mims, she's in Fresno,  California. She's been speaking out against California sanctuary laws. I'd  like your reaction to what the sheriff said. Let's take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARGARET MIMS, SHERIFF, FRESNO COUNTY:  We need to stop vilifying our hard- working ICE agents and our federal law enforcement partners. They are doing  their jobs. Law enforcement has to enforce the law, teachers have to teach,  and preachers have to preach and we're not going to apologize any of us for  doing our jobs.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  So, mayor, do you hear from your local law enforcement the same  thing that the sheriff just said?</p><p> EDGAR:  You know what, I think that there is kind of two different  jurisdictions. The sheriff definitely deals with the county, Orange County  level and at L.A. County for us, but you know, the sheriff is little bit  different than the police chief. </p><p> And so, within our cities we all have police chiefs and we across the  different cities so have a lot of different types of things that are going  on. And I think tonight what we will hear --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But are your cops upset about it, are your cops upset about two  different standards they are dealing with?</p><p> EDGAR:  Now. You know what, I think at this point it's probably more the  counsel, you know, Mayor Pro Tem Kusumot has been really focused on this  and him and I together really want to kind of bring this up and have an  open discussion with the city council and start bringing stuff into this on  more formal basis.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Mayor Troy Edgar of Los Alamitos standing up in defiance  against California laws. Good to see you, mayor. Thanks you so much for  coming on.</p><p> EDGAR:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Now -- you, too. It appears to be the first driverless car  fatality on a public road it involved ridesharing company Uber. It has now  stop its self driving robot car program after a woman in Tempe, Arizona was  struck and killed by one of its robots cars. </p><p> Coming up, an attorney on who could be responsible, is it Uber or is it the  software? </p><p> But first, forget about distancing themselves. Reverend Al Sharpton is now  saying we are going to do a protest in support and in defense of anti- Semite and racist Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. </p><p> We're bringing on Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz to react after  this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LOUIS FARRAKHAN, LEADER, NATION OF ISLAM:  Hitler was a very great man. The  Satanic Jews. White folks are going down.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> FARRAKHAN:  Hear the Jews they don't like Farrakhan so they call me Hitler.  That's a good name. Hitler was a very great man.</p><p> Your country has been taken from you by the synagogue of Satan. The Satanic  Jews. White folks are going down.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Black activist groups including Al Sharpton's national action  network also Black Lives Matters -- matter and the New Black Panther Party  now organizing a protest in support of and in defense of the controversial  leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan. The groups are protesting a  congressional resolution condemning Farrakhan.</p><p> With me now Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz. First of all, Alan,  professor, rather, there are some other comments made by Farrakhan. Here's  one of them. The Jews talk about never again. You cannot say never again to  God because when he puts you in the oven you're in one indeed.</p><p> He also said the Jews of control over those agency -- agency of the  government. He also said this. When a woman does not know how to cook and  the right foods to cook she's preparing death for herself, her husband and  her children.</p><p> You know, Professor, Democrats like Maxine Waters, Al Green, Keith Ellison,  they also have links to Farrakhan. What's going on here?</p><p> ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL:  Well, first of all,  Farrakhan is not only an anti-Semite, he's anti-white, he's anti-woman,  he's anti-gay. He's anti everything decent in this country and when you get  bigots supporting him and people like Al Sharpton was has his own history  of anti-Semitism. </p><p> Black Lives Matter which singled out only Israel called genocide to an  apartheid country which was anti-Semitic as well. What we have in this  country as people who believe in an affirmative action program for racism  for African Americans. That if you're an African-American you can get away  with supporting anti-Semitism, anti-gay, anti-white --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But wait a minute, wait, wait, wait. Because you know, Trump is  being accused of racism but now we've got an MSNBC host Al Sharpton  defending this anti, you know, this anti-Semite, this racist anti-gay  individual. I don't understand why more people are not condemning Farrakhan  including Democrats.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Well, the Democrats should condemn him, the women's movement  should condemn him, gay rights movement should condemn him, everybody  should condemn him. And I don't never have understood why Al Sharpton was a  history of anti-Semitism, the history about lying and falsely accusing  people of crime should be on the major network.</p><p> If you had a white person who is equivalently racist against blacks and who  defended David Duke he would never ever get on the air on a national  network. And yet, we have affirmative action for black races and that's  just unjustified. We have zero tolerance for bigotry, racism, and anti- Semitism and under the standard at zero-tolerance are not only doesn't  Farrakhan satisfy it but neither does Sharpton, neither does Black Lives  Matter, and neither to the congressmen who were now standing in support of  a big anti-Semite.</p><p> Imagine if Republican congressmen standing in support of David Duke and  Farrakhan is much, much, much more dangerous than David Duke. Because  Farrakhan has the support of hundreds of thousands of African-Americans.  What's my source to that? My source to that is Sharpton who says that he  has massive support in the African-American community. </p><p> David Duke doesn't have any support and so we should not have a double  standard. And Democrats and all decent people should come out not only  against Farrakhan but any congressperson who supports Farrakhan.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, so let's get to one of those congressmen, professor. It's  Democrat Congressman of Illinois, he's Danny Davis. He tried to clarify his  position, he and his praise. Danny Davis has praise Farrakhan and has met  with Farrakhan.</p><p> Here's what he saying now. Quote, \"I disagree with Minister Farrakhan in  terms of white people being devils and Jewish people being Satanic. But I  also protect his right as a free individual to say and do whatever he wants  to do. I think he does outstanding things for, especially blacks who are  unsure about themselves and people who've been in prison.\"</p><p> Your reaction to that.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  People said the same thing about Adolf Hitler that he did good  things for the German people. You cannot justify this kind of bigotry by  saying that he also does some decent things. And I think it's a scandal  that the Democratic Party and liberals and the New York Times lets a black  bigots off the hook. Only a text to bigotry on the right. </p><p> Today the danger of bigotry is far greater from the hard left, from the  African-American community from the Muslim community, from many other  communities which tolerated (AUDIO GAP) bigotry than it is from the right.  Look, anti-Semitism was wrong for both the right and the left. We all  condemn it from the right, let's join together to condemn it from the left  regardless of the race of the person behind it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Professor Alan Dershowitz, we love having you on. Come back  soon, sir. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Any time. Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. The robot cars are supposed to stop fatalities. But  now it appears to be the first death caused by the robot car in a public  road. Ridesharing company Uber stopping its self-driving car program after  a woman in Arizona was struck and killed by one of its robot cars last  night.</p><p> We're bringing in an attorney on what this means for the car industry and  Silicon Valley.</p><p> But first, Hillary Clinton now backtracking now her none-apologize --  apology after implying last week that women who cast a ballot who voted for  Trump for this all due to pressure from their husbands. </p><p> My all-female power panel is here to react after this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS: It's not helpful at all. And in fact, my  friend Hillary Clinton is wrong.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We do not do  well with white men and we don't do well with married white women. And part  of that is a -- an identification with the Republican Party and a sort of  ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son,  whoever believes you should.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Hillary Clinton putting up a lengthy 861-word non-apology on  Facebook, trying to defend and explain her controversial comments about the  Trump campaign. It's called backwards that the state that didn't vote for  her are not optimistic, diverse or dynamic, and that white women vote like  their husband. She made those comments a week and a half ago in India.</p><p> But now Hillary Clinton says this. \"I also mentioned something in passing  that's got a lot of attention.\" She's saying now that she said in passing,  \"that there is anecdotal level and some research to suggest that women are  unfortunately more swayed by men than the other way around. As much as I  hate the possibility and hate saying it, it's not that crazy when you think  about our ongoing struggle to reach the gender balance even within the same  household. </p><p> I understand how some of what I said upset people and can be  misinterpreted. I mean, meant no disrespect to any individual or group. I  want to look to the future not just anybody.\"</p><p> With me now, the Federalist, Britt McHenry, and Democrat strategist,  Danielle McLaughlin. Britt, are you satisfied what is not apology. I mean,  why is Hillary even bringing up these things, why get into it?</p><p> BRITT MCHENRY, CONTRIBUTOR, THE FEDERALIST:  Absolutely not. Hillary  Clinton is like that relative, that strange relative that comes to family  gatherings and you just know that she's just going to say something  patronizing and offensive which she did.</p><p> Donald Trump 52 percent of white women votes, so she's right about that, 61  percent of white women without college degree. So in her non-apology she is  trying to say that those white women anyone watching this program right now  don't have gender equality in their household. It's ridiculous. And she  can't get out of her own way.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  And that they can't think for themselves --</p><p> MCHENRY:  Exactly.</p><p> MACDONALD:  -- they just follow what their husbands are doing. OK.  Danielle, Democrat Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin speaking out against  Clinton's comment. Let's listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DURBIN:  It's not helpful at all. And in fact, my friend Hillary Clinton is  wrong. Thirty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump had voted  for President Obama. Why? The same people who look for change with  President Obama thought wasn't enough for us, their personal lives were  concerned and they supported Donald Trump.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  How come more Democrats, Danielle are not joining Dick Durbin  and condemning comments like Hillary made?</p><p> DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I think because Dick  Durbin is right. You know, I don't think that what she said on that face --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But how come more Democrats -- how come more Democrats are not  stepping out and saying you know what, Hillary, you're wrong?</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  Well, I think plenty have in all honesty and they don't  because they probably wants to draw much attention to it. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Who?</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  But I will give the person credit for apologizing.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Who besides Dick Durbin has stepped up?</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  There have been a number of Democrats, there have been a  number of people on television who have said this as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Who?</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  I can name for you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Go ahead.</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  I mean, this is clearly something that you would never say and  shouldn't even say. But you know what? I give her credit for apologizing.  We have a president who has insulted many number of people.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  It wasn't an apology. Have you read it? Have you read it?  Danielle, have you read it? It was a non-apology.</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  And she said very much that --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  She didn't say she was sorry anywhere in that Facebook post.</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  Well, I mean, she said I mean I meant no disrespect. She did  not meant to hurt people or harm people that as far more that Donald Trump  has ever said when he talked about John McCain or Judge Curiel --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Understood. But we're talking about -- understood. I get what  you're saying. H has said an extraordinary inflammatory things.</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We get that and we've covered it here on the show.</p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  I know --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  We're talking about Hillary right now. Britt, she's no apology  there.</p><p> MCHENRY:  There's no apology. And if Democrats want success they need more  moderate Democrats like we saw with Conor Lamb who won in a congressional  district that won by 20 points for Trump in Trump's favor in 2016. That's  going to send their message not that I particularly wanted to go over the  Democrats instead of this identity politics and just offensive rhetoric  from Hillary Clinton.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Britt and Danielle, thank you so much for coming on. I really  appreciate it.</p><p> MCHENRY:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Breaking news. Washington Post reporting that President Trump  is preparing by this Friday to hit China with tariffs on $60 billion worth  of goods that would double the what was earlier thought to be 30 billion,  now it's going to 60 billion. It could be 100 different types of products  hit with tariffs by this Friday.</p><p> This amid the escalation of trade tensions is going to four anonymous  senior administration officials. We're staying on that story for you.</p><p> Now it appears to be the first robot car death on a public road.  Ridesharing company Uber stopping its self-driving car program after a  woman in Arizona was struck and killed by one of its robot vehicle.</p><p> Attorney Emily Compagno on whether this is basically upends the entire  robot car industry. That's after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Cars are supposed to stop traffic fatalities but now a  bombshell. The first driverless robot car death in a public road evolving  ridesharing company Uber. It's now suspending its robot car program after  woman was struck and killed by one of its robot cars at 10 o'clock last  night in Tempe, Arizona.</p><p> Attorney Emily Compagno, I mean, how worried are you about robot cars  killing people? We thought they were supposed to stop traffic fatalities.</p><p> EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  Right. And it's hard because in this field which  is noble one death is one death too many but in the larger picture we see  over -- we see up to 50 million disabled and injury results from car  crashes a year and millions death, right, it's the highest -- it's the  highest cause of death in the country.</p><p> But again, the argument for autonomous vehicle in part is that it's  supposed to be safer because it removes that human element. But in  situations like this is it possible that the human element the ability to  be malleable and to react to things that that ultimately what would render  an autonomous vehicle safer.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> COMPAGNO:  So it kind of begs a larger question, right? But what we're  seeing this play out is going to be in a regulatory field. The reason that  Arizona has so many tech companies playing in that field now it's because  they've said they taking an accommodating approach to not regulate the  autonomous riding field there.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. You know, Emily, I hear what you're saying. We hear  so many glowing statements about how great robot cars are going to be. But  you know what's not being discussed, Emily, is this. Robot cars have been  found to not properly read highway signs if those highway signs have been  slightly altered. They don't know how to read it. And some of these were  about cars don't even network and talk to other robot cars.</p><p> That's the big deal for Apple. Apple can have its own Apple closed system  in these cars. So the thing is, Emily, we still haven't figured out who is  going to be liable for robot car death. Is it companies like Uber or the  software?</p><p> COMPAGNO:  Right. Well, in every case it's going to be a different analysis  as to who or what is responsible, right? So we saw in a large accident  earlier that didn't involve a fatality that human driver that was in the  autonomous vehicle he was ultimately held responsible because of that. </p><p> In another major crash it was the other driver of the car that T-bone the  autonomous driving vehicle. And I think the larger answer to your question  is that this is why test phase is so important. This is why we're not ready  to hit the road yet. This is why kind of a phase physical area for these  cars to be tested is so crucial.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right. Bingo.</p><p> COMPAGNO:  Because otherwise of course now we'll see more fatalities.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You just nailed it. That's the thing, Emily. Because this is  like a -- we're just at the beginning stages of this and now we have a  woman killed by a robot car, right? I mean, this is a big deal.</p><p> COMPAGNO:  Yes. And note that just next month or in April, California has  maintained that they will now allow test writing of these autonomous  vehicles without the human driver inside, right? Up until now it's just  been Arizona. So that's something that we're going to see now a huge test  zone there, that's a physical fight at the Silicon Valley, right. So we'll  see a lot more.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Emily, we need you back on. We love having you on to break it  all down and drill into this. You're terrific. Please come back on the  show. Good to see you.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  More after the break. Don't go away.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Breaking news on the Facebook data mining breach. Cambridge  Analytica they're accused of abusing the Facebook data of potentially  millions of Facebook users. Now Great Britain wants to seek a warrant to  get into the computer servers of that data mining firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p> We're going to stay on that story for you tomorrow. Mondays are big night  on Fox Business. Tune to two new episodes of Strange Inheritance tonight at  9 p.m. Eastern Time. </p><p> Thank you so much for watching.

And it's only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to big tech harvesting private information</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Arwa Mahdawi</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sorry to break it to you, but you are probably a \"dumb fuck\". This is according to statements by a young Mark Zuckerberg anyway. Back in 2004, when a 19-year-old Zuckerberg had just started building Facebook, he sent his Harvard friends a series of instant messages in which he marvelled at the fact that 4,000 people had volunteered their personal information to his nascent social network. \"People just submitted it ... I don't know why ... They 'trust me' ... dumb fucks.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fourteen years later, the number of people who have trusted Zuckerberg with their data has grown from 4,000 to 2 billion. Zuckerberg has also grown, or so he would have you believe. In a 2010 interview with the New Yorker, the Facebook founder said he regretted those early messages. \"If you're going to go on to build a service that is influential and that a lot of people rely on, then you need to be mature, right? I think I've grown and learned a lot.\"</p><p>When it comes to respecting and safeguarding the information people have given him, however, has Zuckerberg really learned that much? Recent events suggest not.</p><p>On Saturday, the Observer revealed how Cambridge Analytica, a company funded by conservative billionaire Robert Mercer, acquired and exploited the data associated with 50m Facebook profiles. It appears that while Facebook had been aware of what the Observer described as \"unprecedented data harvesting\" for two years, it did not notify the affected users.</p><p>What's more, Facebook has displayed a remarkable lack of contrition in the immediate aftermath of the Observer's revelations. Instead of accepting responsibility, its top executives argued on Twitter that the social network had done nothing wrong. \"This was unequivocally not a data breach,\" Facebook vice-president Andrew Bosworth tweeted on Saturday. \"People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.\"</p><p>In a sense, Facebook's defence to the Cambridge Analytica story was more damning than the story itself. Tracy Chou, a software engineer who has interned at Facebook and worked at a number of prominent Silicon Valley companies, agrees that there wasn't a hack or breach of Facebook's security. Rather, she explains, \"this is the way that Facebook works\". The company's business model is to collect, share and exploit as much user data as possible; all without informed consent. Cambridge Analytica may have violated Facebook's terms of service, but Facebook had no safeguards in place to stop them.</p><p>While some Facebook executives were busy defending their honour on Twitter over the weekend, it should be noted that Zuckerberg remained deafeningly silent. On Monday, Facebook's shares dropped almost 7%, taking $36bn (\u00a325.7bn) off the company's valuation. Still, Zuckerberg remained silent. If you're going to build a service that is influential and that a lot of people rely on, then you need to be mature, right? Apparently, silence is Zuck's way of being mature.</p><p>But forget how the folks at Facebook are reacting to this \u2013 still unfolding \u2013 PR crisis. If you're one of the social network's 2 billion users, how are you reacting? Have you deleted your account in protest? Are you angrily sharing articles about the fiasco on Facebook but continuing to use the service? Have you shrugged and moved on?</p><p>For my part, the Cambridge Analytica story was the nudge I needed to finally cut ties with the social network. I've been trying to extricate myself from Facebook for a long time. My uneasiness with the network largely stems from the fact that I used to work in advertising and, for years, was on the receiving end of many a sales pitch from Facebook, Google and other companies that have built businesses trading in users' data.</p><p>Funnily enough, the likes of Facebook deliver a very different narrative to marketers than they do the wider public. They downplay their significance when challenged by the media about, for example, their influence on the 2016 US election. They downplay their power to deal with online harassment or the spread of fake news. However, if you've got an advertising budget and want to know how Facebook can persuade your target consumer to buy your product, it's a different story. Suddenly, Facebook is an all-knowing entity with unrivalled information; it can get almost anyone to do almost anything. While Facebook presents itself to the public as a social network, when addressing the advertising industry, it is very clear about the fact that it's a surveillance system.</p><p>Learning just how much Facebook knew about its users put me off using the network. But while I stopped actively using Facebook and its suite of apps, including Messenger and Instagram, years ago, it's only recently that I decided to delete my account. Before taking the plunge, however, I downloaded an archive of all the data I had put on Facebook. There's an option to do this when you go to Facebook's settings. It's easy and I highly recommend it. Seeing years' worth of data neatly arranged serves as an important wakeup call as to the extent of the information you have handed over to the company. Even then I was loath to get rid of my account altogether; just in case I needed to contact someone or check something. But on Monday, having witnessed Facebook's refusal to take any meaningful responsibility in regards to the Cambridge Analytica story, I deleted my account in disgust.</p><p>To be clear: I'm not recommending that you do the same. In many ways, being able to distance yourself from Facebook these days is a privilege. As Safiya Noble, an assistant professor of information studies at the University of Southern California and the author of Algorithms of Oppression, notes: \"For many people, Facebook is an important gateway to the internet. In fact, it is the only version of the internet that some know, and it plays a central role in communicating, creating community and participating in society online.\"</p><p>Even if you've got multiple ways to communicate and participate in society online, there is not really a good replacement for Facebook. There's no one portal that reminds you of your friends' birthdays, connects you to relatives across the world and stores photos from 10 years ago. Deleting Facebook inevitably means missing out on certain things and having to make more of an effort to connect with people in other ways.</p><p>What's more, unless you delete Facebook's entire ecosystem of apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp, you aren't safeguarding yourself from the company's data-collection practices. I haven't brought myself to delete WhatsApp, for example, because I still think that the benefits of using that outweigh the privacy tradeoffs. Nor have I fully deleted Instagram, which is just as nefarious as Facebook. Deleting my Facebook account may have some way to protecting my sanity, but it has done little to minimise my digital footprint.</p><p>As Noble stresses, \"deleting individual Facebook accounts will not solve the total datafication of our lives\". While deleting your account may give you some temporary satisfaction, it has \"little impact on finding real solutions to the way data is being collected, sold, and used against the public. This issue isn't just about one platform like Facebook, and the issues of surveillance and experimentation on the public, it's about the many companies that are tracking and profiling us, and the abuses of power that come from having vast troves of information about us, available for exploitation.\"</p><p>Other data experts echo Noble's view. As Frederike Kaltheuner, who leads the data exploitation programme at the charity Privacy International, explains: \"You can delete your Facebook, but you will still be tracked in your online and increasingly also your offline life. Mobile phones are by definition a tracking device.\"</p><p>The recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how our data is being used and abused. This can not be stressed enough. The internet is increasingly a worldwide web of corporate surveillance and it's impossible to piece together a complete picture of how your personal information \u2013 both your online and offline data \u2013 is being utilised. While behemoths such as Facebook are guaranteed to make headlines, there's a lot less media scrutiny of the thousands of other companies that make a living out of extracting and exploiting your personal life in extremely dubious ways.</p><p>The software company Pixoneye, for example, is far from a household name. But if you have granted an app permission to access your photos in the past, there's a good chance you have allowed it to utilise Pixoneye's tech. This scans the photos on your phone and uses the data it extracts to create a story of who you are. It might characterise you as someone who watches sports, for example, or as wine-drinker who enjoys lots of family holidays. Your photo gallery offers a staggering amount of insight: as the CEO of Pixoneye wrote in an op-ed last year: \"Our smartphone image galleries have in many ways become a reflection of our lives \u2026 each image you have stored contains a range of data attributes and meta tags that not only reveal your past purchasing profile, but can also be the key to predicting what purchases you're likely to make in the future.\"</p><p>So, you might be thinking, an app knows I like wine, and uses that information to sell me stuff. What's the big deal? In isolation, not much. But, as Kaltheuner stresses, \"when combined, data can reveal a lot\". Bringing together multiple data sources is \"how data-brokers have information such as personality profiles and relationship statuses\". The more data points you have, the more you can predict. As the Cambridge Analytica investigation revealed, even a few dozen Facebook \"likes\" can strongly predict someone's sexual orientation, or the political party they are most likely to vote for.</p><p>If you're starting to feel jittery about the exploitation of your personal data but aren't ready to delete social media and go and live off the grid, there are some simple steps you can take to mitigate your digital footprint. \"We should all do a little digital spring cleaning,\" advises Leila Hassan, head of analytics at the London branch of Ogilvy, a global advertising agency. \"Check what [third-party apps] you've enabled through your social channels. I'll bet most of us still have things enabled from years ago.\"</p><p>In order to examine the apps you have enabled through Facebook, go to settings and click \"Apps\" on the left sidebar. When I did that I was somewhat alarmed to find that I had given 68 apps indefinite access to my Facebook data. Even more alarmingly, accounts I had deleted ages ago \u2013 such as the dating app Bumble \u2013 still seemed to have access to my Facebook information.</p><p>Once on this page, it's easy to revoke permission for particular apps to access your data. It's much harder, however, to view or remove the data they have already collected. Facebook informs you that you should \"contact the developer of the app\" if you want to get rid of the data they have collected. I didn't really feel like contacting the developer of 68 different apps before deleting my Facebook account so I am unclear about the fate of the data they have amassed. Presumably it's all floating around in the cloud somewhere.</p><p>What else can you do to try and minimise your digital data trail? Jim Killock, from Open Rights Group, an organisation that works to protect the right to privacy online, suggests \"posting less, sharing less and, most importantly, removing page 'likes' as these are a major way [Facebook tries] to profile you\". Killock further suggests using \"privacy plug-ins to block Facebook cookies, and cookies from other websites, which they all use to keep a record of the sites you visit, and making extra, 'fake' accounts\". But Killock stresses that while it's important that people are more cognisant of their online behaviour, \"regulators must also act\". So must companies. \"At Privacy International, we want companies to do better and protect privacy by default, rather than users having to become full-time data protection experts in order to have their basic rights protected,\" says Kaltheuner.</p><p>The good news is that regulators are slowing starting to act. On 25 May, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is going to come into effect. This is an important step in shifting the balance of power, when it comes to data, away from companies and back towards individuals.</p><p>Kaltheuner notes that a key point of the new legislation is that it is extraterritorial. \"This means that if you are a company based outside the EU (for example in the US), and are offering goods or services to, or monitoring the behaviour of individuals in the EU, you must comply with it. This is especially important in countries, such as the US, with no comprehensive data protection regime.\"</p><p>While the GDPR is an important step towards giving people control over their data, it's far from a cure-all. It is no exaggeration to say we are teetering on the edge of a data dystopia. Just look at China, where the government recently announced that it will ban people with poor \"social credit\" from travelling on planes and trains. And it's not just China where oblique algorithms are determining the direction of our lives. The recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica are an important wakeup call that we are all living with the sociopolitical consequences of surveillance capitalism. We can't just sit back and hope that regulation will save us. We can't just click and like and share as usual and hope something will eventually change. We are, I think, at a critical moment where the degree of corporate surveillance to which we are all subjected can either get much better, or much worse. So, I would urge you to extricate yourself from social media as much as you can. Deleting your Facebook account may not put an end to the surveillance state, but it sends an important message to big tech that we don't trust them any longer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-112889837</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RY9-XX11-F11P-X082-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2390\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Yerepouni Daily News.

This is according to statements by a young Mark Zuckerberg anyway. Back in 2004, when a 19-year-old Zuckerberg had just started building Facebook, he sent his Harvard friends a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">series of instant messages</url> in which he marvelled at the fact that 4,000 people had volunteered their personal information to his nascent social network. \"People just submitted it... I don't know why...       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">They 'trust me'... dumb fucks</url>.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fourteen years later, the number of people who have trusted Zuckerberg with their data has grown from 4,000 to 2 billion. Zuckerberg has also grown, or so he would have you believe. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">In a 2010 interview with the New Yorker</url>, the Facebook founder said he regretted those early messages. \"If you're going to go on to build a service that is influential and that a lot of people rely on, then you need to be mature, right? I think I've grown and learned a lot.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When it comes to respecting and safeguarding the information people have given him, however, has Zuckerberg really learned that much? Recent events suggest not.</p><p>On Saturday, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">the Observer revealed how Cambridge Analytica</url>, a company funded by conservative billionaire Robert Mercer, acquired and exploited the data associated with 50m Facebook profiles. It appears that while Facebook had been aware of what the Observer described as \"unprecedented data harvesting\" for two years, it did not notify the affected users.</p><p>What's more, Facebook has displayed a remarkable lack of contrition in the immediate aftermath of the Observer's revelations. Instead of accepting responsibility, its top executives argued on Twitter that the social network had done nothing wrong. \"This was unequivocally not a data breach,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">Facebook vice-president Andrew Bosworth tweeted</url> on Saturday. \"People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.\"</p><p>In a sense, Facebook's defence to the Cambridge Analytica story was more damning than the story itself. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">Tracy Chou</url>, a software engineer who has interned at Facebook and worked at a number of prominent Silicon Valley companies, agrees that there wasn't a hack or breach of Facebook's security.

However, if you've got an advertising budget and want to know how Facebook can persuade your target consumer to buy your product, it's a different story. Suddenly, Facebook is an all-knowing entity with unrivalled information; it can get almost anyone to do almost anything. While Facebook presents itself to the public as a social network, when addressing the advertising industry, it is very clear about the fact that it's a surveillance system.</p><p>Learning just how much Facebook knew about its users put me off using the network. But while I stopped actively using Facebook and its suite of apps, including Messenger and Instagram, years ago, it's only recently that I decided to delete my account. Before taking the plunge, however, I <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">downloaded an archive of all the data</url> I had put on Facebook. There's an option to do this when you go to Facebook's settings. It's easy and I highly recommend it. Seeing years' worth of data neatly arranged serves as an important wakeup call as to the extent of the information you have handed over to the company. Even then I was loath to get rid of my account altogether; just in case I needed to contact someone or check something. But on Monday, having witnessed Facebook's refusal to take any meaningful responsibility in regards to the Cambridge Analytica story, I deleted my account in disgust.</p><p>To be clear: I'm not recommending that you do the same. In many ways, being able to distance yourself from Facebook these days is a privilege. As Safiya Noble, an assistant professor of information studies at the University of Southern California and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">the author of Algorithms of Oppression</url>, notes: \"For many people, Facebook is an important gateway to the internet. In fact, it is the only version of the internet that some know, and it plays a central role in communicating, creating community and participating in society online.\"</p><p>Even if you've got multiple ways to communicate and participate in society online, there is not really a good replacement for Facebook. There's no one portal that reminds you of your friends' birthdays, connects you to relatives across the world and stores photos from 10 years ago. Deleting Facebook inevitably means missing out on certain things and having to make more of an effort to connect with people in other ways.</p><p>What's more, unless you delete Facebook's entire ecosystem of apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp, you aren't safeguarding yourself from the company's data-collection practices. I haven't brought myself to delete WhatsApp, for example, because I still think that the benefits of using that outweigh the privacy tradeoffs. Nor have I fully deleted Instagram, which is just as nefarious as Facebook. Deleting my Facebook account may have some way to protecting my sanity, but it has done little to minimise my digital footprint.</p><p>As Noble stresses, \"deleting individual Facebook accounts will not solve the total datafication of our lives\". While deleting your account may give you some temporary satisfaction, it has \"little impact on finding real solutions to the way data is being collected, sold, and used against the public. This issue isn't just about one platform like Facebook, and the issues of surveillance and experimentation on the public, it's about the many companies that are tracking and profiling us, and the abuses of power that come from having vast troves of information about us, available for exploitation.\"</p><p>Other data experts echo Noble's view. As Frederike Kaltheuner, who leads the data exploitation programme at the charity Privacy International, explains: \"You can delete your Facebook, but you will still be tracked in your online and increasingly also your offline life. Mobile phones are by definition a tracking device.\"</p><p>The recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how our data is being used and abused. This can not be stressed enough. The internet is increasingly a worldwide web of corporate surveillance and it's impossible to piece together a complete picture of how your personal information - both your online and offline data - is being utilised. While behemoths such as Facebook are guaranteed to make headlines, there's a lot less media scrutiny of the thousands of other companies that make a living out of extracting and exploiting your personal life in extremely dubious ways.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">software company Pixoneye</url>, for example, is far from a household name. But if you have granted an app permission to access your photos in the past, there's a good chance you have allowed it to utilise Pixoneye's tech. This scans the photos on your phone and uses the data it extracts to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">create a story of who you are</url>. It might characterise you as someone who watches sports, for example, or as wine-drinker who enjoys lots of family holidays. Your photo gallery offers a staggering amount of insight: as the CEO of Pixoneye       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">wrote in an op-ed last year</url> : \"Our smartphone image galleries have in many ways become a reflection of our lives ... each image you have stored contains a range of data attributes and meta tags that not only reveal your past purchasing profile, but can also be the key to predicting what purchases you're likely to make in the future.\"</p><p>So, you might be thinking, an app knows I like wine, and uses that information to sell me stuff. What's the big deal? In isolation, not much. But, as Kaltheuner stresses, \"when combined, data can reveal a lot\". Bringing together multiple data sources is \"how data-brokers have information such as personality profiles and relationship statuses\". The more data points you have, the more you can predict. As the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">Cambridge Analytica investigation revealed</url>, even a few dozen Facebook \"likes\" can strongly predict someone's sexual orientation, or the political party they are most likely to vote for.</p><p>If you're starting to feel jittery about the exploitation of your personal data but aren't ready to delete social media and go and live off the grid, there are some simple steps you can take to mitigate your digital footprint. \"We should all do a little digital spring cleaning,\" advises Leila Hassan, head of analytics at the London branch of Ogilvy, a global advertising agency. \"Check what [third-party apps] you've enabled through your social channels. I'll bet most of us still have things enabled from years ago.\"</p><p>In order to examine the apps you have enabled through Facebook, go to settings and click \"Apps\" on the left sidebar. When I did that I was somewhat alarmed to find that I had given 68 apps indefinite access to my Facebook data. Even more alarmingly, accounts I had deleted ages ago - such as the dating app Bumble - still seemed to have access to my Facebook information.</p><p>Once on this page, it's easy to revoke permission for particular apps to access your data. It's much harder, however, to view or remove the data they have already collected. Facebook informs you that you should \"contact the developer of the app\" if you want to get rid of the data they have collected. I didn't really feel like contacting the developer of 68 different apps before deleting my Facebook account so I am unclear about the fate of the data they have amassed. Presumably it's all floating around in the cloud somewhere.</p><p> Related:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">Delete your account - a guide to life after Facebook</url></p><p>What else can you do to try and minimise your digital data trail? Jim Killock, from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">Open Rights Group</url>, an organisation that works to protect the right to privacy online, suggests \"posting less, sharing less and, most importantly, removing page 'likes' as these are a major way [Facebook tries] to profile you\". Killock further suggests using \"privacy plug-ins to block Facebook cookies, and cookies from other websites, which they all use to keep a record of the sites you visit, and making extra, 'fake' accounts\". But Killock stresses that while it's important that people are more cognisant of their online behaviour, \"regulators must also act\". So must companies. \"At Privacy International, we want companies to do better and protect privacy by default, rather than users having to become full-time data protection experts in order to have their basic rights protected,\" says Kaltheuner.</p><p>The good news is that regulators are slowing starting to act. On 25 May, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">the EU General Data Protection Regulation</url> (GDPR) is going to come into effect. This is an important       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">step in shifting the balance of power</url>, when it comes to data, away from companies and back towards individuals.</p><p>Kaltheuner notes that a key point of the new legislation is that it is extraterritorial. \"This means that if you are a company based outside the EU (for example in the US), and are offering goods or services to, or monitoring the behaviour of individuals in the EU, you must comply with it. This is especially important in countries, such as the US, with no comprehensive data protection regime.\"</p><p>While the GDPR is an important step towards giving people control over their data, it's far from a cure-all. It is no exaggeration to say we are teetering on the edge of a data dystopia. Just look at China, where the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/18/mark-zuckerberg-college-messages\">government recently announced</url> that it will ban people with poor \"social credit\" from travelling on planes and trains. And it's not just China where oblique algorithms are determining the direction of our lives. The recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica are an important wakeup call that we are all living with the sociopolitical consequences of surveillance capitalism. We can't just sit back and hope that regulation will save us. We can't just click and like and share as usual and hope something will eventually change. We are, I think, at a critical moment where the degree of corporate surveillance to which we are all subjected can either get much better, or much worse. So, I would urge you to extricate yourself from social media as much as you can. Deleting your Facebook account may not put an end to the surveillance state, but it sends an important message to big tech that we don't trust them any longer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-42467574</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX8-PYB1-JCJY-G29W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2381\"/><timeReceived>2:41 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

He and his counterpart in British Columbia, Michael McEvoy, issued a stern rebuke to Facebook for violating the privacy of about 620,000 Canadians - and then pretty much acknowledged that they're impotent to do anything about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook refuses to accept it did anything wrong when it let a thirdparty app harvest Canadians'personal information, exposing it to potential misuse by Cambridge Analytica, the consulting company at the centre of attempts to influence political campaigns in Britain and the United States.</p><p>Facebook rejects the commissioners'recommendations on fixing the problem. It even disputes that they have jurisdiction over its activities. It's basically telling them to pound sand.</p><p>But Therrien's hands are tied.</p><p>Canadian law doesn't give him the power to actually tell Facebook to do anything. So he was left to sputter his frustration and announce that he's going to Federal Court to try and get some legal leverage over the company.</p><p>Good luck with that. If, and it's a big if, Facebook is actually found to have violated Canadian privacy law, the maximum fine it could face in this country is $100,000.</p><p>That's less than a pittance for a company with annual revenues of $56 billion U.S. and profits of $6.88 billion U.S. last year. A Conservative MP, John Brassard, calculated the company makes $100,000 every 60 seconds. It's actually a fair bit more than that.</p><p>Compare that with the type of fines being levied on the big-tech companies these days in the United States and Europe, which have woken up to the challenges posed by the likes of Facebook, Google and Apple in the areas of competition, copyright, taxation and privacy.</p><p>Facebook announced last week it expects to be fined between $3 billion and $5 billion by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations going back to 2011.</p><p>If the fine ends up at the top end of that range, it will be paying out 50,000 times more than the maximum penalty in Canada. But even that seemingly impressive number is being brushed off as a slap on the wrist for the social network behemoth. Its stock price actually went up last week when it revealed how much it may have to pay out; the markets know Facebook can easily handle it.</p><p>Authorities in Europe are also taking a much harder line. In 2016 Apple was fined $15.3 billion for taking advantage of illegal tax benefits from the Irish government.</p><p>And last year Google was fined $5 billion for abusing its market dominance in Android cellphones and breaking antitrust laws.</p><p>These are significant fines, on a scale commensurate with the tech firms'vast revenues and power in the marketplace. But the fact that the companies can pay them and continue to rack up record profits unfazed shows they are far from crippling.</p><p>Canada, by contrast, is limping along with laws that have no teeth. Therrien's frustration was obvious in the statement he put out last week as he announced the results of an investigation into the Canadian dimension of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which affected 87 million people worldwide.</p><p>\"Facebook's refusal to act responsibly is deeply troubling given the vast amount of sensitive personal information users have entrusted to this company,\" he said. \"The stark contradiction between Facebook's public promises to mend its ways on privacy and its refusal to address the serious problems we've identified - or even acknowledge that it broke the law - is extremely concerning.\"</p><p>McEvoy, the B.C. privacy commissioner, identified one obvious remedy: give privacy regulators the power to do more than just scold those who flout our laws. \"The ability to levy meaningful fines would be an important starting point,\" he said.</p><p>Just so. Therrien and McEvoy can only document violations of privacy, make recommendations to companies to clean up their act, and lament the fact they lack the legal tools to take things further. Only the government can address the shortcomings of our laws.</p><p>In Ottawa, the Trudeau government is at long last making noises about moving in this direction.</p><p>Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould said last week she isn't satisfied with what Facebook and Twitter have done so far to make sure this fall's federal election isn't compromised, and she told the Star that when it comes to possible new regulations \"all options\" are on the table. She and Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains promised an announcement on digital privacy in the coming weeks.</p><p>These are complicated issues, so we shouldn't expect a full overhaul quickly. But the government has been dithering for far too long in the face of the multiple issues raised by the dominance of the tech giants.</p><p>In the area of privacy, in particular, our laws are now clearly inadequate. They need to be made tougher, and they need to be backed by penalties severe enough to make Facebook and company stop brushing them off.</p><p>Editorial from The Toronto Star</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LTBHLD-390909362LBHD</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LTBHLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W17-TSN1-DYG7-V1YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"841\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Lethbridge Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Lethbridge Herald</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 2, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He and his counterpart in British Columbia, Michael McEvoy, issued a stern rebuke to Facebook for violating the privacy of about 620,000 Canadians - and then pretty much acknowledged that they're impotent to do anything about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook refuses to accept it did anything wrong when it let a third-party app harvest Canadians' personal information, exposing it to potential misuse by Cambridge Analytica, the consulting company at the centre of attempts to influence political campaigns in Britain and the United States.</p><p>Facebook rejects the commissioners' recommendations on fixing the problem. It even disputes that they have jurisdiction over its activities. It's basically telling them to pound sand.</p><p>But Therrien's hands are tied. Canadian law doesn't give him the power to actually tell Facebook to do anything. So he was left to sputter his frustration and announce that he's going to Federal Court to try and get some legal leverage over the company.</p><p>Good luck with that. If, and it's a big if, Facebook is actually found to have violated Canadian privacy law, the maximum fine it could face in this country is $100,000.</p><p>That's less than a pittance for a company with annual revenues of $56 billion U.S. and profits of $6.88 billion U.S. last year. A Conservative MP, John Brassard, calculated that the company makes $100,000 every 60 seconds. It's actually a fair bit more than that.</p><p>Compare that with the type of fines that are being levied on the big tech companies these days in the United States and Europe, which have woken up to the challenges posed by the likes of Facebook, Google and Apple in the areas of competition, copyright, taxation and privacy.</p><p>Facebook announced last week that it expects to be fined between $3 billion and $5 billion by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations going back to 2011.</p><p>If the fine ends up at the top end of that range, it will be paying out 50,000 times more than the maximum penalty in Canada. But even that seemingly impressive number is being brushed off as a slap on the wrist for the social network behemoth. Its stock price actually went up last week when it revealed how much it may have to pay out; the markets know Facebook can easily handle it.</p><p>Authorities in Europe are also taking a much harder line. In 2016 Apple was fined $15.3 billion for taking advantage of illegal tax benefits from the Irish government. And last year Google was fined $5 billion for abusing its market dominance in Android cellphones and breaking antitrust laws.</p><p>These are significant fines, on a scale commensurate with the tech firms' vast revenues and power in the marketplace. But the fact that the companies can pay them and continue to rack up record profits unfazed shows they are far from crippling.</p><p>Canada, by contrast, is limping along with laws that have no teeth. Therrien's frustration was obvious in the statement he put out last week as he announced the results of an investigation into the Canadian dimension of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which affected 87 million people worldwide.</p><p>\"Facebook's refusal to act responsibly is deeply troubling given the vast amount of sensitive personal information users have entrusted to this company,\" he said. \"The stark contradiction between Facebook's public promises to mend its ways on privacy and its refusal to address the serious problems we've identified - or even acknowledge that it broke the law - is extremely concerning.\"</p><p>McEvoy, the B.C. privacy commissioner, identified one obvious remedy: give privacy regulators the power to do more than just scold those who flout our laws. \"The ability to levy meaningful fines would be an important starting point,\" he said.</p><p>Just so. Therrien and McEvoy can only document violations of privacy, make recommendations to companies to clean up their act, and lament the fact that they lack the legal tools to take things further. Only the government can address the shortcomings of our laws.</p><p>In Ottawa, the Trudeau government is at long last making noises about moving in this direction.</p><p>Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould said last week that she isn't satisfied with what Facebook and Twitter have done so far to make sure this fall's federal election isn't compromised, and she told the Star that when it comes to possible new regulations \"all options\" are on the table. She and Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains promised an announcement on digital privacy in the coming weeks.</p><p>These are complicated issues, so we shouldn't expect a full overhaul quickly. But the government has been dithering for far too long in the face of the multiple issues raised by the dominance of the tech giants.</p><p>In the area of privacy, in particular, our laws are now clearly inadequate. They need to be made tougher, and they need to be backed by penalties severe enough to make Facebook and company stop brushing them off.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2019042954231268</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0S-KJ61-JDH1-C2R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"841\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Daily News Group Inc.

But at heart they are profit-making corporations with only limited competence in these domains, so their choices frequently go awry.The big picture: Facebook's operations as a quasi-state span realms such as ...1. Speech: Facebook's mission of connecting people and giving them a voice, combined with its global reach and billion of users, means that it is constantly making decisions about who can say wha[1]t. The company has moved forward with plans to invent a \"Supreme Court\"-like independent content moderation appeals board.[2] But in the meantime its evolving rules, particularly around political speech and advertising, have left a wake of confusion and consternation. 2. Money: Earlier this year, Facebook announced with great fanfare that it was launching its own global cryptocurrency[3], called Libra. </p><p>But the plans for Libra have quickly run into a regulatory sawmill, and key financial partners[4] have bailed on the project. 3. Safety: Facebook's global footprint means it is constantly dealing with waves of conflict that expose users to harm, and its leadership has little experience or background to head off or mitigate these disasters. In 2018 a UN report held Facebook responsible[5] for disseminating hate speech that fueled atrocities against Myanmar's Rohingya minority.Something very similar is happening today in Assam[6], the rights group Avaaz has reported. 4. Taxes: Facebook doesn't tax us directly for cash, but stockpiles our data to target ads and fine-tunes our \"engagement\" to consume our attention. As with any tax, if the rates are too high, people rebel. That hasn't yet happened with Facebook, which reports continued user growth[7]. But there are signs that the platform has lost its cachet[8] among the younger users who set online trends. Be smart: As a quasi-government, Facebook is also an absolute monarchy[9]. Mark Zuckerberg's special shares give him total personal control over the company's decisions.The company also has gobs of cash and tons of revenue to play around with. That lets it pursue efforts like subsidizing financially-strapped news publishers[10] without much hesitation. Yes, but: Of course, Facebook isn't a real government and doesn't have true sovereign power. It's subject to laws around the world, and in the U.S. many legislators and regulators are eager to remind the company that antitrust laws apply to it.[11] Our thought bubble: Internet idealists and tech visionaries have long bemoaned the sluggishness and inefficiency of government processes. Their companies have moved at \"internet speed\" to revamp our lives while the public sector can barely pass a law or solve a problem. One reason governments are more cumbersome is that they actually have to balance tons of competing interests.Companies mostly worry about their shareholders (in Facebook's case, one controlling shareholder). States and their leaders must manage complex webs of stakeholders wielding constantly shifting amounts of political power. Facebook has a rough road ahead because it has no experience with this dance \u2014 yet, suddenly, the company must perform it everywhere.

The topic at hand? \"Extremist content and Russian disinformation online\", which, translated, reads: how did Russian use of social media affect the outcome of the 2016 presidential election? The committee chairman, Senator Lindsey Graham, set it up nicely in his opening statement by quoting what Trump had said on Fox Newson 20 October: \"I doubt I'd be here if it weren't for social media, to be honest with you.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For three tech companies that, like all of Silicon Valley, loathe and despise politics, this was a nightmarish week. I mean to say, there they were, at the mercy of the low-IQ technophobes of Capitol Hill, live on C-Span (the congressional TV channel), something they had lobbied furiously to avoid. Their appearances were presaged by a flurry of press releases and revelations. The Russian exploitation of their advertising machines that they had once pooh-poohed was, it turned out, much more extensive than they had imagined. Facebook, for example, had belatedly discovered that 126 million people in the US may have seen posts produced by Russian-government-backed agents on its site. Very devious coves, those Ruskies.</p><p>The Republicans who control Congress have no intention of doing anything to regulate the tech companies</p><p>A few things emerged from the hearing. The first is that legislators seem to be getting worried about the power of the big tech companies, especially Facebook. \"How does Facebook,\" asked Senator Al Franken, \"which prides itself on being able to process billions of data points and instantly transform them into personal connections for its users, somehow not make the connection that electoral ads, paid for in rubles, were coming from Russia?\" Good question, which produced no answer from Colin Stretch, the company's general counsel.</p><p>Second, the legislators focused too much on the Russian ads and ignored what may be a bigger problem, namely the 80,000 \"organic\" posts that appeared in the news feeds of a third of American Facebook users. These were ingenious posts that appeared to come from US users and carried messages that, though not overtly political, were designed to press emotional buttons in a way that could have had a political impact.</p><p>To a detached observer, though, it looked like classical political theatre. The politicians huffed and puffed and kept an eye on their Twitter feeds. There was much cant about \"finding solutions\". And the company representatives mimed contrition but yielded little ground.</p><p>All of which was predictable. My guess is that nothing much will happen. On the political side, the Republicans who control Congress have no intention of doing anything to regulate the tech companies. Three Democratic senators have put forward a bill that would require the companies to provide more information about the political ads that they accept and run. It's called the Honest Ads Act, which would make it the first oxymoron to make it on to the statute book. But its chances of progressing are infinitesimally small, if only because the midterm elections\u00a0loom.</p><p>On the corporate side, nothing much will happen either. Of course the companies are promising to recruit lots of people to help them stamp out abuses of their advertising engines. They are also investing heavily (they say) in AI that will be smart enough to outwit those fiendish Russians. (Good luck with that.) The one thing they will not do, however, is anything that might undermine their business models, which are, at least in the cases of Google and Facebook, licences to print money.</p><p> Related:  Trick-or-treats and burger tweets: what tech CEOs did instead of testifying in DC</p><p>Just to emphasise that point, Facebook has just released its results for the third quarter of 2017. They show that its number of \"daily active users\" grew by 50 million to 1.37\u00a0billion. Its revenues are up by 47% from what they were a year ago. And its share price now stands at $182 compared with $127 last November. It will take more than a spot of public humiliation at the hands of a few senators to persuade them to switch off a money-making machine like that.</p><p>Summing up: the companies have no incentive to change their ways. And there's no real political will in the US to make them. All of which perhaps explains why <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>wasn't on Capitol Hill but in China to meet the great Thought Leader Xi Jinping. Now there's  a politician worth sucking up to.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBSRVR-38651809</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBSRVR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PWG-5751-JCJY-G1K9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"760\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer(London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 5, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><className>TWTR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

A large chunk of your digital rights were watered down. On March 23, the US Congress passed a gargantuan spending bill that was stuffed with funding for everything from roads to public parks and drug addiction programmes. Tucked away on page 2,201, however, was a little-noticed addition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was called the Cloud Act - short for the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act. The legislation granted sweeping new powers to law enforcement and governments around the world, including Britain, to harvest and use for prosecution the private online information of their citizens.</p><p>For the first time, police in Britain and elsewhere will be able to obtain real-time online data stored in America by <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Google, Slack and other internet giants - something that previously would have been a criminal offence.</p><p>The Cloud Act, which has been heavily criticised by privacy campaigners, raises fundamental questions over how the data trail we leave behind on the internet is handled. Our virtual data is stored in \"the cloud\" - the 8m-plus data centres housing our photos, emails, documents, music and credit card transactions. US tech giants handle most of this traffic in facilities scattered around the globe.</p><p>For years, the industry has been buffeted by requests from governments and law enforcement agencies, clamouring for access to data on persons of interest. To grant these requests would, in many cases, have violated US law; so they were mostly refused.</p><p>The question of how to deal with these requests came to a head in February in the US Supreme Court. The justices heard arguments for what was expected to be a landmark case, in which Microsoft had refused American requests for access to a drug trafficker's data because it was held on servers in Ireland. The Cloud Act has rendered the expected ruling moot.</p><p>The likes of Google, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and, to a lesser extent, Microsoft have been happy to parse vast swathes of personal data for their online advertising businesses. Apple, which does not rely on web advertising, has sought to cast itself as a privacy champion. Last week, boss Tim Cook said Apple was \"not going to traffic in your personal life\" - a none-too-subtle dig at <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>left reeling by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Big tech, however, was united in supporting the new legislation.</p><p>So what is the Cloud Act? It allows the US justice department, for the first time, to strike one-to-one deals with foreign governments to allow instant access to private citizens' data stored on overseas servers. Access can be given to every level of law enforcement, from local police to national governments, without notice to those being monitored.</p><p>The UK government was a key partner in creating the system, which privacy campaigners at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) have labelled a \"dangerous expansion of police snooping on cross-border data\".</p><p>The framework replaces so-called mutual legal assistance treaties - tightly focused agreements between two countries that must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the Senate.</p><p>More than 20 human rights organisations, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, opposed the Cloud Act. Their two primary concerns are that not only does the law dramatically extend snooping powers, it hands authority to choose America's partners in this new system entirely to the justice department, now run by Jeff Sessions. The worry is that authoritarian regimes, such as Turkey or Russia could use data to quash dissenters and activists, if Sessions deemed them worthy of one of these special agreements.</p><p>Greg Nojeim of the Centre for Democracy &amp; Technology, a Washington think tank, said: \"The Department of Justice will decide which countries will get these agreements and is given maximum flexibility to grant these requests. There's no real check on that power.\"</p><p>The first such agreement has been drafted with Britain, though the final version has not yet been publicised or signed. This is significant because in 2016 parliament passed the Investigatory Powers Act - the \"snoopers' charter\" - which gave the government new and far-reaching access to personal data. \"Britain is the first mover,\" Nojeim said.</p><p>Currently, UK authorities can access only stored, historical data held in overseas data centres, and gain access only if they meet America's rigorous \"probable cause\" legal standard. Once the deal with America is struck, that legal hurdle falls away and the British authorities will be able to obtain real-time - rather than historic - communications.</p><p>\"After the agreement is in place, British authorities will be able to access email and other communications content of virtually any British citizen in the world. Never before have they had any ability to get real-time intercepts from <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, etc. This is enormous,\" said Nojeim.</p><p>There are safeguards, though critics claim they are weak. The law requires, for example, that the US president must ensure partner states meet minimum human rights standards. If Congress disagrees, however, the only way to void the president's ruling is by a two-thirds vote in both House and Senate, which has not happened in many years.</p><p>Apple, Google, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Microsoft, along with Yahoo-owner Oath, signed a letter in February in support of the law, claiming it would create a \"concrete path\" for governments to enter \"modern bilateral agreements with nations that better protect customers\".</p><p>Campaigners disagree. David Ruiz of the EFF said: \"It's disappointing to see some of the most popular and most well-used companies, which handle the majority of global internet traffic, signing on to a piece of legislation that will erode global privacy protections.\" He added: \"They interpreted this act as a streamlining. We think it's a bad streamlining.\"</p><p>Europe's new data privacy regime will do nothing to curtail snooping powers. The General Data Protection Regulation, restricting how industry can use consumers' data, comes into effect on May 25. Yet it has a carve-out for exactly the type of bilateral deals between governments envisaged by the Cloud Act.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-42786091</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S0S-CCT1-F021-6339-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1032\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 1, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The people at Facebook, for all their flaws, don't seem like the villains in a James Bond movie. And, for what it's worth, they may very well have our best interests[1] in mind. Who knows?</p><p> But Facebook isn't people, it's more akin to a country, and a large one at that with over two billion citizens.It wasn't always a country. The social network was driven first by Zuckerberg's ego, then briefly by the talent of its team. But it wasn't about people then either. When the brains at Facebook were figuring out how to create the best experience for users they stumbled upon a man-made natural resource that was as unexplored as the vastness of our galaxy: personal data[2]. It's because of this resource Facebook went from a college dropout's personal project to an advertising platform reaching more than two billion users[3]. Most of us haven't spent much time trying to figure out how Facebook makes its money because we've never paid to use it. But it's damn sure never been free.As we've said before, Facebook should be paying us to use its platform[4]. So far, Facebook has gotten by convincing us that it's techno-wizardry just found a way to turn something into nothing. We're fine believing in alchemy as long as we're all liking and sharing without any apparent consequences. In the face of the Cambridge Analytica news[5], however, this 'something for nothing' rhetoric is taking a beating. At best, the company's been ignorant. And you don't want your valuable personal data in the hands of a bunch of ignorant technologists. At worst, the social network is complicit in the hijacking of an American presidential election both through giving away user data to Cambridge Analytica and through selling data and advertising space to the Internet Research Agency[6], a troll farm sanctioned by the Russian government.Who are you sharing your life with? #regulatefacebook[7] pic.twitter.com/r7B7Ajkt0V[8] \u2014 Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) March 20, 2018[9] Giving unbridled access to the user accounts of 50 million Facebook users sounds like the kind of thing Equifax would accidentally do[10], except when Facebook does it the company is 100 percent aware of what's going on. And that's a problem because the US government willfully chooses to avoid punishing either[11]. If the social network were 'people' then 'they' would be doing everything possible to give us control over our data, simply because it's ours. And if it was a 'business' it would have to worry about shareholders, a board, fines, breaking the law, or at least losing money.Facebook is not worried about money. It lost $60 billion[12] in value overnight and nobody seems to be even the slightest bit concerned. It's not a business we can deal with in the traditional sense: it's a country you can't bomb that's run by an autocrat who, short of committing a violent crime, is as above-the-law as you can get without being Steven Segal. It's worse when you take the macro view, because as tax payers and patriots we don't want to admit our governments are powerless against the likes of Facebook. But they are. Perhaps you're thinking: what about Twitter, Alibaba, Amazon, or Microsoft? It's true, all the big tech companies collect data and use it to fuel profits. You don't have to be an investigative journalist to know that Amazon probably has as much data on you as Facebook, maybe even more. But Facebook's data is unique and so is the way it's used. The social network is a closed economy with an end-to-end solution for data harvesting that is completely centralized. Amazon is trying to sell you something. In fact, Amazon is trying to sell you everything. At the end of the day both Amazon and Alibaba are companies that sell products to you. Facebook, on the other hand, isn't selling you anything because you're the product. You can't fight Facebook's technology because it's locked away under trade secrets, too complex for politicians to understand, and defended by better lawyers than The Justice Department can afford. And you can't simply opt out[13], #DeleteFacebook is only going to get you so far. As TNW's Alejandro Tauber pointed out[14], it's hard to do and even if you don't have an account the company has data on you. No, the only way to take on Facebook is to treat it like a country. We need an ethical uprising against the misuse of our personal information and we need both politicians and business leaders to pressure Facebook into being a good ally for democracy. Trying to hold Mark Zuckerberg legally accountable for his company's ethical missteps is a minefield. Instead, we should consider making it expensive for other companies to do business with Facebook until it decides to protect our data or use it ethically.

The people at Facebook, for all their flaws, don't seem like the villains in a James Bond movie. And, for what it's worth, they may very well have our best interests in mind. Who knows?</p><p><br/> But Facebook isn't people, it's more akin to a country, and a large one at that with over two billion citizens.<br/> It wasn't always a country. The social network was driven first by Zuckerberg's ego, then briefly by the talent of its team. But it wasn't about people then either. When the brains at Facebook were figuring out how to create the best experience for users they stumbled upon a man-made natural resource that was as unexplored as the vastness of our galaxy: personal data.<br/> It's because of this resource Facebook went from a college dropout's personal project to an advertising platform reaching more than two billion users. Most of us haven't spent much time trying to figure out how Facebook makes its money because we've never paid to use it. But it's damn sure never been free. As we've said before, Facebook should be paying us to use its platform.<br/> So far, Facebook has gotten by convincing us that it's techno-wizardry just found a way to turn something into nothing. We're fine believing in alchemy as long as we're all liking and sharing without any apparent consequences.<br/> In the face of the Cambridge Analytica news, however, this 'something for nothing' rhetoric is taking a beating.<br/> At best, the company's been ignorant. And you don't want your valuable personal data in the hands of a bunch of ignorant technologists. At worst, the social network is complicit in the hijacking of an American presidential election both through giving away user data to Cambridge Analytica and through selling data and advertising space to the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm sanctioned by the Russian government.<br/> Who are you sharing your life with? #regulatefacebook pic.twitter.com/r7B7Ajkt0V<br/> - Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) March 20, 2018<br/> Giving unbridled access to the user accounts of 50 million Facebook users sounds like the kind of thing Equifax would accidentally do, except when Facebook does it the company is 100 percent aware of what's going on. And that's a problem because the US government willfully chooses to avoid punishing either.<br/> If the social network were 'people' then 'they' would be doing everything possible to give us control over our data, simply because it's ours. And if it was a 'business' it would have to worry about shareholders, a board, fines, breaking the law, or at least losing money. Facebook is not worried about money.<br/> It lost $60 billion in value overnight and nobody seems to be even the slightest bit concerned. It's not a business we can deal with in the traditional sense: it's a country you can't bomb that's run by an autocrat who, short of committing a violent crime, is as above-the-law as you can get without being Steven Segal.<br/> It's worse when you take the macro view, because as tax payers and patriots we don't want to admit our governments are powerless against the likes of Facebook. But they are.<br/> Perhaps you're thinking: what about Twitter, Alibaba, Amazon, or Microsoft? It's true, all the big tech companies collect data and use it to fuel profits. You don't have to be an investigative journalist to know that Amazon probably has as much data on you as Facebook, maybe even more.<br/> But Facebook's data is unique and so is the way it's used. The social network is a closed economy with an end-to-end solution for data harvesting that is completely centralized. Amazon is trying to sell you something. In fact, Amazon is trying to sell you everything. At the end of the day both Amazon and Alibaba are companies that sell products to you.<br/> Facebook, on the other hand, isn't selling you anything because you're the product.<br/> You can't fight Facebook's technology because it's locked away under trade secrets, too complex for politicians to understand, and defended by better lawyers than The Justice Department can afford.<br/> And you can't simply opt out, #DeleteFacebook is only going to get you so far. As TNW's Alejandro Tauber pointed out, it's hard to do and even if you don't have an account the company has data on you.<br/> No, the only way to take on Facebook is to treat it like a country. We need an ethical uprising against the misuse of our personal information and we need both politicians and business leaders to pressure Facebook into being a good ally for democracy.<br/> Trying to hold Mark Zuckerberg legally accountable for his company's ethical missteps is a minefield. Instead, we should consider making it expensive for other companies to do business with Facebook until it decides to protect our data or use it ethically.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-n10431727</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXW-J6B1-DYDW-70M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"812\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 21, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002M0H</classCode><className>EQUIFAX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>EFX (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

It's a dangerouscollaboration. But when you take a closerlook at the complaints lodged by each side, you see how thin their argumentsreally are. Most of the left-wing criticism of Facebook amount to criticisms of human nature. </p><p>People lie. People are jerks.They seem to want Facebook to be responsible for the fall of man. Most of the conservative criticisms of the social media platform are allegations of bias. And I'm not here to tell you there is none, because, well, see left-wing criticisms.  People are human. Evenpeople who design algorithms are human. Trying to defend Facebook from chargesof bias is a fool's errand. The sheer volume of content posted daily from allover the globe virtually guarantees that it will make wrong calls.  It has done so with the pro-life groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List (and acknowledged at least some of those errors), and I'm sure it will again.  And the left has madeitsown accusations[1]of bias in Facebook's fact-checking. Facebook is a globalprivate company, with 100 billion pieces of content every day, facing differing\u2014andsometimes conflicting\u2014objections from right and left. Do we really wantgovernment to step into this morass? In an Oct. 17 speech atGeorgetown University, co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg committed Facebook todefending free expression, pledging that all members of its new appealsboardwill'each hold free expression as their paramount value.'  Pushing back on demands formore censorship on his platform, Zuckerberg said, 'You can't impose tolerancetop-down.' But that fact is not stopping some members of Congress\u2014in bothparties\u2014from trying. While the concerns that motivate the two parties are different, the so-called 'solutions' to the alleged problems posed by Facebook and other social media sites that have been proposed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., aren't all that different: Regulate Facebook or break it up. Their rhetoric is also virtuallyindistinguishable. Warrenargues[2]that 'today's big tech companies have too much power\u2014too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,' and the solution is to regulate them like public utilities that would be 'required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users.' Who gets to determine what's 'fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory'? Rest assured: It won't be you. Hawley, who hascalled[3]Facebook 'an extremely creepy company,'says 'theline-drawing problems are not as difficult as folks make it sound.'  But whogets to determine who draws the lines? Again, not you. The stampede from left and right to regulate Facebook, Google, and other tech companies provides a classic example of a useful thought experiment: Every time you come up with a new power for government, think about that power being exercised by politicians you don't like. Does Hawley really want Warren determining what's fair and reasonable? Does Warren really want Hawley drawing lines to determine the level of bias? I'm guessing not. Conservatives should beparticularly wary of this kind of thinking. Once we breach the dam ofgovernment regulation of social media, there is no certainty that you'll end upwith Hawleybook instead of Warrenbook. Given the nature of popular culturetoday, Warrenbook is a much likelier outcome. There are also the practical consequences. Some conservatives flippantly call for ending Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the provision that ensures that Facebook and Twitter\u2014as well as the comments section of the New York Times, Amazon, and Yelp\u2014are not liable for what their users post. There are many responses tothat, but the bottom line is that ending Section 230 would be the end of socialmedia (and a lot of other user-created online content).  If every social mediacompany is responsible for libel by every user, expect to see the following popup on your next Facebook status: 'Thank you for your status update. It will beposted once it has been reviewed by our legal team. The current wait time is 3days, 12 hours, 16 min.' Stack that possible futureup against what we have today. Social media platforms have positives beyond memes and my countdown to Christmas music season. Facebook enables us to stay connected to cousins, distant relatives, and friends from earlier parts of our lives who we would have otherwise lost track of.  It also allows us to interact with a range of people we might never encounter or get a response from in real life, such as artists, authors, sports personalities, even politicians. It provides a way to raise money for causes, organize activities, and, yes, follow the news.  Beyond Facebook, platforms such as LinkedIn give people a way to build professional networks and find new careers. Figure8 gives parents a way to coordinate carpools in their communities.  Imagine what new platforms will have become part of our daily experience in 10 years? Everybody likes to hate socialmedia\u2014and some days, I'm right there with them. But for all of its faults, Zuckerberg'splatform has been a net positive in my life and most of our lives.  As a user, I have everyright to ask for changes in the product, or I can decide not to use it. Butsmall-government conservatives demanding that government exert its power over aprivate company to enact my preferences should be off thetable.  Ultimately, this is adebate about the democratization of information and how that empowers people. No one argues that innovation and new technologies don't come with downsides. But social media are positive tools that make our lives better in ways many of us now take for granted.  Individuals are smartenough and resilient enough to figure out how to use it wisely. More governmentisn't the answer. Conservatives ought to know that. The post Facebook Isn't Broken. Government Shouldn't 'Fix' It.[4] appeared first on The Daily Signal[5].

It's a dangerouscollaboration. But when you take a closerlook at the complaints lodged by each side, you see how thin their argumentsreally are. Most of the left-wing criticism of Facebook amount to criticisms of human nature. </p><p>People lie. People are jerks.They seem to want Facebook to be responsible for the fall of man. Most of the conservative criticisms of the social media platform are allegations of bias. And I'm not here to tell you there is none, because, well, see left-wing criticisms.  People are human. Evenpeople who design algorithms are human. Trying to defend Facebook from chargesof bias is a fool's errand. The sheer volume of content posted daily from allover the globe virtually guarantees that it will make wrong calls.  It has done so with the pro-life groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List (and acknowledged at least some of those errors), and I'm sure it will again.  And the left has madeitsown accusations[1]of bias in Facebook's fact-checking. Facebook is a globalprivate company, with 100 billion pieces of content every day, facing differing andsometimes conflicting objections from right and left. Do we really wantgovernment to step into this morass? In an Oct. 17 speech atGeorgetown University, co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg committed Facebook todefending free expression, pledging that all members of its new appealsboardwill'each hold free expression as their paramount value.'  Pushing back on demands formore censorship on his platform, Zuckerberg said, 'You can't impose tolerancetop-down.' But that fact is not stopping some members of Congress in bothparties from trying. While the concerns that motivate the two parties are different, the so-called 'solutions' to the alleged problems posed by Facebook and other social media sites that have been proposed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., aren't all that different: Regulate Facebook or break it up. Their rhetoric is also virtuallyindistinguishable. Warrenargues[2]that 'today's big tech companies have too much power too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,' and the solution is to regulate them like public utilities that would be 'required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users.' Who gets to determine what's 'fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory'? Rest assured: It won't be you. Hawley, who hascalled[3]Facebook 'an extremely creepy company,'says 'theline-drawing problems are not as difficult as folks make it sound.'  But whogets to determine who draws the lines? Again, not you. The stampede from left and right to regulate Facebook, Google, and other tech companies provides a classic example of a useful thought experiment: Every time you come up with a new power for government, think about that power being exercised by politicians you don't like. Does Hawley really want Warren determining what's fair and reasonable? Does Warren really want Hawley drawing lines to determine the level of bias? I'm guessing not. Conservatives should beparticularly wary of this kind of thinking. Once we breach the dam ofgovernment regulation of social media, there is no certainty that you'll end upwith Hawleybook instead of Warrenbook. Given the nature of popular culturetoday, Warrenbook is a much likelier outcome. There are also the practical consequences. Some conservatives flippantly call for ending Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the provision that ensures that Facebook and Twitter as well as the comments section of the New York Times, Amazon, and Yelp are not liable for what their users post. There are many responses tothat, but the bottom line is that ending Section 230 would be the end of socialmedia (and a lot of other user-created online content).  If every social mediacompany is responsible for libel by every user, expect to see the following popup on your next Facebook status: 'Thank you for your status update. It will beposted once it has been reviewed by our legal team. The current wait time is 3days, 12 hours, 16 min.' Stack that possible futureup against what we have today. Social media platforms have positives beyond memes and my countdown to Christmas music season. Facebook enables us to stay connected to cousins, distant relatives, and friends from earlier parts of our lives who we would have otherwise lost track of.  It also allows us to interact with a range of people we might never encounter or get a response from in real life, such as artists, authors, sports personalities, even politicians. It provides a way to raise money for causes, organize activities, and, yes, follow the news.  Beyond Facebook, platforms such as LinkedIn give people a way to build professional networks and find new careers. Figure8 gives parents a way to coordinate carpools in their communities.  Imagine what new platforms will have become part of our daily experience in 10 years? Everybody likes to hate socialmedia and some days, I'm right there with them. But for all of its faults, Zuckerberg'splatform has been a net positive in my life and most of our lives.  As a user, I have everyright to ask for changes in the product, or I can decide not to use it. Butsmall-government conservatives demanding that government exert its power over aprivate company to enact my preferences should be off thetable.  Ultimately, this is adebate about the democratization of information and how that empowers people. No one argues that innovation and new technologies don't come with downsides. But social media are positive tools that make our lives better in ways many of us now take for granted.  Individuals are smartenough and resilient enough to figure out how to use it wisely. More governmentisn't the answer. Conservatives ought to know that. The post Facebook Isn't Broken. Government Shouldn't 'Fix' It.[4] appeared first on The Daily Signal[5].

Think of it: the visibility of a YouTube, the algorithms, security, and data storage of a Facebook or Gmail, the utility of a Google - all of these and more were supposed to be offered to the masses free of charge. That's not a business model any company could sustain. Like it or not, the product: The ubiquity of a Facebook or the ease of Google, is not the product. </p><p>We are the product.Our personal identities are curated and sold to advertisers. Succinctly, the information we provide on the internet via these and other big tech companies allows them to offer amazing services for 'free.'In return, we adhere to user agreements. We barter what many people consider beyond commodification: our very selves. Our aspirations, political affiliations and ideologies, religious beliefs, or lack thereof, sexual orientation, even the kind of alcohol we like or our favorite color \" all of these and more, from the intimate to the mundane, are pretty well understood by Facebook and company.For the construction and maintenance of infrastructure, employees' salaries, technology, research and development, security, and yes, profit, tech companies had little choice but to use advertising as a means of steady revenue. Even better (for big tech and advertisers), as the television market has become saturated, fractured, and streamed, large advertisement campaigns on big legacy stations have given way (somewhat) to smaller, targeted, personalized, and more effective advertising on all mediums: your phone, your netbook, and your tablet.There are those who dislike this paradigm. They see this packaging of our identities as a kind of violation of privacy. They find the prospect of big tech and big data knowing a great deal about consumers as Orwellian and dystopic. Really?People need to grow up. Either we accept this paradigm, or advocate for regulations. These regulations could treat big tech (specifically Facebook and Google plus Gmail) as utilities, like electricity and gas companies.Having said all that, I can definitely understand people's frustrations. The recent revelations are alarming. Political obfuscation was perpetrated by Russian spies to subvert the 2016 American presidential election via Facebook ads.Moreover, through Facebook and other social media platforms, Russian intelligence attempted to interfere in other democracies in Europe, like Britain (witness Brexit) and France.Worse, most large companies, far beyond tech (like banks and retailers), aren't spending the time and resources to protect our private information as best they can.The recent data breaches at Equifax (an American credit scoring company), Facebook, Yahoo, Whatsapp, Instagram, Target, Walmart, several government agencies in America and abroad, and data intrusion by North Korea of several major South Korean banks, attest to the rather lax way the internet, or at least the infrastructure thereof, has not taken cyber security seriously.Particularly for tech companies, the way in which most of the applications and computer programs we routinely use are not properly structured.From inception, phone apps, for example, are created for functionality and utility, not security. The apps are then retrofitted with a patchwork of security features meant to fix vulnerabilities.This has been going on for a long, long time. Take Windows OS or Apple's various operating systems. These programs are created and sold, then consumers get security updates and patches, often at inconvenient times and with some updates slowing down the overall functionality of the computers using these operating systems (the newest iteration of Windows 10's updates are a glaring and annoying example).Imagine if people routinely bought cars that needed major fixes every few months. Who would buy such a product (Tesla notwithstanding)? Even worse, unlike Facebook and company, Windows, Apple and Android are programs we necessarily pay for whenever we buy a computer, netbook, or tablet.There's blame to go around. The internet was conceived more as a means to share information, but like Social Security numbers in America, we use the internet for almost everything without proper security measures in place.Unfortunately, even paid internet services cannot guarantee 100 percent security, and in the case of Facebook and company, we understand (or should) that our data is subject to being sold, and sometimes mismanaged.It's naive to act as if we didn't know this, and unless you plan to live under a rock, there's no way to get around this constant vulnerability. The best thing we can hope for is a better balance in privacy, security, and the sharing of our information in a fashion that's legal, transparent, and secure.We want free stuff and no skin in the game. At least with the web, it has never been that way, and it never will be. Free stuff ain't free. Consumers and corporations need to deal with it.</p><p>Deauwand Myers (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:deauwand@hotmail.com\">deauwand@hotmail.com</email>) holds a master's degree in English literature and literary theory, and is an English professor outside Seoul.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S94-BX91-JCBN-50TK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"863\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 9, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002M0H</classCode><className>EQUIFAX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>EFX (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

An array of newly announced or planned products could help it grab a slice of a hugely lucrative industry and bring in tens of billions in revenues. And the move will help Facebook diversify away from its controversial (but profitable) advertising business at a time of unprecedented uncertainty and scrutiny for the company. Facebook[1] wants to get inside your wallet. </p><p>The Silicon Valley social networking giant is doubling down on its consumer payments and finance infrastructure, and on Tuesday announced Facebook Pay[2] \u2014 a unified payments app for making payments across its ecosystem of apps. And more ambitiously, it is still plowing ahead with Libra, its plan for a new cryptocurrency, even in the face of significant political and regulatory opposition. The $555 billion company's escalating efforts in the financial sphere highlight how the company is in the midst of an unprecedented push to diversify beyond its core lucrative advertising business. Why? The simple answer is that the business opportunity for Facebook is massive. The company pulls in billions in profit every quarter off the strength of its advertising business, but Western markets are increasingly saturated, while emerging economies where Facebook is still growing monetize at lower rates. By investing in ecommerce and payments, Facebook gains an opportunity to cash in on its existing audiences in all-new ways. We're already seeing a glimpse of this with Facebook's push to add shopping options to its photo-sharing app Instagram. It's still early days for the effort, but Deutsche Bank analysts have predicted[3] that it could generate $10 billion in additional revenue for Facebook by 2021. But payments has another benefit: It's also (in theory) less controversial than advertising. Notwithstanding concerns from lawmakers about Libra's potential impact on US national sovereignty, doubling down into financial-related products gives Facebook a toehold in a space that is less politically sensitive than ads have proved to be over the past few years. Facebook continues to be in the midst of a firestorm of controversy over whether it should be running political ads on its platform (it says it should, asserting free speech reasons, while rival Twitter has taken the opposite view), and there is ongoing discussion about the fundamental ethics of hyper-targeted online advertising[4]. Meanwhile, ad fraud is a perennial concern for Facebook and the rest of the online advertising industry. The payments and ecommerce world has its own unique headaches, of course, and it's very unlikely that advertising will stop comprising a major part of Facebook's business in two, five, or even 10 years. But this diversification puts the company on a stronger and more stable footing as it navigates an unparalleled number of known and unknown challenges in the years ahead \u2014 from antitrust arguments to concerns about how it handles user data to content policy controversies and beyond. In the third quarter of 2019, Facebook pulled in $17.65 billion in revenue. $17.38 billion of that came from advertising; just $269 million came from payments and all \"other fees,\" a catch-all category that includes sales of the company's Oculus VR headset as well as fees from app developers who use the social network's existing payments infrastructure. If Facebook can make its overall payments and ecommerce business even a quarter as successful as its ads business, that's an extra $17 billion-plus in revenue every year.Do you work at Facebook, or a company that interacts with it?Contact this reporter via encrypted messaging app Signal at +1 (650) 636-6268 using a non-work phone, email at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rprice@businessinsider.com\">rprice@businessinsider.com</email>, Telegram or WeChat at robaeprice, or Twitter DM at@robaeprice[5].

Facebook is resisting giving over reams of internal documents to the EU's antitrust investigator.Bloomberg[2] reported that on July 15 Facebook's lawyer in the EU filed an official challenge to a request from the European Commission for documents relating to the company's internal practices. Facebook confirmed to Reuters[3] on Monday it's suing the Commission for demanding unreasonable quantities of information. </p><p>The Commission said it would defend its position in court, per Reuters.Facebook's lawyer Tim Lamb said the EU's requested internal emails that mentioned a set of 2,500 terms including \"big question,\" \"shut down,\" and \"not good for us,\" and could end up infringing on the privacy of individual employees.\"We are cooperating with the Commission and would expect to give them hundreds of thousands of documents,\" Lamb told Business Insider in a statement. \"The exceptionally broad nature of the Commission's requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the Commission's investigations, including highly sensitive personal information such as employees' medical information, personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees.\"We think such requests should be reviewed by the EU Courts.\"The Commission has been investigating Facebook's data practices and its Marketplace platform since summer 2019, but has not yet launched a formal antitrust probe.Reuters reports Facebook has already handed 315,000 documents over to the Commission.Meanwhile, Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg is preparing to testify before Congress on Wednesday in a series of big tech US antitrust hearings.

After my Mum leaned down and gave me one final bear hug, I was off to start my education as I casually waved her away without looking at her \"\" clearly she was cramping my style. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I don't remember this seminal moment, but I happened to stumble upon the footage this week by complete happenstance.</p><p>The video is of a TV screen playing an old VHS tape and appears to be taken on a camera phone. My guess is my younger sister found the tape and filmed the video to send to me.</p><p>But maybe I should just ask Facebook, because that's where I found it - in the huge file containing my extensive Facebookhistory the company keeps on me.</p><p>Since the moment I, and everyone else signed up, the social media service has been collecting and keeping everything - I seriously mean everything - we have ever done on the site. All the conversations, videos, pictures and documents we have shared or have had sent to us are all held on a server somewhere with space specially dedicated to each of us.</p><p>I downloaded the cache (it's very easy to do) to check out everything Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) had on file about me from over the years.</p><p>It included scanned copies of lease forms from a previous rental property I must've sent to my buddies over Messenger, my current tenant ledger report, an old monthly billing statement for my home broadband, screen shots of banking transfers and seemingly endless web pages of all the banal conversations I have ever had on the platform.</p><p>It's one thing to know Facebookholds all this data (and much more) on you but it's another thing to trawl through it and find things even you'd forgotten about yourself.</p><p>It's an odd feeling to think that, in some ways, Facebookknows you better than you know yourself.</p><p>Looking through the 500MB zip file you can see your \"Ads History\" which stores what ads you've ever clicked on as well as all the advertisers who Facebookhas shared your contact information with.</p><p>It has facial recognition data (Facebookhas 105 examples of what I look like), exhaustive photo metadata including your location and the time the photo was taken and data about every time you logged onto the site such as the IP address, location, browser and device used.</p><p>My file also contained the names and numbers for everyone in my iPhone's contact list - and yours will too.</p><p>Facebooknot only knows everything you've ever done on its platform but via cookies it leaves in your web browser it also tracks you wherever you go on the internet - even if you don't use Facebook.</p><p>I, like many others, opened my Facebookaccount just over a decade ago. Arguably it's the first time in history that 10 years of human behaviour has been meticulously gathered, stored and analysed by a company on this scale.</p><p>It's called surveillance capitalism and it's the reason Zuckerberg is worth $92 billion.</p><p>But as the public and regulators become increasingly aware of just how deep Facebook's tentacles extend into our digital lives, the company is facing increasing political headwinds.</p><p>Earlier this month Belgium ordered Facebookto stop tracking internet users who have no accounts with the social network, or face fines of 250,000 euros a day.</p><p>The ruling came amid efforts by the European Union to force Facebookto comply with stringent new privacy rules that would threaten its ability to sell advertising based on targeted user information.</p><p>Now Australia has become the latest government to turn up the heat on the Zuckerbergs of the world.</p><p>The Federal Government has ordered the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate the big tech giants in what ACCC chairman Rodd Sims said will be the broadest inquiry of its type in the world.</p><p>The ACCC's inquiry will involve asking consumers how much they think the digital platforms know about them and comparing that to what is in fact being gathered.</p><p>Some people have asserted that consumers know what's going on and don't care, Mr Sims said </p><p>last week.</p><p>\"I think it's absolutely crucial we find out what consumers do know and then let's see whether they care. My suspicion is Facebookand Google have much more personal information about people than people realise,\" he said.</p><p>The inquiry will look at whether Facebook, Google or others have misused their power in commercial dealings.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOW TO DOWNLOAD YOUR PERSONAL DATA</emphasis></p><p>Facebookwas the first of the big social media companies to give users the ability to download a file containing their personal history on the service. Google followed in 2011 and Twitter in 2012.</p><p>It's undeniably a good thing and means you can partake in Mr Sims's game of comparing if the amount of personal data Facebookhas on you is in line with your expectations.</p><p>To download it, click at the top right of any Facebookpage on the desktop version of the site and select Settings.</p><p>Click \"Download a copy of your Facebookdata\" below your General Account Settings and then click the green button.</p><p>It takes about 10 minutes for Facebookto retrieve the file and you'll get an email and notification when it's ready to download.</p><p>Even if you don't use Facebookvery much, you might be surprised by what you find.</p><p>I seldom use Facebookany more and deleted the app on my phone some time ago.

Today, the company is again in hot water for, among other things, misusing private user data, failing to stop the spread of fake news and enabling the distribution of toxic and violent multimedia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the company isn't the only one in trouble. Now the regulator who is in charge of policing markets - the FTC - is facing a crisis of legitimacy. The reason is simple. We know that Mark Zuckerberg will do whatever he feels he can get away with. And he can get away with a lot; Facebook's surveillance-based business model is a money printing machine, garnering $55bn of revenue last year. At a certain point, however, after a bank robber has shown he will keep robbing banks, the right question isn't why the bank robber does what he does, it's \"Where are the cops?\"</p><p>Over the past two weeks, the FTC has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/01/new-privacy-oversight-on-the-table-for-facebook-zuckerberg-1402278\">reportedly been negotiating</url> a $3bn to $5bn fine, which sounds like a lot of money, and which the commission will no doubt describe as \"record-breaking\". But when compared with Facebook's revenue, it is an unimportant amount. That amount is between 5% and 10% of the company's annual revenue, the equivalent to what it will generate in revenue in three weeks. Upon the rumors becoming public, the stock value of the company jumped by roughly $40bn.</p><p>The money isn't the end of the settlement talks. Facebook would also have to create an in-house \"privacy committee\", and appoint a federally approved privacy official to oversee and report biannually on Facebook's compliance. Plus, CEO Mark Zuckerberg would probably become the company's own \"designated compliance officer\". That's right, the man who <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/01/new-privacy-oversight-on-the-table-for-facebook-zuckerberg-1402278\">recently joked</url> \"I know we don't exactly have the strongest reputation on privacy right now,\" while facing down       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/01/new-privacy-oversight-on-the-table-for-facebook-zuckerberg-1402278\">a year of controversy</url> and ongoing federal investigations, may personally oversee privacy efforts at the company.</p><p>What is especially pathetic is the company probably won't even have to admit wrongdoing.</p><p>The FTC is an agency in crisis. Last year at his nominating hearing, the FTC chairman, Joe Simons, pledged to look at big tech platforms for potential bad behavior. That, he said, is where the action is. Simons has done nothing on tech and very little in general so far. For example, the FTC under Simons has not challenged a single corporate merger in court. The primary problem here isn't just that the FTC's leadership is weak, though it is. It's that the commission has no underlying goal for the settlement except to get a good headline and hopefully get Congress and the public to stop paying attention. This is not a coherent way to address the crisis in the social media industry that Facebook reflects.</p><p>Any competent regulator must first frame the problem they are trying to address. In this case, the problem is simple. First, the company has a culture of immorality and lawlessness, epitomized by the slogan \"Move Fast and Break Things\". Second, the company operates in a market where the incentive is to gather as much personally identifiable data as possible so it can use that data to profit through individually targeted advertising. This induces privacy violations no matter what the rules say.</p><p>When framed properly, the solutions become obvious, at least at a high level. The first step is to force Mark Zuckerberg to admit he did wrong. This would send a message through Facebook's entire company, which right now is composed of many executives and engineers who think the media is just picking on them.</p><p>There's also an important legal consequence to such an admission. It would also open up the company to private lawsuits by the victims of Facebook's strategy. Letting Facebook settle without an admission of wrongdoing would be handing the company a win: a legal shield to protect it from real accountability. The company could then use this new settlement in fending off litigation from state enforcers. It is already trying to keep executives' records <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/01/new-privacy-oversight-on-the-table-for-facebook-zuckerberg-1402278\">sealed in a court case</url> with the Washington DC attorney general, Karl Racine.</p><p>(Of course, Facebook would not be alone in avoiding an admission of wrongdoing as part of an FTC settlement. In August 2017, Uber, another tech giant plagued by scandal and privacy concerns, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/01/new-privacy-oversight-on-the-table-for-facebook-zuckerberg-1402278\">settled</url> an FTC complaint over its mishandling of private user and driver data, neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing. PayPal, which owns Venmo, settled with the agency in February 2018, for misleading consumers about their transaction privacy on the peer-to-peer payment service; the company       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/01/new-privacy-oversight-on-the-table-for-facebook-zuckerberg-1402278\">did not admit</url> to any wrongdoing, either.)</p><p>After an admission of wrongdoing, the second step is to restructure the business model of Facebook so it has no incentive to collect and exploit data. The FTC could follow the example of the German federal cartel office, which put aggressive restrictions on the data the company can use for targeted advertising purposes. Without the ability to exploit data for profit, Facebook would no longer have a reason to collect it.</p><p>There are many other potential solutions, but the point of any of them would be to attack the culture of lawlessness in the company and eliminate the motivation to collect data. Facebook will fight any such demands, and the FTC will have to go to court to enforce them. If the FTC's litigation department is not up to the challenge, Simons must act to bring its quality up to snuff. And if the courts block the FTC from acting, then the commission will have a reason to ask for more authority from Congress. But \"we don't want to try\" is no longer enough.</p><p>At the very least, given Facebook's repeated misconduct, the FTC must require something meaningful beyond a settlement designed to get headlines for the size of the fine. This seems unlikely. It's time Congress took a hard look at the agency itself. It must immediately examine the FTC's settlement with Facebook as well as the investigation, and it must move money from the FTC's budget to state attorneys general, such as Tish James in New York or Racine in DC, who are acting to protect consumers and users from unrepentant data companies such as Facebook.</p><p>It is clear the FTC has failed to hold powerful companies accountable. A settlement with Facebook, requiring no admission of wrongdoing, would further prove the agency's fecklessness. But it's up to Congress to say enough, and move taxpayer money to enforcers who actually seem intent on doing their jobs. The right question at this point is not \"Why is Mark Zuckerberg violating my privacy?\" We know why. It's profitable. The right question is, \"Where are the cops?\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-53076292</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2H-V0G1-JCJY-G3D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1124\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

The agreement also lays out an elaborate, expensive compliance program for Facebook. The previous record for the largest fine imposed for violation of an FTC consent decree was $22.5 million - a privacy case involving Google in 2012.\u00a0<br/>Democratic Commissioners Rohit Chopra and Kelly Slaughter argued that the fine was too small, that the FTC should have sought to hold Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg personally liable, and that an even tougher compliance program should have been required. The Republican majority defended the compliance program and questioned, more than a dozen times in eight pages, whether the FTC could have obtained better relief for consumers if the Commission had decided to litigate the case. Implicitly (but repeatedly), the majority seemed to concede that the FTC might not have been able to obtain any fines at all if it had taken the case to court.</p><p><br/>\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook just bought a $5 billion protective moat around its business model</emphasis>,\" said Berin Sz\u00f3ka, President of TechFreedom. \"Facebook can't be happy about taking such a huge financial hit, but with over $50 billion in cash on hand, the company can easily afford this settlement. But more importantly, who else could? Nothing could do more to discourage competition with today's tech giants than the looming threat of such massive fines. Those cheering today's settlement as a victory against Big Tech should think twice about its long-term effects on those trying to dethrone Facebook. Fortunately, Facebook did refuse to accept what would have been an even worse barrier to entry: that executives can be held personally liable when it's so unclear whether conduct is illegal. Who would launch a startup, or take a leadership role at one, if they might face staggering personal liability?\"<br/>Only by charging Facebook with violating an unrelated 2012 privacy consent decree was the FTC able to impose a monetary penalty, since the FTC Act does not authorize penalties for new charges that a company violated the Act by committing an unfair or deceptive practice. Remarkably, nothing in the Order or the Republican majority's statement explains why the Cambridge Analytica fiasco fell within the scope of the 2012 decree. A year ago, TechFreedom urged the FTC to charge Facebook with deceiving its users by failing to notify them about Cambridge Analytica's misuse (and to seek new injunctive relief), but concluded, in the first public legal analysis of the case, that the 2012 consent decree did not apply - and thus that the FTC could not obtain monetary penalties.<br/>\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Today's fine rests on a legal sleight of hand - and sets a dangerous precedent</emphasis>,\" warned Sz\u00f3ka. \"Chairman Simons seems to have found himself in an impossible position: His Democratic colleagues wanted a much, much larger fine, but at least one Republican Commissioner - and maybe all three - clearly recognized the cold, hard legal reality: if Facebook refused to settle, a court would rule that the FTC had no authority to impose monetary penalties because the agency could not show that the new conduct fell within the scope of the 2012 consent decree. Indeed, when that agreement was negotiated, Republican Commissioner Rosch, who wanted a tougher order, complained that the agreement did not cover conduct by third party app developers - the very thing at issue here. That Facebook chose to settle again merely proves that the company decided it was worth $5 billion not to have to drag out its public relations nightmare any further.\"<br/>\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Today's settlement should trouble even Facebook's critics - especially </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook's critics - because the company has, whether intentionally or not, helped to establish two legal precedents that will be used against all</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> tech companies, including small ones</emphasis>,\" Sz\u00f3ka explained. \"The first is multiplying, by 22-fold, what fines are considered reasonable. The second is validating the FTC's use of privacy consent decrees to regulate everything a company does. Combine these two things with the fact that FTC already has all significant tech companies under 20-year consent decrees, and the result is vast and essentially arbitrary power over the tech sector. This isn't something that even the fiercest critics of 'Big Tech' should want. It might be fair to penalize tech companies for violating clear new rules if Congress legislates, but not for failing to predict how the FTC wields its existing, uniquely vague power to decide what is 'unfair' or 'deceptive.' And even with clear rules, Congress needs to establish clear limiting principles governing the FTC's ability to impose fines, just as it did when it created the Consumer Financial Protection Board.\"In a Medium post published earlier this year, Sz\u00f3ka analyzed the legal issues surrounding the case, distilling a letter TechFreedom sent to lawmakers last March, shortly after the news broke about Cambridge Analytica's misuse of data collected about Facebook users. <br/>See more of our work on consumer privacy, including:<br/>Our March 2018 analysis of the FTC's authority as applied to the Cambridge Analytica and recommendations for Congress<br/>\"The Facebook/Cambridge Analytica Settlement: How Far Can the FTC Go, Legally?\" on Medium<br/>Our 2018 FTC Comments on Competition &amp;

While Cambridge Analytica obtained the user data through unsanctioned means, the data itself was scraped from what people were sharing on Facebook.</p><p>The fact that this data was used to custom-tailor ads for prospective voters in service of swaying voters towards\u00a0Donald Trump is a wake-up call for people on all sides of the political divide: it matters that you <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-find-out-everything-facebook-knows-about-you-2018-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">share things on Facebook</url>. And yes, the internet can reach out and influence the real world.\u00a0</p><p>Here's the thing, though. Cambridge Analytica is really just the canary in the coal mine for a new wave of scandals - scandals that are impossible to prepare for because the world hasn't seen anything like it.\u00a0</p><p>The first thing you should know is that when it comes to sharing information online, that ship has mostly sailed. Between your friends tagging you on Facebook, and the very many data breaches experienced by sites like Yahoo and Orbitz, there is more information about you floating around online than you might realize.\u00a0</p><p>Second, and more importantly, you have to know that the future is going to get very odd. Just this year, a scandal broke out on Reddit over \"<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/discord-closes-down-deepfakes-server-ai-celebrity-porn-2018-1?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Deepfakes</url>,\" a technology for using artificial intelligence to digitally insert celebrities into pornographic videos, using nothing more than still photos.\u00a0</p><p>The point is that as such technology matures, it's only going to get easier for people to create fake stuff: fake videos, fake accounts, fake news. And it's going to be harder for ordinary people to understand what is authentic and what isn't.</p><p>Every Twitch streamer, every Instagram selfie-taker, and every YouTube vlogger, every bit of personal information you think you are revealing only to your friends could be giving the bad guys all the ammunition they need to impersonate people.\u00a0</p><p>I mean, researchers have shown that it's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/13/peace-sign-pics-fingerprints/\">possible to duplicate a fingerprint from an Instagram photo</url>.</p><p>Facebook</p><p>Besides flat out fakes and impersonation, there is manipulation of the style employed by Cambridge Analytica. It used social media information to construct \"psychographic\" voter profiles, targeting users based on their personality traits. And that technology will be getting smarter, too. Machine learning and artificial intelligence will allow all kinds of companies (and more of those bad guys) to construct ever-more-accurate assessments of what you like, what you don't, what motivates you, all based on the data stream you're leaving behind.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>And from there, these models could be used to create very realistic \"virtual\" humans. Couple all of this with Mark Zuckerberg's notion that <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-f8-mark-zuckerberg-on-augmented-reality-2017-4?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">computers you wear on your face are the wave of the future</url>, and the future is going to be equal parts weird and scary. It's already getting difficult to tell what's real or not; it's only going to get harder from here.</p><p>So as the Cambridge Analytica scandal reaches its crescendo, just get ready for what's next, because we as a society are going to have to have some really tough conversations about what we share online, who can access that information, and, most importantly, how we can protect ourselves.\u00a0</p><p>This time, the data was used for advertising that could well have influenced an election. I'm not sure I want to know what other ways our data will be misused but it seems inevitable that one day, very soon, we will all find out.</p><p>NOW WATCH: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-reid-hoffman-on-facebooks-mark-zuckerbergs-growth-2017-11?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">LinkedIn's founder explains how Mark Zuckerberg transformed from an awkward kid to one of tech's best CEOs</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Also:</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-apology-facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal-2018-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">If Zuck wants us to take Facebook's response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal seriously, he should try saying 'sorry'</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-tracks-people-not-on-site-ads-privacy-2016-6?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Facebook can still track you even if you delete your account - here's how to stop it</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/sandy-parakilas-facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal-2018-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">A former Facebook employee who was responsible for monitoring data breaches has come forward about the way Facebook handles user data, calling its practices 'utterly shocking and horrifying'</url></p></bodyText></listItem></list><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEE ALSO:\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg finally breaks his silence on the Cambridge Analytica scandal</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISIUS-5ab2da930860e827008b4785</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISIUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VD6-XGV1-JBG6-5275-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465531</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><timeReceived>08:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Insider Inc.

It's a good time to reflect on how much of our personal information we're willing to share online \u2014 especially as the tools for misusing that data get smarter and better every year. Cambridge Analytica may be the first big social media data scandal but it won't be the last.And it gets weirder from here.By now, it looks like the furor over Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal has peaked \u2014 CEO Mark Zuckerberg has finally broken his silence and promised to do better.[1] It seems likely that Zuckerberg, or one of his lieutenants, will have to testify in front of lawmakers. Concessions will be made, the idea of regulating \"Big Tech\" will be kicked around some more, and then, in all probability, the world will move on. </p><p>So it's worth taking a moment to reflect on what we've learned from the affair so far. The Cambridge Analytica scandal serves as a forceful reminder that there are consequences to posting on social media. While Cambridge Analytica obtained the user data through unsanctioned means, the data itself was scraped from what people were sharing on Facebook. The fact that this data was used to custom-tailor ads for prospective voters in service of swaying voters towardsDonald Trump is a wake-up call for people on all sides of the political divide: it matters that you share things on Facebook[2]. And yes, the internet can reach out and influence the real world. Here's the thing, though. Cambridge Analytica is really just the canary in the coal mine for a new wave of scandals \u2014 scandals that are impossible to prepare for because the world hasn't seen anything like it. The first thing you should know is that when it comes to sharing information online, that ship has mostly sailed. Between your friends tagging you on Facebook, and the very many data breaches experienced by sites like Yahoo and Orbitz, there is more information about you floating around online than you might realize. Second, and more importantly, you have to know that the future is going to get very odd. Just this year, a scandal broke out on Reddit over \"Deepfakes[3],\" a technology for using artificial intelligence to digitally insert celebrities into pornographic videos, using nothing more than still photos. The point is that as such technology matures, it's only going to get easier for people to create fake stuff: fake videos, fake accounts, fake news. And it's going to be harder for ordinary people to understand what is authentic and what isn't. Every Twitch streamer, every Instagram selfie-taker, and every YouTube vlogger, every bit of personal information you think you are revealing only to your friends could be giving the bad guys all the ammunition they need to impersonate people. I mean, researchers have shown that it's possible to duplicate a fingerprint from an Instagram photo[4].Besides flat out fakes and impersonation, there is manipulation of the style employed by Cambridge Analytica. It used social media information to construct \"psychographic\" voter profiles, targeting users based on their personality traits. And that technology will be getting smarter, too. Machine learning and artificial intelligence will allow all kinds of companies (and more of those bad guys) to construct ever-more-accurate assessments of what you like, what you don't, what motivates you, all based on the data stream you're leaving behind.  And from there, these models could be used to create very realistic \"virtual\" humans. Couple all of this with Mark Zuckerberg's notion that computers you wear on your face are the wave of the future[5], and the future is going to be equal parts weird and scary. It's already getting difficult to tell what's real or not; it's only going to get harder from here. So as the Cambridge Analytica scandal reaches its crescendo, just get ready for what's next, because we as a society are going to have to have some really tough conversations about what we share online, who can access that information, and, most importantly, how we can protect ourselves. This time, the data was used for advertising that could well have influenced an election. I'm not sure I want to know what other ways our data will be misused but it seems inevitable that one day, very soon, we will all find out.NOW WATCH: LinkedIn's founder explains how Mark Zuckerberg

The FTC settlement also requires Facebook to make sweeping changes to its privacy practices and submit itself to more independent scrutiny than ever before. Facebook must establish a board-level independent privacy committee and designate \"compliance officers,\" who will beheld accountable for the firm's privacy standards. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] The Federal Trade Commission announced today[2] that it has slapped Facebook with a $5 billion penalty over its handling of user data which came to light after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The settlement is the result of Facebook violating a 2012 agreement with the FTC, in which it promised not to hand over user data to third parties without consent. It represents the biggest penalty the FTC has handed down to a technology company, with the regulator calling it \"unprecedented.\"Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1154008896446586881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Facebook assessed $5 billion penalty, subjected to sweeping new restrictions on user privacy decisions to settle FTC charges the company violated a 2012 FTC order by deceiving users about their ability to control privacy of their personal info.

Facebook will be required to restructure its board of directors, mandating an independent privacy committee. The FTC said this committee will remove CEO Mark Zuckerberg's \"unfettered control\" over user privacy, and will be responsible for appointing \"compliance officers\" to Facebook's privacy programme. These officers will be held accountable for the firm's privacy standards. Members of the new committee must be appointed by an \"independent nominating committee,\" and can only be fired by a \"supermajority\" from Facebook's board of directors.Facebook's VP of Product Partnerships Ime Archibong wrote in a blog post[6] that the restructuring will mean a \"fundamental shift in the way we work.\" \"Under the new framework required by the FTC, we'll be accountable and transparent about fixing old products that don't work the way they should and building new products to a higher standard,\" wrote Archibong. The FTC also included a list of six new privacy requirements it's imposing on Facebook. These include: Increased oversight of third-party apps. A ban on taking users' phone numbers security purposes and then using them for advertising (which it admitted to doing last year[7]). Clearly alerting users and getting affirmative consent before using facial recognition. Establishing and maintaining a new and comprehensive data security program. Encrypting user passwords and regularly scanning to see if any passwords are being kept in vulnerable, plain-text format (as was discovered in March of this year[8]). A ban on asking for email passwords to other services when users sign up to Facebook. Facebook said it was expecting the fine in its first-quarter earnings report last month, saying that it had set aside $3 billion to $5 billion in anticipation[9]. The company is due to give its second-quarter earnings report later on Wednesday[10]. Although the FTC fine has been long-anticipated, it has landed amid a flurry of regulatory activity. Less than an hour after the FTC announced the penalty, the Securities and Exchange Commission fined Facebook $100 million[11]for \"misleading investors\" in the wake of Cambridge Analytica. The day before both penalties landed, the Department of Justice announced a sweeping antitrust probe into the big tech giants[12]. Two members of the FTC, Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, felt the penalty was not harsh enough. \"While it is difficult in this case to quantify the economic value of the violations to the company, there is good reason to believe $5 billion is a substantial undervaluation,\" Slaughter wrote in a statement to CNBC[13].The FTC simultaneously announced[14] it is suing the now-defunct Cambridge Analytica, and has reached settlements with disgraced former CEO Alexander Nix and app developer Aleksandr Kogan, whose \"This Is Your Digital Life\" app scraped the user data then used by Cambridge Analytica. The pair have \"agreed to administrative orders restricting how they conduct any business in the future, and requiring them to delete or destroy any personal information they collected,\" according to the FTC.NOW WATCH: 7 lesser-known benefits of Amazon Prime[15]See Also: Facebook looks set to get stung with another big fine over the biggest scandal in its history[16]The Justice Department's
