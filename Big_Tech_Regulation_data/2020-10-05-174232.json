Her campaign officials have said the complaint about her stock ownership is politically motivated.</p><p>The Mayor's Office issued a statement last week noting that city officials met with the activists earlier  to discuss issues related to the surveillance network.</p><p>\"Attendees brought up a variety of concerns, however the conversation was primarily focused on strengthening and advancing the policy for committee consideration later this month,\" said Christina Chadwick, a spokeswoman for Mayor Kevin Faulconer.</p><p>Jones-Wright said she and other coalition members are satisfied with the progress to date, but additional discussions are being planned.</p><p>\"I walked away feeling very positive about the meetings,\" she said.</p><p>The coalition wants Elliott, the city's highest legal authority, to recuse herself from any decisions related to the \"smart streetlights\" program because she reported owning up to $100,000 worth of stock in General Electric on her annual statement of economic interest, a mandated report that spells out the personal assets of public officials. GE owns the startup that has been installing the sensors.</p><p>\"The city attorney's glaring conflict of interest appears to be what's preventing policymakers from addressing valid concerns about our privacy and civil liberties,\" Jones-Wright said. \"We have alerted the mayor's staff that the city of San Diego must hire outside an uncompromised legal counsel immediately to address the issues with the city's contract with GE.\"</p><p>The City Attorney's Office declined to respond to questions about TRUST San Diego's concerns.</p><p>Instead, the office directed questions to Elliott's political campaign, which said the conflict-of-interest allegations are untrue and are motivated by one of her rivals on the March primary ballot.</p><p>\"Three different state laws make clear that Mara and her family's GE stock, which they made a whopping $200 from last year, isn't even in the ballpark of conflict of interest,\" said campaign spokesman Dan Rottenstreich. \"This is politics - not the law.\"</p><p>Rottenstreich cited two sections of the state Government Code and a regulation of the Fair Political Practices Commission that say minor holdings in publicly traded companies do not typically constitute material conflicts of interest.</p><p>The Elliott campaign also pointed out that Jones-Wright works with Cory Briggs, a San Diego lawyer challenging Elliott on the March primary ballot. Briggs serves on PANA's board.</p><p>\"It's a good thing Mara Elliott is the city attorney and not those shoddy lawyers who wrote this bogus complaint,\" Rottenstreich said.</p><p>Jones-Wright said no one in the TRUST San Diego coalition works for Briggs, who is not even a member.</p><p>In late 2016, the City Council approved a $30 million investment in the development of 3,200 sensor-equipped street lights that would collect audio and visual data in real time.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.<br/>\u00a0<br/> SUSIE GHARIB: Rising interest rates, weak earnings, political problems overseas; you name it and it spooked Wall Street today. The Dow plunges 231 points, the NASDAQ loses 43. Good evening, everyone. I'm Susie Gharib in New York City.<br/>\u00a0<br/> PAUL KANGAS: And I'm Paul Kangas in Miami. There's mixed earnings news from two big tech names after the closing bell. Motorola meets Street estimates, but Intel doesn't. Then, take the Internet, add phone service and cable TV, and you have broadband. We begin a special series looking at how it will impact your world.</p><p>PAUL KANGAS: Wall Street got socked today. The Dow, the NASDAQ and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 all plunged on a day of anxiety, worries about inflation and jitters about earnings. And investors could be in for rough- and-tumble trading tomorrow based on late news from two high tech giants. After the closing bell, Intel and Motorola reported earnings. Erika Miller has details.<br/>\u00a0<br/> ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: After the bell, it was sell on Intel. The company's stock fell in after-hours trading, after it reported disappointing earnings. The world's largest chip-maker posted profits of $0.55 a share in the latest quarter. That was $0.02 below what Wall Street was expecting, but up from last year. Intel says it shipped a record number of chips during the quarter. But it said profit margins on those chips fell as a result of increased competition. Analysts say they're focusing on the company's upbeat forecasts for next quarter, when Intel says it expects revenues and margins to improve significantly, as PC sales get a boost from holiday shopping. Intel also expects next quarter's performance to benefit from strong sales of the latest high-speed Pentium III chip which began shipping last month. Analyst Dan Scovel is repeating his \"hold\" rating on the shares.<br/>\u00a0<br/> DAN SCOVEL, SEMICONDUCTOR ANALYST, FAHNESTOCK: Well Intel is clearly, has a very large exposure to the PC markets. And in the PC market, we are concerned about growth moving forward. Specifically, we think unit sales are fairly assured, however they are going to be at the expense of price erosion and the net result is probably a fairly flat market.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MILLER: Motorola's stock also fell in after-hours trading, even though its results came in on target. It reported a profit of $0.53 a share in the third quarter, a big improvement from last year. The communications equipment maker credits sales growth, particularly in wireless. Sales were strong in all regions, led by Asia. Tomorrow, the market's will turn their focus to the next batch of companies releasing earnings. Look for industry leaders like Time Warner (TWX) and Apple (AAPL) to report. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Meanwhile, a grand slam for three of America's all-star brokers: Merrill Lynch (MER), Paine Webber (PWJ) and Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette came out swinging today with stronger than expected earnings. A big change from last year, when the world financial crisis knocked down their profits. Merrill Lynch earned a $1.34 a share, a nickel better than estimates, and almost a dollar better than a year ago. DLJ more than quadrupled last year's numbers with $0.85 a share, $0.09 better than estimates. And Paine Webber posted the smallest surprise, but still $0.86 a share, beating estimates by $0.03.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: The stock market opened with a list of uncertainties that put investors in a defensive posture, like what would the upcoming reports on retail sales and wholesale prices show? As a result, the Dow Industrial Average headed steadily lower, posting a 92 point loss at 10:00 a.m., as New York Exchange Breadth turned 2 to 1 negative. The early sell-off made it difficult for the NASDAQ Index to follow through on yesterday's record high, so after rising only a few points early on, it fell to a 10 point deficit by 11:30 this morning. A broad downturn in the bond market and persistent weakness in the dollar kept stocks moving lower throughout mid- session and well into early afternoon, despite some good earnings reports. However, there were also some disturbing earnings forecasts, especially from Raytheon. The bears kept piling on for the rest of the session then, and at the closing bell, the Dow Industrial Average was Down 231.12 points or 2.2 percent and now stands at 10417.06. In today's 232 point trading range, the Industrial Average closed right at its worst level of the day. The NASDAQ Composite finished with a loss of 43.52 points at 2872.43. In its 54 point trading range, the Composite Index settled only 3 points above its worst level of the session. Big board volume moved up rather smartly, about 112 million shares or 116 million shares above yesterday's pace. And no contest between down volume over up volume, about a 5 to 2 ratio. Actually, a little worse.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The Dow Transports Index off 64 1/2 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Utilities down .13.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And the Closing Tick definitely bearish at -768.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Standard &amp; Poor's 500 off 22.17.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Just over an 11 1/2 point drop in the S&amp;P 100.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MidCap 400 fell nearly 6 3/4 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And a big jump in the CRB Bridge Futures Price Index rising 3.85.<br/>\u00a0<br/>New York Stock Exchange Composite down almost 10 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Over a 5 3/4 point drop in the Value Line.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Russell2000 Small Cap off just over 5 1/2 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And the Wilshire 5000 dropped 179 1/2 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Higher interest rates overseas and a weaker dollar led to a lower opening for the bond market and the selling pressure was sustained by a sharp jump in oil futures. Also, the Federal Reserve's recent announcement to keep open its option to hike rates kept a lot of potential buyers sidelined. However, news of an apparent military takeover of Pakistan's government and the sharp slide in stock prices triggered flight to safety buying, which enabled tax-free and corporate issues to close with little change, while trimming the Treasury market's losses.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The 5-year notes, no change at all.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The 10-year notes down only 4/32 at the close.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The Bellwether 30-year bond down 18/32. Look at the yield now, up to 6.23 percent.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The Lehman Brothers Long-Term Treasury Bond Index fell just over 6 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> I'll be back shortly to show you where the action was on Wall Street today. Susie.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Paul, as you said the CRB Index rose sharply today. In fact, the prices of commodities have been rising recently. That's boosting returns for managed futures funds. And it's getting the attention of investors. But as Diane Eastabrook explains, before you invest, experts say, know what you're buying.<br/>\u00a0<br/> DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Managed futures funds are used to speculate on financial futures like stock indices and foreign currencies or commodity futures like grain and oil. Fund manager Dennis Newton says managed futures can give investors exposure to a wide variety of products with a minimum investment of 2 to $5,000.<br/>\u00a0<br/> DENNIS NEWTON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, MILLBURN RIDGEFIELD CORP: If you traded for people on an individual basis the amount of money, the critical mass required to trade a diversified portfolio given the margin requirements, it would require a very large investment for an individual investor.<br/>\u00a0<br/> EASTABROOK: In the past five years, the amount of money flowing into managed futures funds has more than doubled. And while the performance of more than 350 managed futures funds has lagged the S&amp;P 500 most of this year, the funds narrowly outperformed the S&amp;P in September.<br/>\u00a0<br/> CHRISTINA ZURLA, FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT, BRIDGENEWS: A lot of these trading advisors seem to feel that if we get some signs of inflation, if some of the commodities really take off, they can take advantage of those kinds of trends.<br/>\u00a0<br/> EASTABROOK: While a lot more individual investors are pouring money into managed futures funds, experts warn they aren't for everyone. Futures can be highly volatile, and losses in managed funds can mount quickly. Investors are advised to look at a fund manager's track record carefully to see how quickly he or she has returned a fund to profitability after a loss.<br/>\u00a0<br/> DAVID SILVERMAN, DIRECTOR, CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE: To the extent that you find someone whose returns warrant that kind of risk, then I think it's a good investment.<br/>\u00a0<br/> EASTABROOK: Fees for some managed futures funds can also run much higher than other types of mutual funds, sometimes as high as 20 percent. So experts say take that into consideration before investing. Diane Eastabrook, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Investors and consumers are also warming up to borrowing money on the Internet, and one of the top lenders on- line is E-Loan. It's a $20 million broker based in California that sells home mortgages, car loans and credit card deals. E-Loan was a hot IPO when the stock came public in June. But it's now trading at about the same price as its offering. Joining me live now in New York is E-Loan's founder and CEO, Chris Larsen. And welcome to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. Good to have you here.<br/>\u00a0<br/> CHRIS LARSEN, CEO, E-LOAN: Thanks for having me, Susie. I want to point out we are trading at about 60 percent above our offering price.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Well $21 now, $14 dollars at the offering, so slightly above that. But let's talk a little bit about rising interest rates. Because this has been slowing down E-Loan's mortgage business. How are you going to grow E- Loan in that kind of environment?<br/>\u00a0<br/> LARSEN: Well you know, we're really focusing on building out the entire, part of the consumer debt portfolio; mortgages, auto-loans, credit cards, business loans. But we did see our business grow 35 percent during a period when the industry actually slowed down about 24 percent. So, we are very pleased with those results. And we think you know such a huge market, almost $2 trillion in all of these categories, that the opportunity is just tremendous going forward.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Well one of the successes of E-Loan in terms of selling mortgages to consumers, there's been a lot of choices. You can shop around for your mortgage. But now with carfinance.com which you acquired and also your Internet credit card, there aren't those kind of choices. Isn't the key to giving consumers, isn't the success just giving them choices?<br/>\u00a0<br/> LARSEN: Choices is absolutely key. And in the mortgage space absolutely. We have over 70 lenders, 22 different capital market providers. In the car finance category, we bought from Bank of America (BAC), because it was part of Bank of America, that was single source, we will now morph that into a multi-lender in the car space, which is a very key category. In the credit card category, what we're really trying to do is provide an offering that gives the consumer as much choice of what they can get. We never want to turn down a customer. So there, we think it's important to partner with one of the leaders, and that's what we did in that space.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: And now you've been spreading this E-Loan concept overseas. You have been doing deals in France. You just came back from a deal in Paris, doing deals with Softbank in Japan. Do you think you're doing too much where you haven't yet dominated the U.S. market?<br/>\u00a0<br/> LARSEN: Well, you know the whole Internet space moves so quickly. You know we have leadership now in the U.S. We see incredible opportunity in Europe, so we did partner there in both our European operation with Avende, a French company and with Rupert Murdoch and Softbank in the UK.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: It's not a distraction?<br/>\u00a0<br/> LARSEN: Well, we think it's important. We have to have a global brand, it will really spread cost. And most importantly, long term, we think there's a opportunity to bring foreign capital back to the U.S. consumer. We think that strengthens the entire brand and the entire business.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: How are you going to finance all this growth? I mean, you look at your finances. You pre-announced your earnings saying that you're going to have a loss bigger than Wall Street was expecting. Revenues are a little bit slower than everybody was expecting, and your stock is you know not doing as well as it was the time of its offering. How are you going to finance all this?<br/>\u00a0<br/> LARSEN: Well, overseas for example, all of those financings came from partners. So, we didn't have to put any cash in the overseas venture. We raised about $60 million there. And here in the U.S., we raised about $50 million on our IPO, we're in good shape there. We'll look at the capital markets opportunistically going forward. But again, we really have to focus on building the company globally in these additional products representing the entire right side of the balance sheet.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Well, we appreciate you coming by and telling us all about it.<br/>\u00a0<br/> LARSEN: Thanks, Susie.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Thank you very much.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: And we've been speaking with Chris Larsen, CEO of E-Loan.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Wall Street's bears made a statement today, saying it's too early to go into hibernation. It was a nasty day on the down side, the Dow Industrials losing 231 and a fraction, 2.2 percent. The broader market lower by a 21 to 8 margin. Only 33 new yearly highs, as against 210 new lows.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Topping the active lists on 24.6 million shares, however, a good gainer. Compaq (CPQ) up 1 5/16. Bank of America says the company should meet or beat Wall Street earnings estimates in the third quarter of a nickel a share.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Sprint PCS (PCS) down 2 7/16.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Followed by Rite Aid (RAD), which moved up a half even though the company forecasts second quarter loss at $0.26 a share and Goldman Sachs removed the stock from the recommended list. Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded it. But considering that the yearly high on that stock was 51 I think all that bad news has already been incorporated into the price.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Xerox (XRX) down another 15/16. It plunged over 10 last Friday on an earnings warning.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Mattel (MAT) bucking the trend up 3/4. Barron's Online Service today quoted a number of analysts who think Mattel's stock is so depressed it could invite a takeover bid.

Susie?<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Paul, broadband is the new buzz word. Companies are spending billions of dollars to build telecommunication networks in American homes and offices. New ways to use those networks are in the works and regulatory battles are being fought over how broadband will develop. In part one of our series tonight, \"Broadband Pipe Dreams,\" Stephanie Woods looks at what's at stake.<br/>\u00a0<br/> STEPHANIE WOODS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Spend an evening with the Bentley family and it's easy to see why companies are scrambling to offer them new services. Bill and Gayle have two cell phones, cable TV, a phone line for voice and one for the computer.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GAYLE BENTLEY: The girls were fighting over one phone line, so not only did we have one phone line being tied up by a telephone, then the other person could not use another phone and could not get on the Internet. So it was a matter of who was going to have the phone and who was going to be on the Internet.<br/>\u00a0<br/> WOODS: Add up the bills for local, long distance, cable, cellular and Internet service, and Bill Bentley figures he spends $250 a month.<br/>\u00a0<br/> BILL BENTLEY: And I think it'll only go higher. I think people, well, I think the phone company, if you bundle it, will be able to offer it at a cheaper rate so you get a lot more services for your dollar.<br/>\u00a0<br/> WOODS: Bundling those services and delivering them faster is what the industry calls broadband. Telephone and cable companies are scrambling to upgrade their networks to handle voice, data and Internet traffic. AT&amp;T is betting big customers will want broadband. It spent $120 billion buying TCI and MediaOne, and it will spent $2.5 billion more upgrading the cable networks. Local phone companies are also investing billions to upgrade their networks. Bell Atlantic (BEL) and SBC (SBC) offer high-speed service called DSL for digital subscriber line. Bell Atlantic COO Jim Cullen says demand for the service is strong.<br/>\u00a0<br/> JIM CULLEN, COO, BELL ATLANTIC: The reality is that the data business today is one of two or three high growth, high opportunity areas not just because we decided to invest in it but because it's a very efficient, very high- value selection for consumers. This meets a lot of their requirements.<br/>\u00a0<br/> WOODS: But the roll-out has been slow. The cost is high, the technology is still being tested, and it can take up to two hours to install the service in a home. RoadRunner is Time Warner and MediaOne's (UMG) joint venture for broadband service. CEO Carl Rosetti says when they started he didn't know if the technology would work or if anyone would want it.<br/>\u00a0<br/> CARL ROSETTI, CEO, ROADRUNNER: The single biggest challenge is hooking customers up today. Now we can bring the signal and the service to their house. Selling it has been a fairly straightforward proposition. We know that the customers, if they get it, they like it, they keep it.<br/>\u00a0<br/> WOODS: For those who buy the service, cable modems and DSL run $40 to $50 a month. That's why Jupiter Communications expect only 23 percent of online users will have a high-speed connection in the next three years.<br/>\u00a0<br/> ZIA DANIELL WIGDER, ANALYST, JUPITER COMMUNICATIONS: The vast majority of users still will be using a dial-up connection, you know, virtually everyone in the U.S. will have access to a dial-up connection, whereas not everyone will have access to a broadband connection and also everyone's not going to be willing to pay the premium that they are being asked to pay for a broadband connection.<br/>\u00a0<br/> WOODS: And in the future there will be more than just cable modems or DSL to get high speed. Sprint and MCI are pursing new fixed wireless technology and Teledesic plans to build a satellite system to carry Internet traffic. Despite the apparent hurdles, businesses already are planning new content to use the higher speeds. The Bentleys say it won't take much to get them hooked up. Stephanie Woods, \"NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT,\" Washington.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Tomorrow, our series continues with a look at broadband and the Internet, a match made in technology heaven.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: The dot-coms apparently like the \"Wall Street Journal.\" The \"Journal's\" parent company, Dow Jones (DJ), says a surge in Internet advertising boosted its third quarter earnings by 35 percent. It earned $0.50 a share, $0.02 better than estimates. But the stock lost 1 5/16 today to 57 11/16, some of it on profit taking after hitting a 52 week high yesterday.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: The Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve are in talks tonight about how to resolve the key issues that could kill a financial services reform bill. The dispute centers around how banks should offer expanded financial services and how they should then be regulated. The White House says it will veto the bill in its current form.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Tonight's commentator says that there can be a silver lining to every economic cloud. Here's Irving R. Levine, dean of international studies at Lynn University and a former chief economics correspondent for NBC News.<br/>\u00a0<br/> IRVING R. LEVINE, COMMENTARY: So far this year Americans have spent almost $200 billion more for goods from other countries than the U.S. has sold abroad. This trade deficit is a cloud hanging over the economy, but there are bits of a silver lining. While the flow of foreign-made products may deprive American workers of jobs, the U.S. unemployment rate is still at a quarter century low. And foreign manufacturers do create some jobs in the U.S. for sales people, distributors and other personnel. Of course, foreign-made goods generally cost less than competing U.S. products and that has played a big role in keeping inflation down. Otherwise, the Federal Reserve might have had to raise interest rates still more, which would have put the brakes on the economy and really cost American jobs. What's more, many of those dollars streaming out of this country to buy goods come back to be invested in the stock market, which helps sustain a bull market. Finally, a number of the countries adding to our deficit have been in economic crisis and would be in a lot worse shape if they weren't selling to the U.S. Without those sales to the U.S., the countries in distress would be seeking loans which they might never be able to pay back. So, at least in the case of the trade deficit, the U.S. is receiving worthwhile goods for its money, not IOUs. I am Irving R. Levine.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Recapping today's market action, a slide on Wall Street. The Dow lost 231 points and the NASDAQ Index fell 43. And please join us at our World Wide Web site, NBR.com, or on America Online, keyword \"NBR.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: And that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, October 12. I'm Susie Gharib. Have a good evening everyone and good night to you, Paul.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Good night, Susie.

In the Terminator series, a sentient computer system, Skynet, realizes that the best way to keep the world safe (and protect its own existence) is to wipe out mankind. In Battlestar Galactica, robots created as servants slowly outgrow their programming and come to the realization that they, not their human creators, should exist.</p><p>It's easy to see why the idea makes for good books and movies. If, for example, artificial intelligence (AI) can beat a human at chess or on Jeopardy!, then it's easy to make the next leap to robots someday being smarter than humans -- and for that to go terribly wrong. That's a leap that's getting easier to make these days since robots and various other AI-powered devices have made their way into reality.</p><p>AaAaAeAccents Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Ale</p><p>In some cases, they are taking (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/careers/2017/06/04/is-your-job-safe-from-the-rise-of-the-robots.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/careers/2017/06/04/is-your-job-safe-from-the-rise-of-the-robots.aspx</url>) our jobs , while in others, AI handles our (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/06/22/big-tech-is-battling-cyberthreats-with-ai.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/06/22/big-tech-is-battling-cyberthreats-with-ai.aspx</url>) cybersecurity or tells us where we might like to eat dinner. Our homes have AI devices that can control our lights, alarm systems, and pretty much anything else.</p><p>We may not be living in a post-apocalyptic hellhole where mankind tries to avoid being wiped out by well-armed robots and cyborgs, but our world looks like the opening scene in that type of movie. What once seemed far-fetched has become plausible, and Tesla ((<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/tesla/tsla\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/tesla/tsla</url>) NASDAQ:TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk believes we need to plan for it.</p><p>What did Musk say?</p><p>Without pulling any punches, Musk recently told the (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4676772/elon-musk-national-governors-association-2017-summer-meeting&amp;start=1740\">https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4676772/elon-musk-national-governors-association-2017-summer-meeting&amp;start=1740</url>) National Governors Association Summer Meeting that he has seen the most cutting-edge AI technology and believes that people should be \"really concerned about it.\" Coming from most people -- nearly anyone else -- these comments would seem a tad paranoid. Coming from the person behind Tesla, SpaceX, and Hyperloop, they sound credible even though Musk is talking like the guy in a movie whose warning people should heed, but don't.</p><p>\"... until people see robots going on the street killing people, they don't know how to react because it seems so ethereal,\" he said. \"We should all be really concerned about AI.\"</p><p>AaAaAeAccents This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 19</p><p>The technology pioneer believes that AI is the rare case where government should be proactive instead of reactive in regulation.

Without regulation, he expects that to lead to a problem that could cause potential challenges to ongoing human existence. He, of course, did not mention Terminator, Battlestar Galactica, or any other sci-fi doomsday scenario, but he clearly believes one could happen. </p><p>Is Musk right?</p><p>We already have machines that can advance beyond their programming without human help. It's not an unfathomable leap to think an evolving AI could come to the conclusion that protecting humanity involves enslaving or even exterminating humans.</p><p>Musk is right that limits should be placed. In the same way government has forced the self-driving-car movement to move slower than many companies would want, some sensible regulation for AI -- specifically around testing and what we allow artificial intelligence to control -- could forestall, if not eliminate, the possibility of disaster.</p><p>AaAaAeAccents 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Mark</p><p>If we create near-sentient AI devices/robots that both learn and think for themselves, we open up the possibility for catastrophic problems.

Science fiction has regularly dealt with the idea that artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to humanity's end (or at least its near end). In the Terminator series, a sentient computer system, Skynet, realizes that the best way to keep the world safe (and protect its own existence) is to wipe out mankind. In Battlestar Galactica, robots created as servants slowly outgrow their programming and come to the realization that they, not their human creators, should exist. </p><p>It's easy to see why the idea makes for good books and movies. If, for example, artificial intelligence (AI) can beat a human at chess or on\u00a0Jeopardy!, then it's easy to make the next leap to robots someday being smarter than humans -- and for that to go terribly wrong. That's a leap that's getting easier to make these days since robots and various other AI-powered devices have made their way into reality. \u2022 Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert[2] In some cases, they are taking our jobs[3], while in others, AI handles our cybersecurity[4] or tells us where we might like to eat dinner. Our homes have AI devices that can control our lights, alarm systems, and pretty much anything else. We may not be living in a post-apocalyptic hellhole where mankind tries to avoid being wiped out by well-armed robots and cyborgs, but our world looks like the opening scene in that type of movie. What once seemed far-fetched has become plausible, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA[5]) CEO <person><nameText>Elon Musk </nameText></person>believes we need to plan for it. What did Musk say? Without pulling any punches, Musk recently told the National Governors Association Summer Meeting[6] that he has seen the most cutting-edge AI technology and believes that people should be \"really concerned about it.\" Coming from most people -- nearly anyone else -- these comments would seem a tad paranoid. Coming from the person behind Tesla, SpaceX, and Hyperloop, they sound credible even though Musk is talking like the guy in a movie whose warning people should heed, but don't. \"... until people see robots going on the street killing people, they don't know how to react because it seems so ethereal,\" he said. \"We should all be really concerned about AI.\" \u2022 This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997[7] The technology pioneer believes that AI is the rare case where government should be proactive instead of reactive in regulation. It won't work to wait until people are complaining. \"AI is a fundamental risk to human civilization in a way that car accidents, airplane crashes, faulty drugs, or bad food were not,\" he said. \"They were harmful to a set of individuals, but not harmful to society as a whole.\" Musk believes that the race to build the next-best-thing in AI will lead to companies cutting corners. Without regulation, he expects that to lead to a problem that could cause potential challenges to ongoing human existence. He, of course, did not mention\u00a0Terminator,\u00a0Battlestar Galactica, or any other sci-fi doomsday scenario, but he clearly believes one could happen.\u00a0 Is Musk right? We already have machines that can advance beyond their programming without human help. It's not an unfathomable leap to think an evolving AI could come to the conclusion that protecting humanity involves enslaving or even exterminating humans. Musk is right that limits should be placed. In the same way government has forced the self-driving-car movement to move slower than many companies would want, some sensible regulation for AI -- specifically around testing and what we allow artificial intelligence to control -- could forestall, if not eliminate, the possibility of disaster. \u2022 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market[8] If we create near-sentient AI devices/robots that both learn and think for themselves, we open up the possibility for catastrophic problems. We should heed Musk's warning and move ahead cautiously. Daniel Kline[9] has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Tesla.

TikTok re\u00fane varias caracter\u00edsticas \u00fanicas: genera confrontaci\u00f3n geopol\u00edtica entre oriente y occidente, representa un desaf\u00edo nunca antes visto para el regulador, dispar\u00f3 la adicci\u00f3n a redes sociales de los menores de edad de todo el mundo, implica la disposici\u00f3n de un volumen colosal de datos para una empresa (solo el a\u00f1o pasado se descarg\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 750 millones de veces) y, como qued\u00f3 demostrado en Colombia por el caso de pedofilia, atrae el inter\u00e9s de buenos y malos para acceder especialmente a los j\u00f3venes de la generaci\u00f3n Z (1994 al 2000).  El perfil p\u00fablico de TikTok se elev\u00f3 la semana pasada, en todas las generaciones, por cuenta de la jur\u00e1sica decisi\u00f3n de Trump de prohibir TikTok en su pa\u00eds por la posibilidad, seg\u00fan \u00e9l, de que el gobierno chino la utilice con fines de espionaje y por el riesgo que supone para la privacidad de los estadounidenses. Ve la aplicaci\u00f3n como una amenaza contra la seguridad nacional y la econom\u00eda de Estados Unidos. Lea tambi\u00e9n: Dice estar amparado por la Ley de Poderes Econ\u00f3micos de Emergencia Internacional, que le permite forzar la venta de la aplicaci\u00f3n, bloquear su uso o congelar sus activos en el pa\u00eds. Sin embargo, este no es el primer ni \u00fanico conflicto geopol\u00edtico de TikTok. India, en junio pasado, incluy\u00f3 a la red social entre las 59 aplicaciones de origen chino que fueron bloqueadas en ese pa\u00eds, alegando tambi\u00e9n que su uso podr\u00eda ser perjudicial para la soberan\u00eda y la seguridad de la naci\u00f3n.  No cabe duda de que las medidas adoptadas tanto por los gobiernos de Estados Unidos e India desconocen derechos fundamentales sociales y econ\u00f3micos de sus ciudadanos. Sin embargo, tampoco es conveniente la nociva desregulaci\u00f3n en la que operan las redes sociales y particularmente TikTok en casi todos los pa\u00edses del mundo.  Los gobiernos, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de medidas de protecci\u00f3n de la seguridad nacional, deber\u00edan regular el impacto en la salud mental y en el desarrollo integral de las nuevas generaciones. Las redes sociales, destac\u00e1ndose TikTok, tienden a convertirse m\u00e1s en un importante problema de salud p\u00fablica, que en uno de seguridad nacional. No es menor el hecho, divulgado por The Wall Street Journal, de que los tiktokers, entre 13 a\u00f1os y 20 a\u00f1os, destinan 52 minutos diarios a lo que parece ser una adicci\u00f3n.

Los defensores de la libertad en las redes sociales en Colombia buscan amparo en nuestro ordenamiento jur\u00eddico para rechazar cualquier medida regulatoria. Invocan la garant\u00eda a toda persona de expresar y difundir su pensamiento y opiniones, la de informar y recibir informaci\u00f3n veraz e imparcial, y la no censura. Los l\u00edmites m\u00e1s claros, pero a todas luces insuficientes, los estableci\u00f3 la Corte Constitucional al garantizar el derecho a la libertad de expresi\u00f3n en redes sociales teniendo como excepciones inquebrantables la pornograf\u00eda infantil, la instigaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica y directa al genocidio, propaganda de la guerra y apolog\u00eda del odio, la violencia y el delito. Adicionalmente, la Corte ha dicho que existe una situaci\u00f3n de indefensi\u00f3n cuando se realizan publicaciones que afectan la honra o buen nombre de las personas a trav\u00e9s de las distintas redes sociales sobre las que el afectado no tiene la posibilidad de reaccionar o defenderse. Es claro entonces que nuestro legislador se ha preocupado por los riesgos asociados a la interacci\u00f3n entre ciudadanos, pero descuidando totalmente la relaci\u00f3n entre la empresa de la aplicaci\u00f3n y el ciudadano.   Ni la ley ni la jurisprudencia han abordado los principales riesgos que se derivan de las decisiones de las empresas que est\u00e1n detr\u00e1s de aplicaciones como TikTok, dentro de los que sobresalen el acceso y control de informaci\u00f3n de menores de edad; la evidente ausencia de autorregulaci\u00f3n de las mismas para restringir juegos o actividades que pongan en riesgo la integridad humana, como es el caso de los retos TikTok que amenazan la salud f\u00edsica y mental (por ejemplo, vacuumchallenge); la desbocada libertad de desarrolladores para involucrar inconsultamente a los usuarios de las redes con juegos, contenidos interactivos, concursos y actividades casi impuestas a menores de edad, y las invasivas campa\u00f1as de publicidad que no disciernen edades, educaci\u00f3n, cultura ni nada, a la hora de tomarse la pantalla.  Lea tambi\u00e9n: La realidad no COVID-19  El debate sobre TikTok en Colombia y en el mundo coincide con el \u00e9xito del documental \u201cEl dilema social\u201d de Netflix. O quiz\u00e1s no sea coincidencia. Es arrollador descubrir que fundadores y expresidentes de exitosas empresas mundiales de tecnolog\u00eda y de plataformas digitales reconocen el perjuicio que las redes sociales tienen y tendr\u00e1n en el desarrollo de nuestra sociedad.  \u201cA medida que crecen las Big Tech crece la depresi\u00f3n y la adicci\u00f3n\u201d, \u201csi no pagas por el producto, t\u00fa eres el producto\u201d, \u201ctodos somos ratas de laboratorio\u201d, \u201cse necesita un nuevo modelo de negocio e intervenci\u00f3n de los gobiernos\u201d, y \u201cla sostenibilidad de nuestra sociedad est\u00e1 en juego porque las redes nos llevan a auto depredarnos, a auto atacarnos\u201d, son algunas de las conclusiones literales. La conclusi\u00f3n est\u00e1 a la vista: redes s\u00ed, pero reguladas de verdad. No nos comamos el cuento de que es un problema exclusivo de padres y educadores. El regulador tiene que hacer su trabajo. O iremos rumbo al colapso social.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNES-43153802298</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X8-F5V1-F07F-8185-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398831</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"955\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Dinero Colombia</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - Spanish</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>24 Septiembre 2020 Jueves</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>SPANISH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>ESPA\u00d1OL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Colombia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>South America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>Internet Social Networking</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>Environment + Natural Resources</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST0008ZHS</classCode><className>Information Management + Technology</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>Internet + WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

La norma europea, de 2016, entr\u00f3 en vigor en Espa\u00f1a el pasado febrero, justo antes de la declaraci\u00f3n del estado de alarma como consecuencia de la pandemia del Covid-19 que cataliz\u00f3 los cambios que ya se ven\u00edan gestando en el sector, al que transforma en un ecosistema omnicanal totalmente digital. Sin embargo, la norma se ha quedado corta y no ha conseguido sentar las bases para regular el mundo online que ha dejado el coronavirus y que ha llegado para quedarse. As\u00ed lo han valorado los especialistas del sector en un desayuno h\u00edbrido, presencial y telem\u00e1tico, organizado por CincoD\u00edas y KPMG bajo el t\u00edtulo<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> de El impacto de la IDD en el modelo de distribuci\u00f3n de seguros en Espa\u00f1a, </emphasis>para analizar el escenario en el que se debe mover el sector de los seguros tras la trasposici\u00f3n de la directiva europea. El prop\u00f3sito principal de la IDD, que a\u00fan debe convalidarse en el Congreso de los Diputados, es proteger a los consumidores de seguros al establecer mayor transparencia e informaci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, no se adapta al nivel de digitalizaci\u00f3n actual al que han llegado el sector y la sociedad. </p><p>\u201cLa normativa se proyecta sobre un contexto de mercado totalmente distinto, el ecosistema de competidores es mucho m\u00e1s complejo y da la sensaci\u00f3n de que la regulaci\u00f3n va por detr\u00e1s de la evoluci\u00f3n del negocio\u201d, explica Francisco Ur\u00eda, socio responsable del sector financiero para KPMG EMA, socio principal de KPMG Abogados y moderador del encuentro. Los expertos opinan que la IDD no aporta avances relevantes en el terreno de juego de los seguros. Desde que se comenz\u00f3 a debatir el primer borrador en 2016 hasta ahora, todo ha cambiado. As\u00ed lo indica Daniel L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez, responsable de la asesor\u00eda jur\u00eddica corporativa de VidaCaixa. \u201cLa ley se ha traspuesto como se ha podido y hemos sido los \u00faltimos en Europa en incorporarla\u201d, recuerda el abogado, que asegura algo compartido por todos los presentes en el encuentro: \u201cLa regulaci\u00f3n se ha quedado algo corta si la comparamos con la realidad y el Covid no ha hecho m\u00e1s que evidenciarlo\u201d. La norma, seg\u00fan L\u00f3pez, \u201cllega cuatro a\u00f1os tarde\u201d. \u201cPara acompa\u00f1ar el proceso de digitalizaci\u00f3n del sector necesitamos una IDD m\u00e1s moderna y ajustes en la ley del contrato de seguro, que supone un freno a procesos de innovaci\u00f3n en el sector\u201d, a\u00f1ade. Pilar Gal\u00e1n, directora en el \u00e1rea de servicios financieros de KPMG Abogados, con experiencia en procesos de implantaci\u00f3n regulatoria, explica que \u201ccuando la IDD se empez\u00f3 a fraguar estaba ideada para regular un mundo digital menos desarrollado que el de 2020, por eso la norma se ha quedado atr\u00e1s\u201d. Seg\u00fan Gal\u00e1n, la ley introduce algunas pautas para la distribuci\u00f3n online pero ninguna que regule la experiencia del cliente en un mundo enteramente digital. \u201cLa normativa ha nacido desfasada\u201d, abunda \u00d3scar Merino, director de la asesor\u00eda jur\u00eddica de seguros y previsi\u00f3n de Santander Espa\u00f1a y secretario del consejo de administraci\u00f3n de Santander Seguros. \u201cEl compendio de obligaciones que incluye la norma no tienen sentido en un mundo donde prima la inmediatez\u201d, a\u00f1ade. Los expertos se\u00f1alan la importancia de encontrar un principio de proporcionalidad para aquellas coberturas que nacen para adaptarse a la realidad concreta del consumidor en un momento puntual (como el seguro que cubre el viaje de unos minutos en bicicleta el\u00e9ctrica p\u00fablica) y que no requieren tal exceso de regulaci\u00f3n. \u201cNecesitamos una evoluci\u00f3n normativa en \u00e1mbitos muy diversos\u201d, apostilla el abogado de VidaCaixa. Nuevos competidores La IDD reconoce la presencia de los nuevos actores tecnol\u00f3gicos. Son las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> insurtech </emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">startups </emphasis>que utilizan la tecnolog\u00eda para crear nuevas formas de ofrecer seguros al cliente\u2013 y las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> big tech </emphasis>\u2013grandes compa\u00f1\u00edas tecnol\u00f3gicas globalizadas como Google, Amazon, Facebook y Apple que comienzan a introducirse en el sector\u2013. \u201cLos nuevos jugadores representan desaf\u00edos diferentes, las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> insurtech </emphasis>han llegado para colaborar, pero las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> big tech </emphasis>tienen una capacidad disruptiva m\u00e1s potente\u201d, afirma L\u00f3pez, que pone un ejemplo: Google acaba de anunciar que se asociar\u00e1 con una reaseguradora para ofrecer seguros de salud. \u201cAh\u00ed puede estar el reto, la competencia y el cambio\u201d, expone. Carlos Falc\u00f3n, director general de Ibercaja Mediaci\u00f3n de Seguros, por su parte, va m\u00e1s all\u00e1: \u201cSi las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> insurtech </emphasis>modifican el tablero de juego en el mundo, las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> big tech </emphasis>lo vuelcan boca abajo\u201d, afirma. \u201cEstamos asistiendo al nacimiento de compa\u00f1\u00edas aseguradoras, distribuidoras y grandes operadores digitales que deber\u00edan estar reguladas por las mismas reglas\u201d, comenta Merino, que a\u00f1ade que \u201cla IDD aporta seguridad jur\u00eddica\u201d a la cristalizaci\u00f3n de este nuevo entorno. Sin embargo, Elena Jim\u00e9nez de Andrade, presidenta del Colegio de Mediadores de Seguros, considera que la normativa europea tendr\u00eda que haber ahondado en una mayor regulaci\u00f3n de los operadores tecnol\u00f3gicos. \u201cEsta norma se queda un poco corta y un poco lejos de lo que el cliente necesita\u201d, abunda Jim\u00e9nez. \u201cEst\u00e1 bien regular los comparadores web, pero podr\u00edamos haber ido un poco m\u00e1s all\u00e1\u201d. El abogado de VidaCaixa coincide con el resto de la mesa y a\u00f1ade que \u201cla IDD regula las estructuras que ya exist\u00edan en Espa\u00f1a desde hace tiempo, los comparadores, pero no prev\u00e9 f\u00f3rmulas nuevas\u201d. En cualquier caso, L\u00f3pez cree que las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> insurtech </emphasis>no son una amenaza porque no pueden sustituir a los agentes ya presentes en el sector. \u201cTienen una funci\u00f3n auxiliar, aunque tambi\u00e9n disruptiva, pero solo porque ayudan a seguir evolucionando\u201d, afirma. Seg\u00fan el experto, las plataformas tecnol\u00f3gicas ganar\u00e1n mayor peso con los a\u00f1os, \u201ccomo ya se ha visto durante la pandemia\u201d, en la distribuci\u00f3n directa de los seguros. Impacto del coronavirus El virus del Covid-19 ha acelerado la digitalizaci\u00f3n del sector que ya se adivinaba en el largo plazo. La distribuci\u00f3n digital de seguros y por canales no presenciales ha cobrado fuerza desde marzo, aunque el ecosistema empresarial ya estaba preparado para ello desde mucho antes. \u201cLa pandemia nos ha hecho conscientes de la importancia de estar en el m\u00f3vil del cliente para adaptarnos a sus necesidades, eso es positivo\u201d, dice Jim\u00e9nez. Merino afirma que el negocio estuvo a la altura de las circunstancias durante los meses m\u00e1s duros de la crisis sanitaria. \u201cEl confinamiento nos ha puesto a prueba y ha servido para que el sector implante en tiempo r\u00e9cord la oferta digital que ten\u00eda prevista a medio plazo\u201d, indica el asesor de Santander. \u201cEl sector asegurador ha hecho un esfuerzo tit\u00e1nico para cubrir los siniestros\u201d, a\u00f1ade. Sin embargo, a pesar del impulso que ha tomado la digitalizaci\u00f3n para salvar las restricciones para frenar el virus, el negocio de los seguros se enfrenta a un reto: conseguir adaptarse a un cliente 100% digital en un panorama muy regulado donde se debe cumplir con gran cantidad de requisitos de documentaci\u00f3n. \u201cHay personas que han perdido miedos y prejuicios, por lo que van a demandar m\u00e1s en el campo digital\u201d, explica L\u00f3pez. \u201cEl futuro es omnicanal, se podr\u00e1 hacer todo a trav\u00e9s de todos los canales, cuando el cliente prueba el modelo digital es dif\u00edcil volverle a pedir que llame por tel\u00e9fono o que transite por canales burocr\u00e1ticos, como ocurr\u00eda hasta ahora\u201d, explica. Falc\u00f3n, por su parte, apostilla que \u201cla pandemia nos ha servido para ponernos los primeros de la fila, la experiencia de cliente ahora no est\u00e1 en la oficina, sino en la<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> app </emphasis>o en la web\u201d. Expectativas pos-Covid La pandemia ha cambiado la forma en la que el consumidor se relaciona con la compa\u00f1\u00eda y, en algunas ocasiones, ha conseguido que pase de un extremo (totalmente presencial) al otro (100% digital). \u201cHay que estar preparados para el aluvi\u00f3n de clientes digitales que llegar\u00e1n ahora y que antes no ten\u00edamos\u201d, advierte L\u00f3pez. Adem\u00e1s, la percepci\u00f3n de la cobertura tambi\u00e9n ha cambiado. \u201cEl consumidor ha entendido lo importante que es comprender bien cu\u00e1l es el riesgo que cubre el seguro que ha contratado, por eso tenemos que poner en valor el asesoramiento, acompa\u00f1arlo y darle una cobertura integral, pero no mayor de lo necesario\u201d, aclara el experto de VidaCaixa. Los productos aseguradores tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n evolucionando hacia modelos m\u00e1s modernos, contempor\u00e1neos a las tendencias actuales, que est\u00e1n influenciadas por el cambio en la apreciaci\u00f3n del riesgo tras la crisis sanitaria. \u201cEl Covid nos ha ense\u00f1ado que estamos m\u00e1s expuestos a lo incierto de lo que nos cre\u00edamos, por ello, antes de tomar cualquier decisi\u00f3n nos preocupamos mucho m\u00e1s que antes del seguro que la cubrir\u00e1\u201d, comenta Merino. \u201cNuestra obligaci\u00f3n es completar los productos y ampliar la oferta para satisfacer las nuevas necesidades que las relaciones humanas y mercantiles van a demandar tras la experiencia sufrida por la pandemia\u201d, concluye el experto de Santander.  \u201cAdaptarse o morir\u201d, a\u00f1ade Falc\u00f3n: todo un desaf\u00edo.

Last week, Comptroller of the Currency John Hawke, an FDIC board member, told a House committee the rules should be scrapped.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Online lobbying: Privacy advocates had urged foes of the rules to send letters and e-mails to the FDIC. The agency got more than 225,000 responses -and fewer than 100 of them backed the rules. Friday, the Senate passed by an 88-0 vote a resolution urging that the rules be killed. Last Thursday, the House Banking Committee passed an amendment to a banking bill killing the rules, which are meant to combat money laundering.Tank Fire Rattles Kosovo As U.S. Envoy Arrives7Yugoslav tanks swept through an area along the Macedonian border with Kosovo as skirmishes between Serbs and Albanians continued.

Two Nobel peace laureates, Mairead Corrigan Maguire of Ireland and Adolfo Perez-Esquivel of Argentina, also criticized the attacks. U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said the attacks were spurred by Iraq.Tough Rules Are In Store For Livestock Producers9Cattle feedlots and large hog and poultry farms will face tighter regulations under a national water pollution control strategy from the Clinton administration.

The plan is similar to a draft version unveiled in September.Small Businesses Make For Big Tech Spending10Once ignored by the computer industry, small businesses no longer are getting short shrift when it comes to receiving help from even the largest high-tech firms.

You could use a lot of adjectives to describe Steve Jobs: innovative, visionary, charismatic. But on the short-list of those words would have to be ruthless, as new email messages made public Wednesday made clear yet again.[2]Jobs \u2014 who died in October 2011, but was the founder and previous CEO of Apple \u2014 instructs subordinates in the emails to \"cut off\" a developer who publicly criticized the company, force developers of subscription-based apps to use Apple's payment service, and block any other company from offering a digital bookstore for Apple's iPhones and iPads unless they gave Apple a cut of their revenue.\"I think this is all pretty simple,\" Jobs wrote in an email dated February 6, 2011 focused on the bookstore issue. </p><p>\"[Apple's] iBooks is going to be the only bookstore on iOS devices. We need to hold our heads high. One can read books bought elsewhere, just not buy/rent/subscribe from iOS without paying us, which we acknowledge is prohibitive for many things.\"Jobs' email were part of a trove of internal messages released by the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law. The subcommittee made the documents public following its hearing into antitrust concerns[3] about Apple and the other giant tech companies. That hearing focused on testimony from the current CEOs of Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Facebook.Much of the concern about Apple centers on how it manages the App Store for iPhones and iPads[4]. The only native applications that users of those devices can generally install are those offered in the App Store. Apple sets all the rules for those apps, including which ones can be listed in the store, the services for which they have to pay Apple, and the amount they have to pay. Some regulators and market observers have worried the company uses its control over the App Store[5] to favor its own apps, throttle possible competitors, or to charge developers unfair or unreasonable fees. Apple was aware of concerns from other booksellers The old email messages \u2014 particularly those from Jobs \u2014 are sure to add fuel to that argument. His 2011 digital bookstore comment was part of a larger exchange with top company officials about whether and what Apple should charge developers who offer digital content and subscriptions through their apps. The officials settled on charging developers a 30% commission on sales of such products.The officials were aware in the discussions that book vendors were opposed to having to pay Apple such a commission, because they already were already paying a comparable charge to the book publishers.\"Book stores will claim this model doesn't work,\" executive Eddy Cue, who oversaw the App Store, said in an email that was part of the thread that led to Jobs' comment.Jobs wasn't afraid to be ruthless even with other tech behemoths. In a related email exchange from the previous year, he and Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing chief, were discussing Amazon's Kindle ebook app. At the time, Apple had granted Amazon an exception so that it didn't have to pay a commission when customers purchased digital books on their iPhones and iPads. Schiller was annoyed that Amazon was running ads that demonstrated how customers could purchase Kindle ebooks on an iPhone and then read them on an Android-based phone.\"While the primary message is that there are Kindle apps on lots of mobile devices, the secondary message that can't be missed is that it is easy to switch from iPhone to Android,\" Schiller said in a message to Jobs. \"Not fun to watch.\"In a later message Schiller suggested to Jobs that Apple force Amazon to use Apple's payment system \u2014 and pay its commission \u2014 when selling books on iPhones and iPads. He noted that Amazon may refuse to do that, in which case Apple might be forced to decide whether to pull the app from its store for violating its rules.Jobs made clear he wasn't about to back down from a possible fight.\"It's time for them to decide to use our payment mechanism or bow out,\" he said. Jobs advised subordinates to 'cut off' a developer But Jobs was perhaps at his most forceful and unsentimental in responding to a developer who had been critical of the company. In the summer of 2010, Apple introduced new rules requiring developers to write apps for the iPhone and iPad in the native programming language of those devices, rather than writing in a different language and using a software tool to translate them.A developer named Joe Hewitt objected to the requirement, because he thought the language Apple was requiring was \"mediocre.\" Hewitt went to the press with his complaints.Jobs wasn't interested in understanding his concerns.\"I'd suggest we just cut Joe off from now on,\" he said.Got a tip about Big Tech?

By 2015, it slumped to $41,619, while revenues more than doubled from $67.7 billion to $146.5 billion.For Indian IT, this is an unenviable position to be in, caught between a rock and a hard place, having to not just deal with the supreme difficulty of managing armies of people on projects but to keep hiring so they can win more projects. It also has to weather the aggravation of watching some 30 percent of their workforce cool their heels on the \"bench\" at any given time waiting to be deployed. Meanwhile, contracts are won and lost on the smallest of price differences, making this the next big commoditized wave in technology services.Therefore, the new mantra proclaimed with missionary fervour by Indian IT firms in the last few years has been automation and artificial intelligence, but it is unclear if anyone has implemented anything in any of these departments that has resulted in major traction.A few days ago, Indian IT services company Wipro announced it hopes to achieve a significant milestone for financial year 2016-17 by successfully deploying Holmes. </p><p>The AI platform looks to take over the more mundane tasks in its business lines, such as software maintenance that some 3,000 of its engineers used to slave over, especially on fixed-price contracts. This reportedly could save the firm $46.5 million, which is no mean sum by any standards. The company also introduced its \"Data Discovery Platform, a machine-learning, analytics solution system that provides business insights through specially designed apps.It is chuckle-worthy that Wipro had the gall to name their cognitive learning platform in a nod to the grand-pappy of them all, the question-answering Watson, designed by IBM, which uses natural language processing and machine learning to glean insights from large amounts of data. Watson made a name for itself by being able to comprehensively beat humans in Jeopardy and by now has been used in a dizzying range of applications, from wealth management to medical research and cancer cures. What the Indian IT firm will care about, however, is how good an understudy Sherlock is to Watson and so far, it seems that Holmes has performed above expectations. It has, for instance, been placed in the service of banks to speedily approve and process loans by using cognitive search to compare the customer's vital statistics with that of the bank's other customers before signing off on the loan process.If anyone needed the talents of Holmes most it is Wipro. Generally regarded as a laggard to the other Indian biggies Infosys, TCS, and more recently Cognizant and thought to have been a slow mover in the relatively newer areas of big data, analytics, AI, and cloud, the company has stuttered in the growth department. This financialyear, the company is slated to grow by 4.2 percent at best which marks the slowest pace of growth for the company since 2009-10, when it grew 1.6 percent.Wipro's biggest and most urgent concern has been its inability to ramp up business from the big tech spenders banks and insurance firms. Tack on the inability to increase clients amongst oil companies which, along with banks, makes up one of the two biggest industry clients for Wipro and the situation couldn't be more grim the previous plummeting price of oil not helping the IT regulationsSingapore mobile ad firm fined $950K for 'deceptively' tracking consumer location Meanwhile, Wipro's competitors have also waded into the AI field. TCS launched its intelligent platform Ignio a few years ago while Infosys did so with Mana. According to Infosys chief Vishal Sikka, this move enabled his firm to disengage some 4,000 of his full-time engineers from projects that required the more humdrum tasks of automation and maintenance.This is the precarious situation confronting Wipro's new chief executive Abidali Neemuchwala when he took over the reins early this year. He has chalked out an ambitious campaign that includes tripling revenue growth Neemuchwala has realised that the world that his company finds itself in is one where automation is very rapidly erasing the gains from labour arbitrage that Indian companies once enjoyed. Moreover, clients these days are insisting on digital solutions built in to contracts, since their own offerings are going that route, and having an elegant platform could prove to be a crucial differentiator. AI can also become a standalone generator of much-needed additional cash flow, boosting profit margins: Wirpo plans to generate at least $60-70 million in extra revenue from its platform.</p><p>Published by HT Syndication with permission from News Point.

According to a recent report from McKinsey, the economic profit of the world's top banks and insurance companies declined by $800 billion and $300 billion respectively between 2015 and 2018.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The COVID crisis is making these trends even worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Economic profit\" is profit after cost of capital. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It is a measure of an organisation's efficiency at resource allocation.</emphasis> In other words, it demonstrates the returns an organisation gets from the solutions it offers customers (and society more broadly) after paying back the costs of funding them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's also a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">good measure of innovation effectiveness</emphasis>, and by this measure the industry is not delivering for its stakeholders.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The hard truth is that the financial services industry has not updated its core business model in centuries, and the urgency to do so now is even stronger than it was before COVID.</emphasis></p><p>Banks and insurance companies have spent billions of dollars digitising their existing operations. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">But the time has now come to invest fully in creating digital business models</emphasis>, to help the wider economy recover from the COVID crisis too.</p><p>Embedded finance offers one of the most exciting new digital growth opportunities to incumbent financial institutions: an <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">addressable market worth over $7 trillion, or roughly double the market value of the world's top thirty banks today</emphasis>.</p><p>VCs, big tech and fintech entrepreneurs are excited about this market and are pouring more money and effort into it, following successes like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/01/visa-to-buy-fintech-start-up-plaid-for-5-3bn/\">Plaid, a seven year old start-up which was sold to Visa for over $5 billion</url> recently, and the enormous growth of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/07/squares-55bn-valuation-reaches-skies-of-major-us-banks/\">Square</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/08/payments-group-stripe-snatches-general-motors-cfo/\">Stripe</url>.</p><p>It's time for incumbents to play in this space too, wholeheartedly and at scale. But it requires a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">deeper understanding of the types of digital business models available</emphasis> and how to build a portfolio out of them.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New digital business model archetypes</emphasis></h><p>Embedded finance is about <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">abstracting banking and insurance functionality into technology </emphasis>and enabling any brand or merchant to integrate innovative financial services into their offerings and customer experiences, rapidly and at low cost.</p><p>It is one of four new digital business model archetypes that are particularly relevant to financial institutions.</p><p>The four new business model archetypes in the diagram all exploit <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">platform thinking and platform economics</emphasis>, and are highly suited to an increasingly platform mediated digital economy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Platform thinking means leveraging the creativity and resources of third parties to create greater value for your customers and markets, rather than trying to serve customers only with your own products.</emphasis></p><p>In practice, this means exploiting advanced digital technologies and different ways of capturing value.</p><p>Platform-based business models dominate in an increasingly hyperconnected digital world, due to their powerful underlying economics. Seven of the ten most valuable companies in the world, five of the top eight financial institutions and seventy percent of unicorn startups are driven by platform economics.</p><p>They focus on exploiting and monetising \"intellectual capital\" (encapsulated in software) and \"relational capital\" (connections between multiple parties), which have near zero marginal costs, rather than asset-heavy \"human capital\" (people) or \"financial capital\" (money).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">While these concepts and principles are second nature to VCs, big tech and tech entrepreneurs, they are new and somewhat alien to most leaders at banks and insurance companies (and most traditional sectors) today.</emphasis></p><p>As a result they have not incorporated - wholeheartedly, effectively and at scale - by the industry so far. hence the economic profit figures.</p><p>There are some notable exceptions, like PingAn, which fully embraced platform thinking some years ago. As a result it has grown rapidly and is now worth more than Citi, hSBC and has overtaken all local competition.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/files/2020/08/Simon-Torrance-analysis-4.png\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Platform business models (PingAn, PayPal, Visa) vs hSBC, Citigroup, Allianz</emphasis></p><p>I'll discuss in more detail the other business model archetypes and how to design synergistic portfolios in future articles. Let's now look at embedded finance and why it could be <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a powerful catalyst for business model transformation for incumbent banks and insurers</emphasis>.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Embedded finance - how it works</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Put simply, embedded finance is about enabling any business to manage and sell innovative financial services; seamlessly integrating creative forms of payment, debit, credit, insurance or even investment into their end user experiences.</emphasis></p><p>The simplest example of this in action is paying for an Uber ride. You don't get out your credit card at the end of the journey. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Uber product designers have enabled payments to be embedded into your experience</emphasis> of getting a lift and, for the driver, into their experience of getting paid the right amount at the right time.</p><p>Payment facilitation companies like Stripe and Square have grown rapidly over the last ten years by enabling this sort of capability for digital companies. They are now worth $36 billion and $57 billion respectively and are expanding their capabilities into other areas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Complexity increases as you move from payments to debit, credit, insurance and investments.</emphasis> But if you are a merchant or brand in any sector you want to make your propositions to customers as attractive as possible.</p><p>Today customers have to interact with their banks to get debit and credit cards, loans for a sofa, car or house, and there's a lot of back and forth between the customer, the bank, and the merchant, with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">few options personalised to the needs of individual customers</emphasis>.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/03/chinas-ant-financial-buys-small-stake-in-swedish-unicorn-klarna/\">Klarna</url> has grown into a $5.5 billion company by enabling brands to offer innovative credit solutions at the point of purchase, for example, by paying in instalments.</p><p>Lambda School provides online training for would-be coders. It offers various payment options, including an <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">income sharing agreement</emphasis>, whereby the student is charged a cut of his/her future income rather than an upfront tuition fee. The student deals directly with the school for this and the other payment options offered, rather than seeking a loan from a bank. This may or may not be attractive to everyone, but <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">it demonstrates the opportunities for creativity that embedded finance enables</emphasis>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Embedded insurance is now fast emerging too,</emphasis> enabling your car share service, for example, to come automatically with mobility insurance, or your new camera to come with theft and damage protection right out of the box as part of the overall price.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Some of this happens already today, but it's clunky</emphasis>. British Airways offers travel insurance on its website when buying a flight. But it's not quick and cost effective for brands and merchants to integrate these offers and they tend to be generic and managed by the insurer rather than configured in real time by the brand. For banks and insurers who today \"white label\" their products and capabilities to third parties, the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> timeframes are months or years to conclude deals, and years to implement at scale and see a return.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Today white-labeling financial products for merchants is far from a digital business model for banks/insurers: it has high costs to serve, long RFP-based sales cycles and lumpy revenue.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ultimately, financial services will disappear into the background</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">of the solution being offered to a customer</emphasis>. British Gas has already stopped selling me \"boiler insurance\" - a dull product. It now offers \"remote boiler maintenance\" (enabled by IoT-optimised underwriting) - a much more attractive proposition.</p><p>Embedded finance - as opposed to reselling financial services - is attractive to digital brands and merchants because it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">creates new revenue opportunities at very low marginal cost\u00a0</emphasis>(the brand already has a customer base). It enables new customer experiences that drive loyalty and repeat purchase and allows merchants to capture more of the economics of the relationship.</p><p>For pure software companies, it could potentially enable them to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">increase revenue per customer by two to five times</emphasis>, according to VC a16z.</p><p>For example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/05/ecommerce-platform-shopify-to-launch-shopify-balance-for-businesses/\">Shopify</url>, a B2B e-commerce platform, now makes over $500 million per annum from financial services to its merchants (growing at over 50% per annum). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The underwriting costs are much lower, as Shopify already has a huge volume of data about its users</emphasis>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">For many software and platform businesses, financial services are, and will increasingly be, a very lucrative addition to their core business.</emphasis></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Addressable market sizing</emphasis></h><p>According to analysis by Matt harris from Bain Capital Ventures, if you extrapolate forward the current rates of growth in embedded payments, and make some assumptions about slower adoption rates but the larger market sizes of lending and insurance (lending is roughly double and insurance triple the size of the payments market, by revenue and profits), then assume that companies enabling embedded finance deploy SaaS based commercial models with valuation multiples of 5x revenues, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">you quickly get to a new market potential for entrepreneurs, investors, fintechs and incumbents of $3.6 trillion in ten years time... in the US alone.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">To put this in perspective, embedded finance could potentially create businesses worth more than the total pre-COVID value of America's top 30 financial institutions.</emphasis></p><p>The diagram below demonstrates the assumptions behind payments.</p><p>Again, this is just the US. If we double these figures and those for lending and insurance to create a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">global addressable market (given lower market maturities and adoption rates outside the US), then we get to $7.2 trillion in ten years</emphasis>, about double the market value of the world's top 30 banks today.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Or, put another way, embedded finance opens up the opportunity - for investors willing to grasp it - to create businesses worth more than today's software and platform firms in half the time it took them... or ten times as quickly as it took the US financial industry to get to where it is today.</emphasis></p><p>What underpins these assumptions, according to Matt harris and other visionary analysts, is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the emergence of financial technology as the next (fourth) development platform for the digital world</emphasis>.</p><p>The internet itself was the first platform. It bought \"connectivity\". The cloud followed, and bought on tap computing power and \"intelligence\". Mobile was the third development platform, which bought \"ubiquity\". <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The fourth platform is financial technology (fintech), which\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">enables entrepreneurs to create new businesses related to \"value exchange\".</emphasis></p><p>Many powerful new businesses took advantage of these phases in the evolution of the digital economy. Ebay, Amazon and Facebook leveraged the internet; Salesforce and AWS exploited the cloud; the Apple's AppStore, Tencent and Uber required mobile; Lending Club, Stripe and Ant Financial have been born on top of fintech.</p><p>Ant Financial, as spin off from Alibaba, is planning to IPO this year at a valuation of circa $200 billion. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who will create the next Ant Financial? Could it be a spin-off from an incumbent bank?</emphasis></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Banking-as-a-Service platforms enable embedded finance</emphasis></h><p>Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms are enabling sophisticated forms of embedded finance. They connect into core financial systems via APIs and give digital brands and merchants tools to rapidly configure financial service elements into their user experiences.</p><p>BaaS has been in development for about five years, has now become mature and is being deployed at scale. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VCs are excited about this emerging market, and are funding more start-ups.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>Notable examples of BaaS players include Galilleo (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/04/consumer-fintech-sofi-to-acquire-galileo-for-1-2-billion/\">recently acquired by SoFi</url>), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/06/fintech-start-up-synapse-cuts-50-of-full-time-staff/\">Synapse</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/07/marqeta-plans-2021-ipo/\">Marqeta</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/02/bankable-and-visa-extend-partnership-with-us-collaboration/\">Bankable</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/04/visa-invests-in-open-banking-platform-railsbank/\">Railsbank</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/07/bond-bags-32m-from-coatue-goldman-sachs-and-mastercard/\">Bond</url>\u00a0(a well-funded newcomer led by senior talent from Blackrock, Goldman, SoFi and... Twilio).\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Twilio heritage is particularly relevant</emphasis>. Born out of the telecoms sector, Twilio pioneered Communications-as-a-Service, a precursor to BaaS, over ten years ago. It enables product developers within enterprises to embed communications (text, voice, chat) into their customer experiences. It enables rider-driver interactions on Uber, for example.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Twilio is worth $40 billion today, nearly as much as Vodafone Group, with a 30x valuation multiple compared to Vodafone's 0.9x. You can see which type of business model investors prefer. Not bad for an \"enabler\".</emphasis></p><p>Railsbank, a four year old start-up led by successful serial tech entrepreneurs, originally nurtured by my friends at Startup Bootcamp and invested in by Visa, offers fintechs, financial institutions, digital banks, as well as non-financial brands and merchants a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"single API into the global financial system\"</emphasis>.</p><p>It enables them to create and prototype any financial use case in days and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">launch it within weeks</emphasis>. The potential to commoditise incumbent financial institutions, in the way Twilio did in telecoms, is significant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Today, only a few major regulated banks are taking strong positions in this market at present</emphasis>: BBVA, an international Spanish bank, with its separate Open Platform business\u00a0unit and Goldman Sachs, through its new digital consumer bank <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/06/goldman-sachs-closes-marcus-to-new-uk-users-amid-deposit-surge/\">Marcus</url>, which has sealed deals with Amazon to provide lines of credit to merchants and with Apple to provide credit cards. Standard Chartered has recently\u00a0launched a dedicated BaaS offering, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/03/standard-chartered-launches-banking-as-a-service-solution-in-indonesia/\">nexus</url>.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Opportunities, threats and actions for incumbents</emphasis></h><p>11:FS, in its recent report, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Banking as a Service - reimagining financial services with modular banking\"</emphasis>, describes the emerging BaaS market, showing the different types of players, their needs and aims and lists some of the key providers.</p><p>Today, independent BaaS providers focus primarily on supporting digital companies, especially fintechs. But, we know that \"traditional\" and \"non-financial\" sectors will constitute the larger part of the future market as they digitise and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">they will also demand and expect developer-friendly solutions which are fast and easy to integrate</emphasis>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This creates the perfect storm for those creating embedded finance solutions: the digitisation of every sector combined with mature financial technology and integration simplicity via Finance-as-a-Service platforms.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The danger for banks and primary insurance companies is that they could become marginalised and commoditised in this market.</emphasis> Due to open banking regulations and open APIs it's now possible for more and more financial service capabilities to be delivered by non-regulated third parties. In its report, 11:FS presents the BaaS \"stack\", and gives clear and useful examples of how the market is evolving.</p><p>You can see in the diagram below on the left that the only place where banks have a monopoly now is in their role as a regulated license holder. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The green bars, which make up the \"banking stack\", can now be offered by non-regulated BaaS providers.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>The market to date has been focused on enabling new digital banks to emerge and to embed payments into digital services.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/10/will-smith-and-kevin-durant-part-of-20m-investment-in-mercury/\">Mercury</url>, for example, is a new digital bank for start-ups in the US. To deliver its services it accesses many of the capabilities it needs from Synapse, the aforementioned specialist BaaS provider. It also \"rents\" a licence and general ledger from Evolve, a small regulated \"sponsor bank\" based in Tennessee.</p><p>All parties win: Mercury gets to market fast with low cost and flexible infrastructure, Synapse grows its enabling business, and Evolve, a small local bank, has a new source of high margin revenues.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sponsor banks who play in the US BaaS market are generating higher RoE/RoA multiples than those who don't, according to a16z and 11:FS.</emphasis></p><p>Since entering the market with its dedicated Open Platform business unit, BBVA has started to win business from leading digital companies like Uber and Google. In Mexico, Uber can now offer the 35% of its new drivers who have never accessed banking services before debit cards linked to their Uber accounts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This type of innovation creates financial inclusion for the unbanked as well as enables the gig economy to operate more effectively.</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/08/google-pay-to-launch-bank-accounts-in-2021-with-flurry-of-partners/\">Google Pay</url> announced recently that it will now offer bank accounts and other financial management services to it users in collaboration with several banks including BBVA.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">So, if we take this a step further, could </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barclays </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(per the hypothetical case in the diagram above), for example, create a compelling BaaS platform that enables, for example, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tesco</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'s marketing teams to test and launch - within weeks - highly personalised savings, loan and health insurance offers to niche customer segments related to their profiles from Tesco's ClubCard loyalty programme and spend at stores?\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">What about testing financing offerings for its supplier base, and orchestrating a more connected ecosystem between customers and suppliers - becoming a platform business itself? At the moment, Tesco Bank, formed in 1997, is costly, under pressure and sub-scale (it sold off its mortgage business recently to Lloyds Bank). </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rather than trying to be a traditional bank, why couldn't Tesco use a BaaS platform to create new solutions for real untapped stakeholder needs.\u00a0</emphasis></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Time for action, at scale!</emphasis></h><p>Bank/Insurance/Investment-as-a-Service platforms will enable embedded finance. The examples in this article are just the starting point.</p><p>For incumbent banks the imperative is clear:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">It's time to fight back against the commoditisation and marginalisation of the current business model and upgrade it for the digital economy.</emphasis></p><p>Embedded finance is one of four new digital business archetypes that, if combined within synergistic business model portfolios, will be very powerful.</p><p>In my experience of working with incumbents on this topic there are <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">three key issues</emphasis> to address for a successful transformation:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Leadership understanding and commitment. </emphasis>API-based BaaS platforms are new and alien to leaders of incumbent financial institutions. helping them understand how they work, and the options they have in terms of where to play, how to win is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">critical to getting commitment to re-allocating sufficient capital and resources</emphasis> from other initiatives to support this market opportunity in a meaningful way.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Organisational structure, operating model and skills.</emphasis>BBVA and Goldman Sachs created separate legal entities to tackle this market. New digital business models require radically different skills, technologies and metrics. Attracting experienced tech entrepreneurs who know how to develop and sell digital platform based solutions will be key. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Establishing joint ventures with proven entrepreneurs</emphasis>, as PingAn does to kick-start its ventures, is one of the most effective approaches to reducing risk and increasing chances of success. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Typically these are best managed away from the core, within a</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">new organisational structure</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technical capability.</emphasis> As part of the strategy of where to play and how to win there are opportunities to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">quickly test and learn</emphasis> in the market by collaborating with startups in this space. This can help fast track customer engagement and internal understanding, create opportunities for acquisitions, and in so doing <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">build technical capability faster</emphasis>. Combined with the separate business unit approach this sort of collaboration is an effective complement to relying on internal technical resources or external consultants.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">There's no time to waste when $7 trillion of value is at stake</emphasis>.

According to a recent report from McKinsey, the economic profit of the world's top banks and insurance companies declined by $800 billion and $300 billion respectively between 2015 and 2018.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The COVID crisis is making these trends even worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Economic profit\" is profit after cost of capital. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It is a measure of an organisation's efficiency at resource allocation.</emphasis> In other words, it demonstrates the returns an organisation gets from the solutions it offers customers (and society more broadly) after paying back the costs of funding them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's also a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">good measure of innovation effectiveness</emphasis>, and by this measure the industry is not delivering for its stakeholders.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The hard truth is that the financial services industry has not updated its core business model in centuries, and the urgency to do so now is even stronger than it was before COVID.</emphasis></p><p>Banks and insurance companies have spent billions of dollars digitising their existing operations. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">But the time has now come to invest fully in creating digital business models</emphasis>, to help the wider economy recover from the COVID crisis too.</p><p>Embedded finance offers one of the most exciting new digital growth opportunities to incumbent financial institutions: an <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">addressable market worth over $7 trillion, or roughly double the market value of the world's top thirty banks today</emphasis>.</p><p>VCs, big tech and fintech entrepreneurs are excited about this market and are pouring more money and effort into it, following successes like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/01/visa-to-buy-fintech-start-up-plaid-for-5-3bn/\">Plaid, a seven year old start-up which was sold to Visa for over $5 billion</url> recently, and the enormous growth of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/07/squares-55bn-valuation-reaches-skies-of-major-us-banks/\">Square</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/08/payments-group-stripe-snatches-general-motors-cfo/\">Stripe</url>.</p><p>It's time for incumbents to play in this space too, wholeheartedly and at scale. But it requires a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">deeper understanding of the types of digital business models available</emphasis> and how to build a portfolio out of them.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New digital business model archetypes</emphasis></h><p>Embedded finance is about <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">abstracting banking and insurance functionality into technology </emphasis>and enabling any brand or merchant to integrate innovative financial services into their offerings and customer experiences, rapidly and at low cost.</p><p>It is one of four new digital business model archetypes that are particularly relevant to financial institutions.</p><p>The four new business model archetypes in the diagram all exploit <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">platform thinking and platform economics</emphasis>, and are highly suited to an increasingly platform mediated digital economy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Platform thinking means leveraging the creativity and resources of third parties to create greater value for your customers and markets, rather than trying to serve customers only with your own products.</emphasis></p><p>In practice, this means exploiting advanced digital technologies and different ways of capturing value.</p><p>Platform-based business models dominate in an increasingly hyperconnected digital world, due to their powerful underlying economics. Seven of the ten most valuable companies in the world, five of the top eight financial institutions and seventy percent of unicorn startups are driven by platform economics.</p><p>They focus on exploiting and monetising \"intellectual capital\" (encapsulated in software) and \"relational capital\" (connections between multiple parties), which have near zero marginal costs, rather than asset-heavy \"human capital\" (people) or \"financial capital\" (money).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">While these concepts and principles are second nature to VCs, big tech and tech entrepreneurs, they are new and somewhat alien to most leaders at banks and insurance companies (and most traditional sectors) today.</emphasis></p><p>As a result they have not incorporated - wholeheartedly, effectively and at scale - by the industry so far. hence the economic profit figures.</p><p>There are some notable exceptions, like PingAn, which fully embraced platform thinking some years ago. As a result it has grown rapidly and is now worth more than Citi, hSBC and has overtaken all local competition.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/files/2020/08/Simon-Torrance-analysis-4.png\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Platform business models (PingAn, PayPal, Visa) vs hSBC, Citigroup, Allianz</emphasis></p><p>I'll discuss in more detail the other business model archetypes and how to design synergistic portfolios in future articles. Let's now look at embedded finance and why it could be <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a powerful catalyst for business model transformation for incumbent banks and insurers</emphasis>.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Embedded finance - how it works</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Put simply, embedded finance is about enabling any business to manage and sell innovative financial services; seamlessly integrating creative forms of payment, debit, credit, insurance or even investment into their end user experiences.</emphasis></p><p>The simplest example of this in action is paying for an Uber ride. You don't get out your credit card at the end of the journey. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Uber product designers have enabled payments to be embedded into your experience</emphasis> of getting a lift and, for the driver, into their experience of getting paid the right amount at the right time.</p><p>Payment facilitation companies like Stripe and Square have grown rapidly over the last ten years by enabling this sort of capability for digital companies. They are now worth $36 billion and $57 billion respectively and are expanding their capabilities into other areas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Complexity increases as you move from payments to debit, credit, insurance and investments.</emphasis> But if you are a merchant or brand in any sector you want to make your propositions to customers as attractive as possible.</p><p>Today customers have to interact with their banks to get debit and credit cards, loans for a sofa, car or house, and there's a lot of back and forth between the customer, the bank, and the merchant, with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">few options personalised to the needs of individual customers</emphasis>.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/03/chinas-ant-financial-buys-small-stake-in-swedish-unicorn-klarna/\">Klarna</url> has grown into a $5.5 billion company by enabling brands to offer innovative credit solutions at the point of purchase, for example, by paying in instalments.</p><p>Lambda School provides online training for would-be coders. It offers various payment options, including an <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">income sharing agreement</emphasis>, whereby the student is charged a cut of his/her future income rather than an upfront tuition fee. The student deals directly with the school for this and the other payment options offered, rather than seeking a loan from a bank. This may or may not be attractive to everyone, but <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">it demonstrates the opportunities for creativity that embedded finance enables</emphasis>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Embedded insurance is now fast emerging too,</emphasis> enabling your car share service, for example, to come automatically with mobility insurance, or your new camera to come with theft and damage protection right out of the box as part of the overall price.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Some of this happens already today, but it's clunky</emphasis>. British Airways offers travel insurance on its website when buying a flight. But it's not quick and cost effective for brands and merchants to integrate these offers and they tend to be generic and managed by the insurer rather than configured in real time by the brand. For banks and insurers who today \"white label\" their products and capabilities to third parties, the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> timeframes are months or years to conclude deals, and years to implement at scale and see a return.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Today white-labeling financial products for merchants is far from a digital business model for banks/insurers: it has high costs to serve, long RFP-based sales cycles and lumpy revenue.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ultimately, financial services will disappear into the background</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">of the solution being offered to a customer</emphasis>. British Gas has already stopped selling me \"boiler insurance\" - a dull product. It now offers \"remote boiler maintenance\" (enabled by IoT-optimised underwriting) - a much more attractive proposition.</p><p>Embedded finance - as opposed to reselling financial services - is attractive to digital brands and merchants because it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">creates new revenue opportunities at very low marginal cost\u00a0</emphasis>(the brand already has a customer base). It enables new customer experiences that drive loyalty and repeat purchase and allows merchants to capture more of the economics of the relationship.</p><p>For pure software companies, it could potentially enable them to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">increase revenue per customer by two to five times</emphasis>, according to VC a16z.</p><p>For example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/05/ecommerce-platform-shopify-to-launch-shopify-balance-for-businesses/\">Shopify</url>, a B2B e-commerce platform, now makes over $500 million per annum from financial services to its merchants (growing at over 50% per annum). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The underwriting costs are much lower, as Shopify already has a huge volume of data about its users</emphasis>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">For many software and platform businesses, financial services are, and will increasingly be, a very lucrative addition to their core business.</emphasis></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Addressable market sizing</emphasis></h><p>According to analysis by Matt harris from Bain Capital Ventures, if you extrapolate forward the current rates of growth in embedded payments, and make some assumptions about slower adoption rates but the larger market sizes of lending and insurance (lending is roughly double and insurance triple the size of the payments market, by revenue and profits), then assume that companies enabling embedded finance deploy SaaS based commercial models with valuation multiples of 5x revenues, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">you quickly get to a new market potential for entrepreneurs, investors, fintechs and incumbents of $3.6 trillion in ten years time... in the US alone.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">To put this in perspective, embedded finance could potentially create businesses worth more than the total pre-COVID value of America's top 30 financial institutions.</emphasis></p><p>The diagram below demonstrates the assumptions behind payments.</p><p>Again, this is just the US. If we double these figures and those for lending and insurance to create a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">global addressable market (given lower market maturities and adoption rates outside the US), then we get to $7.2 trillion in ten years</emphasis>, about double the market value of the world's top 30 banks today.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Or, put another way, embedded finance opens up the opportunity - for investors willing to grasp it - to create businesses worth more than today's software and platform firms in half the time it took them... or ten times as quickly as it took the US financial industry to get to where it is today.</emphasis></p><p>What underpins these assumptions, according to Matt harris and other visionary analysts, is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the emergence of financial technology as the next (fourth) development platform for the digital world</emphasis>.</p><p>The internet itself was the first platform. It bought \"connectivity\". The cloud followed, and bought on tap computing power and \"intelligence\". Mobile was the third development platform, which bought \"ubiquity\". <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The fourth platform is financial technology (fintech), which\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">enables entrepreneurs to create new businesses related to \"value exchange\".</emphasis></p><p>Many powerful new businesses took advantage of these phases in the evolution of the digital economy. Ebay, Amazon and Facebook leveraged the internet; Salesforce and AWS exploited the cloud; the Apple's AppStore, Tencent and Uber required mobile; Lending Club, Stripe and Ant Financial have been born on top of fintech.</p><p>Ant Financial, as spin off from Alibaba, is planning to IPO this year at a valuation of circa $200 billion. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who will create the next Ant Financial? Could it be a spin-off from an incumbent bank?</emphasis></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Banking-as-a-Service platforms enable embedded finance</emphasis></h><p>Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms are enabling sophisticated forms of embedded finance. They connect into core financial systems via APIs and give digital brands and merchants tools to rapidly configure financial service elements into their user experiences.</p><p>BaaS has been in development for about five years, has now become mature and is being deployed at scale. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VCs are excited about this emerging market, and are funding more start-ups.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>Notable examples of BaaS players include Galilleo (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/04/consumer-fintech-sofi-to-acquire-galileo-for-1-2-billion/\">recently acquired by SoFi</url>), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/06/fintech-start-up-synapse-cuts-50-of-full-time-staff/\">Synapse</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/07/marqeta-plans-2021-ipo/\">Marqeta</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/02/bankable-and-visa-extend-partnership-with-us-collaboration/\">Bankable</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/04/visa-invests-in-open-banking-platform-railsbank/\">Railsbank</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/07/bond-bags-32m-from-coatue-goldman-sachs-and-mastercard/\">Bond</url>\u00a0(a well-funded newcomer led by senior talent from Blackrock, Goldman, SoFi and... Twilio).\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Twilio heritage is particularly relevant</emphasis>. Born out of the telecoms sector, Twilio pioneered Communications-as-a-Service, a precursor to BaaS, over ten years ago. It enables product developers within enterprises to embed communications (text, voice, chat) into their customer experiences. It enables rider-driver interactions on Uber, for example.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Twilio is worth $40 billion today, nearly as much as Vodafone Group, with a 30x valuation multiple compared to Vodafone's 0.9x. You can see which type of business model investors prefer. Not bad for an \"enabler\".</emphasis></p><p>Railsbank, a four year old start-up led by successful serial tech entrepreneurs, originally nurtured by my friends at Startup Bootcamp and invested in by Visa, offers fintechs, financial institutions, digital banks, as well as non-financial brands and merchants a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"single API into the global financial system\"</emphasis>.</p><p>It enables them to create and prototype any financial use case in days and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">launch it within weeks</emphasis>. The potential to commoditise incumbent financial institutions, in the way Twilio did in telecoms, is significant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Today, only a few major regulated banks are taking strong positions in this market at present</emphasis>: BBVA, an international Spanish bank, with its separate Open Platform business\u00a0unit and Goldman Sachs, through its new digital consumer bank <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/06/goldman-sachs-closes-marcus-to-new-uk-users-amid-deposit-surge/\">Marcus</url>, which has sealed deals with Amazon to provide lines of credit to merchants and with Apple to provide credit cards. Standard Chartered has recently\u00a0launched a dedicated BaaS offering, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/03/standard-chartered-launches-banking-as-a-service-solution-in-indonesia/\">nexus</url>.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Opportunities, threats and actions for incumbents</emphasis></h><p>11:FS, in its recent report, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Banking as a Service - reimagining financial services with modular banking\"</emphasis>, describes the emerging BaaS market, showing the different types of players, their needs and aims and lists some of the key providers.</p><p>Today, independent BaaS providers focus primarily on supporting digital companies, especially fintechs. But, we know that \"traditional\" and \"non-financial\" sectors will constitute the larger part of the future market as they digitise and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">they will also demand and expect developer-friendly solutions which are fast and easy to integrate</emphasis>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This creates the perfect storm for those creating embedded finance solutions: the digitisation of every sector combined with mature financial technology and integration simplicity via Finance-as-a-Service platforms.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The danger for banks and primary insurance companies is that they could become marginalised and commoditised in this market.</emphasis> Due to open banking regulations and open APIs it's now possible for more and more financial service capabilities to be delivered by non-regulated third parties. In its report, 11:FS presents the BaaS \"stack\", and gives clear and useful examples of how the market is evolving.</p><p>You can see in the diagram below on the left that the only place where banks have a monopoly now is in their role as a regulated license holder. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The green bars, which make up the \"banking stack\", can now be offered by non-regulated BaaS providers.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>The market to date has been focused on enabling new digital banks to emerge and to embed payments into digital services.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/10/will-smith-and-kevin-durant-part-of-20m-investment-in-mercury/\">Mercury</url>, for example, is a new digital bank for start-ups in the US. To deliver its services it accesses many of the capabilities it needs from Synapse, the aforementioned specialist BaaS provider. It also \"rents\" a licence and general ledger from Evolve, a small regulated \"sponsor bank\" based in Tennessee.</p><p>All parties win: Mercury gets to market fast with low cost and flexible infrastructure, Synapse grows its enabling business, and Evolve, a small local bank, has a new source of high margin revenues.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sponsor banks who play in the US BaaS market are generating higher RoE/RoA multiples than those who don't, according to a16z and 11:FS.</emphasis></p><p>Since entering the market with its dedicated Open Platform business unit, BBVA has started to win business from leading digital companies like Uber and Google. In Mexico, Uber can now offer the 35% of its new drivers who have never accessed banking services before debit cards linked to their Uber accounts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This type of innovation creates financial inclusion for the unbanked as well as enables the gig economy to operate more effectively.</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/08/google-pay-to-launch-bank-accounts-in-2021-with-flurry-of-partners/\">Google Pay</url> announced recently that it will now offer bank accounts and other financial management services to it users in collaboration with several banks including BBVA.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">So, if we take this a step further, could </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barclays </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(per the hypothetical case in the diagram above), for example, create a compelling BaaS platform that enables, for example, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tesco</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'s marketing teams to test and launch - within weeks - highly personalised savings, loan and health insurance offers to niche customer segments related to their profiles from Tesco's ClubCard loyalty programme and spend at stores?\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">What about testing financing offerings for its supplier base, and orchestrating a more connected ecosystem between customers and suppliers - becoming a platform business itself? At the moment, Tesco Bank, formed in 1997, is costly, under pressure and sub-scale (it sold off its mortgage business recently to Lloyds Bank). </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rather than trying to be a traditional bank, why couldn't Tesco use a BaaS platform to create new solutions for real untapped stakeholder needs.\u00a0</emphasis></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Time for action, at scale!</emphasis></h><p>Bank/Insurance/Investment-as-a-Service platforms will enable embedded finance. The examples in this article are just the starting point.</p><p>For incumbent banks the imperative is clear:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">It's time to fight back against the commoditisation and marginalisation of the current business model and upgrade it for the digital economy.</emphasis></p><p>Embedded finance is one of four new digital business archetypes that, if combined within synergistic business model portfolios, will be very powerful.</p><p>In my experience of working with incumbents on this topic there are <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">three key issues</emphasis> to address for a successful transformation:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Leadership understanding and commitment. </emphasis>API-based BaaS platforms are new and alien to leaders of incumbent financial institutions. helping them understand how they work, and the options they have in terms of where to play, how to win is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">critical to getting commitment to re-allocating sufficient capital and resources</emphasis> from other initiatives to support this market opportunity in a meaningful way.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Organisational structure, operating model and skills.</emphasis>BBVA and Goldman Sachs created separate legal entities to tackle this market. New digital business models require radically different skills, technologies and metrics. Attracting experienced tech entrepreneurs who know how to develop and sell digital platform based solutions will be key. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Establishing joint ventures with proven entrepreneurs</emphasis>, as PingAn does to kick-start its ventures, is one of the most effective approaches to reducing risk and increasing chances of success. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Typically these are best managed away from the core, within a</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">new organisational structure</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technical capability.</emphasis> As part of the strategy of where to play and how to win there are opportunities to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">quickly test and learn</emphasis> in the market by collaborating with startups in this space. This can help fast track customer engagement and internal understanding, create opportunities for acquisitions, and in so doing <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">build technical capability faster</emphasis>.

Then, it makes money on the deposited money by lending it out at a higher interest rate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These deposits and loan repayments are what make a bank tick-and grow. However, they depend on customers, which may soon be in scarce supply.</p><p>Companies with no previous financial products are taking customer-centricity to a new level, introducing services like financing and integrated payments that deepen their relationships with customers at the expense of banks. This new approach, called embedded finance, is an existential threat to the banking industry.</p><p>Embedded finance isn't an intentional attempt to overthrow banking; most companies are just trying to meet customers where they're at (in-app, for example) when it comes to payments. With insight into customer earning and spending, providing more financial services is convenient and beneficial to both parties. It just makes sense.</p><p>Big tech has already been catching on to embedded finance in a big way. Recently, Facebook announced their new Facebook Financial initiative. A dedicated group will focus on embedding financial services like Facebook Pay inside messaging and apps like Facebook Shop. While traditional payment options are still available, the infrastructure now exists for customers to stash their money more conveniently within the platforms they already use every day, no bank account or credit card required.</p><p>Giants in the e-commerce space like Shopify, Paypal, and Stripe are taking it one step further. These platforms handle payments and have detailed data about users' businesses and finances. Recently they've been using that data to offer competitive business loans based on actual sales, revenue, and forecasted income. Since these platforms stand between customers and merchants, they can lower their lender risk by automatically collecting payment when merchants get paid.</p><p>It's not just commerce, either. Last year, Uber rolled out Uber Money to provide debit accounts and cards, credit cards, and a digital wallet for contracted drivers and couriers. Now, eligible drivers will also find a Loan section in-app and can apply for loans at 0% APR with no fees or credit check and the option to use a percentage of earnings for repayment. No branch visits, no more mountains of paperwork-no brainer, right?</p><p>When companies that already have customers' attention provide banking in the same place, they improve their customer experience, and give banks a run for their money.</p><p>Imagine you wanted to start a software company 20 years ago. You would have to buy a server and physically hook everything up yourself. Today, that's unnecessary. You can get an AWS account in five minutes and be off to the races.</p><p>The same is now true of financial services. You can easily use a firm like Marqeta to offer credit cards, Plaid to connect customers to their banks, or any other number of platforms to easily collect payments or offer credit. Fintech startups are bypassing banks and shaping the future of banking.</p><p>Embedded finance isn't new. Retailers like Costco and Walmart have provided their own closed-loop credit cards for decades, and even old-school store credit looked a lot like the embedded finance we see today because it kept money out of banks. The difference now is that the internet enables a fully integrated banking experience on a massive scale. Once this experience is built, it can be infinitely replicated thanks to existing fintech infrastructures.</p><p>It's not a matter of whether embedded finance will disrupt banks, but when.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CARDPM-000001747eeed6b3a7f47fef0a5f00011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CARDPM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V8-VMH1-JCRW-50KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>paymentssource.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29979\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 1</volume><issueNumber>No. 1</issueNumber><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.paymentssource.com/opinion/embedded-payments-are-taking-a-bite-out-of-banking\">https://www.paymentssource.com/opinion/embedded-payments-are-taking-a-bite-out-of-banking</url><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 15, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

How else can the 'burden' of compliance be used beneficially?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a 2011 Wall Street Journal opt-ed piece, famous technologist and venture capitalist Mark Andreessen opined about \"Why Software is Eating the World\" (<url normalizedValue=\"http://on.wsj.com/lfnmISe\">http://on.wsj.com/lfnmISe</url>). Andreessen described in great detail how software companies are disrupting incumbents. It's common knowledge, for example, that Amazon displaced Barnes &amp; Noble, Apple's iTunes displaced physical records stores and Netflix displaced Blockbuster.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What's most curious to me, though, is how regulated industries have been largely insulated from software's relentless attack. Uber (a personal ride service, www.uber. com) and Airbnb (which connects travelers with unique, local places to stay, www. airbnb.com) are notable exceptions that are beginning to chip away at the taxi and hotel industries, respectively. But they are both having a tough time battling against the juggernaut of powerful incumbents and deep regulation in the United States.</p><p>In the financial services industry, only a few consumer-facing software startups, mostly in the payments space, have had a real impact. PayPal (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.paypal\">www.paypal</url>. com) comes to mind. While Square (www. squareup.com) recently announced a chip card connection even before U.S. financial institutions are fully on board with this technology, it also has hinted recently that it is not making enough profit to go public in the foreseeable future.</p><p>Why is this? It is hard to start a bank or credit union or to dismpt the way things are traditionally done in the financial sendees space. Even neobanks like Simple (www.: simple.com), Moven (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.moven.com\">www.moven.com</url>) and Bluebird (wwbluebird.com) are really just slick online consumer banking applications.</p><p>Yes, they have awesome technology, user experience and marketing. But in each case, these companies have had to partner with an insured bank, use an existing ATM network, and strike a deal with one of the major credit card networks. It's simply not as easy to displace the current financial institution model as it is to enable movie rentals or music sales online.</p><p>It turns out that most venture capitalbacked software startups are looking for massive investment multiples and unorganized industries to target. Financial services, with its long history, powerful players, crowded marketplace and heavy regulation is not that attractive for savvy start-ups looking to strike it rich. Look no further than the recent stumbles in the Bitcoin arena. (See <url normalizedValue=\"http://tinyurl.com\">http://tinyurl.com</url>/ beprobs for an example.)</p><p>In the financial services industry, regulation is in place to insulate consumers from the bank failures that ruined so many during the 1930s. In the United States, credit union deposits are covered up to $250,000; in some Canadian provinces, the deposit cap is unlimited. Government regulators are involved to make sure these insurance funds and the century of trust credit unions have builtup is protected. Again, this may seem overly burdensome, but this environment makes for a highly defensible position in the financial marketplace.</p><p>Ironically, the endless rules, tight oversight, politics and complexity that have many CEOs pulling their hair out could very well be a moat that's keeping them in business and the software start-ups at bay.</p><p>If I have convinced you that regulation is actually your CU's friend (or at least not as evil as you thought), here are strategies to embrace it and use it to your advantage.</p><p>Clue in to CUSOs</p><p>Half of the 7,000 U.S. CUs are below $50 million in assets. These smaller CUs are feeling the weight of regulation, compliance and keeping up with technology. Their boards and executive teams are looking for ways to remain viable and relevant. Before throwing in the towel and looking for merger candidates, look to the industry's answer to entrepreneurship and innovation-the CU service organization.</p><p>For-profit organizations owned by one CU or several CUs, CUSOs are formed for all sorts of reasons and can provide avenues for innovation and creativity that would not typically occur within the confines of a CU. They can provide additional revenue streams for founding CUs and reduce service costs incurred by participating CUs. Generally, these outcomes are the result of collaboration and the cooperative spirit inherent in the industry.</p><p>Large-scale CUSOs like CUES Supplier member PSCU (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pscu.com\">www.pscu.com</url>), St. Petersburg, Fla.; CUES Supplier member CO-OP Financial Services (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.co-opfs.org\">www.co-opfs.org</url>), Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. ; and CU*Answers (www. cuanswers.com), Grand Rapids, Mich., have cost-saving technology solutions that cover almost every aspect of the CU business. Offering payments, ATM networks and app development, CUSOs are away for CUs to compete on a level playing field with Bank of America and the next hot Silicon Valley start-up.</p><p>While CUSOs are regulated, they can help CUs flex their entrepreneurial muscles. To gain a better understanding of what CUSOs exist and what they can do for your CU, visit the National Association of Credit Union Service Organizations website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nacuso.org\">www.nacuso.org</url>). There are thousands of CUSOs already; the next one could be started by your CU.</p><p>While Canadian CUs don't have a robust CUSO environment, they do have great resources offered by their central CUs. Five centrals cover the nine Englishspeaking provinces and these CU-owned organizations provide trade, technology and back-office services to their members. Chances are, if your Canadian CU has pain points in technology or compliance, your central may have a solution to help.</p><p>Leverage Compliance Software</p><p>In addition to solutions provided by industry-owned CUSOs, CUs have a number of powerful software options to help them deal with their unique regulatory challenges. A great number of these providers exist. If this is a path you're considering, check out the story about automated compliance solutions on p. 36 of this issue.</p><p>Partner With Disruptors</p><p>Once you are leveraging CUSOs and compliance software to your advantage, you may think there's time to take a breather, but not so fast! You still need to stay ahead of the curve on technology and innovation.</p><p>One way to do this is to partner with the very disruptors that used to worry CUs. Fortunately, my observation of such potential disruptors at Finovate (www. finovate.com), a demo-based financial technology conference series that started in 2007, is that they are becoming more willing partners.</p><p>At one time, the start-ups on stage at Finovate were making grandiose claims about disrupting the consumer finance space and looking for venture capital to make it happen. But this has given way to most of the companies that demo at the event looking to license or partner with established companies, including CUs.</p><p>These wouldbe disruptors have learned it is extremely difficult and expensive to build a successful business-to-consumer finance brand from scratch. Instead, they are now offering business-to-business, white-label solutions (to which you can add your own brand) to institutions with established customer bases.</p><p>More specifically, personal financial management software companies like Money Desktop (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.moneydesktop.com\">www.moneydesktop.com</url>), Bancvue (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bancvue.com\">www.bancvue.com</url>), Geezeo (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.geezeo\">www.geezeo</url>,com), Andera (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.andera\">www.andera</url>, com) and dozens more are building innovative technolog}7 solutions that CUs can leverage. These companies know that to reach critical mass, they need to work through regulated entities with established distribution channels that are trusted by the public. CUs fit this description perfectly.</p><p>Do yourself a favor and review the vast video library of past demos on the Finovate site (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.finovate.com/archives.html\">www.finovate.com/archives.html</url>). You will be blown away with the solutions you can potentially bring to your credit union.</p><p>A Final Thought</p><p>There is a lot of speculation that the big tech titans (specifically Apple, Amazon and Google) are interested in becoming banks, but why would they want to subject themselves to increased financial regulation? It would seem to me that they are very happy to simply facilitate payments on existing credit card rails.</p><p>Apple iTunes has almost 800 million registered users who have an active credit card associated with their accounts. Every song, movie and app purchase is processed automatically. Apple has no accounts receivable on these purchases, plus it is making 30 percent from every transaction from the content creators. Google and Amazon have similar scenarios with their digital marketplaces. Why would any of these companies want to be regulated and assume the risk involved in being a financial institution?</p><p>As consumers move more of their purchasing behavior online, the real opportunity for CUs is to embrace this change and make sure to position their credit cards as the best choice for members who want to link to these new digital marketplaces. Make sure your staff is suggesting that members link their CU credit card to the Internet services they use regularly.</p><p>Fact: Ostriches run much faster when their heads are not stuck in the sand. We can complain all day about how tough it is to be a CU-or we can embrace the moat that being heavily regulated has provided us and master our situation!</p><p>I am not advocating hugging your examiners, but at least understand why they are there and that we are actually all on the same team.</p><h>SIDEBAR</h><p>Make sure your staff is suggesting that members link their credit union credit card to the Internet services they use regularly.</p><h>SIDEBAR</h><p>Resources</p><p>Read more about selecting an automated compliance solution in the article on p. 36.</p><p>Get our monthly \"On Compliance\" columns delivered to your email inbox by subscribing to the weekly CUES Advantage e-newsletter at cues, org/ene wsletter-subscribe.</p><p>The 2014 CUES Next Top Credit Union Exec will be named Nov. 6 at CEO/Executive Team Network in Amelia Island, Fla.

How else can the 'burden' of compliance be used beneficially?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a 2011 Wall Street Journal opt-ed piece, famous technologist and venture capitalist Mark Andreessen opined about \"Why Software is Eating the World\" (<url normalizedValue=\"http://on.wsj.com/lfnmISe\">http://on.wsj.com/lfnmISe</url>). Andreessen described in great detail how software companies are disrupting incumbents. It's common knowledge, for example, that Amazon displaced Barnes &amp; Noble, Apple's iTunes displaced physical records stores and Netflix displaced Blockbuster.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What's most curious to me, though, is how regulated industries have been largely insulated from software's relentless attack. Uber (a personal ride service, www.uber. com) and Airbnb (which connects travelers with unique, local places to stay, www. airbnb.com) are notable exceptions that are beginning to chip away at the taxi and hotel industries, respectively. But they are both having a tough time battling against the juggernaut of powerful incumbents and deep regulation in the United States.</p><p>In the financial services industry, only a few consumer-facing software startups, mostly in the payments space, have had a real impact. PayPal (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.paypal\">www.paypal</url>. com) comes to mind. While Square (www. squareup.com) recently announced a chip card connection even before U.S. financial institutions are fully on board with this technology, it also has hinted recently that it is not making enough profit to go public in the foreseeable future.</p><p>Why is this? It is hard to start a bank or credit union or to dismpt the way things are traditionally done in the financial sendees space. Even neobanks like Simple (www.: simple.com), Moven (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.moven.com\">www.moven.com</url>) and Bluebird (wwbluebird.com) are really just slick online consumer banking applications.</p><p>Yes, they have awesome technology, user experience and marketing. But in each case, these companies have had to partner with an insured bank, use an existing ATM network, and strike a deal with one of the major credit card networks. It's simply not as easy to displace the current financial institution model as it is to enable movie rentals or music sales online.</p><p>It turns out that most venture capitalbacked software startups are looking for massive investment multiples and unorganized industries to target. Financial services, with its long history, powerful players, crowded marketplace and heavy regulation is not that attractive for savvy start-ups looking to strike it rich. Look no further than the recent stumbles in the Bitcoin arena. (See <url normalizedValue=\"http://tinyurl.com\">http://tinyurl.com</url>/ beprobs for an example.)</p><p>In the financial services industry, regulation is in place to insulate consumers from the bank failures that ruined so many during the 1930s. In the United States, credit union deposits are covered up to $250,000; in some Canadian provinces, the deposit cap is unlimited. Government regulators are involved to make sure these insurance funds and the century of trust credit unions have builtup is protected. Again, this may seem overly burdensome, but this environment makes for a highly defensible position in the financial marketplace.</p><p>Ironically, the endless rules, tight oversight, politics and complexity that have many CEOs pulling their hair out could very well be a moat that's keeping them in business and the software start-ups at bay.</p><p>If I have convinced you that regulation is actually your CU's friend (or at least not as evil as you thought), here are strategies to embrace it and use it to your advantage.</p><p>Clue in to CUSOs</p><p>Half of the 7,000 U.S. CUs are below $50 million in assets. These smaller CUs are feeling the weight of regulation, compliance and keeping up with technology. Their boards and executive teams are looking for ways to remain viable and relevant. Before throwing in the towel and looking for merger candidates, look to the industry's answer to entrepreneurship and innovation-the CU service organization.</p><p>For-profit organizations owned by one CU or several CUs, CUSOs are formed for all sorts of reasons and can provide avenues for innovation and creativity that would not typically occur within the confines of a CU. They can provide additional revenue streams for founding CUs and reduce service costs incurred by participating CUs. Generally, these outcomes are the result of collaboration and the cooperative spirit inherent in the industry.</p><p>Large-scale CUSOs like CUES Supplier member PSCU (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pscu.com\">www.pscu.com</url>), St. Petersburg, Fla.; CUES Supplier member CO-OP Financial Services (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.co-opfs.org\">www.co-opfs.org</url>), Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. ; and CU*Answers (www. cuanswers.com), Grand Rapids, Mich., have cost-saving technology solutions that cover almost every aspect of the CU business. Offering payments, ATM networks and app development, CUSOs are away for CUs to compete on a level playing field with Bank of America and the next hot Silicon Valley start-up.</p><p>While CUSOs are regulated, they can help CUs flex their entrepreneurial muscles. To gain a better understanding of what CUSOs exist and what they can do for your CU, visit the National Association of Credit Union Service Organizations website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nacuso.org\">www.nacuso.org</url>). There are thousands of CUSOs already; the next one could be started by your CU.</p><p>While Canadian CUs don't have a robust CUSO environment, they do have great resources offered by their central CUs. Five centrals cover the nine Englishspeaking provinces and these CU-owned organizations provide trade, technology and back-office services to their members. Chances are, if your Canadian CU has pain points in technology or compliance, your central may have a solution to help.</p><p>Leverage Compliance Software</p><p>In addition to solutions provided by industry-owned CUSOs, CUs have a number of powerful software options to help them deal with their unique regulatory challenges. A great number of these providers exist. If this is a path you're considering, check out the story about automated compliance solutions on p. 36 of this issue.</p><p>Partner With Disruptors</p><p>Once you are leveraging CUSOs and compliance software to your advantage, you may think there's time to take a breather, but not so fast! You still need to stay ahead of the curve on technology and innovation.</p><p>One way to do this is to partner with the very disruptors that used to worry CUs. Fortunately, my observation of such potential disruptors at Finovate (www. finovate.com), a demo-based financial technology conference series that started in 2007, is that they are becoming more willing partners.</p><p>At one time, the start-ups on stage at Finovate were making grandiose claims about disrupting the consumer finance space and looking for venture capital to make it happen. But this has given way to most of the companies that demo at the event looking to license or partner with established companies, including CUs.</p><p>These wouldbe disruptors have learned it is extremely difficult and expensive to build a successful business-to-consumer finance brand from scratch. Instead, they are now offering business-to-business, white-label solutions (to which you can add your own brand) to institutions with established customer bases.</p><p>More specifically, personal financial management software companies like Money Desktop (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.moneydesktop.com\">www.moneydesktop.com</url>), Bancvue (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bancvue.com\">www.bancvue.com</url>), Geezeo (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.geezeo\">www.geezeo</url>,com), Andera (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.andera\">www.andera</url>, com) and dozens more are building innovative technolog}7 solutions that CUs can leverage. These companies know that to reach critical mass, they need to work through regulated entities with established distribution channels that are trusted by the public. CUs fit this description perfectly.</p><p>Do yourself a favor and review the vast video library of past demos on the Finovate site (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.finovate.com/archives.html\">www.finovate.com/archives.html</url>). You will be blown away with the solutions you can potentially bring to your credit union.</p><p>A Final Thought</p><p>There is a lot of speculation that the big tech titans (specifically Apple, Amazon and Google) are interested in becoming banks, but why would they want to subject themselves to increased financial regulation? It would seem to me that they are very happy to simply facilitate payments on existing credit card rails.</p><p>Apple iTunes has almost 800 million registered users who have an active credit card associated with their accounts. Every song, movie and app purchase is processed automatically. Apple has no accounts receivable on these purchases, plus it is making 30 percent from every transaction from the content creators. Google and Amazon have similar scenarios with their digital marketplaces. Why would any of these companies want to be regulated and assume the risk involved in being a financial institution?</p><p>As consumers move more of their purchasing behavior online, the real opportunity for CUs is to embrace this change and make sure to position their credit cards as the best choice for members who want to link to these new digital marketplaces. Make sure your staff is suggesting that members link their CU credit card to the Internet services they use regularly.</p><p>Fact: Ostriches run much faster when their heads are not stuck in the sand. We can complain all day about how tough it is to be a CU-or we can embrace the moat that being heavily regulated has provided us and master our situation!</p><p>I am not advocating hugging your examiners, but at least understand why they are there and that we are actually all on the same team.</p><p>Make sure your staff is suggesting that members link their credit union credit card to the Internet services they use regularly.</p><p>Resources</p><p>Read more about selecting an automated compliance solution in the article on p. 36.</p><p>Get our monthly \"On Compliance\" columns delivered to your email inbox by subscribing to the weekly CUES Advantage e-newsletter at cues, org/ene wsletter-subscribe.</p><p>The 2014 CUES Next Top Credit Union Exec will be named Nov. 6 at CEO/Executive Team Network in Amelia Island, Fla.

Chinese companies Ant Financial, JD Finance and Baidu took up three of the top five. The U.S. and China also dominate in big tech companies that offer financial services.</p><p>Experts said one of the biggest reasons Korean players lag behind in the global market is that the government's approach to new initiatives and regulatory environment not conducive to newcomers, and help is given to prevent small companies from failing, rather than letting them learn from and survive failure.More specifically, the Korea's current regulatory framework, known as 'positive system,' bans everything except for what is allowed, but calls have grown for the system to be changed toward 'negative system' so that everything is allowed with the exception of what is banned. The latter framework grants more liberty to players.They explained that under the current system, it is difficult to create innovative and disruptive new services as the regulations and licensing requirements tend to protect existing financial services companies and focus on helping new players avoid failures.'China cites the government's patience and liberty it allowed to players until side effects emerged as the backdrop of fintech's development there,' Bank of Korea Governor Lee Joo-yeol said earlier this year. China's big tech and fintech firms grew explosively over years of an unregulated environment, and the government only recently took a stricter stance to control risks. Still, the approach to regulations is balanced.Jung Yoo-shin, who heads Fintech Center Korea, said in a recent interview, 'In Korea, initiatives face regulations first.' The government is allowing regulatory sandboxes for fintech firms but only since April. He claims a revised bill needs to be passed to allow unidentified customer data to be utilized for statistics for commercial purposes. The bill is pending at the National Assembly.While becoming the first or among the first movers in the industry is key to wielding global influence, Korean fintech startups joined the industry years later compared to their foreign counterparts.'This is because in Korea, financial firms such as banks were already offering convenient services for customers, leaving little room for the need for new services,' a banking industry expert said. This compares to the situation in China or the U.S., where opportunities have been much greater for fintech companies due to the unmet needs that were not covered by existing financial firms, the official said.China, in particular, leap-frogged from a cash-based to digital payment system, as other forms of cashless payments such as cards hardly existed.Another cited factor is the size of Korea's market, which is much smaller than China's.Balance between safety, efficiency'When a new sector emerges, the government should seek to strike a balance between safety and efficiency,' said Park Sang-soon, CEO of fintech company Fin2B.'However, the government placed a priority on safety over efficiency.'He noted that conflicts of interest that arose with existing financial firms when fintech players emerged would have put the government in a difficult position.Another expert in the finance sector also cited the need for a conducive environment.'Korea has no globally competitive fintech firms, with most copying models of foreign players,' he said.'For innovation to take place, an environment that enables failures and enables players to learn from such failures is necessary, but Korea has not provided such an environment.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WT8-BR61-DYTP-W4G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 12, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0005MM0</classCode><className>BANK OF KOREA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>SIC6011 FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001211</classCode><className>NEW PRODUCTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009SVL</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

As you all know, he has been at the help of a pretty incredible transformation of a storage company into a very successful federation business that is now in the midst of a transformative transaction with Dell. In addition to Joe, we're going to be having with us on stage Bill Green who is the Lead Independent Director of EMC and the former Chairman and CEO of Accenture. So with that, welcome on stage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Questions and Answers</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DEBBIE GOLDMAN SACHS: Bright lights on you guys. So I'm just going to kick off a couple questions and turn it over to Simona. But I think the big question people are wondering for you, Joe, and for Bill, what have you guys been up to lately? What's new?</p><p><person><nameText>JOE TUCCI, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN, CEO, EMC CORP: Not much. You know, the lawyers are going to absolutely kill me if I don't go back a slide. And I hate doing this, but Bill and I may well make some forward-looking statements and some additional comments and we really urge you to check our filings with the SEC. So thank you for being with us today and kind of sorry for that, but very, very important, so please check those filings. Debbie, go ahead.</p><p>DEBBIE GOLDMAN SACHS: You tell us. What's been preoccupying both of you over the last couple of months?</p><p><person><nameText>JOE TUCCI</nameText></person>: Well obviously first and foremost on our mind has been the merger with Dell. It certainly has garnered a lot of excitement. And to be honest, Bill and I both know it's generated some angst amongst the investor bases, both investor bases of EMC and investor base of VMware. But we really, truly believe that this was a fantastic and indeed the best alternative and answer for our shareholders, our customers and our people around the world, our 70,000 people around the world. We'll get into that I'm sure as questions, as the session comes.</p><p>We really believe, and we've been very vocal in talking about the massive secular changes that are facing this industry in mobile, around telemetry, around cloud computing, around digital transformation the companies are going to go through, the need for security. We, over time, that's dominated our internal thoughts and we've shaped our company to address the opportunities. Because obviously those, all those have a disruptive side, but all those have massive opportunity attached to them and we've been making sure that we well-face into this. And I think with Dell we get a better opportunity to capitalize on all these great things that are going to happen in information technology.</p><p>It gives us great leadership in servers and storage, in conversion infrastructure, in virtualization, in software defined datacenter and cloud platforms, areas of security, so it's a great coming together, creates a great platform, in client I should add, give us a great platform to serve our customers and make sure that we hopefully give you something that really is fair and a good outcome. So this is what's been dominating our mind and we want to make sure that this works really well for you and everybody else that's involved. Bill, you want to --</p><p>BILL GREEN, LEAD DIRECTOR, EMC CORP: Yeah, I suppose it's out of character that a Director -- usually they keep directors away from the investors because they're afraid they might go off script I suppose. But I look at it as my job, I'm the Lead Director of EMC, I'm honored to be that. I failed retirement. I was with Accenture for 36 years and when you retire, of course, everyone wants you to be on their board. And there were a bunch of them and Joe came by and I was lucky enough to know the company and know the people. And I just said to myself, these guys have something special, I want to be part of building something great. And so I joined the EMC board and became the Lead Director.</p><p>My job is to represent our shareholders. That's what I have to solve for and I have to work closely with the management team and the board to do that. And so we've been at this for quite a while. The way you take on a transformation is from a position of strength. And so as we assessed ourselves and we looked as a board at our company and what we had, and most importantly the underlying assets that had either been built or acquired over a period of time, and then the talent that we have, and then you lay that up against the market that we're facing. The market we're seeing today and the rise of digitization and the cloud and all these things, isn't a surprise. We could see that coming. So the question is, how do you get the most value out of what we have on behalf of your shareholders? How do you solve for the needs of your customers that stick with you day in and day out? And how do you provide opportunities for your people to take a good thing and make it a great thing?</p><p>And so the process on the board, which is our job, was one of rigor and discipline to look at all the alternatives for the company that was the EMC Federation. Everything we could do ourselves that would enhance our position to serve our customers and reward our shareholders. And then be ready to change, even when you're at the top of your game, to look at opportunities in the market. And as part of looking at those opportunities in the market, it was recognizing, and Joe has always articulated this to our board, that consolidation was something that was going to continue to happen in this industry. I think that's absolutely true. And so we looked hard at where can we have one plus one equals three? And in working through that with the likely kind of companies that are out there, the Dell opportunity came up and so we were very thoughtful about it, very rigorous about it. I'll talk about some of that later in terms of the things we did to protect our shareholders and enhance the shareholder value. But most importantly, we had the opportunity to solve for building something great. We had the opportunity to take capability and assets, knowledge and know how, and most of all ambition of a company we represented and another company and combine them together to build one of the world's great companies.</p><p>And so yes, we solved for the right financial deal and value for our shareholders, but we also solved for leveraging the assets, knowledge, knowhow, people and really a couple of decades of Joe's work to build a company that is incredibly special. And that's the journey that we've started on and as a board we're incredibly proud with the work we did on behalf of our shareholders to do that.</p><p>DEBBIE GOLDMAN SACHS: Joe, what surprised you the most about the last 4 or 5 months?</p><p><person><nameText>JOE TUCCI</nameText></person>: First of all, on the positive side, the overwhelmingly positive reception from our customers. Because at the end of the day, the customers are the ultimate vote if a company is going to be successful or a transaction is going to be successful. And the over -- I'm using the word overwhelmingly positive and I'm using it in all honesty and my own style is I always try to be extremely straight with you all the time, and it's overwhelmingly positive for our customers.</p><p>If you look at the strengths we have, we believe that this new company, we're beyond the must look at list, must consider list, anytime there's a significant bid going down in anything that matters in IT. That's a great place to be in life. So you as shareholders, VMware shareholders, I mean basically end up on the other side, you say from the EMC point of view I get cash, but on the VMware point of view, the stock that you own, the common stock or the letter stock that you will be getting, gives you a great opportunity. And I think when you look at what VMware can do with that massive $80 billion company helping push their great software technology, and I mean great software technology. This is a company with three software product lines that are over $1 billion of revenue today, and a fourth in networking, virtual networking product line on the cusp of becoming a fourth $1 billion plus revenue stream. This is a special company. And again, what you get with this is you get to own a piece of that special company for as long as you want obviously. You can always -- it will be very liquid when this is done.</p><p>And then of course it's the connection where Michael Dell and Silver Lake will own 27% to 30% of this company when it's done and they're going to operate this in the best interests of VMware. I know there is fears out there that they will raid the balance sheet. That is unfounded. VMware's cash will be VMWare's cash. VMware will use that cash to expand its business, invest in technology, whether it be organic or inorganic, and they will develop with their engineers acquired, they will be used to return cash, really return cash to shareholders. So we really believe that it's a win/win for our shareholders and a very special asset. I know there's a lot of worries about that, but I really do believe, and Bill and I have both had a lot of conversations with Michael Dell on their intentions, and their intention is to -- they get how special VMware is and what that can mean and that's going to generate value for you beyond just the initial whatever the deal goes down at. Because you get 0.11 shares for every EMC and then of course the common that's already out there. So I'm very comfortable this is going to be a great deal for all of you.</p><p>BILL GREEN: What surprised me, well the first thing that surprised me is it's easy to do these things wrong. It's really hard work to do them right. And it surprised me that for $100,000 and as many turkey club sandwiches I can eat for the last year I worked on this project, if you will, to get it right. And when I say get it right, I mean one is, find the real synergies. Find the real differentiation, find the nuggets. How hard it is to look under the hood of big companies like this that are incredibly diverse and complex. And you realize there are assets, knowledge and knowhow and talent that's been trapped in there and how you free that up and work through to find the case for not just cost synergies. I mean those are kind of shooting fish in the barrel. Revenue synergies, they're profound.</p><p>The second thing is, our board, the EMC board, on behalf of our shareholders, once we decided we were going to go this way, we solved for something called certainty to close. And certainty to close just rolls right off your tongue. But it's an incredibly complex set of legal and banking assistance to make sure that one you set on this path, you have arranged it so the deal is going to close unless an act of God happens essentially. Because that's the obligation we have to our shareholders. So just working through all the things on certainty to close.</p><p>And then it's complex, right? It's a big transaction. And it has its tracking stock in it. So people don't understand the tracking stock. We looked at every tracking stock thing that was ever set up over time through the heyday of it, through the falloff of it. We looked at all the legal considerations. Some of my board members call it putting the belt and suspenders around the agreement of the tracking stock. And then we looked at, you have this tracking stock, how do you get the governance right? How do you have common stock type governance in a tracking stock environment? And you make sure you build in all the legal and contractual things that you can influence to make sure that that stock that's going to be sort of unique to people that certainly went from the generation when we had those, understand the durability of the security and how it can operate. And so it was a profound amount of work to get to the signing in the fall, and it's turning out to be now a lot of work, and yet fun work, as we work through the process of not the regulatory approval and all that, but really the discovery of the golden nuggets that are in both companies that we can bring together in a synergistic way to add real value.</p><p>So the amount of work has been profoundly surprising to me. I am surprised at the reaction to the tracking stock. I do think there's people that just don't get it yet because it's not obvious, but the more people spend time on it, they're going to see and understand why this is a great transaction for the investors.</p><p><person><nameText>JOE TUCCI</nameText></person>: And ultimately the tracking stock will highly depend on -- will depend on VMware's performance. Pat Gelsinger will be here tomorrow, he's the President and CEO for VMware, he'll talk to you about their strategy, their multi-cloud, multi-device strategy which I think is outstanding, and I encourage you to attend that session and you'll get a glimpse of what they're saying. But to echo, and kind of dig down one level deeper, we have a really, I think, very good, we've negotiated a very good merger agreement. I believe our performance relative to our peers is on par or better. And I talked to you about our last quarter was relatively flat, the previous 24 quarters we grew, 24 quarters in a row year on year. There's very few companies born when we were born that are doing that, very few, if any.</p><p>Secondly, our cash flow is great and right on track, so we have high confidence that this deal will close under the original terms on time.</p><p>DEBBIE GOLDMAN SACHS: So if we step away from the deal for a second, Joe, I was wondering, I mean we've had rocky times in the market since the calendar turned this year. I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense, how do you see IT budgets shaping up for 2016? When you're out there talking to customers, what are they saying to you today?</p><p><person><nameText>JOE TUCCI</nameText></person>: First off all, I think when you think of IT budgets, they're changing. Because in yesteryear, IT budgets kind of came and were accumulated by the CIO themselves, in that department. And I think now what you're seeing is other departments, like marketing most notably, and others, have IT budgets in them. So I'm convinced if you look at shadow IT and the formal IT budgets for IT in other departments, I think the growth in IT is bigger than it comes across which is up a couple percent. That's number one.</p><p>Number two, I think customers are changing, and this goes back to the CIO. The CIO is changing a little bit of his buying patterns. And they're separating -- we see a separation, a careful separation of budgets into something that's more transformational in nature and something that's more transactional in nature. Transformational in nature is how do I get this company on a digital transformation agenda? How do I use this massive trove of information coming off of these Internet of Things devices, sensors, telemetry, smartphones, to really change the way I deal with my customers, with my supply chain, and become more intimate with my employees and partners? How do I do that? I mean those are transformational, becoming more of a software company itself, that's transformational. That's a budget. And how do I make sure that I'm going to be trusted and secure, cyber security? Those are viewed in the transformational bucket.</p><p>Then you get a transactional which basically covers most of the legacy systems. Which, by the way, companies still run tons of businesses on and they're very important. But there they're doing just enough just in time. So you see those trends hit and you look at just the, not the transformational budget, but you look at the transactional budget. They look like they're a little lumpy and that's because of this unbelievable, they've gone through incredible inspection, to make sure we're doing just what I need to buy now. Because I know the IT is going to change, and the CIO departments are putting new requirements on my desk every day, and I've got to create money for this new transformational side and then make sure I do just enough on the transactional side.</p><p>So that's a new phenomenon that we and all other customers are having to deal with. But I do believe when you look at that and the shadow IT budgets and the marketing budgets, there's a phenomenal future for IT. But it's changing and we've got to change with it.</p><p>DEBBIE GOLDMAN SACHS: I'm going to turn it over --</p><p><person><nameText>JOE TUCCI</nameText></person>: Do you have anything to add to that?</p><p>BILL GREEN: No, I would just say as we provide governance to the company, there's plenty of legacy tech companies that are going off into the sunset. The question is, when you operate a company of size and scale like the EMC Federation is, how do you operate the company with one foot in today and one foot in tomorrow? And the foot in today is putting the plan in place and driving the business towards it and maintaining your market share or capturing market share. The foot in tomorrow is looking around the corner really on two dimensions.</p><p>One is, if you look at some of the new products that are coming on line from EMCII, first quarter, second quarter around flash, mainframe symmetrics, it's profound. The new products and technologies that are being driven into the market, these are must have kind of assets for anybody who has to keep the lights on and run the railroad at a customer's thing.</p><p>And then the other thing is the foot looking in tomorrow. If you look at the acquisitions and the investments in R&amp;D that are the things that are going to be the billion dollar businesses of tomorrow, or $5 billion businesses of tomorrow, we as a board look at that and we see six or seven of these inside the EMC Federation. We've seen a few in VMware. We have Pivotal on its own. We have new things in the EMC, historic EMC family. And all those things are about important because you have to make today happen and tomorrow happen.</p><p>And so the budgets that are there today we feel good about our ability to be able to capture and be distinctive. And more importantly, the spending for tomorrow, that piece that's being freed up by cost cutting and customer companies today in order to invest in tomorrow, we feel good about as a company we have the assets. And at the end of the day, and I remember this from my history and my work experience, it's not clear how all this cloud digitization and so forth is going to shake out and there's profound uncertainty in the customers. So one of the things about putting these companies together, is I think it's going to be one of the most trusted providers of services and products in technology in history. And if you look at the biggest companies in the world, they want someone to go on the journey with them. I think that's why we translate today's activity in the market into the opportunity long term with the Dell/EMC combination.</p><p>SIMONA JANKOWSKI, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: To follow up on that, Joe, EMC has been talking the last few years about the third platform. Can you dig into what that really means and how you guys are putting it into practice?</p><p><person><nameText>JOE TUCCI</nameText></person>: Assets that we have that are aimed clearly at the third platform would be more of our software defined assets. So if you're building a new application today and you're going to build the services and micro-services -- the buzzword of the industry is micro-services now, you've probably heard that 2,000 times at this conference. But if you're going to -- when you build those kind of services into the app or around the app itself, you can actually do different things in your infrastructure and make it much more cloud-esque. So obviously in that area, things we're doing with Pivotal with its first of all teaching customers how to fish again, which is basically teaching companies how to write software again, to be driving a cloud platform, a typical cloud platform that's cloud agnostic. And then three, helping customers analyze those huge troves of data that are being thrown at them. That's all third platform.</p><p>If you look at the software defined assets, the Viper, the -- let's use some names, ECS for Hadoop and Object Storage, vSAN from VMware, ScaleIO from EMC for block, OneFS for file, if you look at these software defined assets, they're more oriented towards tomorrow's (inaudible). And then of course you look at VMware's new strategies around NSX, around this growth strategy of multi-cloud, multi-device, and look at strategies around AirWatch, strategies around their management suite, they're very much placed for tomorrow. And also provider -- and the management suite also provides a bridge in everything products from today until tomorrow which is also going to be important. Because you know, tomorrow won't be all brand new applications and today won't be all old applications. You get this kind of mixture in the middle.</p><p>So I believe we have great assets And that's what I've been referring to as platform three, and that's what Bill was talking about. You've got to do the blocking and tackling which is probably a pot that is more of a zero sum game. When you get into zero sum games, everybody can't win. So you can get some of our peers are going to become much less relevant, they'll become irrelevant, and many will die. And then again, this is why getting the reach we're allowed with Dell at the SMBs, state and local governments, healthcare, departments of big companies, EMC's reach of the data center, of the biggest companies in the world. The leadership in servers, leadership in storage, leadership in virtualization, conversion infrastructure, etc. You put these together, this gives us massive opportunity to both help for today and tomorrow, And that's what's going to make a difference if the company can help with both, because that's what CIOs have, that's why they're working on the transformational and transitional budgets. They have to have a foot in both camps. And we uniquely can help them.</p><p>And again, from a VMware point of view, the majority of the software that we sell will come from VMware, so that will generate should be hopefully a good channel and outlook for them, too. So we really believe this will be a win/win/win. And again, the win/win/win is a win for you as shareholders, a win for our customers and a win for employees and partners. And those are the three buckets any CEO and any board worries about and obviously I put you first.</p><p>BILL GREEN: Yeah, I would just add to that, one of the transactions we did this year that the board was incredibly excited about was Virtustream. I mean this is an incredibly special company. This is very focused purpose cloud service environment that handles what the leader of that, Rodney Rogers, would describe as spinal fluid of companies. So it's not fringe cloud stuff, this is the heart and soul. And their stock in trade is to operate SAP in the cloud. And the momentum behind this business which sort of get lost in all the Dell and the transaction, is just profound, right? And it is built on the VMware platform and it is a peek at the future and how the former customers of Accenture are going to be operating their environments in a hybrid cloud kind of way, and Virtustream, which is part of this family of products and services, is going to be a big part of that.</p><p>SIMONA JANKOWSKI: Maybe just to follow up from that, so back at your Analyst Day last year in March, you guys talked about your expectation of consolidation in IT. And obviously we've now seen some of that happen. What are some of the benefits that you see from a scale perspective or otherwise, in having a very large hardware company versus some of the smaller hardware companies out there?</p><p><person><nameText>JOE TUCCI</nameText></person>: Well hopefully we're not building a hardware company. We're building a hardware company, a software company both for today and tomorrow. So I think it's the breadth of what we have. Basically one of the things that I was most basically honored by and thrilled by, and I think Bill is in the same boat, is that if you look at what Michael Dell said he's going to do, he's following a bit of our federation strategy. And I think the benefit of having the mothership private gives you -- I think is actually a pretty good idea because it gives you an ability to incubate more things and then of course take them public eventually through the children so to speak. So I think that's really a profound advantage.</p><p>But I do think -- it's what I talked about before, it's just massive reach. I mean they are the king of the SMB market. Huge, huge footprint in state and local marketing in government state and even federal governments around the world. Huge footprint in hospitals. You look at EMC's footprints there, they're small, tiny Again, you go to the core datacenter, that's where EMC and VMware shine and of course Dell is not as prevalent there. So the ability to cross sell. And when you look at these things, you look the word synergies, and of course you focus on and you say, hey, they're pretty good operators, they'll get the cross synergies. But what makes me even more excited about it, and I really think they're real, is the revenue synergies are three times -- the cost synergies are real and sizable, but the revenue synergies are three times the cost synergies. And a number of those revenue synergies go to VMware, too.</p><p>So I think this is -- that's what makes me most excited about this deal. It wasn't long ago Dell was a big reseller of ours and just in one storage line they did almost $2 billion a year at the peak of our product. That just shows you the opportunity. And it also shows you that because we worked together for 7 years, people know each other. So it was a little bit of a homecoming when we finally got everybody together in the room and say, ah, I haven't seen you in five years, where have you been, you know. It's heartening. So that's kind of what I think is going to be the benefits.</p><p>BILL GREEN: Yeah, when we looked at that question from a board point of view, it was really important to us to understand not just where the synergies were, but sort of the broader opportunities in the market. So the first one was, how are buyers buying? And also to recognize that there's going to be someone who's going to be the de facto infrastructure provider of the future and it's not obvious who it is now. And so there's opportunities on that side.</p><p>The converged infrastructure momentum is just profound. So how do you move the business to where the buyer values are? And so one thing was consolidation to get scale and leverage. And if you just think of doubling the salesforce of people out there that can sell products that are attached to each other, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that you get huge lift from that.</p><p>But maybe one of the things that was really interesting to me, I had breakfast with a CEO of a big tech company, he's a good friend of mine, and it was one of those, this was in August, in the summer and this was one of those days when the market was jumping ugly. And we're trying to have a cup of coffee and every five minutes he's pulling out his phone, checking the share price. And so after about ten times, I'm like, how are you doing? And that evening we had dinner with Michael Dell and I said, Michael Dell, what were you doing today? And he said I sent a message to my employees and said isn't great to be a private company?</p><p>And I say that for this reason. Because incubation is a premium right now. And when you look at the ability to take the EMC, VMware family of assets, or Pivotal or any of these pieces, and incubate them out of harsh lights and then create and turn them loose on the market, it's a profound advantage of speed and keeps you from distraction. And so when we looked at what is it going to take to be a technology leader in the future, the ability to incubate was incredibly important to us in the assets that we had. And that's just another thing I think that comes with this consolidation thing.</p><p>SIMONA JANKOWSKI: And so you talked about it a little bit earlier, but Bill I think you mentioned like if the technology companies and the transformation, and we're not really sure how exactly the cloud is going to pay out. And I mean this with a lot of respect, Joe, because I've known you for a long time, but there is a boogieman in the room called public cloud that everybody is afraid of, at least from an enterprise legacy technology company perspective. Can you give us a sense for EMC and VMware the challenges that you think need to be overcome by each company and then the opportunities that cloud presents?</p><p><person><nameText>JOE TUCCI</nameText></person>: I think any strategy that denies the existence and the success of the mega public cloud providers is foolhardy strategy. So I don't view it as the boogieman, I just view it as a fact of life. It rains somedays and it's sunny some days, just kind of facts of life. I can like it or dislike it. But basically, you've got to embrace it.</p><p>So for instance, on the Pivotal side, when you develop an application for this new world, it is from the get go able to run [on the cloud], it is able to run on Amazon, on Google, on Azure or on a VMware cloud, VMware-based cloud. That's what customers want, choice. Today we're the king of business continuance, backup disaster recovery, archives as part of our storage business. We understand that some of those VRs are going to go to a cloud. So therefore, you can fight it and first of all have our own offerings using Virtustream. But secondly, we'll say, okay, if you want to use Amazon or Azure, that's fine. And you could be a player at the software level.</p><p>VMware, when Pat presents it tomorrow, it's multi-cloud, multi-device strategy is all about being a cloud broker. How do you take applications and securely, seamlessly manage them and move them whether they're on your cloud in your datacenter, on a managed cloud, or in an Amazon or Azure. I mean that's where we're heading.</p><p>So basically what I see customers doing is there's very few customers are saying I'm putting everything on a public cloud. There's very few customers that are saying I'm doing only everything on a private cloud. And almost every customer I ask is doing something with a Salesforce or a WorkBay, or one of those kind. So they're managing or doing an application on a managed, hosted managed cloud. So that's the future. You're going to have managed clouds, and I put the SaaS providers in there. You're going to have private clouds, you're going to have public clouds. And how do you deal with all of them? And don't deny that these mega cloud providers are a real part, an important part of the future. And how do you play? And they're willing to play with us, too, and they're excited to play with us. Because in this new company, obviously they'll get some synergies, but we start out with like with 38,000 go to market people. 38,000. Unbelievable. That's sales, presales, management, etc. But that's a huge number.</p><p>We're a force. And that's part of the reason why this kind of merger, as Bill articulated, makes sense to us now. And if we do it right, and obviously the benefits will accrue to VMware and then the value will be more where you'll like it, and that's why we think this will be an attractive deal for you. And we've got to -- anytime we do something a little different, but again, we're doing a tracker and then also have a common. And usually in almost every tracker we looked at, there was no common. And those trade fairly -- in a much different range than the implied value of the trackers are trading today. So we think that we have confidence in this strategy, which is why we're saying to you it's going to benefit VMware, it's going to benefit other things we'll take public that you can participate in as we do those. A different set of decisions, but for you, they'll be open to you. And we think this is going to create a great future for this company that I helped build and love and Bill has come to love and is a great director and big in support of what we're doing. So that's kind of how I view the public cloud.</p><p>SIMONA JANKOWSKI: One of the other big trends I wanted to touch on is the move to converged infrastructure. I think, Joe, you said in the last earnings call that you think this year about 20% of storage will be sold as part of converged infrastructure. Can you just expand on that a little bit and how you see that featuring in your roadmap on a go forward basis?</p><p><person><nameText>JOE TUCCI</nameText></person>: In a joint venture that Cisco -- EMC, VMware and Cisco started, VCE, we started the converged infrastructure. We thought it would be successful, it's way successful beyond our imagination. And then of course you've got hyper conversion and other plays, but basically it's conversion of infrastructure. And it's closer to what is happening in the cloud. Because customers don't want to spend the money buying piece parts, assembling those piece parts and keeping all those piece parts up to revs. So in other words, just in those pieces right there, there's a Cisco switch which has revs that it's putting out for its software and its products. In that is an EMC storage or multiple storage devices. Each of those has its cycles for upgrades and software cycles. And then you've got VMware virtualization and of course there's different products in there. So if you're a customer you've got to sit back and do all of that work yourself, assemble the hardware. And if you go converged, we're doing all that for you. It's closer to why you would buy a cloud. It has huge cost benefits to the customer.</p><p>So we will take this concept, and we start out with blocks, we'll take this concept through racks, through more of the third platform application, and we'll do appliances. So we are convinced that we will be the leader in converged infrastructure appliances, which are called hyper converged today, converged infrastructure racks and converged infrastructure blocks. We started with blocks, we're moving this way and stay tuned. I don't want to steal the thunder, but I think on February 16th you'll hear a lot more about that.</p><p>DEBBIE GOLDMAN SACHS: I think with that we have officially run out of time. So thank you, gentlemen, both for being here. Simona and I are pleased to have you, honored. Thanks again.</p><p><person><nameText>JOE TUCCI</nameText></person>: Just a quick thing -- I want to just -- thank you, again. Bill noted that you usually don't take a director to a meeting with investors. I think that's yesterday's thinking. I think the directors represent you, I think you have every right and should know how the directors are doing for you. And this gives you a chance to meet a very experienced, very caring Lead Director. So I want to thank Bill for being with me and with you and on your behalf. And secondly, I want to let you know that we are confident this deal will happen. It will happen, we're confident it will happen in the original timeframe under the original conditions. And I want to thank you for your patience and thank you for your interest and I really appreciate the time you spent with us this morning.

For the next session we've got EMC Corporation and we're very pleased to have with us again this year, Jeremy Burton, who is EVP of Product Operations and Marketing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jeremy, perhaps you could just start kind of bring us up to where EMC is today and give us a little summary and we'll go into Q&amp;A.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEREMY BURTON, PRESIDENT, PRODUCTS &amp; MARKETING, EMC CORPORATION: Yes. Thanks, Steve. It's good to be back. I see the weather is the same as we had last year.</p><p>STEVE MILUNOVICH: That will make you feel at home.</p><p>JEREMY BURTON: Thanks. Last 12 months, probably make a couple of comments first, maybe start with the nature of customer conversations and then drill down specifically into some of the macro trends and the work that we've gotten done in the last year.</p><p>Customer conversations, very interesting, I think they've changed fairly dramatically. I've never been in so many conversations in the briefing center with business people. We typically tend to talk to the guys who are in infrastructure and IT. Increasingly we get access to executives and line of business executives. And probably most surprisingly in a number of those briefings, they don't actually bring the IT team with them and the topic of conversation increasingly is business transformation or digital transformation. If I'm a product company, how can I enhance my product with software, if I'm a services company, how can I deliver my services directly to a mobile device using software running on that mobile device?</p><p>So these conversations very quickly get to a point where paraphrase and they say, hey, I'd really like to become more of a software company. And that doesn't really matter which industry. I have seen this in sports retailers, I have seen it in automotive suppliers, pharmaceutical companies. So the conversation is very, very different and the lead in that conversation tends to be Pivotal. Those of you that are familiar might remember we set Pivotal up probably about 18 months ago to two years ago, really designed to build a new application and data platform to host these new kinds of applications.</p><p>The business transformation conversation invariably leads to a conversation around data center or IT transformation. That is more in the mainstream where VMware and EMC play. I would tell you in the last 12 months, you cannot have a meeting with the CIO, or a Head of Infrastructure without discussing a private and/or a hybrid cloud strategy and that's led us to do quite a bit of work in this area to deliver that hybrid cloud in a finite period of time for a finite amount of money. So both with business and with IT, I think the nature of the conversation has changed. Obviously, underpinning a lot of these top level drivers are things like cloud and mobile and social and big data, the four big tech trends, if you like.</p><p>And certainly as a family of companies, Pivotal, VMware, EMC, I think we've, at least to-date, been able to navigate those better than most. If you look at the last quarter with the top line growing 9% that certainly stacks up incredibly favorably versus large cap tech peers. And certainly if you take the last three years or so, we've consistently grown our top line up above, I think, probably 3% is the watershed that many of the large cap tech peers have been fallen below. I think we've only ever once managed to dip below that mark in the last 12 quarters.</p><p>One more comment then specifically around infrastructure, kind of very high level and how is the group doing, but specifically around infrastructure, which is the core part of the EMC information infrastructure business that I run, the first trend that in the last 12 months we've really been directly addressing is the move towards a flash technology in the data center.</p><p>I think when I sat here last year we didn't have our all flash array XtremeIO out in the marketplace. I sit here this year, we do. That product as we exited Q3 is on about a $500 million run rate. It was zero when I sat here last year. And I think if I was a betting man, I would say it reaches $1 billion, not just faster than any other EMC product in its history, including VMware, but I'd say it probably gets to $1 billion in half the time. So that obviously has been a big play for us.</p><p>We acquired a company early this year called DSSD. It's another play in the realm of flash. It is not a flash storage array. It is a server attached flash products and we think it's going to have a big role to play in memory databases and new applications that people will be building in future. So flash clearly a big deal, clearly something that we're addressing and we've got a couple of big things that we've rolled out in the last year.</p><p>The other extreme of things where people don't want incredible latency in performance, where they want economics, there's a trend towards software defined storage on commodity drives. You may be familiar, we introduced ViPR, a couple of years ago and then most recently we packaged ViPR with dense commodity hardware on something we call our Elastic Cloud Storage appliances. So if people are wanting object storage infrastructure like an Amazon S3 or they are wanting a block infrastructure like an Amazon EBS and they want to stand that up internally and provide self-service access to the application owners, that's what we provide through our software-defined appliances.</p><p>Up a level, converged infrastructure is a big trend. You might have noticed that we brought VCE into EMC Information Infrastructure that was a joint venture between EMC, VMware, Pivotal -- sorry, EMC, VMware, Cisco. We recently brought that back inside EMC, continues to do very, very well, last quarter growth above 50% now on a $2 billion run rate. And I think that decision gives us a lot more flexibility as to what we do in converged infrastructure in future. We also announced a little bit down market in hyper-converged infrastructure that we're going to be partnering with VMware on the EVO:RAIL project. So whether it's kind of departmental enterprise or whether it be data center, we feel that between the EVO:RAIL effort and VCE, we've got our bases covered.</p><p>And then finally on cloud, our latest announcement that we did, we set up about 15 months ago a joint lab between EMC, VMware, Pivotal to prove out customer solutions. Solution is probably the most overused term in tech. So let me be specific about what I mean. Proven out hardware, software plus a large amount of consulting intellectual property that we've used on prior engagements, we've packaged that together to deliver for the customer a hybrid cloud in 28 days. So obviously the packaged services offering is what allows us to start from the 50-yard line instead of -- have the customer start from the 50-yard line instead of the 10-yard line. So the goal there is to go to large IT departments and say look, virtualizing results is not enough. You have to automate, you have to provide sell service, you have to provide a lot of the public cloud type experiences to your application owners. Here is the way that you can do that quickly and cost effectively.</p><p>So set flash software define storage and commodity, converged infrastructure and cloud those are the macro trends affecting the infrastructure and I think probably say in the last year, we've been pretty busy addressing those.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>STEVE MILUNOVICH: Great. Thank you. It's a great introduction. Maybe talk a little bit about the demand side of things on the macro side, how do you feel about storage demand generally, use of efficiency features and so forth? And then specifically in terms of your product cycle, you are starting to see accelerating revenue growth, you've got VMAX going into the new year, the emerging technology group is obviously very strong. How do you put all that together in terms of what you expect going forward?</p><p>JEREMY BURTON: Yes, it's a great question. I should point out first of all before KD kills me, that I will be making forward-looking statements which do involve risk and you can read all about those in our SEC filings which are up on our website.</p><p>But the storage demand environment, I mean, look it's been more challenging than we've seen in prior years. That continues to be the case. We see customers certainly leveraging efficiency technologies -- thin provisioning and de-duplication compression more than ever. It also used to be the case that storage arrays would get refreshed every three or four years. It's not uncommon now to see equipment on the flow of five years, six years, maybe even seven years. So people are certainly sweating assets longer.</p><p>I think we've been able to withstand the kind of lull in demand, if you like, better than most because of the diverse nature of the portfolio. As much as high-end storage, the VMAX has been a drag on growth this year. If I look at something like an Isilon which is north of $1 billion and still growing very strongly in double digits, I think there's plenty of headroom there. The Isilon team is starting to push out into some of these new workloads. So Isilon for those of you not familiar, it's a scale-out NAS box, really came to market, let's say, eight or nine years ago, focused on things like seismic exploration and oil exploration in media and entertainment to do video editing. But it turns out that this is a system which is equally good at maybe running home directories in the enterprise and consolidating 10s or even 100s of filers on to a single system. And they are now starting to provide access to a lot of that data through things like object in HDFS protocols. So the Hadoop teams that are starting to spring up organizations, the Isilon team is starting to tap into that. And [known] to many, about 10% of the Isilon customer base at this point is actually deployed underneath Hadoop instances, not just Pivotal as well Cloudera and Hortonworks as well. The lull at the high end with the VMAX, we've been able to make up for some of that with the great performance of XtremeIO.</p><p>XtremeIO, as I said earlier, it's an all flash array. Some of the very latency sensitive workloads that we see into the data center are moving to all flash technology. We acquired XtremeIO back two-and-half years ago. We were under a lot of pressure, I think, to bring it out to market. We held onto it because as soon as it has an EMC badge on it, the expectation of quality, I think goes up fairly dramatically in people's minds, and what we've seen from that product is not only is it capable of taking on those latency sensitive workloads, VDI initially and now database, the data from the field shows that we are getting five-nines availability out of it. And even in the very, very latest release of 3.0, we got about 300 installs and it appears to be rock solid.</p><p>So as I said when I look at kind of block storage overall VMAX, VNX I also have to look at XtremeIO and say, look those three together, can we grow that 3x faster than the storage market growth. There is going to be some puts and takes in there, but I think XtremeIO it's not just -- I think probably 20% of our business is replacing existing VMAX and VNX installations, but a big chunk of it, probably 30% of it is getting us into new accounts as well.</p><p>So the diversity, I think, has helped us weather the storm better than most. And we have a little bit more diversity coming on line maybe mid next year with DSSD that I mentioned earlier.</p><p>STEVE MILUNOVICH: So let's talk a little bit about the federation. I think in what you call platform 3, there is a view that you perhaps need to be more closely aligned with VMware in particular. And Joe spoke last week and he said something to the effect of it's time to make major corrections where you need to tightly align the Internet of Things telecom markets. Could you kind of give us the current EMC thinking in terms of how much the federation is still very loosely coupled versus how often you really are going to go to market together?</p><p>JEREMY BURTON: Yes, I think [again it] gives me the rise smile. I mean, I spent a large part of my career at Oracle in the mid 1990s and tension between groups and pulling on the reins that doesn't just happen in loosely coupled structures, like the one that we have, right.</p><p>I mean I'd say every big company would tend to have friction between product groups. I mean, ignoring VMware for a second if I just look at the product groups that I look after there is plenty of tension there that you have got to manage from time to time.</p><p>So look I think it's fair to say that EMC's biggest customers which often are VMware's biggest customers, they are looking increasingly to buy an outcome, so hey, I would really like to have a private cloud move into a hybrid cloud. And they want less vendors involved and they want a single throat to choke.</p><p>So I would tell you, and I sponsor a number of these accounts, they want a strategy from the federation, they want the federation to speak with one voice, they want to base their IT strategy around components of the federation, they like the idea that they've got choice there. The goal here is not to lock folks in for another 20 years. But they don't -- more diversity in a lot of respects is bad.</p><p>And so I'd say for those biggest and best customers, and as long as I've known Joe, customer comes first. That's probably what he is speaking to there, if the customer wants us to align, and I would probably point at the biggest customers we have, then we should align.</p><p>As you go further down market, there are many customers EMC customers that are not VMware customers or VMware customers that use somebody else's storage, it's tougher to align on mass because as you get down to the Fortune 5,000 versus Fortune 100 there is much more diversity there.</p><p>But I think where the customers really want us to align it's the biggest customers, the guys who got the biggest IT spend and in those areas, I think the enterprise hybrid cloud solution is just one example of how we have aligned and are looking to deliver an outcome for them.</p><p>STEVE MILUNOVICH: Yes. In our CIO surveys we find a slight edge to those who would prefer VMware to be separate, but it's very believable that in the larger accounts, they probably would prefer to be together. We also find by the way that VARs tend to pretty strongly prefer VMware to be separate in terms of feeling the times they compete with EMC for deals which I know shouldn't happen.</p><p>JEREMY BURTON: Yes, you might want to recheck that data point, because I've heard both. I mean, I know the [CRN] guys, very, very well and they went and surveyed folks all the nice first little up in there, said, really don't want that. And then they recently went and re-surveyed them and they changed their mind. So, again, I mean I used to be marketing. So I can give you a data point to prove any theory you have.</p><p>But the reality is I think the ones that you'll find with the VARs, I don't think it will be that different to the customer base. I think if you've got a big EMC VMware customer, man, they want alignment and a single message. If you've a partner that's got a big EMC and VMware business, I think they're going to want alignment because it helps them internally align their strategy.</p><p>The less dependent they are on EMC or the less dependent they are on VMware, that's where you're going to see a little bit of flux.</p><p>STEVE MILUNOVICH: Could we talk a bit about the changes at VCE, first of all, what's your view of the importance of converged infrastructure and what are the positives and risks in terms of bringing VCE more in-house?</p><p>JEREMY BURTON: Yes, VCE, first of all, for those of you don't know it's a joint venture between VMware, Cisco, EMC and actually Intel as well. When we first established VCE five years ago, we were all well aware that joint ventures don't last forever. And so no matter how well the intention is on day one, you know at some point you are going to come to a decision point. And for us that decision point we decided was five years after creation which -- that happened October this year.</p><p>So the compelling event, if you like, was the decision point that we'd bake into the initial contract. We were the majority owner. And so in a lot of respects, it was up to us as to what move we wanted to make next.</p><p>The upside, look I believe converged infrastructure three, five years from now, most infrastructure, I think will be bought that way. People are going to buy a system or they are going to buy a service.</p><p>Components, if you are in a component business five years from now, I actually think you end up in a world of hurts. People want an outcome, stick with the big companies, a system or a service.</p><p>VCE gives us an ability to build and deploy converged infrastructure for the biggest and best. It tends not to be like an SMB or an SME play. It tends to be a data center play or in some cases a service provider play, but I think said 5 years from now, most people will consume their infrastructure that way.</p><p>The other benefit I think of bringing VCE back is we're committed to going down the path of the Vblock spin, VMware, Cisco, EMC and it will always be that way. But we do have an ability now to diversify. There could be blocks that we'll want to produce that have got slightly different ingredients. That should give us greater penetration with our converged infrastructure.</p><p>And also I think the final benefit and I touched on it earlier is, it's not only people or customers looking for a converged infrastructure, they're really looking for an outcome to be delivered more quickly. So, can I get the hardware and software and services that I need to implement this solution in a much shorter period of time because I've never felt more pressure from the business. And think VCE gives us that packaging and distribution capability to have everything show up at the customers' site, ready to go.</p><p>I mean look -- the downside or the [gotchas] here, I don't know if there's any gotchas, but I'd say, look we've gone from being probably the partner for Cisco to being a partner. We've got long-term agreements in place, we're both committed to delivering Vblocks. But I mean, look from their standpoint, we are into the partner, albeit a partner that generates a pretty large revenue stream for UCS, but it's not as clear-cut. So I think that's probably the obvious one.</p><p>And then look, the second one, we've got to take on a bit more expense. But again, to my mind taking a bit more expense to now have that capability in-house to provide a greater and more diverse range of converged infrastructure, if that's where we believe the market is going, that should be a good thing.</p><p>STEVE MILUNOVICH: Let's talk a bit about the cloud. I think all the storage vendors are wrestling with how do they approach public and hybrid cloud. We had NetApp here today talking about their approach. You recently had an announcement. Could you take us through what EMC's approach is?</p><p>JEREMY BURTON: Yes, the thing we've heard time and time again and this has come back directly from the sales team is, look, you can't have a conversation with the CIO, or a Head of Infrastructure today without talking about a private cloud and then very quickly that turns to a hybrid cloud conversation.</p><p>So number one, the hybrid cloud in general, it's a very nebulous term, the customers in general don't really know what it is, what it entails, how much does it cost, how long does it take to put in, when am I done. And so what we've tried to do first and foremost is really demystify that.</p><p>So the hybrid cloud's announcement that we did was really the culmination of about 15 months' work that we did in conjunction with VMware and it was to say look, let's be very, very specific and write the recipe book around what a hybrid cloud environment entails. And then, not the hardware and software, but the key processes within IT that you would want to automate and you'd want to serve up in a self-service way what would they be, can we package that as well. And then can we deliver it in a very definite finite period of time.</p><p>So the enterprise hybrid cloud announcement really was saying, look, we can lay down a hybrid cloud foundation for you Mr. customer in 28 days. And the reason why it's 28 days and not six and nine months is because a lot of the services that we have delivered over the past year implement in this (inaudible) for many customers we have now packaged as a part of the overall solution.</p><p>That implementation comes ready to migrate workloads off to the VMware, Vcloud so they are a public cloud service. And in future it will support the migration of workloads to places like (inaudible) as well.</p><p>So first and foremost it was a job of really taking the mystery out of it through work in the lab that we've done with VMware. By the way there are a category of customers that we talk to that they are not going to go down the VMware path, they are going to go down the OpenStack path. And so you are going to see us next year also introduce a hybrid cloud stack that is going to have an OpenStack control plain on top of VMC storage and also a Microsoft control plain on top of VMC storage.</p><p>So our strategy here would be getting those conversations, take the mystery out of it for the customer and be able to deliver a full solution for a customer in a finite period of time for a finite amount of money.</p><p>If this turns into the next ERP implementation, then everything will go public cloud, right, because folks are not going to spend $100 million and wait two years in order to get a private or a hybrid cloud foundation down. And I believe at least, it's not really a technology issue at this point, it's delivering the solution to the customer and then helping the customer work through the organizational change that is required to adopt the new processes that are in a hybrid cloud.</p><p>STEVE MILUNOVICH: So you've got essentially a converged infrastructure product down the kind of private cloud side. I'm not so clear on what part of your product set, hardware or software, is going on to the kind of public cloud side and also how this Company bought, I think in summer that does a gate way facilitates perhaps data movements to the cloud. How does that fit in?</p><p>JEREMY BURTON: Yes. So there is a number of levels that track around hybrid cloud. There is look I've got what I've got in my data center. All what I can do is, I could pick my storage up and go drop it in one of Amazon's partners and use EC2 against my storage, right. So is that a hybrid cloud, well yes, it is. I just -- we don't think there is anything particularly innovative about dropping an EMC storage array inside of data center located next to Amazon and using that compete with our storage. Some people will find that interesting, because hey I can keep the storage on a storage array that I own and I can benefit the elastic compute, great. I think that's a niche. I think it's a (multiple speakers)</p><p>STEVE MILUNOVICH: So you are basically talking about the NetApp and Equinix and -- Direct Connect, right.</p><p>JEREMY BURTON: It's called Direct Connect. We did it too, we just -- you don't see us making a big deal out of it because we don't think it's a big deal. So you can drop an EMC storage array into an Amazon datacenter grade, you can connect it up to EC2 grade, but look that's one option. Another option would be, instead of putting your storage at Amazon, leave your storage on premise and then maybe I can trickle data off to Amazon.</p><p>So TwinStrata and Maginatics, these are two companies that we've acquired that will allow us to move data from our primary storage arrays and from our backup products across the network and take advantage potentially of the public cloud economics. So again implementing your private cloud on-premise, that's one transformation and I think IT departments have to go through. Then there is maybe I could move some of my data off to Amazon through these gateways and that's what we bought to TwinStrata and Maginatics for and that could be primary storage data or it could be backup data.</p><p>I could say, hey, I want to move my storage entirely into that public cloud environment, so I can move it to the Equinixs data center, I can use the Amazon Direct Connect and I have then got peace of mind, so that's on my storage that I own and I'm leveraging the Elastic Compute. And then there is the ability to move the entire workload to the public cloud. So when we talked about enterprise hybrid cloud five minutes ago, I was talking more about that last used case where, hey Mr. customer we're going to make your environment into a private cloud, pooled resources, automation, self-service. We're going to give you the connectivity to the Vcloud Air and then you're going to stratify your workloads and you're going to make a call as to what you want you run on your own premise and what you are going to run in the cloud. And I think they're going to draw a line in the sand and say, you know what, these I'm going to have you manage because I'm going to manage those for cost and you're going to deliver me the service level. These, I want to manage on-premise because of the regulatory requirements. And I actually think that's how the majority of hybrid environments will work.</p><p>mean, as a tech industry, we love to talk about these great use cases of the end of the quarter and everything is going to burst magically to the public cloud and that's a niche. People are going to do workload analysis. They're going to stay, look these are Tier 1, they're running here, these are Tier 2 they're running here, these are Tier 3, they're running here. Some of those Tier 2 and Tier 3, I think will be in public cloud. I think for a long time to come the Tier 1 will likely be on premise and the line is going to be different depending on what kind of company you are talking to.</p><p>STEVE MILUNOVICH: Is this where VMware is pretty critical strategically to what you're doing where there is high alignment because I kind of view VMware to some degree as your cloud strategy? And if you were to separate, would you be able to do the same sorts of things through an alliance?</p><p>JEREMY BURTON: Yes. Alliance, I said solution was an overly used word in the tech industry. I'd say, alliance is probably another one. I guess, [apparently], you would say it's possible, because the degree of difficulty is much, much higher. I've worked in a lot of tech alliances over the last 20 years out here and look, it's just -- it's very, very difficult to get another company that you are unrelated to on the same page building technology and go into market together. There's got to be some kind of a forcing function.</p><p>And so, in direct response to your question, I'd say, yes, the VMware plays a very, very important role as we go talk to companies and how they want to move towards a hybrid cloud environment.</p><p>I was with a huge bank last week in Europe. This is the 40,000 virtual machine environment, right, I mean, that's like shockingly big. And look, it's an EMC VMware stack on the infrastructure with the Pivotal cloud Foundry on top for the next generation applications. And the thing, although it's not as relevant today, VMware EMC is very relevant today for that move.</p><p>In future I think the alliance with Pivotal becomes even more important because the next generation of applications are going to be built on some kind of new development platform and that's really what Pivotal is trying to provide. And if we want to be the infrastructure underneath that new development platform, then we will be well served to annex ourselves to Pivotal in the same way as in the last seven or eight years we've kind of annexed ourselves to VMware. That world is still getting going, so it's small revenue today, but I truly believe we're entering a period of time almost like the mid 1990s in application development where you're going to see massive amounts of custom software built. The debt platform is not going to be like a BEA application server and an Oracle database like it was back in the day. It's going to be something else.</p><p>And so, Pivotal are in the hunt for that something else and we want to be the infrastructure underneath that something else. And so, kind of going forward, I think they become arguably just as important to EMC is VMware are today.</p><p>STEVE MILUNOVICH: Competition. How do you currently view the landscape? Is there any change? You did say, you expect to grow three times the storage market rate obviously implying continued share gains. How difficult is that and earlier you mentioned to me that maybe you don't even focus as much on the traditional competitors going forward because the game is changing.</p><p>JEREMY BURTON: Yes, we certainly encounter our traditional competitors on a day-to-day basis. But, if you look at the growth dollars and where are those growth dollars going in storage, it tends to be more in these new areas like all flash arrays, like software defined. And so most of the kind of investment dollars, if you like, are starting to go into these new areas.</p><p>I mentioned earlier, I think when we first started off, the workloads in the data center are becoming incredibly latency sensitive. They are the perfect candidates for the all flash arrays. I mean, if you can guarantee a response time of less than a millisecond, a lot of performance issues go away in the data center.</p><p>So we certainly see that movement taking place. There's a whole new set of folks competing for the all flash array business. The only traditional competitor, we really see in that space is IBM with TMS. So IBM's legacy storage products are not doing that great. But I think, TMS at this point is probably still doing pretty well and I think, it's still a very, very viable competitor. But we believe by the time we exit this year our all flash business will be bigger than probably the next -- at least the next two combined and probably the next three vendors combined. And that was from a standing start back in this time last year.</p><p>So flash is a big deal, a lot of growth dollars. XtremeIO is one vector of innovation to intercept the trend. The other one that we have not talked about much is DSSD. And I think even to this day, if you go to dssd.com don't get set for an intense reading session. I mean there's really nothing out there.</p><p>So this is Bill Moore who is the -- [sits on] ZFS and he was one of the founders of 3PAR and Andy Bechtolsheim. They have built a dense, as the name suggests, dense SSD, dense flash storage offering but it's actually not really a storage array. It doesn't talk like (inaudible) and all the weird and wonderful protocols that we've used over the years. It talks the language of the application, it talks HDFS and it talks key value. And the reason it does that is this thing is designed as a real latency monster. I do believe in the new world that we're heading into where everybody has got access to their applications through mobile devices, you're going to get lots of streams of information. And instead of us doing transaction processing, again a world I came from, Oracle database is transaction processing, instead of processing transactions, we are going to process streams. And those streams are going to need to be processed in memory, because often, you're going to be dealing with the consumer where we all sit there with iPhones, man, when is this thing going to respond. So I think in-memory computing is going to be a huge deal.</p><p>And if you look at what's going to be required from a storage standpoint for in-memory systems, you're going to need an order of magnitude better latency and an order of magnitude more bandwidth. And so the DSSD, we have moved the storage from the other side of the network on to the service side. But it is still a shared storage and it plugs into compute through PCIe3 and I think some of the latency and the performance characteristics of this we think are going to be groundbreaking and we're pretty bullish on it coming out next year.</p><p>And I think, again tapping into new vectors of growth in the storage industry. If in-memory is big, if a lot of these new applications use in-memory, that's something that I think we're well placed to tap into that nobody else is. And so that's what we should be able to charge a premium for. So XtremeIO, DSSD the software defined components on commodity so the [sea word] was probably not a very nice word and it didn't exist in EMC's vocabulary two or three years ago. Let's be that definitive. But look, you get a lot of companies that come into our briefing centre enamored with the Google, Amazon way of working and they are like, hey, I want a software defined storage strategy that runs on commodity drives. And so the ViPR project that we started three or four years ago, there is a whole bunch of the team that did ASIO for Microsoft came to EMC to build out ViPR. That really is still early days. It's in its version two incarnation, but we'll start to see a lot of pickup in that because we've packaged ViPR with dense commodity storage.</p><p>And so if you are an IT department and you say, hey look, I want to stop the Shadow IT going out to Amazon S3, I want a self-service environment that I can stand up and get running in minutes, that's what the elastic cloud storage appliances does. You plug it in and off you go. You've got self-service access via developers to get Amazon S3 like environment.</p><p>So again, that though I think is, in a lot of ways like a new growth vector and what we're really doing here is, is we see the high-end under pressure. We've got to tap into these new growth vectors so that overall we can continue to not just grow our business but grow it the 3x the storage market growth that has always been our goal for the last few years.</p><p>STEVE MILUNOVICH: Okay. Let me pause and see if we have any investor questions for Jeremy. Any one, not, I'll continue. I know you are not the CFO, but perhaps you can kind of address the investments that EMC is making. It's pretty clear that this year EPS is taking kind of a $0.15 to $0.20 hit from six or seven new investments. I would imagine next year it comes down, but it's still negative. Apparently, you're going to be talking more about this at the Analyst Meeting, probably early next year. But how is management thinking about getting some more bottom line leverage, how long do we have to wait to see the payoff?</p><p>JEREMY BURTON: Yes, the ultimate question is, how long do we have to wait. I mean, the difficult thing, I think, the last couple year has been in that the technologies that we've acquired it's not been the case that we can just push them through our distribution channel and boom -- have them take off. If you look at that period, maybe 2008 to 2010 or 2011, we had a couple of those. Data domain has been one and Isilon being another. I mean these things went from $100 million. I think, it took Isilon seven or eight years to get to $100 million and then inside EMC it took four years to get to $1 billion, right. So that's something that we could put through our distribution channel and it just took off. And even XtremeIO -- you might remember, we had it probably 15, 18 months.</p><p>So, we made the investment right, which was clearly dilutive, but it was 15 or 18 months before we ship the product. Now we're starting to see the pickup, but look let's face it, $500 million run rate in a business overall that's $25 billion, it's still not big enough to move the needle. That said, with XtremeIO, you can clearly see, if we've not made that investment three years ago we'd be where a lot of our traditional storage competitors are today, right. We'd be on the receiving end of a hiding, right, and which wouldn't feel very good. But we're feeling very bullish about the XtremeIO business.</p><p>I make the same statement about DSSD. We haven't disclosed the price, but that was a big investment 18 -- it is going be almost 18 months. It's not unlike XtremeIO before we get any revenue, all right. But we believe it's differentiated. We believe it's one for the future. And as that revenue ramps, you're going to lead to improvements on the bottom line.</p><p>And then you can keep going because I'm just talking about the storage investments there. I mean, ViPR is another one. We've invested big there, really organically building a software defined storage strategy for commodity drives.</p><p>Look at revenues there, it's ramping, it's below [100], but we believe in future that's another one which as the world moves to what's software define on commodity or it moves towards flash, we've got a good play there. And if we were starting today to do that, I think we'd be beat.</p><p>And then Pivotal, that's another big investment. We think the world -- we think new apps are going to be built differently. Everything leads us to believe that we want to have a play in that because the longer term I think the only way you can stop someone like an AWS is maybe not to compete on commodity infrastructure but you've got to build a better platform. I don't believe folks want to be locked into the platform that they're going to use for the next 15, 20 years today. I think if they had a choice they prefer an open platform so it's about they could deploy it on many, many different clouds. So we've invested thinking that that's where the market is going. But again if you look at Pivotal revenue today it's a couple of hundred million dollars because a lot of it's ratable, it's growing at 24%. It's not big enough to move the needle.</p><p>And then look, I can look at VMware and say we've got AirWatch and Nicira software defined network and we think is one for the future. Mobile, we think is big, but again, if you look at the revenue, it's in the $100 million -- hundreds of millions of dollars. It's not quite big enough yet to move the needle. So the macro point is in the last couple of years, I think we've invested ahead of revenue. As you rightly point out that has an impact on margin. But if we start to see a lift off, maybe not even from all of those, but pick three of them, if they lift off anything like XtremeIO a few years from now, I think we stand a good chance of being as relevant to the future as we are today present or past.</p><p>STEVE MILUNOVICH: Yes, my understanding is your CTO who came I think about two years ago found that EMC was spending a fairly low percentage of its budget on emerging technologies and has really shifted it. And apparently you guys even put aside a few hundred million dollars maybe coming into the year to accelerate things that you might buy like DSSD.</p><p>JEREMY BURTON: Yes, I mean, look this is -- every large cap tech company is going through this right now. You've got an existing business that keeps the lights on, pays the rent, generates the cash flows, that's growing slowly. And then you've got new businesses which you hope are going to make you relevant to the future.</p><p>And so do you take money from this business and put at risk to today's revenue and cash flows with the hope that you can make yourself more relevant in future and then how aggressively do you move money around. And so this is one of the things that were pretty maniacal about tracking internally where we've got models that we're using to drive the spend. But I'd tell you in the last three years there's been huge shifts internally towards investing in the XtremeIOs, the DSSDs, the Pivotal, the VCEs over and above our traditional storage platforms that we have today. And by the way it's critical we keep those storage platforms going because we've got some of the world's biggest companies running thousands of workloads on that. That doesn't go away. You got to keep that running and you got to keep innovating. But at the same time, if we don't build something for the future, I think in tech if you're stop investing for some period of time, you never catch up.</p><p>STEVE MILUNOVICH: Great. I think we need to stop there. Jeremy, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>JEREMY BURTON: All right.

All the usual suspects \"\" Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin, Amsterdam \"\" have rushed to make the case for becoming Europe's new banking centre.One of the very first pitches, however, came from a more unlikely source. A week after the referendum, hundreds of UK-based banks, hedge funds and fintech firms received a letter from a Lithuanian poker player-turned MEP.\"You must be thinking about where to relocate your EU operations,\" wrote Antanas Guoga \"\" or Tony G, as he is known at the tables. \"I would like to invite you to explore Vilnius.\" And, for anyone who was unsure where that was, he helpfully added: \"The capital of Lithuania.\"At first glance, a former Soviet city of half a million people in the northeastern corner of Europe seems an unlikely spot for a global financial hub. Yet, as Guoga pointed out, Vilnius has already attracted a clutch of big tech and banking names. Barclays, Danske Bank and Nasdaq have large operations centres there, while Uber chose the city for its first IT development centre outside Silicon Valley.So what does Vilnius have to offer? \"Great prices and great quality of life, together with a multilingual talent hub of hard-working, tech-minded and creative high-achievers,\" according to Guoga.He added: \"Vilnius is open, flexible and business-friendly. We will get you everything you need.\"As a publicity stunt, the letter was highly effective. Journalists desperate for Brexit news were understandably amused by the idea of Vilnius setting itself up as a competitor to London or Frankfurt. But could an obscure Baltic capital live up to the hype? Two months later, Euromoney travelled to Lithuania to find out.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">MEP Antanas Guoga</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>One thing that is immediately apparent from a quick tour of the city is that Guoga's talk about its liveability is justified. Leafy, low-rise and elegant, Vilnius is relatively free from traffic, but packed with hipster coffee shops, bars and high-quality restaurants.English is spoken everywhere and, unlike the other Baltic centres, Riga and Tallinn, there is almost no trace of Lithuania's Soviet past. There is, however, plentiful evidence of Vilnius's recent success in attracting western business. Over the past decade, shiny new glass buildings emblazoned with the logos of global blue chips have sprung up all along the north bank of the narrow Neris River.Easily the most eye-catching of these is Barclays' Lithuanian headquarters, an elliptical 14-storey structure that towers over the sprawling red roofs of its neighbour, the University of Educational Sciences.The UK bank was the first big player to set up in Vilnius, establishing a shared service centre in 2009. At the time, Lithuania was in the middle of a particularly sharp post-financial crisis recession, which saw the economy shrink by nearly 15% in one year. The country was also still off the radar for global firms.Mariano Andrade Gonzalez, chief operating officer of Barclays Lithuania, says this was one of the main factors that attracted the bank to the country.\"We looked at Poland and Ukraine, but we chose Lithuania because of the high quality of the talent pool and the lack of competition,\" he says. \"It was relatively easy to ramp up.\"Barclays has certainly done that. From humble beginnings as a technical support centre for the bank's staff, Vilnius has over the past six years been transformed into one of its key global operations and development hubs.Top choiceToday, the riverside tower and a second location to the northeast of the city centre house dozens of teams covering functions from change management and mobile development to cybersecurity. Since 2014, Vilnius has been designated as one of Barclays' two global human resources hubs, along with Chennai, and one of four global attack monitoring teams is based here.\"We can't show you it,\" says Gediminas Mikaliunas, head of workspace and user experience. \"It's in a secret room on a secret floor.\" Sadly, he appears to be joking.Euromoney does, however, get to see some of the less sensitive parts of Barclays' offices, which in true tech style are lavishly equipped with whiteboards, beanbags and adjustable-height desks. The staff is young \"\" the average age is 29 \"\" and, apparently, hyper-fit. Gonzalez notes proudly that 15% of his employees ran the Vilnius marathon this year. We've never seen in any countries such a push for innovation,\" he says. \"Regulators are usually more like policeman  -Nikolay Storonsky,Revolut Some come from outside Lithuania, but many have been trained up by Barclays, which has worked with local universities to ensure a ready supply of skilled talent for the bank's more rarefied divisions.Vilnius University now offers a masters degree in cybersecurity, thanks in part to Barclays' efforts, and has also helped the bank set up training programmes for mainframe and iOS operating systems. The iOS app for Barclays' Pingit mobile payment system was developed in Vilnius.Mikaliunas says this flexibility is one of the key advantages of working in a small market such as Lithuania: \"You have great collaboration from the government and from the education system, so you can shape the future of the services you want to deliver.\"Barclays is also looking to tap into a growing pool of local fintech talent in Lithuania and its former Soviet neighbours in eastern Europe, including Belarus and Ukraine. In July, the bank chose Vilnius as the location for its seventh Rise centre.Formerly known as Barclays Escalator, Rise is a global network of fintech communities designed to allow the bank to foster development in areas such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, blockchain technology and big data away from the constraints imposed by strict compliance requirements. Other venues are located in New York, London, Manchester, Tel Aviv, Cape Town and Mumbai.\"It's a way for us to engage in a completely different model of innovation,\" says Gonzalez. \"We draw up a list of problems that Barclays wants to resolve in each location, then we approach venture capital firms and ask what they have in their portfolios.\"In Vilnius a top priority is artificial intelligence, which Barclays sees as the future of technical support for its global workforce.\"We are investing heavily in moving from old-style telephony to modern digital channels, from online portals to chatbots and robotic process automation,\" says Mikaliunas.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mariano Andrade Gonzalez, chief operating officer of Barclays Lithuania</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Housed in an airy building just across the river from Barclays' Lithuanian HQ, Rise Vilnius has 50 working spaces, a caf\u00e9 (you can order and pay for your latte in advance on your mobile, naturally) and a conference hall.At the time of Euromoney's visit, the latter is hosting Lithuania's first ever fintech conference. Organized by the central bank and finance ministry, the event includes panels on topics such as payment innovations and blockchain, with speakers from as far afield as Israel and Hong Kong.A highlight of the morning session is the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the central bank and Revolut, a start-up offering cut-price cross-currency transfers and payments. Set up by two former Credit Suisse bankers, the firm is based in London but plans to open a second office in Vilnius.Nikolay Storonsky, CEO and co-founder, says the choice of location was driven partly by the need for an EU base \"\" he is not convinced that the UK will retain passporting rights after Brexit \"\" but mainly by Lithuania's progressive approach to fintech regulation.\"We've never seen in any countries such a push for innovation,\" he says. \"Regulators are usually more like policeman.\"Payments and e-money firms can get licensed in less than three months in Lithuania, much faster than even in other tech-friendly jurisdictions. From January, they will also be able to apply for a restricted banking licence, similar to that introduced in the UK in 2013, which will drastically reduce capital requirements (to as low as \u00e2,\u00ac1 million ($1.07 million)) for firms involved in basic transaction banking.Still more important for Revolut, says Storonsky, is the fact that non-banks in Lithuania can already get direct access to the Single euro payments area (Sepa) infrastructure.\"We're ahead of even the UK on this one,\" says Marius Jurgilas, a board member at the Bank of Lithuania. \"Mark Carney has said they're looking to do this in two years' time.\"Lithuania has also passed laws this year regulating peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding; legislation on remote identification is being prepared. Other fintech-friendly initiatives include the creation of a regulatory sandbox for start-ups, whereby 45 other Lithuanian state institutions \"\" including the tax inspectorate \"\" have agreed to waive sanctions in a firm's first year of supervision.BlockchainPolicymakers are particularly keen to take a lead on blockchain. Local venture capital firm Nextury Ventures hosted a blockchain and bitcoin conference in Vilnius in April, in conjunction with the mayor's office, and Jurgilas says the central bank is in talks with several bitcoin exchanges about the possibility of issuing them with e-money licences.\"They are looking for a regulator who would be willing to give them a stamp of approval,\" he says. \"We understand that we would be sticking our head very high, but we are ready to do that.\"He is eager to stress that the central bank's enthusiasm for innovation is as much about cutting costs for consumers as it is about making life easier for start-ups. Lithuania's banking sector is highly concentrated; three lenders, SEB, Swedbank and DNB account for more than 90% of the market.\"The general perception is that banks are overcharging their clients, so there is huge pressure on politicians and regulators to improve competitiveness,\" says Jurgilas. \"That's why we are keen to embrace fintech.\"<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Marius Jurgilas, a board member at the Bank of Lithuania</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>At the same time the push to liberalize financial regulation is in line with broader efforts to position Lithuania as a business and tech-friendly jurisdiction. A more flexible national labour code was introduced in September, while visa restrictions for skilled workers and start-ups have recently been relaxed as part of a drive to attract tech talent from eastern Europe to Lithuania.Vilnius's mayor, Remigijus Simasius, says the initiative is already showing results: \"Entrepreneurs and IT specialists from Belarus, Ukraine and even Russia are starting to move here.\" He notes that more than two dozen Russian gaming start-ups have set up shop in Vilnius.Daumantas Dvilinskas, head of local payments firm TransferGo, says bringing in talent from outside Lithuania is becoming a priority as more and more companies move to Vilnius.\"The market is getting saturated,\" he says. \"We only have a few thousand people graduating with tech degrees in Lithuania every year, and every firm that comes here wants to hire thousands.\"Recent arrivals such as AIG and Nasdaq, which opened an \"~innovation hub' in Vilnius last year, are ramping up rapidly, while established players such as Barclays, Western Union and Danske Bank also continue to expand. Western Union now employs more than 2,000 staff at its European regional operations centre in the northern Baltupiai district.\"Every company I know that has invested in Lithuania, especially in shared service centres, has exceeded their most optimistic prognosis in terms of expansion,\" says Simasius.NicheDespite these successes it would be hard to say that Vilnius currently qualifies as even a regional financial centre. So, is it really credible to expect UK banks and fintechs fleeing Brexit to relocate en masse to a remote corner of the Baltics?Clearly not, says Bank of Lithuania's Jurgilas.\"We are not dreaming of having the headquarters of Goldman Sachs in Vilnius just because we have some nice parks,\" he says. \"We are fishing at the bottom. We have something to offer in a very specific niche.\"Far from looking to compete directly with London, he sees the UK capital as a key partner for Vilnius in its fintech development drive.\"Seed capital isn't located in Lithuania,\" he says. \"If you want investors, you need to jump on a stage in London.\"This is also the message from Jeremy Browne, a former Liberal Democrat minister in the UK's coalition government, who now holds the thankless post of special representative to the EU for the City of London.In opening remarks to a packed auditorium at the Vilnius fintech conference, he says London's goal is to work with, rather than against, cities such as Vilnius before and after Brexit.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TransferGo: the need for speed</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">The tendency of foreigners to confuse Lithuania and Latvia is a standing joke among locals. For a pair of Lithuanian students, it was also the inspiration for one of the country's most successful start-ups.In 2011, Daumantas Dvilinskas and Justinas Lasevicius were studying in the UK and running a small import-export business. They were using banks for international money transfers, which was expensive and very slow.Then one day, their UK bank mixed up the Lithuanian and Latvian currencies \"\" litas and lats \"\" and sent their cash to the wrong country. To add insult to injury, it refused to compensate them for the mistake. In despair, Lasevicius suggested using his personal accounts in the UK and Lithuania for local transactions and then netting off payments at the end of the day.\"And it worked\" says Dvilinskas. \"The supply chain was happy because we were paying out money in real time and the cost plummeted becausethere were fewer international payments.\"And then the revelation came\"\u00a6\"The result of this eureka moment was TransferGo, a payments firm that uses partner banks in countries across Europe and beyond to provide low-cost, real-time money transfers.\"We call it a local-in, local-out model,\" says Dvilinskas.Fees are based on speed \"\" starting from 99p for next-day delivery \"\" and, for cross-currency transfers, transaction size. For payments over \u00a31,000, the currency conversion fee is 0.4%.Dvilinskas says transfer time is particularly important for the blue-collar migrant workers from central and eastern Europe that make up the firm's core customer base: \"People are willing to pay for speed.\"TransferGo's expansion has been rapid. Four years after launch, the firm is processing 45,000 transactions a month with a value of around \u00a315 million ($18.7 million). It is the market leader for remittances from the UK to the Baltics and in the top five for Poland.\"The beauty of our model is that revenues are very predictable,\" says Dvilinskas. \"Pay-day remitters are like clockwork.\"Surprisingly, he is not dismayed by the Brexit vote.\"There are seven million migrant workers in the UK,\" he says. \"They won't disappear overnight. Maybe in a few years they will reshuffle, but they will be working somewhere.\"In the short term, he adds, the referendum was good for business: \"June and July were record months for us. People were nervous about the pound dropping, so they were sending all their money back home.\"Any adverse effects further down the line should also be diluted by TransferGo's expansion into new global markets. The firm has recently added India, Ukraine and the Philippines to its growing list of transfer destinations, and is targeting Russia and China next.\"We are trying to link up Europe with the major currencies of the world,\" says Dvilinskas.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>\"We're not here to see what we can take from Lithuania,\" he says. \"We want to help you realize your ambitions by providing access to the scale and expertise that London can offer.\"</p><p>Even the ebullient Guoga, who made headlines in July when he applied to run as a pro-European candidate to replace Nigel Farage as leader of Britain's nationalist UK Independence Party, admits that global banks will not be moving their front office staff to Lithuania. \"For now,\" he adds.</p><p>At the same time, he says, the Brexit vote offered a great opportunity to \"reach out and tell people that Vilnius exists, that Barclays is here and is happy, and that we have a lot of smaller companies working in the fintech space\".</p><p>This highlights the fact that the biggest challenge for globally minded policymakers in Lithuania is still the country's international reputation \"\" or, rather, its lack of one. Outside emerging Europe, many people have not heard of Lithuania, and, Guoga notes, those that have often tend to confuse it with Latvia.</p><p>\"When we started thinking about developing a financial hub in Vilnius, we immediately realized that what we've been doing wrong is that no one knows about this opportunity,\" says Jurgilas. \"They don't know that we have such a wealth of tech talent here, that all the innovative payment development IT guys are based here.\"</p><p>As more and more firms move to Vilnius, however, the message is gradually reaching a wider audience. \"The fact that Nasdaq has set up here has really helped with Americans,\" says Guoga. \"Previously they thought Lithuania was a just a backward place somewhere far away that they probably wanted to avoid.\"</p><p>(There is clearly still work to be done on brand recognition in the US \"\" an American tech journalist at the Vilnius conference tells his hosts how delighted he is to be in the Balkans.)</p><p>The famous Brexit letter has also produced results, according to Guoga.</p><p>\"We've had hundreds, thousands of replies,\" he says. \"We even had a response from HSBC.\" He adds that he hopes to bring a \"fairly big\" hedge fund to Vilnius \"fairly soon\".</p><p>He is confident that Lithuania's capital \"\" of which he is chief investment officer \"\" has a very bright future. For fintechs in particular, he insists, Vilnius is \"number one\".</p><p>He says: \"If you are a start-up with 20 staff, and you want to be able to talk to the central bank and compete all over the world from a eurozone country, we are the best place in the world.\"</p><p>Never one to underplay his hand, Guoga adds: \"If we start now and work really hard, maybe in 20 to 25 years we can be half the size of London as a financial city.\"</p><p>It is a bold call, but then again, post-Brexit there is all to play for in Europe. There seems no reason why Vilnius should not be able to take a share of the spoils.</p><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-3605787</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MF0-PVF1-JD1P-T3G0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3065\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"11\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>November 2016</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001ONJ</classCode><className>DANSKE BANK AS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>DANSKE (CPH)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0008X6L</classCode><className>RELOCATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000A0ED</classCode><className>MULTILINGUALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

Stiroh, Executive Vice President</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Introductory Remarks at the GARP Global Risk Forum, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York City As prepared for delivery</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Introduction</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning and welcome to the GARP Global Risk Forum. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been collaborating with GARP on this forum for a decade and it is always a pleasure to participate. This discussion provides real-time insight into critical issues at the center of the practice of risk management.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A quick scan of todays agenda highlights a number of topics of obvious importanceoperational resilience, cyclical aspects of risk management, technology and big data. We are all thinking about these issues, and I look forward to your insights.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Id like to briefly discuss two topics where I expect risk managers will increase their focus in coming yearsclimate change and the cultural aspects of digital transformation. Both issues reflect potentially transformative trends for the economy and the financial system, and I believe they will take an increasing share of your bandwidth over the next decade. In both cases, the relevant questions from a supervisors perspective are: what new risks are introduced? How do firms manage them? And how do supervisors view them?</p><p>Before proceeding, I will emphasize that I am speaking for myself and these views do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.</p><p>Climate</p><p>The U.S. economy has experienced more than $500 billion in direct losses over the last five years due to climate and weather-related events.1 In addition, climate change has significant consequences for the U.S. economy and financial sector through slowing productivity growth, asset revaluations and sectoral reallocations of business activity.2</p><p>For these climate-related risks, a new lexicon has emerged. Physical risk is the potential for losses as climate-related changes disrupt business operations, destroy capital and interrupt economic activity. Transition risk is the potential for losses resulting from a shift toward a lower-carbon economy as policy, consumer sentiment and technological innovations impact the value of certain assets and liabilities. These effects will be felt across business sectors and asset classes, and on the strategies, operations and balance sheets of financial firms.</p><p>Risk managers must be aware of these risks and develop the tools needed to identify, monitor and manage them appropriately. Physical and transition risks may manifest through traditional risk stripes such as credit, market, operational, legal and reputational risk, but todays tools are not necessarily well-suited for the unique challenges associated with climate change. Let me mention three of these challenges.</p><p>First, climate change is a long-term issue where actions today are likely to have an impact over many decades. This exceeds the typical life span of a bank exposure, as well as the typical control and planning horizon of a financial institution. Risk management tools, models and scenarios are not designed to capture the long-term nature of climate-related risks.3 Nonetheless, real impacts are already being felt and we must develop the tools to assess and manage them.</p><p>Second, climate change is complexthe impacts are uncertain, non-linear and hard-to-predict. Trusted credit models, for example, may prove less useful if the historical patterns of the frequency and severity of weather-related shocks become a poor guide to the distribution of future losses. Asset prices may move sharply, and unpredictably, as consensus views change and future impacts are priced today. Moreover, transition risks may stem from second-order, indirect effects like the impact on supply chains, sectoral shifts or worker productivity, which are inherently difficult to model and predict.</p><p>Third, we face significant data gaps. Climate change is a global phenomenon, but risks should be assessed locally, which requires new data such as asset-specific, geo-spatial data. Borrower-specific analysis requires data, for example, on asset utilization and climate effects for particular industries at particular locations. Such granular data is currently limited and requires significant resources to acquire and process, but greater transparency about the physical location of assets will allow institutions to better assess exposures to at-risk borrowers or to specific geographic risks.</p><p>As supervisors, we can consider climate-related risks in terms of both microprudential and macroprudential objectives. To be clear, in my view, supervisors should take a risk management perspective, not a social engineering one. It is beyond our mandate to advocate or provide incentives for a particular transition path. Rather, supervisors should focus on the risks that emerge along the path decided by the public at large and their elected governments. Supervisors can use our tools to ensure financial institutions are prepared for and resilient to all types of relevant risks, including climate-related events.</p><p>To do this, we must continue to invest in research to better understand the economic and financial impact of climate-related events. For example, on Friday, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco will host a conference on the economics of climate change. We can also continue to follow closely and learn from the approaches taken by other central banks, including the use of scenario analysis, stress testing and supervisory expectations to encourage institutions to factor climate risk into their risk management practices. Finally, we can seek to strengthen the data and modeling capabilities we need to assess climate-related risks as part of our forward-looking, data-driven supervision.</p><p>Given the far-reaching impact of climate risk on the structure of the economy and the financial sector, I am confident that risk managers will respond appropriately and firms will continue to build resilience to all risks. GARP, for example, is exploring this and has recently surveyed its members to better understand professional needs for sustainability, climate risk, and ESG integration.4 I am interested to hear from all of you about how your institutions are developing tools and practices to integrate climate risk into your risk management frameworks.</p><p>Innovation and Culture</p><p>It is no surprise to this audience that technological innovation, big data, and advanced analytics are transforming financial services. We can debate where we are on the maturity curve and what innovations are most likely to be transformative, but the direction of travel seems clear. I expect the afternoon session on Technology, Big Data, and the Practice of Risk Management will address core issues such as new approaches for model risk management in a world of widespread artificial intelligence; the inherent challenge of explainability and potential bias in algorithms; the strategic risks from new entrants; and the impact on human capital strategies.</p><p>I want to highlight a complementary, but different issue and focus on how firms manage these changes. More broadly, what type of corporate culture is needed to support a successful digital transformation?</p><p>Over the past five years, the New York Fed has emphasized the importance of a healthy culture to reduce misconduct risk. In addition, I think there is likely a link between a firms culture and its ability to adapt to a changing environment, whether it is technological innovation, demographic change, new business models, or climate change. Firms need a culture that allows change and is resilient to these trends.</p><p>In discussions of the impact of technology on financial services, for example, one extreme view is that new fintech entrantseither smaller start-ups or big-tech firmswill leverage technology and a customer-centric approach to disrupt the industry and outcompete stagnant incumbents, fundamentally transforming the industrial organization of financial services. An alternative, equally extreme view, is that incumbent financial firms with established customer bases, scale, vast quantities of data, and experience working in a regulated environment will disrupt themselves and maintain their central position in finance. The most likely outcome, as is typically the case, is somewhere in the middle, but change seems inevitable.</p><p>If all firms face a strategic imperative to innovate and adapt, a relevant question is what types of firm-specific factors will determine success? Clearly, things like business model, technological expertise, and resources will matter. I think that firm culture will also matter.5 And by culture, I mean the values and shared norms within a group that influence individual behavior, collective decision-making and outcomes.</p><p>As firms innovate and transform how financial services are provided, I expect well see the value of leadership from senior managers and boards as they outline the strategic case for change and exhibit the critical behaviors that promote it. I expect well see the value of innovative environments where employees speak up, both raising new ideas and questioning assumptions. I expect well see the value of cognitive diversity as firms tackle complex problems like a digital transformation from multiple perspectives. I expect well see the value of agility that facilitates product innovation, reprioritization, constructive partnerships, or the successful integration of financial market specialists and technologists. Finally, I expect well see the value of well-crafted incentives where employees are rewarded based on both what they do and how they do it.</p><p>More broadly, I think firms with high levels of cultural capital will be more likely to successfully implement a digital transformation in a sustainable, prudent and responsible manner.6 This is a central question for risk managers and supervisors because the evidence suggests that most large-scale transformations fail.7 Just like firms, investors and supervisors consider execution risk when assessing bank mergers, I expect more attention will focus on culture and the change management risks associated with innovation and digital transformation.</p><p>In my view, the official sector can facilitate this transition. The 2018 guidance on responsible innovation related to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing is a good example.8 Supervisors can also press on the governance and change management framework to promote effective internal oversight. From our perspective, supervisors also need to be nimble and develop the necessary skills to assess innovation as firms transform.</p><p>While a firms culture is not directly observable, I believe this will prove to be a critical part of any change initiative. Technological progress, innovation, and new models of competition are changing the financial industry and there will undoubtedly be winners and losers. Understanding all of the factors that drive successful transformations will be a critical insight for both risk managers and supervisors.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>The financial sector is large, complex and constantly evolving due to a wide range of technological, business, and macro factors. Your job, and ours, is to be vigilant and open-minded in our thinking, constantly questioning our traditional assumptions and scanning the horizon to understand how the risk landscape is changing.</p><p>The topics covered at todays conference are some of the most important risks that the industry faces. Climate change and digital transformation are two powerful trends with the potential to fundamentally change financial services. We all need to be forward-looking and proactive in order to promote our ultimate goal of a safe and sound financial system that supports the sustainable provision of financial services and economic growth.</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p><p>1 NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters (2019), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>2 The Impact of Higher Temperature on Economic Growth, Riccardo Colacito, Bridget Hoffmann, Toan Phan and Tim Sablik, Economic Brief, August 2018, No. 18-08; Climate Change and the Federal Reserve, Glenn Rudebusch, FRBSF Economic Letter, 2019-19, March 25 2019; Fourth National Climate Assessment, Volume II: Impacts, Risks and Adaptation in the United States, U.S. Global Change Research Program.</p><p>3 Mark Carney, Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon Climate Change and Financial Stability, September 29, 2015.</p><p>4 Climate Risk Management at Financial Firms: Challenges and Opportunities, GARP Risk Institute, May 29, 2019; Climate Risk Management at Financial Firms: A Good Start, but More Work to Do, GARP Risk Institute, May 29, 2019.</p><p>5 Were Only Human: Culture and Change Management, James Hennessy, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, September 2019.</p><p>6 Misconduct Risk, Culture, and Supervision, Stephanie Chaly, James Hennessy, Lev Menand, Kevin Stiroh and Joseph Tracy, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, December 2017.</p><p>7 Leading Change: Why Transformation Efforts Fail, John P.

Back then, Microsoft was the only tech group in the world's top 10 companies by market capitalisation. Now, however, tech shares account for seven of the world's top 10 companies.

The equity funds of developing economies have attracted more than US$43 billion of inflows so far this year, roughly the same amount in outflows from US stock funds, according to JPMorgan. This is partly because emerging markets have recently been growing at an even faster pace relative to advanced economies, but also because the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2130443/us-dollar-falls-three-year-low-after-steven-mnuchin-hails-weaker\">dollar has fallen</url> sharply\u00a0- and is expected to remain weak given the weighty speculative bets against it.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2102214/us-tech-stocks-now-reach-chinese-investors-tiger-brokers-mobile-app\">US tech stocks now in reach of Chinese investors with mobile app</url></p><p>According to a market sentiment survey published by DataTrek Research, a US consultancy, on Tuesday, investors believe emerging-market equities are the asset class most likely to outperform this year despite concerns about tech stocks.</p><p>Secondly, and more importantly, mounting strains on emerging-market equities are a blessing in disguise.</p><p>Not only do the recent declines in the stock markets of developing countries stem entirely from external factors, the sell-off began, and is still most apparent, in US equity markets. This is not a home-grown downturn\u00a0- quite the opposite. Investors know this and are therefore likely to continue to perceive emerging markets favourably, at least for the time being.</p><p>More importantly, renewed volatility in equity markets is forcing investors to pay more attention to valuations.</p><p>While US stocks, which have been dangerously overvalued for some time, have become less expensive, emerging-market shares are still significantly cheaper. The so-called forward price-earnings ratio, a popular valuation tool, for the S&amp;P 500 still stands at just below 17, compared with 12 for the MSCI EM index.</p><p>The decoupling thesis may have been flawed, but there is still value in emerging-market shares.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nicholas Spiro is a partner at Lauressa Advisory</emphasis></p><p>Copyright (c) 2018.

Instead of hiring more people, they are turning to automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, digital and broader technology to achieve these goals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the conclusion reached by Michael Page International in its 2020 Guide to Salaries &amp; Skills in South Africa. However, the company has also identified fascinating trends in technology recruitment.</p><p>We have seen an increased need for strong commercial leaders with the capabilities to steer businesses through these challenging economic times, focusing on guiding and leading the workforce, and increasing the bottom, says Paul Newman, associate director of Michael Page South Africa.</p><p>The last year has proven to be challenging for the professional labour market within South Africa, due to various economic and political reasons. The year started cautiously, with the General Elections held on 8 May, and investors adopting a wait and see approach. This has, however, continued with policy uncertainty such as expropriation of land without compensation, underlined by the highest unemployment rate since comparable data was recorded in 2008, peaking at 29.1% in the third quarter of last year.</p><p>Overall, we have seen a decline in demand across most industries within South Africa, with certain industries feeling the impact more than others. Companies are looking for ways to increase output and productivity, while at the same time cutting costs. Therefore, automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, digital and in broader terms, technology is playing a bigger role in achieving the above mentioned goals.</p><p>South Africa is also facing a brain drain of highly skilled labour who are opting to emigrate; this is creating a talent gap in the market, further contributing to the challenges of investing in the economy.</p><p>Newman points out that 2019 will also be fondly remembered by South Africans as the year the Springboks won the 2019 Rugby World Cup and Miss South Africa was crowned Miss Universe.</p><p>There is a renewed sense of hope and achievement spreading across the country. South Africans are resilient and have overcome many challenges in the past. There are some real success stories to celebrate all over the country, from innovative start-ups showing phenomenal growth and a fresh new approach to doing business in Africa, to larger multi-nationals with world-renowned structures and processes continuing to be pillars of the economy.</p><p>Kagiso Rangaka, manager at Michael Page Technology South Africa, says The big incumbent banks have always been heavily invested in technology, but much of this investment had been towards maintaining legacy infrastructure and making incremental change, with limited incentives to disrupt.</p><p>Even efforts that were intended to be disruptive, were often poorly conceptualised and offered more theatrical than bottom-line value. However, this is changing for two key reasons, he says.</p><p>Firstly, a deteriorating economic outlook is forcing incumbents to finally bank the benefits of past digitisation efforts by cutting branches and workforces. This will only be expedited by new investments in robotics that, with little systems impact, automate data entry and checking that was still being done by humans.</p><p>Secondly, new capital, a more open regulatory environment, and customer discontent, has led to the emergence of new entrants that are unconstrained by legacy systems, bloated workforces and inertia. Tyme Bank, Discovery, Yoco and Jumo have been able to leverage new tech and business models from the get-go. Such entrants are forcing incumbents to invest more, and demand more from their tech and innovation efforts. Big bets are being made in innovation processes, cloud and AI.</p><p>Rangaka says bets in innovation processes and collaboration tools should help make available more relevant customer value propositions quicker. Cloud platforms should help incumbents become more agile, in terms of both lower cost scalability as well as in being able to integrate best of breed services and partners.</p><p>The informed application of AI should empower incumbents to better offer the nuanced, personalised experiences that big tech (Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon) has made customers get accustomed to. These bets will all be underpinned by the skills required to secure, manage and optimise networks, especially those in the cloud and new mobile application endpoints.</p><p>These bets are reflected in the skills that companies say they are currently lacking, as well as what they expect to need in future, says Rangaka. As a result, there will be losers as well as winners.</p><p>Mainframe specialists will have to re-tool to develop micro-services. Project managers will have to morph into Scrum masters. Data analysts will have to learn the No-SQL paradigms prevalent in the AI world. Application developers will have to apply their skills to the Internet of Things and mobile. Not everyone will cope.</p><p>Companies will have to mix new recruitment with up-skilling, contracting, off-shoring and fintech partnerships, as skills shortages, increased specialisation and needs volatility may not make full time onboarding practical. 2020 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLDTPT-168833696</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLDTPT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YB9-K411-F11P-X2Y3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411387</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Global Data Point.

Week in Review The House is in recess, set to return to Washington the second week of September. The Senate was in session this week and voted unsuccessfully on Monday to override the President's vetoes of three congressional resolutions blocking emergency weapon sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.Today, the Senate voted 67-28 to pass the Bipartisan Budget Act, sending it to the President for his signature. The President has indicated he intends to sign the two-year budget deal, which also suspends the debt limit until July 31, 2021. The Senate also confirmed David Norquist to be Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kelly Craft to be Ambassador to the United Nations, and a slew of district court nominees this week before wrapping its work and joining the House in recess.Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced[1] the Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology (SMART) Act[2] this week, which aims to ban certain features from social media, including infinite scroll, autoplay, and other additive features that 'exploit the science of addiction to make it difficult to leave a social media platform.'A number of lawmakers have announced in recent days that they do not plan to seek reelection in 2020, including House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Michael Conway (R-TX) and Reps. </p><p>Paul Mitchell (R-MI), Pete Olson (R-TX), and Martha Roby (R-AL). House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Rob Bishop (R-UT) also confirmed that he will retire.President Trump announced on Sunday his intention to nominate Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) to succeed former Senator Dan Coats as Director of National Intelligence. On Monday, the President signed the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund reauthorization into law during a White House ceremony with first responders and on Tuesday he traveled to Williamsburg, Virginia to mark the 400th anniversary of the First Representative Legislative Assembly. President Khaltmaagiin Battulga of Mongolia visited the White House on Wednesday for a bilateral meeting.Elsewhere, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer spent the week in Shanghai for bilateral US-China trade negotiations. The President also announced on Wednesday that he will nominate Jovita Carranza to be Administrator of the Small Business Administration.On Tuesday, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) published a Federal Register notice[3] announcing the comment period for its proposal to create a pilot program within the Universal Service Fund (USF) to support connected care for low-income Americans and veterans. Comments are due by August 29 and reply comments are due by September 30. For more on the Connected Care pilot program, click here[4]. Looking Ahead The House and Senate will be in recess until the second week in September. Senate Appropriations Chairman Shelby (R-AL) will set FY20 spending allocations during the recess in anticipation of subcommittee markups beginning shortly after lawmakers return to Washington and the first full Committee markup set for September 12. Shelby has suggested that he will prioritize the Energy-Water, Labor-Health and Human Services, and Defense bills. The Senate can also be expected to move ahead with Gene Scalia's nomination to succeed former Secretary Alex Acosta at the Department of Labor.The President and First Lady will mark the 80th anniversary of the beginning of World War II on September 1 in Warsaw before traveling to Denmark for bilateral meetings. President Trump will also host Australian Prime Minister Morrison on September 20 for a state visit. Gosar Introduces Bill to Reform Section 230 Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) recently introduced[5] legislation to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The Stop the Censorship Act[6] would 'revoke the unprecedented and unwarranted immunities given to Big Tech for the censorship of 'objectionable' content but retains immunities when acting in good faith to remove unlawful material or when providing users the option to filter.'Gosar argues that the legislation is necessary because technology platforms 'police political speech' and that the immunity provided by Section 230 should be limited to 'good faith efforts to remove actual unlawful content.' Reps. Mark Meadows (R-NC), Steve King (R-IA), and Ralph Norman (R-SC) are original cosponsors with Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL) signing on this week. Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced legislation to reform Section 230 in June, calling the safe harbor a 'sweetheart deal.' Hawley's Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act[7] requires large technology companies to 'submit to an external audit that proves by clear and convincing evidence that their algorithms and content-removal practices are politically neutral.' Senate EPW Committee Advances Surface Transportation Reauthorization with AV Amendment as NHTSA Extends Comment Deadline for AV ANPRM On Monday, Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman John Barrasso (R-WY) and Ranking Member Tom Carper (D-DE) unveiled a five-year, $287 billion surface transportation reauthorization bill, the America's Transportation Infrastructure Act[8], in anticipation of current authorities expiring in September 2020. For the first time, the bill includes a climate change title, which among other provisions, authorizes $1 billion for electric, hydrogen, and natural gas vehicle charging and fueling infrastructure. The bill also authorizes $12.5 million annually for a nationwide vehicle miles traveled (VMT) pilot program.The Committee advanced the bill on Tuesday morning 21-0 after adopting several amendments, including an amendment[9] offered by Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) directing the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) to conduct a study to better understand the impacts of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies on existing and future transportation systems and assess the steps that should be taken to improve safety and mobility, alleviate congestion, and protect the environment. Carper voiced support for the amendment, noting that the Committee should play a leading role in AV deployment policy. It is now up to the Senate Finance Committee to propose mechanisms to pay for the underlying legislation, which President Trump tweeted support for ahead of the markup.Meanwhile, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) extended[10] the comment deadline this week for its Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on Removing Regulatory Barriers for Vehicles with Automated Driving Systems[11]. Comments were originally due by July 29, but NHTSA will now accept feedback through August 28. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) similarly extended[12] through August 28 the comment deadline for its ANPRM on Safe Integration of Automated Driving Systems-Equipped Commercial Motor Vehicles[13]. President Trump Threatens 'Reciprocal Action' as France Implements Digital Services Tax Shortly after French President Emmanuel Macron signed France's new digital services tax into law on July 25, President Trump tweeted that the United States will 'announce a substantial reciprocal action,' suggesting potential tariffs on French wine. French Agriculture Minister Didier Guillaume said Tuesday that the digital services tax and a potential tariff on a foreign exchange of goods like wine are 'completely different,' but that France would 'try to negotiate' with the United States, echoing comments French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maine made over the weekend at G7 leaders prepare to meet in Biarritz, France at the end of the month. Negotiators are aiming to reach international consensus on digital services taxes through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) by the end of 2020, which would prompt France to withdraw its national tax.The new French law levies a 3% tax on revenue collected in France by technology firms with more than \u20ac750 million in global revenue and \u20ac25 million in revenue in France. The Office of the US Trade Representative announced[14] on July 10 that it has opened an investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 into France's digital services tax, which the United States argues disproportionately impacts American companies. FCC Advances Rural Broadband Rulemaking Today, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved during its July Open Commission Meeting a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking[15] to establish the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. The proposal would allocate $20.4 billion to expand high-speed broadband in rural America over the next decade. The fund would build upon the Connect America Fund (CAF) Phase II auction launched in July 2018, under which 103 bidders were awarded over $1.4 billion in universal service support over ten years to build high-speed broadband service to over 700,000 households and small businesses in 45 states. Under the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund proposed rulemaking, the FCC would conduct a multi-round auction under which internet providers would compete for subsidies, with priority given to faster services with lower latency. The proposal would increase the minimum broadband speed requirement from 10/1 megabits per second (Mbps) to 25/3 Mbps.During the Open Meeting, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and Republican Commissioners Michael O'Rielly and Brendan Carr voiced support for the rulemaking, lauding the proposal for advancing rural broadband deployment. While supporting the underlying mission of the rulemaking, Democratic Commissioners Jessica Rosenworcel and Geoffrey Starks raised concerns with the proposed minimum broadband speed requirement, as well as the accuracy of the data and mapping used by the FCC to determine unserved and underserved communities. Rosenworcel argued that the new 25/3 Mbps minimum will not reflect increasing broadband speed capabilities when deployment efforts enabled through the auction are underway. Starks stated that by advancing the proposed rulemaking despite inaccuracies in broadband data and mapping, the FCC 'is choosing speed to auction over accuracy.\"The FCC considered a number of other proceedings[16] during the meeting, including new improvements to broadband coverage data collection, changes to licensing procedures for small satellites, and reforms to the Rural Health Care Program.

Week in Review The Department of Transportation is seeking comments[1] on 'projects, issues or topics' that it should consider through the Non-Traditional and Emerging Transportation Technology Council, which was created in April of 2019 to address regulatory gaps associated with the industry. Comments will be accepted until January 10.Julius Knapp, chief of the Office of Engineering and Technology at the FCC announced his retirement last week effective January 3, 2020. Knapp, an over 45-year veteran of the agency, led the Office of Engineering and Technology for more than a dozen years. Previously, he led the Policy and Rules division and the FCC laboratory. </p><p>In a statement, Chairman Pai wrote: 'Julie Knapp is an FCC institution, and I will miss him for his expertise, his leadership, and his friendship.'On Tuesday, Stephen Hahn, President Trump's pick to lead the FDA, advanced through the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on a bipartisan basis with a vote of 18-5. Senator Alexander anticipates a full senate vote will occur by the end of the year.The Small UAV Coalition, Drone Alliance Europe, Global UTM Association, and UAV DACH released a joint statement on Thursday regarding U-Space. The statement says the group 'fully endorses the EASA objectives set forth in its U-Space services draft opinion,' and a full copy of the release can be found here[2]. Looking Ahead Prime Minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, comes to the White HouseOn January 7th, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic, will come to Washington, DC to meet with President Trump. In a statement[3], the White House said the visit will 'celebrate the strong economic, security, and cultural ties between the United States and Greece' and that 'President Trump will also emphasize the importance of telecommunications security, especially related to 5G.' Senate Commerce Committee Holds Hearing on Data Privacy Bills On Wednesday, The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee held a hearing on legislative proposals regarding consumer data privacy. The hearing comes on the heels of a congressional report suggesting the need for increased technological expertise on congressional committees and also follows the release on November 26th of ranking Democrat Maria Cantwell's (D-WA) privacy bill. Cantwell's bill, titled the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA), offers many of the same consumer protections as Chairman Roger Wicker's (R-MS) draft legislation but differs in a few key areas. The biggest differences surround a private right to action and state preemption. The Democrats' proposal would provide individuals with the right to sue entities they feel have violated the act, while Wicker's would prohibit such action. In addition, Wicker's bill would preempt all state laws, regardless of their strength, while Cantwell's would allow state regulations to remain in place if they provide stronger protections to individuals than federal law.Five data experts spanning academia and business testified before the committee. They agreed that consumers should have more control over their personal data but differed on issues regarding third-party access to data and whether to permit private rights of action. The witnesses agreed the FTC is the right agency for enforcement of any new privacy law but all recognized it does not have sufficient resources currently. They therefore recommended that the Commission hire hundreds of new employees to work on privacy and urged Congress to give it rule-making authority and first-time violation fining authority. They also all agreed that empowering states attorneys general would enhance the FTC enforcement gap. Speaker Pelosi Moves to Have Legal Protection for Online Content Taken Out of USMCA As Congress continues to negotiate the final language of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the Trump Administration's proposed replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is reportedly pushing to cut protections to large technology companies. The issue relates to Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which gives online platforms legal protection regarding harmful content that may be published on their websites. Similar language was to be included in USMCA.Technology companies wanted to keep the language in the agreement, as doing so would expand their protections across the continent. However, Democrats are wary of including it out of fear doing so may prevent them from making changes in the future. Section 230 has become increasingly controversial in recent years, as Democrats and Republicans heighten their scrutiny of technology and social media companies. In August, Representatives Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and Greg Walden (R-OR), Chairman and Ranking Member of the Energy and Commerce Committee respectively, sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer calling the inclusion of language similar to that of Section 230 in trade agreements 'inappropriate.' It is unlikely though that Pelosi will receive widespread support from Republicans on the issue, given the president's desire to fast track approval of the agreement. FCC Makes Rural High-Speed Internet a Priority In a study released in December of 2018, Microsoft researchers suggested that high-speed internet access has been significantly overstated. While the FCC claimed that broadband was unavailable to almost 25 million Americans, the Microsoft study suggested the number was closer to 163 million. These findings caused the FCC to reconsider the issue, conducting speed tests across the country. Their and Microsoft's findings are in part what is driving the Commission to take action to ensure not only that their data is more accurate, but that more Americans have access to broadband internet speeds. In order to make this happen, the Commission has announced the creation of a new nine billion dollar 5G fund that will help carriers invest in rural areas with limited or slow internet access. The fund replaces the existing 4G LTE fund and will disburse its resources over the next ten years. Autonomous Vehicles Get Big Push from Diverse Coalition A coalition made of disability rights advocates, senior citizens, environmental groups, and automotive and technology companies is calling for federal action on autonomous vehicles. At the moment, the issue has been left to the states, which has been problematic for the industry as it tries to test and build software designed to revolutionize the transportation industry. The group, named the Coalition for Future Mobility, is lobbying congress to build a national strategy that will not stymie innovation but rather provide a cohesive regulatory framework that assures passengers' safety and creates a clear path to the mass deployment of autonomous vehicles.

Week in Review On Monday, the House passed H.R. 4753[1], the Drone Origin Security Enhancement Act. The bill prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from acquiring or operating foreign manufactured unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), or UAS with certain parts manufactured overseas. Also on Monday, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) proposed[2] to make the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) part of the Department of Justice (DOJ) under one Senate-confirmed Director, rather than five commissioners, reporting to the Associate Attorney General. </p><p>Hawley's proposal focuses on 'Big Tech' oversight and would give the new entity authority to enforce rules requiring interoperability, data portability, and data minimization.House Republicans have named Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) the new ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. He succeeds Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA), who is stepping aside as he pursues a bid for the Senate. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) will replace Jordan as the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee.President Trump released his FY21 budget proposal on Monday, proposing sweeping cuts to federal spending. Several House and Senate committees are holding hearings on the FY21 budget this week as Congress prepares to begin the appropriations process. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi (R-WY) said this week that he will not hold a hearing on the President's budget request, calling it an 'exercise' to which Congress pays little attention. See below for additional details on the budget proposal as it pertains to emerging technologies.On Wednesday, the President signed an Executive Order[3] on Strengthening Resilience through Responsible Use of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Services (PNT) directing the federal government to develop guidance to mitigate the risks of disruption to critical infrastructure that rely on PNT services. The order responds to concerns about U.S. adversaries hacking global navigation satellite systems. President Trump and First Lady Melanie Trump also hosted President Lenin Moreno Garcs and First Lady Rocio Gonzlez de Moreno of the Republic of Ecuador to the White House.The Department of Justice hosted a workshop on Wednesday at Stanford University on venture capital and antitrust. In opening remarks[4], Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim called the event 'part of our on-going effort at the Department of Justice to understand the competitive conditions under which online platforms operate.' He also observed that venture capitalist and antitrust enforcers 'share similar values' when it comes to dynamic competition, investment, and disruption.On Wednesday, Senators Merkley and Booker introduced the Ethical Use of Facial Recognition Act[5], which would temporarily prohibit the federal government from using facial recognition software. The bill would also bar state and local governments from using federal funds to implement such technology. After 18 months, a commission established by the bill would provide recommendations to congress on how the government should use and regulate facial recognition software.On Thursday, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) released a bill[6] that would overhaul the way the government regulates privacy. The bill, titled the Data Protection Act, would create a new Data Protection Agency, where consumers could file data malpractice complaints against companies. The agency would be responsible for investigating complaints and inflicting penalties if wrongdoing is found.The House adopted a resolution[7] to remove the deadline for ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). Senators Ben Cardin (D-MD) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) have offered a Senate companion resolution[8]. Supporters have renewed their efforts since Virginia ratified the ERA earlier this year.Last Friday, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra released revised regulations regarding the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in response to comments received on the initial proposal. The public may comment on the modified regulations until February 25. Looking Ahead The House and Senate will be in recess next week coinciding with Presidents' Day.On February 19, the Department of Justice will hold a workshop on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act titled 'Section 230 - Nurturing Innovation or Fostering Unaccountability?.'The President and First Lady will travel to India on February 24 and 25. President Trump and Prime Minister Modi are expected to celebrate a new US-India trade agreement during the visit. On April 21, the President and First Lady will host King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain at the White House for a state visit. House Energy and Commerce Holds AV Hearing, Releases More Draft Legislative Text On Tuesday, the House Energy and Commerce Consumer Protection and Commerce held a hearing to discuss the future of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the United States. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle shared the desire to work together to pass legislation that establishes safety standards and regulations for the gradual deployment of self-driving vehicles while retaining the country's competitive edge in the global market.Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Pallone (D-NJ) emphasized the importance of self-driving vehicles being safe and reliable in order to receive public acceptance. He highlighted that troubling safety incidents, regulatory black holes, and lax oversight threaten to disrupt the critical balance and the future of the technology itself. Ranking Member Rodgers (R-WA) warned that the United States is falling behind China and losing the global race in AV deployment. Safety advocates, trial lawyers, and local officials spoke in support of Congress empowering regulators at the National Highway Traffic Administration to require companies to provide more data from AVs such as collision reporting. Trial lawyers expressed their desire to exclude forced arbitration rules that could prevent riders from bringing injury claims against AV manufacturers.Following months of bipartisan and bicameral negotiations, seven new sections of a draft AV bill were released on Wednesday. The sections cover cybersecurity, consumer education, inoperative controls, appropriations, personnel and staffing, crash data, and the exclusion of trucks. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee Begins Series of Hearings on DCMA The Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Intellectual Property held a hearing on Tuesday to discuss the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA). Senators and panelists discussed the original purpose of the DCMA and what reforms may be needed to bring it into the 21st Century. President Clinton signed the DCMA in 1998 and its original intent was to protect content creators from online counterfeiting. Critics have argued that the bill is outdated, impedes fair use of content on the internet, and limits innovation. Lawmakers are currently examining whether to reform the bill, scrap it, or leave it as it is written.During the hearing, panelists noted that the bill's reach was further than intended and that it was even impacting groups like farmers and automakers. In addition, panelists criticized the courts' interpretation of the bill, which some think has put too much burden on copyright holders and not enough on platforms and internet providers. When asked how to improve the bill, panelists suggested red flag provisions need to be reformed and the government needs to increase antitrust enforcement in the copyright and telecommunications industries. President's Budget Request Prioritizes AI, Other Technology Investment President Trump's $4.8 trillion fiscal 2021 budget request released on Monday would cut spending at all but five of the Cabinet-level departments and major agencies in keeping with the administration's intent to limit the federal bureaucracy. However, it includes significant funding increases for research and development in emerging technologies. While the request is largely a wish list for Congress, which will write and vote on its own budget, the proposal provides insight into the administration's policy and spending priorities.The President's budget also reflects a prioritization of scientific research seen as crucial to international competition and security by requesting a significant funding boost[9] for critical emerging areas including artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing. In fact, it proposes doubling the nondefense AI spending budget from about $973 million to almost $2 billion. This boost is in keeping with the administration's American AI Initiative[10] launched last month and actions to increase funding for quantum computing and communications through the National Quantum Initiative Act.Overall, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) did not request significant changes to funding or staffing. Representing a modest increase of 1.5 percent, it proposes a $134.5 million increase for spectrum auction authority from the current year. Similarly, the Department of Commerce requests an additional $25 million to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to modernize spectrum management systems and accommodate for more advanced technologies. The budget proposes doubling AI funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to 'accelerate the development and adoption of interoperable, secure, and reliable AI technologies and resilient position, navigation and timing systems, and support a prominent U.S. role in standards development efforts for 5G.'The Department of Defense 2021 budget request includes the largest research funding request in more than 70 years, including $7 billion in investments in four emerging technology areas it deems Advanced Capabilities Enablers (ACEs), including hypersonics, AI, 5G, and autonomous platforms.Reflecting its seriousness about pending investigations into tech giants, the Department of Justice (DOJ) requests a steep 71 percent increase in congressional spending on the Department's antitrust division and an additional 87 staffers to address the increase in workload. Coronavirus Hits Tech Hard Technology is central to discussions about the spread and impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic. For good or evil, not only have emerging technologies like AI played an increasingly prominent role in monitoring and tracking the illness, but China has even deployed technologies like drones to enforce the wearing of face masks to contain it. Meanwhile, the preponderance of face masks has presented new challenges for government surveillance and the spread of the virus has even been said to have led to delays in China's installation of 5G base stations. Furthermore, while the Internet has been the source of helpful information, statistics and instructions, it has also been used to spread misinformation, rumors and conspiracies.Coronavirus repercussions highlight China's outsized role in the technology manufacturing sector, as the China trade wars did before the virus tightened its grip. Recent factory shutdowns expose supply chain vulnerabilities as technology companies that rely upon products manufactured or sold in China fear production shortages, launch delays and suspensions in shipping. The outbreak caused major tech players to withdraw from Europe's biggest telecommunications conference, the Mobile World Congress, ultimately leading to its cancellation altogether. The conference is typically a launching ground for new technology, and this year 5G was expected to be center stage.Few if any industries are proving immune to the effects of the virus. With flights and cruises grounded, and hotel reservations canceled, the global tourism, travel, logistics, retail and aviation industries are all grappling with the financial impact of COVID-19. The full impact remains to be seen with untold billions of dollars in the balance.  AB 5 Litigation Developments On February 10, a U.S. District Court Judge denied a motion for preliminary injunction filed by Uber, Postmates, and two individuals.The plaintiffs sued California challenging AB 5 as a violation of several provisions in the United States and California Constitutions. The judge determined that plaintiffs did not have a likelihood of success on the merits of any of their claims and held that their claim of irreparable injury was belied by the assertion by Uber and Postmates that their drivers are independent contractors even under the Dynamex standard codified in AB 5.Also on February 10, in the lawsuit filed by the California Trucking Association, the court took two additional actions. First, the court denied the International Brotherhood of Teamstersmotion for a stay of the injunction pending appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. Second, the court dismissed two of the three legal challenges to AB 5.The court held that the dormant Commerce Clause is not available in light of the enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994, which was the basis for the court's issuance of the preliminary injunction. The court also held that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's opinion preempting California's meal and rest break rules was not enforceable in court because that statute does not create a private right of action.

Senate Democrats continued to block action on a Middle East policy bill, but a privileged motion offered by Minority Leader Schumer (D-NY) to disapprove the Trump administration's decision to lift certain Russia sanctions moved forward with bipartisan support. Senate Republicans are attending the conference's retreat today at Nationals Park. House Democrats continue to bring up and pass spending bills to reopen the government that to date have failed to move the needle in the Senate, where Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) has said he will not bring up any spending bills that the President will veto because they do not include $5 billion to build a border wall. </p><p>Meanwhile, Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) wrote to President Trump this week suggesting that due to security concerns generated by the shutdown, the State of the Union address scheduled for January 29 be postponed or delivered in writing. Today, the President responded with a letter to Pelosi cancelling a congressional trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan and suggesting that time would be better spent in Washington. The Senate Judiciary Committee convened for this first time this Congress under the new leadership of Chairman Graham (R-SC) to hold confirmation hearings for William Barr, the President's nominee to succeed former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. See below for more details on the hearings. The Environment and Public Works Committee also held a confirmation hearing for Andrew Wheeler, who the President nominated to replace former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt. Wheeler has been leading the EPA in an acting capacity since former Pruitt resigned.Looking AheadThe House and the Senate are both amending plans to recess next week around Martin Luther King Day amid the ongoing shutdown and are scheduled to spend at least part of the week in Washington. Senate Democrats will hold their retreat at the end of the month.Gregory Guice Joins MWC Federal Public Affairs TeamMcGuireWoods Consulting announced this week that Gregory Guice has joined McGuireWoods Consulting as a senior vice president on the firm's federal public affairs team and senior counsel with McGuireWoods LLP. Guice adds significant depth to McGuireWoods Consulting's capabilities in telecommunications, data privacy and emerging technologies. He joins MWC from Akin Gump Strauss Hauer ...ld, where he served as senior counsel focusing on legislative and regulatory matters in the telecommunications and information technology sectors. He has significant experience handling matters related to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles, universal service, broadband connectivity and affordability, spectrum issues, artificial intelligence, and competition policy, among others. Prior to joining Akin Gump, Guice served as director of the Office of Legislative Affairs for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), as well as counsel to the Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and as a regulatory attorney in the Wireline Competition Bureau and Wireless Telecommunications Bureau. An experienced lobbyist and attorney, Guice offers clients a unique perspective on matters before the U.S. Congress, FCC, Federal Trade Commission, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, Rural Utilities Service, and Department of Transportation.

The Chairman detailed the Committee's restructured slate of subcommittees:Senator John Thune (R-SD), who chaired the full Committee in the last Congress but relinquished his gavel to join Republican leadership, will chair the Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet. His successor, Chairman Wicker (R-MS), chaired the Subcommittee in the last Congress. Thune will continue to focus on 5G and broadband deployment in his new role. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) will helm the newly organized Subcommittee on Aviation and Space, which merges the jurisdiction of the former Subcommittee on Aviation Operations, Safety, and Security and Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness). Senator Blunt (R-MO) chaired the Aviation Subcommittee in the last Congress. The Subcommittee is likely to focus on a NASA reauthorization. Senator Fischer (R-NE) will continue to chair the Subcommittee on Transportation and Safety, formerly the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure, Safety, and Security. Senator Moran (R-KS) keeps the gavel on the Subcommittee on Manufacturing, Trade, and Consumer Protection, formerly the Subcommittee on formerly Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security. Senator Sullivan (R-AK) chairs the new Subcommittee on Security, which will focus on issues at the intersection of economic and national security, including drone security and cybersecurity. Senator Gardner (R-CO) chairs the Subcommittee on Science, Oceans, Fisheries, and Weather. Senator Sullivan chaired the Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, and Coast Guard in the last Congress.Democrats have not yet finalized ranking members. On the other side of the Capitol, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and Ranking Member Greg Walden (R-OR) announced subcommittee leaders:Subcommittee on Communications and Technology: Chairman Doyle (D-PA) and Ranking Member Latta (R-OH) Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce: Chairman Schakowsky (D-IL) and Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) Subcommittee on Energy: Chairman Rush (D-IL) and Ranking Member Upton (R-MI) Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change: Chairman Tonko (D-NY) and Ranking Member Shimkus (R-IL) Subcommittee on Health: Chairman Eshoo (D-CA) and Ranking Member Burgess (R-TX) Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations: Chairman DeGette (D-CO) and Ranking Member Guthrie (R-KY).Walden also announced that Rep. Gianforte (R-MT) is joining the Committee. Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) previously announced that Reps. Barragan (D-CA), Blunt Rochester (D-DE), Kelly (D-IL), Kuster (D-NH), McEachin (D-VA), O'Halleran (D-AZ), Soto (D-FL), and Veasey (D-TX) would join the roster.Draft Drone Operations Over People Rule Subject to Yet-to-be-Released Remote Identification RulemakingOn Monday, the Department of Transportation made public two draft FAA proceedings related to drone operations, including a long-awaited notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to authorize certain commercial operations over people. However, the NPRM makes clear what the commercial drone industry has long understood - that the FAA will not promulgate a final rule until it finalizes a remote identification rulemaking, a proposal for which has yet to be released. The NPRM would also allow for flights at night. Both types of operations are currently permitted only by waiver under Part 107 and while the FAA has granted over 2,000 nighttime waivers, only two dozen operators have been authorized to fly over people. The draft NPRM proposes three categories for operations over people based on level of risk. A draft advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) released alongside the draft NPRM seeks public comment on potential rulemaking activity related to safe and secure small drone operations and seeks input on stand-off distance requirements, additional performance-based limitations beyond those mandated by Part 107 (i.e., altitude and airspeed), additional payload restrictions beyond those already in place, and critical system design requirements (i.e., redundancy). The ANPRM also seeks comments on how an unmanned traffic management (UTM) system should be implemented, noting that the FAA is currently working with NASA on a congressionally mandated UTM pilot program that is intended to provide data to inform an implementation plan. Neither draft proceeding has been published for comment.DOJ Expands Scope of Wire Act to Limit Online GamingIn a November 2, 2018 opinion[2] released this week, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) announced changes to broaden the department's interpretation of the Wire Act[3], legislation passed in 1961 to prohibit the operation of certain types of interstate betting businesses in the US. The newly released document reverses a 2011 OLC opinion limiting the ban to online gambling on 'sporting events or contests.' Instead, the 2018 opinion extends the prohibition to all forms of interstate gambling, including online gambling and online lotteries. Shortly after its release, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein issued a memo[4] setting a 90-day grace period for during which federal prosecutors are advised not to apply the Wire Act to non-sports-related betting or wagering. 'This 90-day grace period will allow anyone affected to review the opinion and bring their gambling-related operations into compliance, if necessary,' the DOJ stated in an adjoining press release[5]. In anticipation of varying interpretations of the November 2 opinion, the Department will require any Wire Act charges to be reviewed by the Criminal Division's Organized Crime and Gang Section.Senate Judiciary Committee Holds Hearings for U.S. Attorney General Nominee William BarrThis week, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a two-day series of hearings to consider the nomination of William Barr to serve as Attorney General of the United States. Barr previously served in the same capacity under the late President George H.W. Bush. On Tuesday, members of the Committee focused the majority of questions on issues related to government ethics and the Mueller investigation. Lawmakers were especially interested in discussing the intentions and impetus for the unsolicited memo Barr sent to the Department of Justice (DOJ) in June 2018. The following day, members questioned a panel of witnesses on a variety of issues, ranging from criminal justice reform and the public defender system to gun safety and voter suppression/election reform. Several senators expressed concerns related to antitrust law. Senator Lee (R-UT), Chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, asked Barr to comment on whether the scope of antitrust law should be expanded to address issues related to social harms or control company size. Barr emphasized the importance of maintaining a narrow application of antitrust law. He provided a similar response to Senator Hawley (R-MO) when asked whether the DOJ has authority to address alleged biases in content filtering practices by companies such as Facebook and other dominant digital platforms. Senator Blackburn (R-TN) joined Hawley in criticizing technology companies' business practices. They argued that the platforms have violated consumer protections and encouraged Barr take a more proactive approach to oversight if confirmed. Barr committed to reviewing these issues and agreed that the Department should be more engaged in oversight and merger reviews. Of note, Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) asked panelists on Wednesday to comment on the DOJ's role in overseeing big tech platforms and various edge providers with regard to their failure to protect consumer data as well as alleged anticompetitive behavior. She also emphasized that biases in content curation can only be resolved through a multifaceted strategy that includes partnerships with state AGs, as well as strong enforcement by the DOJ Consumer Protection Bureau and Antitrust Division. The Committee has not yet scheduled a vote on Barr's nomination, which at this point Senate Minority Leader Schumer (D-NY) opposes because of what he called unsatisfying answers about Barr's stance on interfering in the Mueller investigation.

A Technology-Focused Week in Review Amidst frenzied efforts to enact a COVID-19 relief bill to extend unemployment benefits during global pandemic and address issues such as state and local funding needs, PPE and testing needs nationwide and liability protections for employers, Congress briefly turned its attention to the technology sector. In two hearings in particular, Congress set its sights on scrutinizing whether this critical sector of our economy has sufficient competition or is dominated by a few key companies and whether statutory protections that have allowed the sector to offer consumers a diverse array of content should remain intact or if they are in need of updating.The Antitrust Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee held its sixth hearing in its series 'Online Platforms and Market Power,' but it was the first time it heard directly from the CEOs of the four largest technology companies: Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook. For more than five hours, the Antitrust Subcommittee members probed questions on the role of these companies in today's economy and whether they have used their position in the market to further extend their market power. </p><p>The areas of concern range from online search and advertising, app store policies for developers, and e-commerce. Content moderation focused on political speech and alleged bias against conservative voices was also an issue of debate at the hearing. The law under which these and other online companies moderate their content, Section 230, was the subject of a Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing earlier in the week, in which Chairman Thune (R-SD) and Ranking Member Schatz (D-HI) heard from expert witnesses on whether Section 230 should be updated to reflect current market conditions.Meanwhile, the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) sent a petition for rulemaking to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) asking the FCC to seek public comment on rules to constrain the applicability of Section 230. The NTIA petition was prepared pursuant to President Trump's Executive Order[1] issued on May 28, 2020 and seeks the adoption of regulations by the FCC to define certain statutory terms and clarify what practices are outside the scope of Section 230's liability protections. Technology CEOs Testify at House Antitrust Hearing The House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee hearing on July 29 represented the culmination of a more than year-long investigation into certain business practices of online platforms to determine whether they have exercised their market power in a way that is anticompetitive. For the sixth in its series of hearings, the Subcommittee called on the CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google. As in the previous hearings, Wednesday's panel touched on the exercise of market power and the effects it may have on competition, innovation, data privacy, small and independent business development, and journalism online.At the core of the hearing was whether Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple are using their status in the market to harm competition in ways that violate antitrust law. In his opening statement[2], Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-RI) called the companies 'critical arteries' of commerce and communications, but also characterized them as 'emperors of the online economy,' whose business practices have an excessive impact on economic growth and democracy. Ranking Member Sensenbrenner (R-WI) stated in his opening remarks that while 'being big is not inherently bad' he 'share[s] the concern that market dominance in the digital space is ripe for abuse.'Lawmakers provided context for their allegations of market abuse gleaned from their investigation, citing emails and other internal communications obtained as part of its investigation as well as reports from businesses that had provided additional information on their experiences in working with the platforms. Members, such as Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), pressed a number of the companies on whether they used the data collected from competitors that use their platforms to develop competing products. Rep. Neguse (D-CO) followed up on this point asking Apple and Google, in particular, if they would commit to updating their app developer policies to make clear they will not take such steps.In questions regarding market share in online advertising, Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) and Jayapal pressed Google in particular on its role on all sides of the advertisement exchange market, noting that the company had between 50-60 percent of the market.A handful of lawmakers also concentrated their attention on the potential gatekeeper and toll-taking action of mobile device app stores. Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA) highlighted concerns the Committee had heard related to search manipulation, prioritization, demonetization, and delisting. Chairman Nadler (D-NJ) and Reps. Val Demings (D-FL) and Joe Neguse (D-CO) questioned whether suspension and removal policies were being used as tools to advantage the app store-owned apps over independent apps. Lawmakers also probed the issue of commissions charged by app stores.A number of Republican members raised concerns about the content moderation practices of the companies and whether there is bias against conservative speech online. Rep. Gaetz (R-FL) and Steube (R-FL) raised the issue with the companies and alleged there was ongoing bias against conservative viewpoints. Rep. Raskin (D-MD) responded to the assertions noting that if these companies were censoring conservative speech 'they were doing a lousy job of it.' Senate Commerce Committee holds a Hearing on the PACT Act as calls for Section 230 Reform Grow On July 28, the Senate Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and Innovation held a hearing examining the PACT Act[3], a bill to reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act introduced by Subcommittee Chairman John Thune (R-SD) and Ranking Member Brian Schatz (D-HI). In his opening statement, Chairman Thune said that the PACT Act would enable greater transparency and accountability online without destroying the entrepreneurial benefits of Section 230. Ranking Member Schatz expressed similar sentiments. In addition to discussing the bill and reforms to Section 230, Senators also raised issues relating to election interference, government censorship, and the EARN IT Act, among other topics.The hearing comes as debates over Section 230 rage throughout Washington. Earlier this month, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously passed the EARN IT Act[4], to limit platforms' Section 230 immunity in relation to child sexual abuse material. In addition, this week Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced the Behavioral Advertising Decisions Are Downgrading Services (BAD ADS) Act[5] to revoke Section 230 immunity for platforms that display advertisements based on 'personal traits of the user.' Additionally, this week, the Department of Commerce filed a petition[6] with the Federal Communications Commission asking it to propose rules to narrow the scope of Section 230. The move follows an executive order signed by President Trump that takes aim at social media platforms, which he and other Republicans allege are biased against conservative voices. Yesterday, Rep. Gosar (R-AZ) and a number of other House Republicans introduced the Stop the Censorship Act[7], to address this perceived bias by revoking Section 230 immunity for the removal of lawful speech. The bill is unlikely to receive a vote in the House.

Week in Review Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in Washington today for separate meetings with the President, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) that will primarily focus on the proposed US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement.With just a handful of legislative days remaining before the July 4 recess, the Senate continued to process pending judicial and executive branch nominations this week, including Sean Cairncross' nomination to be CEO of the Millennium Challenge Corporation. In the meantime, the President announced on Tuesday that Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan would withdraw his nomination to serve in that role in a permanent capacity and that Army Secretary Mark Esper would replace him as Acting Secretary.On the other side of Capitol Hill, the House voted 226-203 on Wednesday to pass its first FY20 minibus, a package of appropriations bills. It then turned to a second minibus comprised of the Commerce-Justice-Science, Agriculture-Rural Development-FDA, Interior-Environment, Military Construction-Veterans Affairs, and Transportation-Housing and Urban Development bills, as well as nearly 300 amendments. </p><p>Lawmakers will vote later today on amendments to the Commerce-Justice-Science division.Before leaving Washington last week, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) cosponsored Senator Josh Hawley's (R-MO) Do Not Track Act[1], which previously drew support from Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). Nearly two dozen Senate Democrats also introduced a bill[2] led by Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) to prohibit the distribution of 3D printer plans for printing firearms.23 House Democrats also wrote to Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan this week to express concerns about Customs and Border Protection using facial recognition technology. The lawmakers specifically cited reports of false matches and algorithmic bias, as recently discussed during a pair of House Oversight Committee hearings on ensuring transparency in government use of the technology.This week, Reps. Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Thomas Suozzi (D-NY) and Senators Ben Cardin (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Bob Menendez (D-NJ) introduced companion bills[3] to compel states to require vehicles operating through a ride-hailing platform to display an illuminated sign displaying the company's logo, as well as to adhere to specific vehicle inspection requirements. H.R. 3262 also requires ride-hailing platforms to implement a system by which riders can electronically verify a driver's identity, including placing a machine-readable code or label in the vehicle's window that a rider can scan using her or her mobile phone or other device.This morning, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and Ranking Member Greg Walden (R-OR) announced a bipartisan deal on legislation to combat illegal robocalls. The Communications and Technology Subcommittee will markup the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act[4] next week.Reps. Tim Walberg (R-MI) and Yvette Clarke (D-NY) introduced the TOWER Infrastructure Deployment Act[5] this week, a bill aimed at building a workforce equipped to support deployment of new communications technologies. At the outset, the legislation establishes a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) advisory council to examine industry needs as it transitions to technologies including 5G, next-generation broadband, and next-generation television.The FCC also announced[6] this week that it is seeking nominations for a new Precision Ag Connectivity Task Force in accordance with the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018. The Task Force will advise the FCC and Department of Agriculture on steps that should be taken to expand access to broadband for agricultural purposes. Nominations are due by July 17. Looking Ahead With one week remaining before the July 4 recess - and the August recess just around the corner - congressional leaders continue to negotiate towards a budget agreement. The House will resume consideration of its second FY20 minibus next week, but has postponed any consideration of its FY20 Homeland Security funding bill until after the recess. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has also teed up the FY20 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for floor consideration, as well as several privileged Arms Sales Resolutions of Disapproval. Senate Commerce Subcommittee Convenes Drone Security Hearing On Tuesday, the Senate Commerce Security Subcommittee convened a hearing[7] entitled 'Drone Security: Enhancing Innovation and Mitigating Supply Chain Risks.' Representatives from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), University of Alaska Fairbanks, Massachusetts Port Authority, National Defense University, and the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) shared their perspectives on security considerations related to US drone integration efforts. Much of the discussion focused on issues related to privacy and cybersecurity, with several members of the Subcommittee raising concerns with national security threats posed by the use of Chinese-manufactured UAS. Additionally, Subcommittee Members pressed the FAA witness on ongoing delays of the remote identification rulemaking process, reflecting lawmakers' dissatisfaction with the current timeline.In her opening remarks, FAA Deputy Associate Administrator for the Office of Security and Hazardous Materials Angela Stubblefield characterized remote identification as a crucial stepping-stone for unmanned traffic management (UTM) development and deployment, adding that the technology will ultimately enable expanded safe and secure low altitude UAS operations. Despite these references, Ranking Member Markey (D-MA) and Senator Blumenthal (D-CT) raised concerns the delayed FAA UAS remote identification rulemaking process, referencing the July 2018 deadline for publication of a remote ID rule established in the 2016 FAA extension. The most recent Unified Agenda suggests that the FAA plans to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking this September. Hawley Introduces Plan to Amend Section 230 On Wednesday, Senator Hawley (R-MO) introduced the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act[8], the first substantial action in the 116th Congress aimed at updating the Communications Decency Act (CDA). 'There's a growing list of evidence that shows big tech companies making editorial decisions to censor viewpoints they disagree with. Even worse, the entire process is shrouded in secrecy because these companies refuse to make their protocols public,' Hawley stated[9]. The Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act removes the automatic immunity under Section 230 of the CDA for large technology companies. The bill defines covered entities as companies with more than 30 million active monthly users in the US, more than 300 million active monthly users worldwide, or that have more than $500 million in global annual revenue. The bill allows covered entities to earn immunity by conducting external audits, proving to the FTC through clear evidence that their algorithms and content-removal practices are politically neutral. Companies would also be required to reapply for immunity every two years.Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), who co-authored Section 230 and has remained a staunch opponent to calls for reforming the provision, criticized the legislation. 'Senator Hawley has written a bill to deputize the federal government as the Speech Police in flagrant violation of the First Amendment,' Wyden tweeted[10] on Wednesday. 'CDA 230 lets private companies take down inappropriate third-party posts without incurring liability. It's designed to protect companies from floods of lawsuits, the sort that kill innovation in its infancy.' The bill has also garnered criticism from several trade associations within the technology industry. Senate Commerce Committee Discusses Surface Transportation Reauthorization On Wednesday, the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing[11] entitled 'FAST Act Reauthorization: Transportation ...fety Issues'. The witnesses featured senior officials from the Department of Transportation modal agencies including the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Witnesses and committee members alike expressed a common concern with improving safety in transportation while simultaneously promoting innovation. Both Chairman Wicker (R-MS) and Ranking Member Cantwell (D-WA) joined colleagues in expressing support for bipartisan action on a long-term reauthorization of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act.Lawmakers also discussed issues related to the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Senator Schatz (D-HI) asked Acting NHTSA Administrator Heidi King explain why the Administration has not mandated auto manufacturers to adopt new autonomous technologies that have the potential to improve roadway safety, such as lane departure warnings and automatic emergency braking. Ms. King explained that mandated technologies require rigorous test procedures for standardization, and that implementing this would eliminate the learning period in which manufacturer competition improves the technologies. Senator Blackburn (R-TN) also expressed interest in learning more about NHTSA's efforts to promote AV standards. Public safety was the top priority for all members, although the Committee failed to reach consensus as to whether stronger safety regulations or deregulation to promote innovation would be best to protect the public. USTR Holds Hearings on Proposed Tariffs on Chinese Products This week, the US Trade Representative's Office launched a two-week long series of hearings on proposed tariffs on Chinese-made goods under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. The newly proposed measure - which would apply to roughly $300 billion in goods - would impose 25 percent tariffs on a wide range of commodities, including Chinese-made 5G equipment and cellphones. The proposed tariffs have generated strong push back from a range of tech industry representatives, who argue the provisions would stifle innovation and harm business. \"[The proposed tariffs] would cause direct, additional harm to U.S. consumers, cost U.S. jobs, and undermine U.S. technology companies in the intense competition for global leadership,\" ITI argued in comments[12] filed with USTR.A number of technology industry stakeholders will testify during the hearings, including representatives from Roku, VeriFone, Fitbit, and Sony Interactive Entertainment as well as a number of tech trade associations. The fate of the tariffs remains unclear as President Trump prepares to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a G-20 meeting in Japan at the end of the month. Congressman Collins Appointed Co-Chair of Congressional Internet Caucus On Tuesday, Rep. Eshoo (D-CA) announced[13] that House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Collins (R-GA) will serve as the Republican co-chair of the Congressional Internet Caucus, succeeding former Rep. Goodlatte (R-VA), who he also succeeded as the top Republican on House Judiciary. Collins joins Rep. Eshoo and Senators Thune (R-SD) and Leahy (D-VT) in leading the bicameral caucus, which aims to provide a neutral forum for analysis and debate of current technology policy issues. Previously, the Congressional Internet Caucus has hosted seminars discussing the impact of consumer data privacy laws in the U.S. and the EU, as well as briefings on blockchain technology and online sales tax. 'I'm thrilled to have [Rep. Collins] join me as the new Co-Chair of the Congressional Internet Caucus. We're committed to ensuring Members of Congress and their staff are educated about the promise and potential of the internet,' Rep. Eshoo tweeted[14]. FCC to Vote on 2.5GHz Spectrum at its July Open Meeting On June 19, the Federal Communications Commission announced the agenda for its upcoming July 10 Open Meeting. Among the items the Commission will consider is a Report and Order[15] that addresses changes to the regulatory framework governing the 2.5 GHz band (2496-2690 MHz), which the Commission notes is 'the single largest band of contiguous spectrum below 3 gigahertz.' Over the last twenty years this spectrum, designated for uses that include educational broadband service, has been underutilized. The Commission's vote in July will switch this spectrum from its current specific uses to flexible use licensed spectrum that can be used to promote the availability of 5G and other high-speed, mobile broadband services. To promote mobile broadband services on Tribal lands, the Order adopts a Tribal priority window to enable Tribal nations an opportunity to obtain 2.5 GHz licenses to provide service on rural Tribal lands. Following the closure of the Tribal priority window there will be a system of competitive bidding for the remaining available spectrum.

Coronavirus ResponseThe Latest White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro said this week that President Trump 'is very interested in something on the order of at least $2 trillion' for the next coronavirus response package. The statement is at odds with Senate Majority Leader McConnell's (R-KY) previous assertions that a Phase 4 package should come in at no more than $1 trillion. In contrast, the House Democrats' HEROES Act is approximately $3 trillion.Congressional Republicans have generally maintained that existing relief programs need more time to take effect before moving ahead with a Phase 4. In recent days, the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration (SBA) published two new Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) interim final rules (IFRs), available here[1] and here[2], to make revisions to the first PPP interim final rule[3] to conform with the PPP Flexibility Act. </p><p>Another new IFR[4] makes revisions to the program's third and sixth IFRs. SBA also updated the borrower application[5] and the lender application[6] and published a new EZ loan forgiveness application[7] (with instructions[8]) and a new standard loan forgiveness application[9] (with instructions[10]). Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston also announced[11] that the Main Street Lending Program Lender Portal[12] is open and the Federal Reserve announced it is seeking public comment on its proposal to expand the Main Street Lending Program to provide access to credit for nonprofit organizations.On Capitol Hill, congressional committees continued to hold COVID-19 oversight hearings focused on a range of topics, including the impact on public education[13], the impact on Sub-Saharan Africa[14], how bad actors are exploiting the financial system[15], how the Department of Homeland Security can safely resume operations[16], telehealth[17], the PPP[18], racial and ethnic health disparities[19], international pandemic preparedness[20], tax relief[21], resuming air travel[22], and jobs and unemployment[23]. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources[24] and House Energy and Commerce[25] Committees also held hearings on the impact of COVID-19 on the energy industry and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified before the Senate Banking[26] and House Financial Services[27] Committees on the semiannual Monetary Report to Congress.Elsewhere, the President and federal agencies continue to take other steps to respond to the outbreak, including, but not limited to: Vice President Pence held a briefing[28] with governors and the White House Coronavirus Task Force on COVID-19 response and recovery with a focus on supporting small businesses and workforce development. The Vice President also published an op-ed[29] in the Wall Street Journal entitled, 'There Isn't a Coronavirus Second Wave' in which he discusses the Administration's efforts related to testing, PPE distribution, and vaccine development. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a fact sheet[30] on Operation Warp Speed, which aims to deliver 300 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine by January 2021. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released[31] consolidated recommendations[32] for COVID-19 testing, including interim testing guidelines for nursing home residents and healthcare personnel, as well as testing strategy options for high-density critical infrastructure workplaces after a COVID-19 case is identified. The recommendations compile and update previous testing guidance. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revoked[33] emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. FDA Chief Scientist Denise Hinton wrote that studies indicate the drugs 'are unlikely to produce an antiviral effect' to treat coronavirus. The Department of Labor (DOL) issued[34] programmatic guidance[35] to help ensure the accuracy of unemployment claims made due to implementation of the CARES Act. A draft Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) policy statement[36] provided guidance regarding the Commission's response to the effects of the COVID-19 national emergency on oil pipelines.A complete overview of both congressional and Administrative response efforts is available here[37] and updated daily. What's Next Next week, House and Senate committees have more coronavirus oversight hearings scheduled to examine inequities in education, health, and the workforce[38], preparing for the next pandemic[39], the Trump Administration's response to the pandemic[40], health and wealth inequality[41], capital markets and emergency lending[42], and insuring against a pandemic[43]. Relevant ResourcesIn Other NewsSection 230 Under Fire Again on Both Sides of the Aisle With social media companies like Twitter and Facebook in disagreement over the role they should play in fact-checking the President, halting the spread of fake news, or combating violent extremism, a number of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are once again taking aim at Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law, which shields online platforms from liability for the third-party content posted on their sites, has taken heat from Republicans, who claim companies like Facebook and Twitter demonstrate an anti-conservative bias, and Democrats, who assert these same platforms proliferate fake news and provide a venue for dangerous ideologies to flourish. In the case of Facebook, the platform decided not to censor controversial advertisements from President Trump's reelection campaign, leading former Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to urge his supporters to sign an open letter[44] to CEO Mark Zuckerberg demanding he remove misleading content, including political ads, and draft rules to prevent bad actors from using the site to spread fake news. Similarly, Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) recently derided technology platforms for their 'complete failure to fight the spread of disinformation,' and Rep. Schakowsky (D-IL), who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, is preparing to release a bill that would reform Section 230 and address issues of election misinformation.On the Republican side, after Twitter fact-checked a number of his tweets last month, President Trump signed an Executive Order taking aim at the platform and Section 230. The Order labels fact-checking as editorial conduct outside the scope of the law and prohibits the federal government from advertising on platforms that breach Section 230's editorial conduct restrictions. It also allows the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state attorneys general to investigate violators' behavior. Senator Hawley (R-MO), a vocal critic of Big Tech, sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey saying, 'Twitter's decision to affix its own editorial content to users' posts brings into question the basis' for its Section 230 immunity. On Wednesday, Hawley introduced the Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act[45] 'to employer Americans to sue Big Tech companies who act in bath faith by selectively censoring political speech and hiding content created by their competitors.' Senators Rubio (R-FL), Braun (R-IN), Cotton (R-AR), and Loeffler (R-GA) cosponsored the legislation.Finally, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced the results[46] of its Section 230 analysis and four areas 'ripe for reform,' including 1) incentivizing online platforms to address illicit content; 2) clarifying federal government enforcement capabilities to address unlawful content; 3) promoting competition; and 4) promoting open discourse and greater transparency. Any legislative proposal would require Congressional action and it seems unlikely that DOJ's recommendations will garner bipartisan support. Senator Blumenthal (D-CT), a vocal Section 230 critic, panned[47] the proposal. Momentum Grows for Regulating Facial Recognition Technology In the wake of nationwide protests against police brutality, several companies have started distancing themselves from facial recognition technology, while simultaneously stepping up pressure on Congress to take action to curtail law enforcement's use of it. In steady succession over the past week and a half, high profile tech companies have made public statements about dialing back, or in some cases, ceasing the sale of facial recognition software to police at the state and local level. On June 8, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna sent a letter[48] to Congress which said the company will end its facial recognition business and that 'national policy should encourage and advance uses of technology that bring greater transparency and accountability to policing.' On June 10, Amazon announced[49] a one year moratorium on the sale of its facial recognition technology, Rekognition, to police, and stated that it hopes this pause allows Congress enough time to implement 'appropriate rules' to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology moving forward. The following day, Microsoft President Brad Smith announced[50] that the company would no longer sell its facial recognition technology to police until 'there is a national law in place, grounded in human rights, that will govern this technology.'In Congress, where there is increasing bipartisan criticism of facial recognition technology, there is no federal law on the books clarifying rules for its application. This is despite several laws proposed and debated in the past year alone. Civil liberties groups have long decried algorithms used by facial recognition software for built-in biases against people of color and women, a topic which has received considerable attention during Congressional hearings. Another key concern has been how to strike the right balance between protecting consumer privacy without stifling technological innovation in areas where facial recognition technology has the opportunity to enrich daily lives. According to Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), the House Oversight and Reform Committee is poised to reintroduce a facial recognition bill in the coming weeks that will once again try to tackle thorny issues driving the debate.

It also proposes a 9% cut to all non-defense programs, including a $845 billion cut to Medicare. Over the coming weeks, Cabinet secretaries and agency heads will testify in support of the request before the House and Senate Appropriations Committees and the various authorizing committees, but Congress will craft and pass its own spending bills. The President and Congress are marking St. Patrick's Day today. This morning, the President welcomed Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar to the White House before they attended the annual Friends of Ireland luncheon at the Capitol. The Senate spent the early part of the week on executive branch and judicial nominations before taking up a resolution on Wednesday to withdraw US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The resolution passed 54-46 and is likely to result in the President's first veto. Earlier today, the Senate also voted 59-41 to adopt a House-passed resolution to end the President's emergency declaration to direct funds to build a border wall. That resolution is also expected to draw a veto that Congress does not have the votes to override, likely sending the issue to the courts. In the meantime, the House voted 420-0 this morning to approve a non-binding resolution to publicly release the Mueller report. Four Republican members voted present. This week, Senators Portman (R-OH) and Heinrich (D-NM) officially launched[1] the Senate Artificial Intelligence (AI) Caucus with Senators Schatz (D-HI), Gardner (R-CO), Peters (D-MI), and Ernst (R-IA) as founding members. The Caucus will foster dialogue between lawmakers and the executive branch, industry, and academia to develop 'policy that balances AI's risks and rewards to ensure the competitiveness of the U.S. economy, while maintaining important ethical standards.' Senators Thune (R-SD) and Wyden (D-OR) and Reps. Cohen (D-TN) and Ratcliffe (R-TX) reintroduced[2] The Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act (S. 765[3] and H.R.[4] 1725[5]) on Wednesday to prevent digital goods and services such as movies, apps, and music from double or discriminatory taxation not applied to tangible goods. Bipartisan, bicameral lawmakers introduced[6] legislation this week aimed at alleviating the skills gap in the technology sector by providing federal grants to state tech associations and other industry intermediaries to develop apprenticeships. The Championing Apprenticeships for New Careers and Employees in Technology (CHANCE in Tech) Act (S. 777[7] and H.R.[8] 1733[9]) is sponsored by Senators Gardner (R-CO), Heinrich (D-NM), Markey (D-MA), and Moran (R-KS) and Reps. Moulton (D-MA) and Herrera Beutler (R-WA).Looking AheadThe House and Senate will both recess next week. Looking ahead, the Senate is expected to vote later this month on a $13.6 billion disaster aid package. Leader McConnell (R-KY) is also planning a messaging vote on a New Green Deal resolution. Appropriations and authorizing committees in both the House and the Senate will also hold FY20 budget hearings over the coming weeks to hear from Cabinet secretaries and agency heads on the President's budget request and policy priorities.Senators Unveil Bipartisan Bill Aimed at Improving Privacy Protection for ChildrenAs lawmakers continue to discuss the components of a federal privacy bill, several members are introducing separate provisions that target specific issues within the scope of consumer privacy. This week, Senators Markey (D-MA) and Hawley (R-MO) introduced legislation[10] to expand online privacy rules for children. The bill updates the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and includes five key provisions that impact digital platforms:Prohibits the collection of personal and location information from children under 13 without parental consent Prohibits the collection of personal and location information from 13 to 15-year-olds unless the platform receives user consent Establishes an 'Eraser Button' to allow parents and children to delete a child's personal information Outlines a 'Digital Marketing Bill of Rights for Minors' to limit the collection of personal information Creates a Youth Privacy and Marketing Division at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to address children's privacy and marketing practices targeted at minorsBoth sponsors have historically taken hardline approaches to oversight of technology companies. Senator Markey, an original author of COPPA, indicated last Congress that he planned to introduce a bill that would update the existing law. Before being elected to the Senate in 2018, Senator Hawley gained recognition as Missouri Attorney General for investigating dominant digital platforms. 'Big tech companies know too much about our kids...It's time to hold them accountable. Congress needs to get serious about keeping our children's information safe, and it begins with safeguarding their digital footprint online,' Hawley remarked in a press[11] release[12]. Already, the Markey-Hawley bill has gained support from stakeholders such as Color of Change, Common Sense Media, and the Campaign for Commercial-Free Children.Senate Judiciary Committee Wades Into Federal Privacy DebateOn Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee convened a hearing[13] entitled 'GDPR ...PA: Opt-ins, Consumer Control, and the Impact on Competition and Innovation' featuring two panel discussions consisting of company, think tank, and consumer advocacy organization representatives. Dialogue largely focused on developing a federal privacy framework that establishes adequate consumer data protections without stifling innovation or negatively impacting small- and medium-sized businesses. Notably, a number of Members, including Sen. Hawley (R-MO), harshly criticized tech platform business practices, raising concerns with the lack of transparency around the collection, use, and sharing of consumer data. In response, DuckDuckGo CEO and Founder Gabriel Weinberg and Mapbox Policy Lead Tom Lee argued that companies can responsibly use consumer data or not collect consumer data at all and still be profitable. During the hearing, Members and witnesses alike shared thoughts on both the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), arguably the nation's most comprehensive privacy law to date. During the first panel, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) asked witnesses to comment on how lawmakers can make a federal privacy framework stronger than CCPA. Californians for Consumer Privacy Chairman and CCPA champion Alastair Mactaggart explained that unlike the California law, a federal framework could include a whistleblower provision and strong FTC enforcement mechanisms. Google Senior Policy Counsel Will DeVries argued there are important fixes to be made to CCPA that can be translated to a federal framework. During the second panel, American Enterprise Institute Visiting Scholar Roslyn Layton cautioned against adopting a framework similar to GDPR, which she argued has hindered economic growth. Instead, Ms. Layton urged policymakers to support technology-based privacy solutions. Congressional committees in both chambers are in the midst of a series of hearings that will undoubtedly inform efforts to introduce consumer privacy proposals in both the House and Senate. Sen. Blumenthal, along with Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Wicker (R-MS) and Senators Moran (R-KS) and Schatz (D-HI), have convened a working group to develop federal legislation, which they are expected to release in the coming months.House Subcommittee Examines Drones, Urban Air Mobility, and the Future of AviationOn Tuesday, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Aviation held a hearing to examine the future of aviation and technologies ranging from unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), or drones, to urban air mobility and supersonic flight. NASA and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) testified alongside representatives from these industries. Subcommittee members on both sides of the aisle focused on the stalled Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rulemaking for remote identification of drones. While the FAA was not present to speak to the delay, Diana Cooper, representing UAS company PrecisionHawk, noted that industry and other stakeholders participated in an Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC) that delivered recommendations to the FAA in October 2017. Subcommittee Chairman Larsen (D-WA) was among those concerned about the delay and indicated he would follow up with the FAA. Uber Elevate's Dr. Eric Allison provided testimony on Uber's plans to operate ride-sharing in the air, often called urban air mobility. Dr. Allison explained that industry needs a clear pathway to the certification and approvals necessary to operate in urban environments. He added that creating skyports in metropolitan areas is critical and would necessarily involve local real estate interests. He responded to a question on whether urban air mobility would be a luxury available only to the wealthy by stating Uber Elevate's goal of making this transportation option both affordable and attractive to all urban commuters. Dr. Allison agreed with the importance of an unmanned traffic management (UTM) system, noting that Uber Elevate is participating in the FAA's UAS Integration Pilot Program (IPP) with the City of San Diego.European Commission Selects Single Protocol for Vehicle Connectivity Instead of Taking Flexible ApproachOn March 13, the European Commission (EC) adopted a Delegated[14] Act[15] outlining regulations for Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) technology, which will establish rules for vehicle-to-infrastructure, vehicle, and pedestrians (V2X) communications. While there are competing protocols seeking to deliver these communications, the EC decided to select the Wi-Fi protocol over the C-V2X protocol designed to work with future 5G networks. The Delegated Act includes a review provision that could be used to allow technologies like C-V2X to be incorporated into C-ITS at a later date, a provision Commissioner for Mobility and Transport Violeta Bulc noted in releasing the Delegated Act. In her statement, Commissioner Bulc described the decision as 'giv[ing] vehicle manufacturers, road operators and others the long-awaited legal certainty needed to start large-scale deployment of C-ITS services across Europe, while remaining open to new technology and market developments.' A number of proponents of 5G technology, however, are concerned that the loss of flexibility in the protocol for developing C-ITS will have the effect of locking out other technologies from the transportation sector and noted that the decision at odds with recent budgetary developments by the European Parliament and Council to promote 5G infrastructure investments[16] in the transportation and energy sector. As such, they have urged the European Parliament and Council to reject[17] the proposal. A two-month review process is now underway during which the European Parliament and the European Council have an opportunity to oppose the Delegated Act from taking effect.

Week in Review With lawmakers scheduled to leave Washington tomorrow for a week-long Memorial Day recess, congressional leaders are still negotiating a disaster aid package in hopes of sending it to the President for his signature tomorrow. Outside of those negotiations, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) continued to process pending nominations this week as the President sent a dozen more judicial nominees to the Senate. Earlier today, the Senate passed the TRACED Act in a 97-1 vote. </p><p>The bill, introduced by Senators Thune (R-SD) and Markey (D-MA), aims to curb abusive robocalls.This week, Senators Burr (R-NC) and Manchin (D-WV) cosponsored the Social Media Privacy Protection and Consumer Rights Act[1], legislation Senators Klobuchar (D-MN) and Kennedy (R-LA) introduced[2] earlier this year aimed at improving transparency and giving consumers more recourse in cases of data breaches. Rep. DelBene (D-OR) also continues to build support among her Democratic colleagues for her Information Transparency ...rsonal Data Control Act[3], with Reps. Spanberger (D-VA) and Larsen (D-WA) signing on this week.The House Appropriations Committee continued to make progress on its FY20 spending bills this week, including its nearly $74 billion Commerce-Science-Justice (CJS) bill[4], which funds the Department of Commerce, NASA, and the National Science Foundation, among other agencies.During the first of two House Oversight and Reform Committee hearings[5] Wednesday on facial recognition technology, Chairman Cummings (D-MD) indicated his panel will hold its second hearing in June and that he plans to introduce legislation to impose a moratorium on government use of the technology until there are mechanisms in place to address privacy and other concerns. Meanwhile, the Senate Commerce Committee postponed a hearing this week on 'Optimizing for Engagement: Understanding the Use of Persuasive Technology on Internet Platforms' due to a Senate-wide briefing on Iran. A new date has yet to be announced.The New Democrat Coalition Technology Task Force released its mission statement[6] for the 116th Congress this week, underscoring a commitment to 'ensure that every American has the opportunity to benefit from the economic opportunities and advancement of our technology without sacrificing basic consumer protections and privacy.' Reps. Soto (D-FL), Davids (D-KS), Horn (D-OK), and Rouda (D-CA) co-chair the Task Force, which plans to develop near- and long-term policy proposals informed by stakeholder input. Looking Ahead The President will arrive in Tokyo this weekend, where he will meet the country's new emperor and hold trade talks with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Congress will be in recess next week and will return to Washington the first week of June. Looking ahead, the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation and House Energy and Commerce Committees are both planning hearings on the media marketplace in early June as they look to reauthorize STELA before it expires at the end of the year.In addition to prioritizing nominations, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) will also move to bring the FY20 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to the floor in the coming weeks after the Senate Armed Services Committee approved its bill authorizing $750 billion this morning on a 25-2 vote. The House Armed Services Committee will begin marking up its bill the first week of June. Senate Judiciary Committee Scrutinizes Privacy and Competition in Digital Advertising The Senate Judiciary Committee convened a hearing[7] this week on 'Understanding the Digital Advertising Ecosystem and the Impact of Data Privacy and Competition Policy.' Discussion spanned a variety of topics, ranging from concerns with consolidation in the digital advertising market and alleged discriminatory content filtering to consumer privacy and the development of a federal privacy framework. While there was disagreement amongst panelists as to the threat posed by the growing dominance of online platforms like Facebook and Google, all agreed on the importance of a federal consumer privacy framework that prevents a patchwork of inconsistent state laws.In addition to discussion of a federal consumer privacy framework, several Committee members questioned panelists on behavioral advertising and potential government oversight of related business practices. Specifically, Chairman Graham (R-SC) asked whether policymakers should regulate contextual and behavioral advertising differently. Yale School of Management's Professor Fiona Scott Morton argued that policymakers should focus instead on antitrust concerns more broadly and work to safeguard market competition. Meanwhile, Senator Hawley (R-MO) expressed doubts as to the societal benefits of behavioral advertising, arguing that companies are spending money on high-priced ads rather than investing in improvements to their underlying product. Professor Scott Morton agreed, arguing that increased spending on advertising has resulted in lower quality digital content.Additionally, Committee members referenced the European Union's \u20ac2.42 billion fine levied[8] in June 2017 against Google after an investigation concluded that the company promoted its own comparison shopping service in search engine results to the detriment of competitors. Senator Blackburn (R-TN) asked Professor Scott Morton to comment on search result manipulation practices and their impact on competition and market access for startup companies. Professor Scott Morton stated that these practices have an adverse impact on companies like TripAdvisor and Yelp, adding that consumers will often not search beyond the top results when using an online search engine. Hawley Introduces Data Privacy Legislation On Monday, Senator Hawley (R-MO) introduced the Do Not Track Act to allow consumers to prevent online platforms from collecting data beyond what's needed to fulfill company services. The legislation is similar to the national Do Not Call list and would also prohibit companies from profiling or discriminating against users who choose to activate the Do Not Track program. In a press release[9], Senator Hawley stated that 'big tech companies collect incredible amounts of deeply personal, private data from people without giving them the option to meaningfully consent. They have gotten incredibly rich by employing creepy surveillance tactics on their users, but too often the extent of this data extraction is only known after a tech company irresponsibly handles the data and leaks it all over the internet. The American people didn't sign up for this, so I'm introducing this legislation to finally give them control over their personal information online.' The bill gives consumers several options for enrollment, including settings for internet browsers and mobile applications. Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Feinstein (D-CA) signed on as a cosponsor yesterday. FAA Announces New Drone Advisory Committee Members, Next Meeting This week, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced that PrecisionHawk CEO Michael Chasen will chair the Drone Advisory Committee (DAC), a federal advisory committee tasked with advising the FAA on its unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) integration efforts. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao also appointed 12 new members to the Committee selected from over 200 applicants that responded to a December solicitation for nominations. DAC members represent both the manned and unmanned aviation communities, as well as academia, local government, labor, and other stakeholders. The DAC will next meet on June 6 in Arlington, Virginia immediately following the FAA's fourth annual UAS Symposium June 3-5 in Baltimore.In the meantime, OMB published its Spring Unified Agenda this week, which again delays the expected date by which the FAA plans to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for remotely identifying drones from July to September.

Senate Artificial Intelligence Caucus Leaders Propose National AI Strategy and $2.2 Billion R...nvestment This week, Senate AI Caucus co-chairs Senators Heinrich (D-NM) and Portman (R-OH), together with Senate Commerce Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet Subcommittee Ranking Member Schatz (D-HI), introduced[11] the bipartisan Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act (AI-IA). The legislation directs the development of a national strategy for artificial intelligence investment and deployment through a new National AI Coordination Office, an AI Interagency Committee, and an AI Advisory Committee comprised of non-governmental subject matter experts. The AI-IA would also establish dedicated AI initiatives within the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST), National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Department of Energy (DOE). Further, the legislation would allocate $2.2 billion in federal funding over five years to support AI research and development, as well as to build an AI-ready workforce.In introducing the legislation, both Senators Heinrich and Portman underscored the importance of addressing growing threats from other nations seeking to eclipse U.S. leadership in AI technology. 'Right now, China is engaging in a full court press to unseat the United States' dominance in AI. By coordinating and synchronizing our country's research and development efforts, this bill ensures not just that the United States remains an AI leader, but that it does so by developing AI technology that prioritizes American values,' Portman stated. '...the gap is closing quickly, and the United States will only continue its leadership position if it acts with a sense of urgency and purpose,' Heinrich added.The bill comes days before a May 30 NIST workshop[12] coordinated to advance development of a plan for federal engagement in artificial intelligence standards. The workshop coincides with a NIST request for information[13] (RFI) announced May 1 soliciting feedback to inform the development of technical standards and related tools to advance 'reliable, robust, and trustworthy systems that use AI technologies.' FCC to Consider New Rules to Support Aviation Safety and Innovation In recognition of a need to update its aviation spectrum technical and service rules to accommodate new innovations, the Federal Communications Commission will vote on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking[14] (NPRM) at its June 6 Open Meeting. The draft NPRM seeks comment on a number of issues including allocation of spectrum for new technologies such as Enhanced Flight Vision System radar, authorization to use a specific spectrum band for operational control communications to allow for the data communications component of the Next Generation Aviation System, service rules for Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System (AeroMACS), and clarifications to existing rules to accommodate aeronautical advisory stations, which provide greater information flows (flying conditions, weather, availability of ground services, and other information) to promote the safe and expeditious operation of general aviation aircraft. Following the Commission's vote on the NPRM, there will be a 30-day public comment period during which stakeholders can comment on the various proposals in the NPRM.

One, two, three -- yes, true -- oh well, and with that he hit himself in the head, it is Wednesday, it's May the 203rd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Emmanuel Macron tries to turn France from a striking nation to a startup nation. Turkey is taking emergency action raising interest rates to stabilize a currency in free fall. And Comcast confirms that it will start a fight with Disney for 21st Century Fox.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am Richard Quest live from London, where of course, I mean, business.</p><p>It is not every day you get to start QUEST MEANS BUSINESS with the Fox theme. But it's not every day that three of the biggest moguls in the media industry are going head to head with each other. A media tug-of-war is going to a whole new level, Comcast is ready to trump Disney in its bid for 21st Century Fox, picking the bigger all cash bid for the media and Murdoch empire.</p><p>Rupert Murdoch, Ryan Roberts, Bob Iger -- the three big titans who are about to go into battle and this is how it goes.</p><p>Remember 21st Century Fox wanted to buy parts of Sky, there's bits of Sky that it doesn't already own. Then, along came Disney, and Disney said, \"Well, we will buy most of the assets of 21st Century Fox, along with what its bought from Sky.\"</p><p>So far so good. But then recently, Comcast -- Comcast came into the game and said, \"No, we are going to make a hostile bid for Sky,\" as well what is a bid for Sky that is higher than 21st Century Fox, and now today, Comcast says, it is very likely, they will make a bid for the whole of 21st Century Fox or the assets that were going to be sold to Disney.</p><p>Put it like this, and you have a straightforward battle between Disney and Comcast for these prize assets of 21st Century Fox. To say nothing about what it means with Sky, the UK and European broadcaster, and if all of these wasn't complicated enough, let me throw in Time Warner which is going to be sold to AT&amp;T if a judge agrees in a court case.</p><p>Look at these. They are the prized assets of the media industry. Rarely do you see anything like this all coming up for sale at once, and if you think about the men involved, you realize huge stakes that are up for grabs.</p><p>Rupert Murdoch's legacy and his new company, Ryan Roberts and his ability to go international with Sky and get the 21st Century Fox assets and Bob Iger, desperate to get his hands on these excellent assets to help shore up the Disney franchise.</p><p>Brian Stelter is with me to try and make some sense out of it. Brian, rarely have we seen such a fight over such prized beautiful media mogul assets.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and it speaks to the desperation that some of these media companies feel. There is a game of musical chairs underway right now and when it's over, some of these companies are not going to be able to continue.</p><p>What we see are these technology giants like Netflix, Amazon and Apple changing the media business.</p><p>Now, as a result, companies like Disney and Comcast are trying to make huge bets in order to compete. They are trying to look five and ten years down the line, trying to make sure that they are still having a chair and able to compete because, just in the last few minutes, Netflix, which of course has been growing, growing and growing, it surpassed Comcast by market cap.</p><p>Now, that's probably why the Comcast stock was down suddenly on this news about Fox and Disney.</p><p>But the point is, it's another symbolic moment of these tech giants gaining more and more ground. Netflix now is about to become even bigger than Disney, but as of today, and just in the last few minutes, its market caps surpassed Comcast. It's a sign of the times and explains why both Comcast and Disney, both down today are both buying for Fox.</p><p>QUEST: Which of the deals do you think makes more sense in that who needs the 21st Century Fox movie studios and TV station assets, along with the Sky assets assuming they get them. Who needs it more? Comcast or Disney?</p><p>STELTER: Looking at the --</p><p>[16:05:16]</p><p>STELTER: -- bidding, Comcast believes it needs the assets more because it was willing to pay $60 billion. Right now, the Disney deal that's on the table is worth almost $53 billion. Keep in mind, Comcast tried to make a play for these assets more than six months ago. Ryan Roberts tried to make a bid as though it was higher than the Fox bid six months ago, but the Murdochs went with Disney. They went with Bob Iger, partly because of the antitrust concerns you talked about AT&amp;T.</p><p>Fox apparently was concerned that Comcast wouldn't be able to get it approved. That is why all of these depends on what a judge decides in a few weeks. If AT&amp;T is able to go to forward and buy Time Warner, that means Comcast is going to show up at the table with its all cash offer.</p><p>QUEST: Brian, is it your understanding that Comcast is going to make a bid, all things being equal. I heard what they said today about you know, they are exploring a bit, but they said that about Sky. They warned us that a bid was coming before it came. They are pretty much doing the same thing again here.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, sources were clear with me several weeks ago that Comcast is going to bid for Fox, unless the AT&amp;T deal doesn't work out. Unless the judge decides that AT&amp;T cannot move forward, that's going to make a lot of these companies rethink what they are doing, but it is a remarkable time to see these media assets in play, these companies circling Fox, Rupert Murdoch has a lot of power in this situation, and hey, there's also a CBS buyer coming out there.</p><p>The future of CBS and Viacom is also at stake in this.</p><p>QUEST: Who? You weren't planning on seeing your family any time soon, were you?</p><p>STELTER: Only on Facetime, it works really well nowadays.</p><p>QUEST: So, I am told. Brian Stelter, we will be needing your help. Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>STELTER: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: As we continue. Now, the U.S. and China are at crossroads negotiating on so many levels. It's almost impossible to comprehend. You've got the summit between Kim Jong-un and the President which is seemingly now up in the air. And Donald Trump believes that the framework trade agreement announced days ago will not bear fruit. He tweeted today, \"Our trade deal with China is moving along nicely, but in the end, we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too-hard to get done and too hard to verify results after completion.\"</p><p>What on earth does that mean? Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo met with his Chinese counterparts in the last hour and said, he hopes the summit will go ahead -- that's the North Korea summit. He would also meet his Japanese counterpart later today.</p><p>Martin Wolf is with me, the Chief Economics Commentator at the \"Financial Times.\" Martin, I think you will agree, these are somewhat extraordinary times in the way in which this news is imparted to us by officials, but this trade deal with China, it looks like it is now on the ropes?</p><p>MARTIN WOLF, CHIEF ECONOMICS COMMENTATOR, FINANCIAL TIMES: Well, it's completely bewildering, but my response is what trade deal? We have absolutely no idea as far as I can what trade deal there is? What it covers? There is an indication that China has agreed to unspecified reductions in its bilateral surplus with purchase of U.S. commodities and goods and so forth, we don't know what they are. We don't know what the quantities are. U.S. have very specific demands, $100 billion this year and $100 billion more next year. None of that is precise.</p><p>We don't know what they are agreeing on any other areas. As far as I think, there is no deal and meanwhile, Mr. Trump announced completely off the bat that he would reverse an administration decision, the whole administration on the treatment of ZTE.</p><p>So, I don't know what it is going on. It is absolutely bewildering.</p><p>QUEST: And the Fed, in its minutes today, the Feds, you start to see they are worried about the trade situation, the Fed now says. They are worried about what might come down the road as a result of this.</p><p>WOLF: Well, the moment -- again, they must be in the same position. It could be something very big and very disturbing or very big and very good, or absolutely nothing at all. My bet at the moment is it is going to end up as nothing at all.</p><p>QUEST: So, how dangerous is the situation in a world where global trade had only just really started to pick up after the great financial crisis, things are still very weak, Fed increasing rates because of growth -- how dangerous or worrying is a situation like this?</p><p>WOLF: If we ended up with a really big trade war of the type what was implied by one side, $150 billion worth of goods with penal tariffs, an immense sort of friction between the two biggest traders, that will be very serious.</p><p>But at the moment, it doesn't look at all likely that is going to happen, so I think it might just be very, very noisy theater in which case, in the end, people will get used to it. There's a lot of theater about this and it really doesn't matter.</p><p>QUEST: It is useful -- I am here in London at the moment, and I get the chance to have you in front of me, as opposed to down the satellite, and I can now ask you what then is worrying you? When you look at the global economic situation at the moment, if it is not this with trade, with Brexit potentially, what really has got your alarm bells ringing?</p><p>WOLF: Well, I think, the trade could be, but I think the most immediate thing is what we are seeing with Turkey --</p><p>[16:10:16]</p><p>WOLF: -- is we are seeing a big reprising of emerging market risk, a big reprising of the dollar. People are beginning to realize that this conversation in the U.S. is really out of control. Interest rates could rise much more. If inflation rises as do interest rates, the U.S. could go up a long way and remember, the big fact, there is more debt outstanding in the world now than there was before the crisis.</p><p>So, it's the interaction of rising dollar, rising interest rates and this huge overhang of debt. Those are the things that really worry me.</p><p>QUEST: But this conundrum of rising dollar at a time of rising U.S. borrowing at the same time, that suggests that the dollar still remains as they have favored, even though the U.S. is borrowing like a billion.</p><p>WOLF: That's what happened in the early '80s. This was the Volcker shock. They've got a fiscal deficit increasing under Reagan and interest rates soaring, it's not as bad as that. And everybody goes at the dollar because in the end, it's a safe haven, and that generates a huge shock in the rest of the world particularly all of the countries with large net debt positions in dollars.</p><p>QUEST: Optimistic? Pessimistic? Or just simply worried?</p><p>WOLF: Interested, very mildly pessimistic at the moment. I think anything can happen.</p><p>QUEST: We'll need you to help us understand this. Good to see you as always.</p><p>WOLF: Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: The markets -- and you want to see exactly what happened. Look at the turbulent day. You saw that the triple digit fall after Donald Trump warned on trade. If you didn't get the Fed minutes which talked about trade, and it perhaps suggested that interest rates won't go up quite as high as we thought is fast, and then, the market goes up and finishes up 52 points.</p><p>How General Electric -- the shares in General Electric fell. The biggest percentage fall in a decade. It follows the Chief Executive, John Flannery who has failed to say, they will definitely have a dividend next year. Guru La Monica is with me.</p><p>GE is a basket case in terms of its stock. The company is a fine company that makes excellent world-class medical leading products and I bow to no one in saying that, but the stock is a dog with fleas and today, those fleas just grew.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, without question, Richard. This is a huge problem for GE when you have the CEO not really having firm confidence that there could be a dividend in 2019. What he seems to suggest was that you know, that will depend on the company's cash flow by next year, which is pretty weak right now, and he also talked about the company's power division, not really showing much in the way of growth and that is a big problem for the company right now.</p><p>He talked about healthcare, they want to focus more on healthcare, but they still have a big power division. Obviously, big in aviation as well and a lot of their units are struggling.</p><p>QUEST: And the share price is down. Paul La Monica, Guru, thank you for joining us.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you, sir.</p><p>QUEST: It's a very busy day, so we move quickly on JCPenney's Chief Executive. That's the retail store, JCPenney -- is leaving the struggling retailer to become Lowe's new Chief Executive. That's Marvin Ellison who announced the move on Tuesday, and the share price is just over $2.00 is the very reason he gave for leaving.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARVIN ELLISON, FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE, JCPENNEY: We brought this company back to positive sales and positive earnings. I am really proud that I played a role in the successes, but one thing I did not do as Chairman and CEO was grow the stock price and generate wealth for you and your associates and the shareholders, and team, this is the number one responsibility of a CEO, and something that I did not deliver on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Those shares dropped more than 10 percent. Clare Sebastian who looks after retailing for us joins me from New York. That sounds like a really weak excuse for why he is off to another better job?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Richard. It is interesting -- that video statement coming about 12 hours after the initial announcement that he was leaving and there was a lot of talk during those 12 hours about whether or not he was dumping a sinking ship, and certainly, you can see from the share price of Lowe's today, up more than 10 percent, and that there is a lot of optimism in him moving that.</p><p>That's also a matter of the difference between these two companies. JCPenney is in a very weak position. As he said, the stock is basically a penny stock, it's heavily indebted. It has been closing stores. It's been cutting staff. Lowe's is in home improvement which has really been the kind of bull work against this so-called retail apocalypse. The housing market has been booming and it's really a two-horse race -- it's Lowe's and Home Depot.</p><p>And Marvin Ellison has a lot of experience in this area. He was at Home Depot for 12 years before he was at JCPenney, so I think he called this a once in a lifetime experience, and I think that video was really him trying to justify that in the face of quite a lot of criticism.</p><p>QUEST: And Target, which of course is the other major retailer, it has many problems and continues to struggle.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes, I mean, that stock was down about 5 percent today. It was perhaps a bit of an overreaction because the earnings did miss, but they were up 28 percent in e-commerce and really, this is what we are seeing across the board in retail. This is the cost of turning around your business in the face of competition...</p><p>[16:15:16]</p><p>SEBASTIAN: -- from the likes of Amazon, from Walmart and Target is doing that. They are investing heavily in e-commerce. They are revamping their stores, and I think you know, they are still in a pretty strong position. Up until today, the stock was up 15 percent so far this year, Richard.</p><p>So, perhaps there is a bit of an overreaction, we may see the stocks rebound in the session tomorrow.</p><p>QUEST: Clare Sebastian who knows pretty much all there is to know about retailing and probably spends a bit of time in the shops as well. Clare, thank you.</p><p>European markets closed firmly in the red. Frankfurt was the worst performer, dragged down by the weak manufacturing data. The country's biggest bank, Deutsche reportedly by the \"Wall Street Journal\" planning to cut 10,000 jobs. In Milan, the prices fall amid the prospects of a populist government and London retreated from record highs, with inflation numbers in the UK.</p><p>Talk about a mega merger -- banking merger between -- let me start that one again. I have no idea where Lloyd came into all of this. Talk of a mega banking merger between Barclays and Standard Chartered is brewing again. Shares in Barclays were down in London. The bank is mulling a deal in response to pressure from an activist investor, Edward Bramson. Both banks of course declining to comment.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg's European talk continues, after the results in Brussels, this time he was in Paris where he made new friends.</p><p>What a difference a day makes. Yesterday, Mark Zuckerberg was lambasted in Brussels, today, he is being wooed in Paris. The Facebook Chief Exec met President Macron ahead of a tech conference. The French President said he would press Zuckerberg on data privacy. He is also vying to bring Facebook's investment dollars to France.</p><p>Now, while Macron is striving towards a new economy, all problems keep getting in the way. This is his vision. A vision of the CEOs of Facebook, Microsoft, IBM, Uber and more -- all of the elites there, (inaudible) in there. You have of course, Satya Nadella, you have Zuckerberg -- all there to talk. So, it's quite an achievement to get these big guys at the summit.</p><p>Macron has promised to turn France into Europe's startup nation. He wants to attract investment with faster growth and he is tweaking employment laws to do it. For now, the statistics aren't cooperating. French unemployment actually ticked up to 9.2 percent in Q1. Now, think about it, 9.2 percent, the UK is about 4 point something and the U.S. is just under 3.9 percent. So, 9 percent in France.</p><p>Meanwhile, whilst all of this goes on, the strikes -- the reformers have had French people taking to the streets, continuing nationwide strikes or threatening to bring France to a halt. It's a very different vision which means -- so the reality of the strikes and the unemployment and the vision which he wants to create of the startup nation.</p><p>Melissa Bell is in Paris for us. How do we square this circle between the reality and the vision?</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is a massive circle to square. As you say, the gap is enormous --</p><p>[16:20:16]</p><p>BELL: -- between the vision and what actually is, and yet, Richard, when you talk about for instance this sudden hike in unemployment that we have seen since the beginning of 2018 where the economists here in France is that that is a result of people getting back on to the jobs market because they believe of the full on unemployment at the end of 2017 and the picking up of the French economy that there may be jobs to be had. They simply haven't been counted before.</p><p>We will probably have to wait a little more to see precisely whether the joy should be out on that, what the real results of that is. Whether he has money to fix things, whether he has money for this reform, to kick start the French economy as he hopes to do.</p><p>You mentioned the strikes, we are in the middle of a strike that has lasted now for many weeks. It is strike of the rail workers. We saw yesterday the public service demonstrators, and we have seen successive strikes and protests over the course of the last few months because, Richard, his reforms have been as broad a statement, and because they have been carried out at such a great neck speed.</p><p>France is simply not used to these sorts of reforms. In a sense, what you are seeing on the street is a protest to precisely where he is succeeding in changing France.</p><p>QUEST: But Melissa, how realistic is it for France to be a startup nation on a global tech industry when the first time anybody says, \"Well, you should do it in English,\" or \"It has to be done to global standards, not the French way.\" Everybody says, \"For the Glory of France, (inaudible).\"</p><p>BELL: You know, it's a really good point, Richard. That's historically been the problem of France, and yet, it occurred to me today as we waited outside the Elysees for this meeting, not just between Mark Zuckerberg and Emmanuel Macron to finish, but the meeting is a series of one-to-ones between the French President and a number of leaders of the tech giants of California. It occurred to me that this was the first time a French President had been able to have those meetings without a translator.</p><p>That in itself is new, and you are right, there is this question of French regulations. There is this question of France's way of life, and there is this piggy back. There is a part of French society that simply doesn't like the way that Emmanuel Macron is seeking to take this country, and yet, he has signaled his determination and perhaps, most crucially, Richard, he has the French public behind him.</p><p>The latest polls show that most people here in France, a majority of them believe that he will win the rail strikers, also the other strikers will lose, that he will see his reforms through and that is perhaps what no other French President has had before.</p><p>He has come into power with this written into his DNA. This is what he tried to do as Economy Minister, bring through reforms that hadn't been carried out. Now, he is doing them as President and he appears to have the public behind him.</p><p>QUEST: Melissa, we'll talk more about it. Thank you. Melissa Bell in Paris, staying up late for tonight and we are grateful for that.</p><p>Italy has made it official, the new Prime Minister is Giuseppe Conte. If you've barely heard of him, you almost definitely are not alone. He is a law professor with almost no public profile. The new populist government plucked him from obscurity. Speaking earlier, he promised to govern for all Italians.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIUSEPPE CONTE, PRIME MINISTER, ITALY: (Through an interpreter). I am a lawyer and throughout my life, I have taken care of many people. I am preparing myself now to defend the interest of all Italians in all places - - in Europe and internationally -- speaking with European institutions and with representatives of other countries.</p><p>I will be the defense lawyer for the Italian people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Barbie Nadeau is in Rome. Simple question, what on earth makes this man think he can be Prime Minister of one of the largest economies, a G7 economy and be successful at it?</p><p>BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, there are two people that have made him think he can do that, and one is the head of the Northern League, now called \"The League\" and the other is the head of the Five-Star Movement. Many people are calling this man a puppet for them that he will be tasked for doing their work for them.</p><p>And as a result of that, he may not actually have much of his own agenda. This man has never run for public office. All we knew about him was what on his resume and some of that has been proven to be inflated to some extent.</p><p>So, there is very little that we know and there is -- you've got a lot to prove essentially, but if we look at who is backing him, I think we have a very good idea, Richard about what direction Italy is going.</p><p>QUEST: But will the Italian people rightly or wrongly be angry? Won't they say, \"Hang on a second, you know, I don't want somebody who has never done medicine to be my doctor. I don't want an amateur pilot to land my holiday jet, and I don't want somebody who has never run in government to be Prime Minister and steward of the economy.\" Won't the people be annoyed?</p><p>NADEAU: Well, you know --</p><p>[16:25:16]</p><p>NADEAU: -- I think they are annoyed when they have a very qualified politician. We have seen governments collapse over and over and over again in this country for the last 40 years, and you cannot look at Italy and look at it as a role model for how you should run a country in terms of the politicians.</p><p>He could do a good job. He could surprise everyone or he could -- you have mentioned in the way of expectations to me because no one is really expecting much, and you look at this on the back of the fact that it's been 11 weeks since the election, March 4th.</p><p>Italians are pretty Federal up. It's nice to just have a name right now, at least someone to argue about at this point.</p><p>QUEST: Barbie, you'll be watching this in the days ahead. Thank you for joining us from Rome tonight, staying up late as well.</p><p>The head of Russia's Direct Investment Fund says he understands the pain that sanctions are causing to some European companies. Kirill Dmitriev is the man in charge of attracting investment to Russia in an age where sanctions are flying and relations with the West is sinking.</p><p>He tells John Defterios the world is on a dangerous path.</p><p>(START VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>KIRILL DMITRIEV, HEAD, RUSSIA'S DIRECT INVESTMENT FUND: We believe that if this trajectory continues, the risk of global conflict increase dramatically and people should really think, is it worth it? Is it really a right strategy to continue on the path of antagonistic relations or is it a time to really say, \"Listen, it really goes into a very dangerous territory right now.\" It is time to start restoring the relationship. It's time to start like Japan, have positive discussions with Russia on the economic front and in other fronts.</p><p>And I think more and more reasonable people understand that and follow this approach.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Are you suggesting the President is being unreasonable, President Trump going after Oleg Deripaska or a Roman Abramovich, it seems to get very personal when you pick out the oligarchs who are big investors in Europe for example.</p><p>DMITRIEV: Well, we see that lots of people in Europe are very much against sanctions. We believe that sanctions are really against the -- you know, having positive discussions and addressing issues, but it is difficult for us to comment otherwise from the U.S. sanction policy.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Is it going to be wrong that it actually closes the gap between Europe, Russia and China in your view? Is the U.S. putting ultimate pressure with the latest round of sanctions on Iran. Do you think this is a bridge builder that brings Germany back in to the full view of Vladimir Putin?</p><p>DMITRIEV: Well, we believe that relationship with Europe is very important for us and for Europe. We don't have much trade, much investment with the U.S., but Germany is our number one trading partner in the world. Many German businesses are suffering from sanctions. I met with many CEOs whose revenue declined by 30 percent to 40 percent of medium sized German businesses because of not being able to do much with Russia.</p><p>So, we believe there is a general sense in Europe that it wants to restore investment and trade relationship and I think we are seeing some of the discussions happening even now.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: There has been a lot of global attention about your January 2007 meeting in the Saychelles with Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater, what was your primary motivation behind this meeting? Was it to establish a back channel with the United States and improve relations or not?</p><p>DMITRIEV: John, the meeting was hundred U.S. business people throughout the year. Nothing restrict U.S. people from meeting with us or from co- investing with us, and I am very passionate about restoring U.S.-Russia relationship. I believe it's very important. I believe that we are going into a very dangerous territory, by hearing such adversarial relationship and when I was in school in the U.S., I really believed in critical thinking and then follow what you believe in.</p><p>If you like critical thinking, you understand that you need to start improving U.S.-Russia relations or otherwise, we in a very dangerous zone, and if you follow what you believe in, as I do, I will continue to work very heavily on improving a U.S.-Russia relations on working with U.S. businesses because this is what is needed right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: As we continue tonight, more e-mails arrived this morning inviting me for privacy statements, opt-in, opt-in, opt-in. GDPR embraced the new rules. Hallelujah. Or shut up shop, Europe's new data law comes in with severe financial penalties. I will discuss them with E.U.'s top supervisor who will join us live from Brussels. Mr. GDPR, after the break.</p><p>[16:30:00] QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest, there is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. But it's a case of adapt or die -- big tech companies, in fact, all the companies are scrambling ahead of Friday's European privacy deadline, and smaller firms have decided enough is enough and they're backing up.</p><p>And the economic turmoil in Turkey, the central bank takes action to stamp out fears of a crisis, as we continue tonight, this is CNN and on this network the facts always come first.</p><p>U.S. Embassy in China has issued a health warning after a U.S. government employee reported abnormal symptoms that resembles a mild traumatic brain injury. A U.S. diplomatic official says the State Department is looking into whether the symptom is similar to that which took place last year in Cuba.</p><p>The government has characterized that as a sonic attack. The daughter of a former Russian double agent is speaking up for the first time since she and her father were attacked with a nerve agent in England.</p><p>Yulia Skripal recall their recovery slow and extremely painful. She says she's now helping care for her father and eventually wants to return to Russia. The head of the U.S. Gymnastics has apologized for horrific acts of his former team doctor.</p><p>Kerry Perry told the Congressional panel she was appalled and sickened by Larry Nassar's sexual abuse of hundreds of young gymnasts. She also say USA Gymnastics have taken a new course over the last five months.</p><p>A federal judge has ruled Donald Trump cannot block critics from responding to his tweets. The judge in New York ruled in doing so violates the constitution, he goes Twitter is a public forum. The Justice Department denouncing the ruling, saying Mr. Trump, as it is his right to decide who he spends time with on social media.</p><p>Sweeping E.U. privacy laws is called GDPR, you're familiar with it that much. It's two days away and it has all the companies particularly the tech companies scrambling. Now, what did I get this morning? Well, of course, I got at least five GDPR opting in e-mails.</p><p>But then I also got from various companies, so for example Deloitte sent me a nine-page document on their privacy policy, and I remember Soho House and they decided to send me a seven-page, but it's tightly formatted policy and buried on page seven, its right to withdraw consent which is one of the bits of course that's important.</p><p>Look, the reality is we're all swamp at this, none of us know what to do with it. You really don't get any choice, you have to accept that if you're going to do business with these people, and sometimes are playing bull, Apple is telling users what data it has, Microsoft and Facebook vows to make the rule global and thus, they're going out of business.</p><p>But the online reputation service cloud, others are shooting services, Uber entertainment and the check search engine stays numb.</p><p>[16:35:00] And some firms are blocking Europeans like gravity interactive because remember this is only relevant if you have European customers or European citizens, European citizens very costly.</p><p>Mark Thompson do help me, please -- the global privacy head at KPMG. This is complex.</p><p>MARK THOMPSON, HEAD, GLOBAL PRIVACY, KPMG: Absolutely, there's complex, and I think one of the things that's misunderstood is the foundations in GDPR, and it's one of hundreds of price regulations that is just global.</p><p>What he's really trying to do is provide a framework for businesses to leverage a person's information create value, but also making sure that when they do that, individual's rights are protected.</p><p>QUEST: How does a nine-page document from Deloitte, which I -- we're processing a special -- person measures, but I'm -- your consent and you withdraw that consent, we received processes of -- this is exactly what we talk about though, isn't it?</p><p>This isn't helping anybody or is it?</p><p>THOMPSON: I mean, I think one of the react is and I can't obviously comment on Deloitte --</p><p>QUEST: Oh, no, I mean, then you want to go where you've got tons of examples. And I'm sure KPMG has exactly the same thing as well.</p><p>THOMPSON: I mean, we've got to realize is the regulation is trying to fight transparency to -- I'm sure it's a holiday to the Jews, and you can argue that's transparent or not. But fundamentally, that is -- that is the purpose of why some of these notices are coming up.</p><p>QUEST: The real food to me, it seems to me, the real issue here is not so much about me withdrawing consent in all of that. It's the companies making sure they have the proper security and safeguards, the data protection officer, the various storage facilities and the role concerning breach.</p><p>THOMPSON: Absolutely, I mean, first, this is one of the most valuable assets, and organizations need to manage to value that asset so they can leverage it to give a great product and services, great customer experience. But also manage the liability that is associated with that.</p><p>And you've seen in recent times how severe that liability can be.</p><p>QUEST: Do you think this is -- do you think this edifice is behemoth that has been put in place of GDPR will do the trick. Is this what was needed?</p><p>THOMPSON: And I think it's what was needed. I think it's about getting it right and a balance. And I think over time, you'll see the requirements of what people have done changing it both.</p><p>QUEST: So for example, when I write to the -- one of these companies next week when it's in the zone, would you please withdraw -- I wish to -- what's the phrase to use here? I wish to withdraw my consent to personal data.</p><p>What are they going to write back and say -- what would you be advising them to write back and say?</p><p>THOMPSON: And I think withdrawn of consent means you didn't get the opportunity to leverage the product and services they offered often. So the question would be is, what's the value of changing that organization --</p><p>QUEST: No, but my point is, isn't there a real problem? I'm not asking you to necessarily to comment on a specific case. But if I do take to say for example, Soho House example. If I say to them, no, I still wish to be a member of your organization, but I wish to withdraw my consent for you to use my personal data.</p><p>Or it could be anything, it could be an -- I mean, these are things we don't know what the result will be.</p><p>THOMPSON: Absolutely, and individuals have got a lot of questions that are unable to get answers from the organizations, and I don't think there's a - - this is golden answer for any of this. It's very much about striking the balance as an individual for once you get the product to service from an organization as well as understanding it if you want that product and services, the organization uses your data.</p><p>QUEST: Finally, we've talked many times on this program about the seriousness of data privacy and cybersecurity. Is it your view that it is one of the biggest existential threats that any company faces?</p><p>THOMPSON: Absolutely. I mean, if you look at the value of data, and you can see it in the way that tech companies and the big concentration companies are valued, there's a huge value being placed on this intangible asset. And if you look at the comparison to this who they get all the gas companies, that's just too big across his personal information companies.</p><p>Although less revenue, less turnover, their big personal information leverage comes at a higher market cap.</p><p>QUEST: What does this say about our society when your name, address and who you are is worth more than some of the things (INAUDIBLE). Good to see you, sir --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>Thank you very much indeed --</p><p>THOMPSON: Right --</p><p>QUEST: To coming in and talking to us tonight, thank you. Turkey seems to have put the pin back in its economic crisis at least it would seem to be. Economists wanted the central bank to do more, it's done so. Paul Donovan from UBS will discuss this after the break.</p><p>It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live tonight from London.</p><p>[16:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Turkey is scrambling for economic stability. The central bank employed a massive 3 percent, 300-basis point make highlights to throw the brakes on the slide of its currency that seemed to have worked for the moment.</p><p>The lira pushed higher that had fallen into a record low against the dollar earlier in the day. Economists think the hike could have been even higher, 4 to 500 points. Paul Donovan is the chief global economist at UBS Wealth Management. What's gone wrong here? What's gone wrong in Turkey?</p><p>PAUL DONOVAN, GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST, UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT: So essentially, Turkey has always had a bit of an Achilles heel, which is its current account deficit -- its current account deficit basically says Turkey needs to borrow money from the rest of the world.</p><p>And to the rest of the world, it says actually, you know what? We're not too keen on lending money to Turkey this week, the currency goes down. So that's your basic point. You've always had this problem with this need to borrow.</p><p>And then a couple of weeks ago, President Erdogan came out and suggested some noble economic ideas. But reducing Turkey's quite high inflation rate and inflation is almost 11 percent, could be achieved by lowering interest rates.</p><p>Now this runs counter to what the role of Society of Economics for example would recommend and the markets didn't like it. And it's where we are today.</p><p>QUEST: Is this a classic balance of payment crisis?</p><p>DONOVAN: It's -- I'm --</p><p>QUEST: I mean, let's face it, raising we know, we know that raising interest rates in this fashion will not work and will cause -- other than just very temporarily, and the ERM debacle proved that.</p><p>DONOVAN: Well, it depends because if you're raising interest rates with a view to slowing domestic borrowing, so, you know, until --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>DONOVAN: Its growth recently has been fueled by a credit binge, and you know, goodness, if anybody knows about credit binge is it's going to be two English people sitting across a desk and talking about it.</p><p>They are trying to slow down map, if they succeed in slowing down the credit, they will reduce the current account deficit, they will help. So it might work where the 300 basis points is enough bearing in mind the Turkish lira has simply gone back to where it was yesterday morning is perhaps a more debatable point.</p><p>QUEST: I am fascinated to hear your views on Italy's new prime minister and his economics. He says that he will -- he's aware that they will respect international and European obligations --</p><p>DONOVAN: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: And responsibilities. But that is counter to the policies that the two parties, populist parties want, which is vast deficits spending.</p><p>DONOVAN: Yes, absolutely, and --</p><p>QUEST: Square that circle.</p><p>DONOVAN: A government with an entirely contradictory set of policies where we see NATO where in Europe. So -- or outside of Europe, perhaps. This I think is going to be a problem. Now, the government has got a very small majority in the Senate.</p><p>Assuming that it wins a vote of confidence, so it succeeds majority in the Senate. That's going to make it fairly fragile which suggests that they'll get lip service for the commitment to European obligations and then there'll be an attempt to support their position with their own supporters in the country through --</p><p>QUEST: When will the market finally give their verdict? I mean, we've seen a little bit of tinkering around with that, but nothing like the sort of anger and resentment that the markets will wreak if they don't like what they see.</p><p>DONOVAN: Well, I think there's a -- there's an important point to bear in mind. Italian assets are generally owned by Italian investors --</p><p>QUEST: Small investors --</p><p>DONOVAN: Italian investors are used to political uncertainty. But good to say, they had 70 years of practice at this.</p><p>QUEST: And I was talking earlier to Martin Wolf, and I said, look, if it's not China trade and it's not Brexit and it's not whatever, what is the most troubling aspect in the global economy? Bearing in mind, yes, the fact that they said it was worried about trade and the fact that it's -- we're still talking about further rate right this year.</p><p>So if I give you the broad brush of the global economy, what is most concerning to you at the moment?</p><p>[16:45:00] DONOVAN: I think in the short-term, there's a risk of an overheating in the United States, not this year, but something which builds next year. You've got deficit finance, fiscal stimulus in an economy that is already going full capacity.</p><p>That is something which raises a risk, the Fed is aware of that, raises a risk.</p><p>QUEST: But the dollar is not reflecting that risk yet, because it's being boiled up by the higher interest rates to some extent and by safe haven. But you -- with that deficit spending, you will start to expect a current account deficit that is a trade that is horrendous.</p><p>DONOVAN: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: You would expect to see some pressure of the currency -- well, we're seeing the opposite.</p><p>DONOVAN: Well, we've seen pressure over the course of the last year, the problem with currency is because they don't move in a straight line forever. Now, I think on a 12-month view, on a 2-year view, the trend of the dollar is going to be weaker and you know, in 12 months, 18 months time, the dollar will be weaker than it is today.</p><p>But we've got some headwinds against that, there's the interest rate differential, as the oil price increase, price of oil is in dollars, so the price of oil goes up, everyone needs to buy more dollars to buy oil. So that's another form of support.</p><p>So there are some factors, we've got the politics in Europe which is also perhaps weighing a bit on the euro. So there are factors which are causing temporary headwinds, but we get this a lot of the time. In the short term, six-month view, those headwinds can be an issue which will support the dollar. Long term, yes, not so convincing.</p><p>QUEST: All right, finally, since we are in London together, Brexit, and the hard versus the soft, the customs union versus some facilitation, bizarre thing that doesn't quite work yet. Technically, how worried are you that this country is heading towards -- it's certainly got political paralysis and government chaos on the issue.</p><p>But in terms of economics, how bad is it going to be now do you think?</p><p>DONOVAN: I think we're going to end up with a relatively soft Brexit which is not going to do too much damage in the short term. And I think one of the things about the longer term -- because a miracle is a long-term decision --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>DONOVAN: We take a ten-year view. You know what we're not going to be trading in the way that we do today in ten years time because the world is going to change radically over the next ten years of course.</p><p>And I think that's one of the things where the cost of bigger structural changes.</p><p>QUEST: Do you understand GDPR?</p><p>DONOVAN: I've got a vague idea about what it means, but I get lots of rotating e-mails which I tend to just delete.</p><p>QUEST: I see your point --</p><p>DONOVAN: Richard, nice to see you, Richard --</p><p>QUEST: We're going to talk GDPR probably with the man who actually is responsible for it, I will ask him whether we should be deleting those e- mails after the break. It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, we're live tonight in London.</p><p>QUEST: EDP Giovanni Buttarelli is the European Union's Data Protection Supervisor joins me now from Brussels. Thank you sir, hoping that you are able to hear me. Congratulations, this is going to happen on Friday. What's your biggest concern as it now comes into operation?</p><p>[16:50:00] GIOVANNI BUTTARELLI, SUPERVISOR, EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION: Well, 24 hours to go here in Brussels, we are ready to start with a full enforcement of the GDPR, and therefore we're saying to the big over-the- top, the tech giants, please surprise us before we will surprise you.</p><p>QUEST: So when would you expect to start doing the first enforcement? Because the thing that's really about GDPR is the enforcement and the somewhat draconian penalties for failure to perform.</p><p>BUTTARELLI: Tomorrow morning, Brussels time, we will let the first and formal meeting of the newly established law that will serve as a member and with a first class secretariat. And we will be discussing our working methods, we will be -- re-establish our task force on social networks and we will synchronize our fights on recent scandals including but not only Cambridge Analytica, and we will finalize written guidelines including those concerning fines.</p><p>And all these documents are to be validated by Friday which is our day one, and therefore no rest periods, no transition period. We are ready to start.</p><p>QUEST: We are all getting e-mails, hundreds of them, we're all being bombarded with privacy papers and privacy policies, most of which we don't even read. Tell me, sir, how is this useful?</p><p>BUTTARELLI: It is not. I'm afraid that all this message I am receiving as a user, subscriber consumer, they aim to protect their data, they can see the data not as personal as relating to data subject, they're protecting themselves in a legalist language.</p><p>I know that there are a lot of patent are going in defensive mode, but what is missing is the human face on what they are doing. It's time to start respecting people and privacy, not the companies themselves.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but that can only happen once the enforcement mechanism which you're putting in place happens. Because at the moment, if write to one of these companies and say I wish to withdraw my data, please tell me what that means.</p><p>Does it mean I can't use the phone or I can't -- my mobile account or I can't go to the restaurant or whatever. We don't understand what GDPR is going to give us.</p><p>BUTTARELLI: Well, GDPR is going to reinforce your rights, it's going to allow you to put in control of the data, and therefore the take it or take it or take it or leave it approach, I know that in this kind of notices you mentioned is exactly out of the context.</p><p>And therefore, I'm afraid that they are wasting their time in transforming what was previously based on freely given consent to an acceptable or at least controversial contract we're closing, we will scrutinize severity.</p><p>QUEST: Sir, you are now heading the global standard on privacy and data protection. The rest of the world is looking to the E.U. and taking GDPR as the gold standard. How does that make you feel?</p><p>BUTTARELLI: Well, it is a responsibility, we need to be accountable, credible, reliable, knowledgeable, we don't want to dictate our values to the rest of the world. They are based also on our cultural experience. But crisis is dead now, national lows are domestic, but data flows are not.</p><p>And therefore it's time for more interoperability, mutual recognition, and therefore I have an appeal for countries late in this process including U.S. at federal level to start cooperating more with the 121 countries, now we keep in the world with a more than generation of data protection and provision including but not only Europe.</p><p>QUEST: Sir, very grateful that we managed to get you into the program tonight after some technical difficulties. Good luck for Friday, thank you and congratulations on what has been a Herculean task, very grateful --</p><p>BUTTARELLI: Thank you for inviting me --</p><p>QUEST: I enjoyed this, thank you. Now, allow me to show you what's happened with the markets. The Dow fell triple digits to the open after Donald Trump warned on a trade deal.</p><p>[16:55:00] The Fed minutes drove right back up again, we went from 117 to 81 points loss over the course of the session and we had to close up 52.4 when all said and done.</p><p>GE, poor old GE punched the biggest percentage fall in nine years. It's all to do with the pain and to be able to say the company is going to make any profits any time soon or at least -- no, not profits, it's going to make a dividend any time soon. We'll take a profitable moment after the break, it's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, good evening to you.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment, how many GDPR's e-mails have you received, and how many clicks have you decide, yes, I'll accept your privacy policy, and now opting for your future communications. GDPR sounds like something rather nasty that you go to see the doctor who gives you a prescription to cure.</p><p>But the reality is it's the biggest change to happen in privacy. I've got dozens of these e-mails. What you heard tonight on this program is that it's got absolutely nothing to do with all these e-mails. This is just face-saving stuff that companies are doing CYA and that's what they're hoping to cover.</p><p>No, the reality is it's about companies, companies and how they handle your data and how they deal with breaches and how they protect what you and I allow them to have. I'm sure there'll be some activists who will on Friday morning text saying please withdraw my data, but continue services.</p><p>There will be the trouble makers who want to make hay out of this. But longer term, GDPR is a safeguard for us against companies and the reckless use of our data. Now, they just have to make it work. The head of the GDPR on the program tonight gives us hope it will work.</p><p>And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London.

You know, like social media has worked out to be. Uh, not so fast. </p><p>An ACLU report published (June 13) called 'the Dawn of Robot Surveillance' says AI-aided video surveillance 'won't just record us, but will also make judgments about us based on their understanding of our actions, emotions, skin color, clothing, voice, and more. These automated 'video analytics' technologies threaten to fundamentally change the nature of surveillance.' More than identifying actions, video analytics allow computers to understand what's going on in a video: They can flag people based on their clothing or behavior, identify people's emotions through body language and behavior, and find people who are acting 'unusual' based on everyone else around them. Those same Amazon in-store cameras can analyze customer sentiment. Other systems can describe what's happening in a video scene. Computers can also identify people. AIs are getting better at identifying people in those videos. Facial recognition technology is improving all the time, made easier by the enormous stockpile of tagged photographs we give to Facebook and other social media sites, and the photos governments collect in the process of issuing ID cards and drivers licenses. The technology already exists to automatically identify everyone a camera 'sees' in real time. Even without video identification, we can be identified by the unique information continuously broadcasted by the smartphones we carry with us everywhere, or by our laptops or Bluetooth-connected devices. Police have been tracking phones for years, and this practice can now be combined with video analytics.(Vice)[1] So, how concerned should any knowledgeable person, of enlightened sentiments (that is, among other things, a typical Left.mn reader), choose to be? Especially, given the kind of subject matter you expect to find on this blog, with how it could potentially be used politically? Certainly there are plenty of indications that people in general are not willing to go with absolutely anything that Big Tech tries to foist on us. 'Glassholes'[2] didn't get far. I have yet to see anyone actually wearing a computer watch in public, though undoubtedly in places where I'm not likely to be found it's known to happen. And, despite the endless hype about the 'Internet of Things,' I know few people who have even troubled to put any of their TVs online, much less their coffeemakers or garage door openers. On the other hand, I've certainly noticed that I'm among the minority that still uses cash rather than swiping a card in the grocery store. Partly that's habit, but partly it is that I don't particularly want The Man to know what, when, and where on everything I buy. (OK, call me paranoid. And I am indeed a Pynchon fan. So be it.) Most people do seem to consider the convenience to be well worth any privacy or other concerns, in that case. My own sense is that most people want, or will want, 'emotional AI' on a tight rein, once acquainted with the issues discussed in the quoted article. (Unless they live in a more or less totalitarian state where they have little to no choice.) But to be effective, helping to see that it is tightly and correctly regulated involves remaining knowledgeable and engaged. And a whole lot of Americans still can't even be troubled to get off our magnificently rock-hard sculpted behinds and vote, once every two years. This is not meant to be considered very relevant to the above, but if you want to read the all-time classic science fiction story of AI gone very, very wrong, dig this.[3] The post 'Emotional AI' is going to be the greatest, right?[4] first appeared on LeftMN[5].

You know, like social media has worked out to be. Uh, not so fast. </p><p>An ACLU report published (June 13) called 'the Dawn of Robot Surveillance' says AI-aided video surveillance 'won't just record us, but will also make judgments about us based on their understanding of our actions, emotions, skin color, clothing, voice, and more. These automated 'video analytics' technologies threaten to fundamentally change the nature of surveillance.' More than identifying actions, video analytics allow computers to understand what's going on in a video: They can flag people based on their clothing or behavior, identify people's emotions through body language and behavior, and find people who are acting 'unusual' based on everyone else around them. Those same Amazon in-store cameras can analyze customer sentiment. Other systems can describe what's happening in a video scene. Computers can also identify people. AIs are getting better at identifying people in those videos. Facial recognition technology is improving all the time, made easier by the enormous stockpile of tagged photographs we give to Facebook and other social media sites, and the photos governments collect in the process of issuing ID cards and drivers licenses. The technology already exists to automatically identify everyone a camera 'sees' in real time. Even without video identification, we can be identified by the unique information continuously broadcasted by the smartphones we carry with us everywhere, or by our laptops or Bluetooth-connected devices. Police have been tracking phones for years, and this practice can now be combined with video analytics.(Vice)[1] So, how concerned should any knowledgeable person, of enlightened sentiments (that is, among other things, a typical Left.mn reader), choose to be? Especially, given the kind of subject matter you expect to find on this blog, with how it could potentially be used politically? Certainly there are plenty of indications that people in general are not willing to go with absolutely anything that Big Tech tries to foist on us. 'Glassholes'[2] didn't get far. I have yet to see anyone actually wearing a computer watch in public, though undoubtedly in places where I'm not likely to be found it's known to happen. And, despite the endless hype about the 'Internet of Things,' I know few people who have even troubled to put any of their TVs online, much less their coffeemakers or garage door openers. On the other hand, I've certainly noticed that I'm among the minority that still uses cash rather than swiping a card in the grocery store. Partly that's habit, but partly it is that I don't particularly want The Man to know what, when, and where on everything I buy. (OK, call me paranoid. And I am indeed a Pynchon fan. So be it.) Most people do seem to consider the convenience to be well worth any privacy or other concerns, in that case. My own sense is that most people want, or will want, 'emotional AI' on a tight rein, once acquainted with the issues discussed in the quoted article. (Unless they live in a more or less totalitarian state where they have little to no choice.) But to be effective, helping to see that it is tightly and correctly regulated involves remaining knowledgeable and engaged. And a whole lot of Americans still can't even be troubled to get off our magnificently rock-hard sculpted behinds and vote, once every two years. This is not meant to be considered very relevant to the above, but if you want to read the all-time classic science fiction story of AI gone very, very wrong, dig this.[3] The post 'Emotional AI' is going to be the greatest, right?[4] first appeared on LeftMN[5].

The phrase was 'useful idiots' and it applied to a good many people who should have known better.[1] I now propose a new, analogous term more appropriate for the age in which we live: useful hypocrites. That's you and me, folks, and it's how the masters of the digital universe see us. And they have pretty good reasons for seeing us that way. </p><p>They hear us whingeing about privacy, security, surveillance, etc., but notice that despite our complaints and suspicions, we appear to do nothing about it. In other words, we say one thing and do another, which is as good a working definition of hypocrisy as one could hope for. \u2014 John Naughton, The Guardian 'Who needs direct repression,' asked philosopher Slavoj Zizek[2], 'when one can convince the chicken to walk freely into the slaughterhouse?' In an Orwellian age where war equals peace, surveillance equals safety, and tolerance equals intolerance of uncomfortable truths and politically incorrect ideas, 'we the people' have gotten very good at walking freely into the slaughterhouse, all the while convincing ourselves that the prison walls enclosing us within the American police state are there for our protection. Call it doublespeak, call it hypocrisy, call it delusion, call it whatever you like, but the fact remains that while we claim to value freedom, privacy, individuality, equality, diversity, accountability, and government transparency, our actions and those of our government rulers contradict these much-vaunted principles at every turn. For instance, we claim to disdain the jaded mindset of the Washington elite[3], and yet we continue to re-elect politicians who lie, cheat and steal. We claim to disapprove of the endless wars that drain our resources and spread thin our military[4], and yet we repeatedly buy into the idea that patriotism equals supporting the military. We claim to chafe at taxpayer-funded pork barrel legislation for roads to nowhere, documentaries on food fights, and studies of mountain lions running on treadmills[5], and yet we pay our taxes meekly and without raising a fuss of any kind. We claim to object to the militarization of our local police forces and their increasingly battlefield mindset[6], and yet we do little more than shrug our shoulders over SWAT team raids and police shootings of unarmed citizens. And then there's our supposed love-hate affair with technology[7], which sees us bristling at the government's efforts to monitor our internet activities, listen in on our phone calls, read our emails, track our every movement, and punish us for what we say on social media, and yet we keep using these very same technologies all the while doing nothing about the government's encroachments on our rights. This contradiction is backed up by a Pew Research Center study[8], which finds that 'Americans say they are deeply concerned about privacy on the web and their cellphones. They say they do not trust Internet companies or the government to protect it. Yet they keep using the services and handing over their personal information.' Let me get this straight: the government continues to betray our trust, invade our privacy, and abuse our rights, and we keep going back for more? Sure we do. After all, the alternative\u2014taking a stand, raising a ruckus, demanding change, refusing to cooperate, engaging in civil disobedience\u2014is not only a lot of work but can be downright dangerous. What we fail to realize, however, is that by tacitly allowing these violations to continue, we not only empower the tyrant but we feed the monster. In this way, what starts off as small, occasional encroachments on our rights, justified in the name of greater safety, becomes routine, wide-ranging abuses so entrenched as to make reform all but impossible. We saw this happen with the police and their build-up of military arsenal, ostensibly to fight the war on drugs. The result: a transformation of America's law enforcement agencies into extensions of the military[9], populated with battle-hardened soldiers who view 'we the people' as enemy combatants. The same thing happened with the government's so-called efforts to get tough on crime by passing endless laws outlawing all manner of activities[10]. The result: an explosion of laws criminalizing everything from parenting decisions and fishing to gardening and living off the grid. And then there were the private prisons[11], marketed as a way to lower the government's cost of locking up criminals. Only it turns out that private prisons actually cost the taxpayer more money and place profit incentives on jailing more Americans, resulting in the largest prison population in the world. Are you starting to notice a pattern yet? The government lures us in with a scheme to make our lives better, our families safer, and our communities more secure, and then once we buy into it, they slam the trap closed. It doesn't matter whether you're talking about red light cameras, DNA databases, surveillance cameras, or zero tolerance policies: they all result in 'we the people' being turned into Enemy Number One. In this way, the government campaign to spy on our phone calls, letters and emails was sold to the American people as a necessary tool in the war on terror. Instead of targeting terrorists, however, the government has turned us into potential terrorists, so that if we dare say the wrong thing in a phone call, letter, email or on the internet, especially social media, we end up investigated, charged and possibly jailed. If you happen to be one of the 1.31 billion individuals who use Facebook or one of the 255 million who tweet their personal and political views on Twitter, you might want to pay close attention. This criminalization of free speech, which is exactly what the government's prosecution of those who say the 'wrong' thing using an electronic medium amounts to, was at the heart of Elonis v. United States[12], a case that wrestled with where the government can draw the line when it comes to expressive speech that is protected and permissible versus speech that could be interpreted as connoting a criminal intent. The case arose after Anthony Elonis, an aspiring rap artist, used personal material from his life as source material and inspiration for rap lyrics which he then shared on Facebook[13]. For instance, shortly after Elonis' wife left him and he was fired from his job, his lyrics included references to killing his ex-wife[14], shooting a classroom of kindergarten children, and blowing up an FBI agent who had opened an investigation into his postings. Despite the fact that Elonis routinely accompanied his Facebook posts with disclaimers that his lyrics were fictitious, and that he was using such writings as an outlet for his frustrations, he was charged with making unlawful threats[15] (although it was never proven that he intended to threaten anyone) and sentenced to 44 months in jail. Elonis is not the only Facebook user to be targeted for prosecution based on the content of his posts. In a similar case that made its way through the courts only to be rebuffed by the Supreme Court, Brandon Raub, a decorated Marine, was arrested by a swarm of FBI, Secret Service agents and local police and forcibly detained in a psychiatric ward because of controversial song lyrics and political views posted on his Facebook page. He was eventually released after a circuit court judge dismissed the charges against him as unfounded. Rapper Jamal Knox and Rashee Beasley were sentenced to jail terms of up to six years for a YouTube video[16] calling on listeners to 'kill these cops 'cause they don't do us no good.' Although the rapper contended that he had no intention of bringing harm to the police, he was convicted of making terroristic threats and intimidation of witnesses. And then there was Franklin Delano Jeffries II, an Iraq war veteran, who, in the midst of a contentious custody battle for his daughter, shared a music video on YouTube and Facebook[17] in which he sings about the judge in his case, 'Take my child and I'll take your life.' Despite his insistence that the lyrics were just a way for him to vent his frustrations with the legal battle, Jeffries was convicted of communicating threats and sentenced to 18 months in jail. The common thread running through all of these cases is the use of social media to voice frustration, grievances, and anger, sometimes using language that is overtly violent. The question the U.S. Supreme Court was asked to decide in Elonis is whether this activity, in the absence of any overt intention of committing a crime, rises to the level of a 'true threat' or whether it is, as I would contend, protected First Amendment activity. (The Supreme Court has defined a 'true threat' as 'statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.') In an 8-1 decision that concerned itself more with 'criminal-law principles concerning intent rather than the First Amendment's protection of free speech[18],' the Court ruled that prosecutors had not proven that Elonis intended to harm anyone beyond the words he used and context. That was three years ago. Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Elonis, Corporate America has now taken the lead in policing expressive activity online, with social media giants such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube using their formidable dominance in the field to censor, penalize and regulate speech and behavior online by suspending and/or banning users whose content violated the companies' so-called community standards for obscenity, violence, hate speech, discrimination, etc. Make no mistake: this is fascism. This is fascism with a smile. As Bertram Gross, former presidential advisor, noted in his chilling book Friendly Fascism: The New Face of Power in America: Anyone looking for black shirts, mass parties, or men on horseback will miss the telltale clues of creeping fascism. . . . In America, it would be super modern and multi-ethnic\u2014as American as Madison Avenue, executive luncheons, credit cards, and apple pie. It would be fascism with a smile. As a warning against its cosmetic faade, subtle manipulation, and velvet gloves, I call it friendly fascism. What scares me most is its subtle appeal. The subtle appeal of this particular brand of fascism is its self-righteous claim to fighting the evils of our day (intolerance, hatred, violence) using the weapons of Corporate America. Be warned, however: it is only a matter of time before these weapons are used more broadly, taking aim at anything that stands in its quest for greater profit, control and power. This is what fascism looks like in a modern context, with corporations flexing their muscles to censor and silence expressive activity under the pretext that it is taking place within a private environment subject to corporate rules as opposed to activity that takes place within a public or government forum that might be subject to the First Amendment's protection of 'controversial' and/or politically incorrect speech. Alex Jones was just the beginning. Jones, the majordomo of conspiracy theorists who spawned an empire built on alternative news, was banned from Facebook for posting content that violates the social media site's 'Community Standards,'[19] which prohibit posts that can be construed as bullying or hateful. According to The Washington Post, Twitter suspended over 70 million accounts over the course of two months[20] to 'reduce the flow of misinformation on the platform.' Among those temporarily suspended was Daniel McAdams[21], Executive Director of the Ron Paul Institute. Rightly contending that tech companies are just extensions of the government, former Texas congressman Ron Paul believes that social media networks under the control of Google, Apple, Twitter and Facebook are working with the U.S. government to silence dissent[22]. 'You get accused of treasonous activity and treasonous speech because in an empire of lies the truth is treason,' Paul declared. 'Challenging the status quo is what they can't stand and it unnerves them, so they have to silence people.' Curiously enough, you know who has yet to be suspended? President Trump. Twitter's rationale for not suspending world leaders such as Trump, whom critics claim routinely violate the social media giant's rules, is because 'Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets, would hide important information people should be able to see and debate[23]. It would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions.' Frankly, all individuals, whether or not they are world leaders, should be entitled to have their thoughts and ideas aired openly, pitted against those who might disagree with them, and debated widely, especially in a forum like the internet. Why does this matter? The internet and social media have taken the place of the historic public square, which has slowly been crowded out by shopping malls and parking lots. As such, these cyber 'public squares' may be the only forum left for citizens to freely speak their minds and exercise their First Amendment rights, especially in the wake of legislation that limits access to our elected representatives. Unfortunately, the internet has become a tool for the government\u2014and its corporate partners\u2014to monitor, control and punish the populace for behavior and speech that may be controversial but are far from criminal. Indeed, the government, a master in the art of violence, intrusion, surveillance and criminalizing harmless activities, has repeatedly attempted to clamp down on First Amendment activity on the web and in social media under the various guises of fighting terrorism, discouraging cyberbullying, and combatting violence. Police and prosecutors have also targeted 'anonymous' postings and messages on forums and websites, arguing that such anonymity encourages everything from cyber-bullying to terrorism, and have attempted to prosecute those who use anonymity for commercial or personal purposes. We would do well to tread cautiously in how much authority we give the Corporate Police State to criminalize free speech activities and chill what has become a vital free speech forum. Not only are social media and the Internet critical forums for individuals to freely share information and express their ideas, but they also serve as release valves to those who may be angry, seething, alienated or otherwise discontented. Without an outlet for their pent-up anger and frustration, these thoughts and emotions fester in secret, which is where most violent acts are born. In the same way, free speech in the public square\u2014whether it's the internet, the plaza in front of the U.S. Supreme Court or a college campus\u2014brings people together to express their grievances and challenge oppressive government regimes. Without it, democracy becomes stagnant and atrophied. Likewise, as I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People[24], if free speech is not vigilantly protected, democracy is more likely to drift toward fear, repression, and violence. In such a scenario, we will find ourselves threatened with an even more pernicious injury than violence itself: the loss of liberty. More speech, not less, is the remedy.

The rules essentially tighten how companies access and use employee data and give the latter far more control over what information their employers can collect about them. While GDPR reaches into almost all of a company's functions, some like GPS powered employee tracking are obviously more deeply affected. Since many companies use employee tracking to execute their business functions more efficiently, it's important for them to understand how GDPR will affect their workings. </p><p>So, what the *bleep* is GDPR? Complex rules like the GDPR have a way of sounding, well, complex. So, here's a simpler summary of what it is Implemented to replace the 1995 Data Protection Directive, the GDPR or General Data Protection Regulation has been implemented. The step was taken because the older rule-set was failing to keep up with the sheer pace at which technology was progressing. As a result, employee privacy was seen to be falling prey to vague language which basically entitled employers to collect and use their data as they pleased.  Some of the key changes that GDPR brings to the table include The rules now apply throughout the EU, regardless of the company's location. So, if your company is located outside the EU and are working with customers within it, your operations will need to comply. Personal data is defined as 'any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person 'data subject'; an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person.' Explicit content must be obtained which clearly outlines how the data will be used. People will have a right to access their personal data and learn more about how this data is being used. People will have a right to erasure where they can ask for certain data they own to be erased.  People will have the right to transfer their personal data from one electronic format to another. Data protection will need to be built into a business's processes for products and services, and privacy settings will need to always be at high. A full record of all processing activities will need to be maintained. Failure to comply carries more stringent punishment as well. Fines that you can incur for not being in good stead with GDPR will include First level -fines of nearly $12 million (10 million euros) or 2% of the company's worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater. Second level -fines of nearly $24 million (20 million euros) or 4% of worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater. The full ruleset is a lot more elaborate and you can find out about it here[1]. How does GDPR affect employee tracking? Since GPS based employee tracking collects all manner of personally identifiable information, they come within the purview of GDPR.  Many companies use a variety of GPS tracking solutions. For instance, logistics and transport companies that have their vehicles lowjacked with GPS trackers. Big tech companies are coming out with electronic solutions to create more interconnected, efficient workforces, too.  However, these developments blur the line between productivity and personal privacy. Add to that the prospects of companies actively GPS tracking employees[2], and it becomes increasingly apparent that stronger measures are the need of the hour. One of the bigger issues surrounding consent is that it quickly becomes a catch 22 situation for the employee. They cannot actually say no as there's always the risk of losing their job or favor with their employers.  Since consent becomes hard to work in such a case, companies will therefore need to seek one or more of five lawful grounds[3] in order to function within GDRP. These include A contract with the individual: As in if user tracking is necessary for the performance of a contract. Compliance with a legal obligation: As in if a company is legally obligated to keep track of their employees. Vital interests: As in if tracking information is required to protect someone or help them. A public task: As in if tracking will help a company fulfill an official function such as those involving the police, school or hospital. Legitimate interests: When the company has a really good reason for tracking the user, provided it doesn't trespass on the latter's rights and freedoms. How can companies uphold GDPR rules? Traversing these new rules can be tough for companies as the language in the rules itself is pretty vague to ensure the rules could be built upon by local authorities.  To mitigate any oversight and ward of those pesky lawsuits, companies need to leave a steady audit trail that details how they are collecting and handling their data periodically. Broadly speaking, you will need to answer the following questions in your audit What does our company hold? List all the systems and data types here.  Where is all this data stored? Are you using on-site servers? The cloud? Ask your IT department to provide you with a list of all the systems and their names. What is the collected data used for? Tabulate all the different data types against all the business functions they are used for. For instance, an email address can be used for marketing, sales and business intelligence.  Who can access the data? Different departments may have different uses for the data. It's best to know how your data is being used across your company.  This is an oversimplification and you will probably need to delve a lot deeper into how your organization functions in order to run an audit properly. Check out this awesome checklist on how to prepare for the GDPR[4] from the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) for a more thorough understanding.  Conclusion With the kind of technological sophistication that is making its way into our lives, regulations such as the GDPR couldn't have come sooner.  Amazon for instance, filed for a couple of patents for wristbands that will tell them when an employee has reached for a certain shelf! UPS has sensors on its trucks that can tell them when an employee has opened or shut the door or whether the engine is running or not.  As the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a more pervasive part of our lives, it will result in privacy concerns that few can deny. In times to come, regulations like GDPR will help even the odds in the employee's favor while helping companies operate better.

But the tests may not be all that beneficial for the general population, experts say.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Levi Strauss &amp; Company introduced a novel benefit for employees at its San Francisco headquarters last fall: free genetic screening to assess their hereditary risks for certain cancers and high cholesterol.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.levistrauss.com/who-we-are/leadership/chip-bergh/\">Chip Bergh</url>, Levi\u2019s chief executive, said he had hoped that the tests would spur employees to take preventive health steps and in that way reduce the company\u2019s health care costs. But even Mr. Bergh was surprised by the turnout. Of the 1,100 eligible Levi\u2019s employees, more than half took the genetic tests. Now, he wants to extend the benefit to employees in other cities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIt really is a differentiator,\u201d Mr. Bergh said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">West Coast companies vying for talent offer an unusual array of benefits like college loan repayment, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.levistrauss.com/who-we-are/leadership/chip-bergh/\">egg freezing</url>, surrogacy assistance and, for new mothers away on business trips, overnight       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.levistrauss.com/who-we-are/leadership/chip-bergh/\">breast milk shipping</url>. Some companies have added genetic screening as well, and employees are lining up for the tests.</p><p>Instacart, Nvidia, OpenTable, Salesforce, SAP, Slack, Stripe and Snap have offered the screenings as an employee benefit. So have some companies based on the East Coast, like General Electric Appliances and Visa. All of them, including Levi\u2019s, work with <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.levistrauss.com/who-we-are/leadership/chip-bergh/\">Color Genomics,</url> a start-up that has quickly become a leader in employee genetic screening and counseling.</p><p>But the use of screenings as an employee benefit is becoming more commonplace just as <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.levistrauss.com/who-we-are/leadership/chip-bergh/\">federal health agencies</url>, researchers, and physicians are wrangling over whether the tests, originally developed to establish patients\u2019 inherited risks of developing certain diseases, are ready for widespread adoption.</p><p>The tests screen for inherited gene mutations that can greatly increase a person\u2019s risk of developing diseases like colon cancer or breast cancer. Doctors now regularly suggest them for high-risk patients, such as people who have close family members with certain cancers.</p><p>But for people of average risk in the general public, a screening may not be all that useful \u2014 and could even cause harm, experts said. A person without a family history of cancer may have the same problematic mutations as high-risk patients, they said, but could have lower risk of developing cancer.</p><p>A federal advisory panel on evidence-based preventive medicine currently <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.levistrauss.com/who-we-are/leadership/chip-bergh/\">recommends against routine screening</url> for certain harmful breast cancer mutations for women who do not have cancer or a family history of cancer. The group concluded that the net benefit of routine genetic screening for these women could range from minimal to potentially harmful.</p><p>\u201cThere is exactly no evidence that systematic screening of the general healthy population for rare genetic conditions will have a net benefit in terms of health outcomes,\u201d said <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.levistrauss.com/who-we-are/leadership/chip-bergh/\">Dr. Jonathan Berg</url>, an associate professor of genetics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p><p>In fact, most cancers are not the result of the hereditary mutations in single genes that these tests detect. Some experts cautioned that extending use of the tests to the broader population may lead some people of average risk to forgo recommended screening tests like colonoscopies. And they warned that it could also lead people to undergo unnecessary medical procedures, including going to the extreme of having surgery to remove their breasts.</p><p>\u201cYou could scare the living daylights out of people unnecessarily,\u201d said Dr. Stephen J. Chanock, director of the division of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the National Cancer Institute.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration, however, recently took the opposite stance. It authorized 23andMe, a consumer genetics company that had already received agency clearance to market several hereditary disease risk tests, to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.levistrauss.com/who-we-are/leadership/chip-bergh/\">offer a test directly to consumers</url> for three breast cancer gene mutations common in people of Eastern European Jewish descent.</p><p>While regulators called their decision a step forward in the availability of direct-to-consumer genetic screening, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.levistrauss.com/who-we-are/leadership/chip-bergh/\">they explicitly warned</url> that the test did not detect most mutations that increase breast cancer risk. They also warned consumers not to use the tests as a substitute for qualified medical care and genetic counseling.</p><p>Color, the genomics company, takes something of a middle road. It markets comprehensive medical diagnostic tests that screen for all mutations of certain genes known to be linked to certain kinds of heredity cancers and heart risks. It has doctors available to order its tests online for users and provides genetic counseling to discuss users\u2019 results.</p><p>\u201cBy using genetics, you can help some people prevent or interrupt something at an earlier stage where the costs are much lower,\u201d said Othman Laraki, chief executive of Color Genomics. The start-up advises users that they could develop major diseases even if their test results show no harmful mutations.</p><p>Executives at SAP and Nvidia said they hoped genetic screening might ultimately help prevent at least a few late-stage cancers, the kinds of life-threatening illnesses that can debilitate employees and cost companies with self-funded health plans more than $1 million in medical fees.</p><p>After Nvidia began offering free screening from Color last year, about 27 percent of its 6,000 eligible employees in the United States took the test. After SAP started subsidizing the genetic tests last year, about 17 percent of the company\u2019s 30,000 eligible employees and family members participated.</p><p>\u201cIn the long-term view of a program like this, it\u2019s going to pay for itself,\u201d said Jason J. Russell, who oversees employee compensation and benefits for SAP North America. And, he added, \u201cYou are creating good will with employees.\u201d</p><p>Given the expense of screening more people of average risk \u2014 as well as follow-up costs from additional tests, medicines, surgery and potential complications from surgeries \u2014 experts said that overall medical expenditures were actually likely to increase. Even so, they said, spending on screening for conditions like hereditary high cholesterol, which increases risk for strokes and heart attacks before the age of 50, could ultimately prolong some lives.</p><p>\u201cYou are getting good preventive care value for money, \u201d said David L. Veenstra, a professor at the University of Washington who studies health outcomes and economics.</p><p>Color has raised $150 million from venture capital firms like General Catalyst as well as Bay Area tech luminaries including Max Levchin, a PayPal co-founder; Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive; and Laurene Powell Jobs, a philanthropist-investor who is the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.</p><p>The company has reduced genetic testing costs by using robotics and machine learning and eliminating tasks like in-person prescreening by doctors. It charges $249 for hereditary risk screening for eight of the most common cancers and began offering that price while more established medical diagnostics firms were charging $4,000 for similar tests.</p><p>The price point appealed to OpenTable. It started offering genetic screening benefits after an employee with a history of cancers told executives she was spending thousands of dollars out of her own pocket to pay for hereditary risk tests.</p><p>\u201cThis was a really interesting opportunity to provide some choice to our employees that was accessible and affordable so they could better understand their own personal health,\u201d said Christa Quarles, chief executive of OpenTable.</p><p>As for privacy concerns, executives at several companies said that Color regularly sent them aggregated data on the number of employees with harmful disease mutations, but that the data is not tied to identifying details like employees\u2019 names or birth dates.</p><p>As more large-scale research is conducted, medical recommendations may change. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.levistrauss.com/who-we-are/leadership/chip-bergh/\">More than 150,000 patients</url>, for instance, have enrolled in a DNA sequencing study at Geisinger Health, a medical center in Danville, Pa. And the federal advisory panel is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.levistrauss.com/who-we-are/leadership/chip-bergh/\">updating its recommendation</url> on genetic screening for certain breast cancer mutations.</p><p>Executives at several companies that have signed up with Color said they were aware of the debate over genetic screening, but said they believed the start-up was simply ahead of the curve.</p><p>\u201cOver time, innovation becomes consensus science,\u201d said Mr. Russell of SAP.</p><p>PHOTO: The start-up Color Genomics has quickly become a leader in employee genetic screening and counseling.

Two years later, she found herself facing a moral dilemma.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clarifai was developing aerial photography and object detection tools as one of several companies working on Project Maven, a Pentagon drone surveillance program. After several conversations with friends and colleagues, O'Sullivan realized this type of technology eventually could be used for autonomous weapons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In January, she wrote to Clarifai CEO Matt Zeiler on behalf of a group of employees, seeking clarification on whether the technology would be used to create weapons and asking him to commit to a series of ethical measures. Zeiler later explained at a meeting that Clarifai likely would provide tech for autonomous weapons. O'Sullivan quit the next day.</p><p>\"I was very surprised and had to follow my conscience,\" she said. Zeiler and Clarifai didn't respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press, though Zeiler has previously said the company's Project Maven involvement aligns with its mission of accelerating human progress with continually improving AI.</p><p>O'Sullivan, 34, considers herself part of a \"growing backlash against unethical tech,\" a groundswell in the past two years in which U.S. tech employees have tried to remake the industry from the inside out - pushing for more control over how their work is used and urging better conditions, job security and wages for affiliated workers.</p><p>While some speak out and others sign petitions and attend rallies, workers are collectively taking action like never before:</p><p>- Amazon and Microsoft employees demanded the companies stop providing services to software company Palantir, which provides technology to federal agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Army.</p><p>- Amazon employees also have urged the company to transition to renewable energy and confronted CEO Jeff Bezos at a shareholder meeting.</p><p>- Following last year's walkouts over Google's handling of sexual misconduct cases, employees signed a letter protesting Project Dragonfly, a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship.</p><p>- Staff at Salesforce, Microsoft and Google have protested their companies' ties to Customs and Border Protection, ICE and the military.</p><p>Despite six-figure salaries and unlimited vacation time, many tech workers are questioning the effects of their work and joining forces with their more precarious blue-collar, service and contract-worker counterparts, pressing for better work conditions and pay.</p><p>\"It's unprecedented, both the magnitude of the power of these companies and the willingness of white-collar employees to shake themselves of the privilege that they have and to really see the impact of the work they're doing,\" said Veena Dubal, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law who has interviewed dozens of tech workers involved in organizing.</p><p>They're feeling emboldened because of national and global \"existential crises\" and the realization that tech companies \"have more power than any multinational corporation has had in a long time,\" Dubal said.</p><p>The phenomenon is particularly strong in the San Francisco Bay Area, home to Salesforce, Google and Palantir, among others. The bastion of activism and progressive culture has been hit hard by the tech boom's housing affordability crisis.</p><p>\"There's a lot of power (that) people are being asked to build for the shareholders of these companies and the management of these companies,\" said Ian Busher, 28, a former contract analyst for Google and an organizer with the Bay Area chapter of Democratic Socialists of America. \"If you want to make the world a better place, you should exercise judgment and democracy with the people you're working with to build these tools.\"</p><p>Facebook and Palantir did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on employee activism but noted the Seattle-based company is committed to sustainability and said it provides good pay and benefits and humane conditions at its warehouses. At the stakeholder meeting, Bezos didn't directly address employees' renewable energy demands but referred to some sustainability efforts already underway.</p><p>A Microsoft spokesperson said the company, headquartered in the Seattle area, appreciates employee feedback, respects differing views and provides \"many avenues for all voices to be heard.\"</p><p>A Google spokesperson did not comment on specific incidents but emphasized that retaliation is prohibited and pointed to CEO Sundar Pichai's previous statements on worker dissent.</p><p>\"There are many things good about giving employees a lot of voice,\" he said at a November conference. \"There are decisions we make which they may not agree with.\"</p><p>Congress has begun to aggressively scrutinize the industry in recent years, and the Justice Department last month launched an investigation into big tech companies amid antitrust allegations. A recent Pew Research Center survey indicated Americans have an increasingly negative view of tech's effect on the country.</p><p>\"As an employee in the tech sector right now, there is a fair bit of guilt or (asking), 'What is my responsibility?'\" said Kellie McElhaney, a professor at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.</p><p>Amr Gaber, 32, a Google engineer, was among several tech workers at a July demonstration in front of Facebook's San Francisco office supporting cafeteria workers seeking a new contract. He said although the white-collar workers are more privileged, they're all working people.</p><p>\"Our fortunes are tied together,\" Gaber said. \"If the (companies) can't even treat the people who work for them well, then how can we expect them to have a positive impact on society?\"</p><p>There's evidence companies are listening.</p><p>Google and Facebook pledged to pay contract workers better and provide some benefits. Google ended forced arbitration for sexual misconduct cases after its employees walked out.

Two years later, she found herself facing a moral dilemma.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clarifai was developing aerial photography and object detection tools as one of several companies working on Project Maven, a Pentagon drone surveillance program. After several conversations with friends and colleagues, O'Sullivan realized this type of technology eventually could be used for autonomous weapons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In January, she wrote to Clarifai CEO Matt Zeiler on behalf of a group of employees, seeking clarification on whether the technology would be used to create weapons and asking him to commit to a series of ethical measures. Zeiler later explained at a meeting that Clarifai likely would provide tech for autonomous weapons. O'Sullivan quit the next day.</p><p>\"I was very surprised and had to follow my conscience,\" she said. Zeiler and Clarifai didn't respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press, though Zeiler has previously said the company's Project Maven involvement aligns with its mission of accelerating human progress with continually improving AI.</p><p>O'Sullivan, 34, considers herself part of a \"growing backlash against unethical tech,\" a groundswell in the past two years in which U.S. tech employees have tried to remake the industry from the inside out - pushing for more control over how their work is used and urging better conditions, job security and wages for affiliated workers.</p><p>While some speak out and others sign petitions and attend rallies, workers are collectively taking action like never before:</p><p>- Amazon and Microsoft employees demanded the companies stop providing services to software company Palantir, which provides technology to federal agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Army.</p><p>- Amazon employees also have urged the company to transition to renewable energy and confronted CEO Jeff Bezos at a shareholder meeting.</p><p>- Following last year's walkouts over Google's handling of sexual misconduct cases, employees signed a letter protesting Project Dragonfly, a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship.</p><p>- Staff at Salesforce, Microsoft and Google have protested their companies' ties to Customs and Border Protection, ICE and the military.</p><p>Despite six-figure salaries and unlimited vacation time, many tech workers are questioning the effects of their work and joining forces with their more precarious blue-collar, service and contract-worker counterparts, pressing for better work conditions and pay.</p><p>\"It's unprecedented, both the magnitude of the power of these companies and the willingness of white-collar employees to shake themselves of the privilege that they have and to really see the impact of the work they're doing,\" said Veena Dubal, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law who has interviewed dozens of tech workers involved in organizing.</p><p>They're feeling emboldened because of national and global \"existential crises\" and the realization that tech companies \"have more power than any multinational corporation has had in a long time,\" Dubal said.</p><p>The phenomenon is particularly strong in the San Francisco Bay Area, home to Salesforce, Google and Palantir, among others. The bastion of activism and progressive culture has been hit hard by the tech boom's housing affordability crisis.</p><p>\"There's a lot of power (that) people are being asked to build for the shareholders of these companies and the management of these companies,\" said Ian Busher, 28, a former contract analyst for Google and an organizer with the Bay Area chapter of Democratic Socialists of America. \"If you want to make the world a better place, you should exercise judgment and democracy with the people you're working with to build these tools.\"</p><p>Facebook and Palantir did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on employee activism but noted the Seattle-based company is committed to sustainability and said it provides good pay and benefits and humane conditions at its warehouses. At the stakeholder meeting, Bezos didn't directly address employees' renewable energy demands but referred to some sustainability efforts already underway.</p><p>A Microsoft spokesperson said the company, headquartered in the Seattle area, appreciates employee feedback, respects differing views and provides \"many avenues for all voices to be heard.\"</p><p>A Google spokesperson did not comment on specific incidents but emphasized that retaliation is prohibited and pointed to CEO Sundar Pichai's previous statements on worker dissent.</p><p>\"There are many things good about giving employees a lot of voice,\" he said at a November conference. \"There are decisions we make which they may not agree with.\"</p><p>Congress has begun to aggressively scrutinize the industry in recent years, and the Justice Department last month launched an investigation into big tech companies amid antitrust allegations. A recent Pew Research Center survey indicated Americans have an increasingly negative view of tech's effect on the country.</p><p>\"As an employee in the tech sector right now, there is a fair bit of guilt or (asking), 'What is my responsibility?'\" said Kellie McElhaney, a professor at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.</p><p>Amr Gaber, 32, a Google engineer, was among several tech workers at a July demonstration in front of Facebook's San Francisco office supporting cafeteria workers seeking a new contract. He said although the white-collar workers are more privileged, they're all working people.</p><p>\"Our fortunes are tied together,\" Gaber said. \"If the (companies) can't even treat the people who work for them well, then how can we expect them to have a positive impact on society?\"</p><p>There's evidence companies are listening.</p><p>Google and Facebook pledged to pay contract workers better and provide some benefits. Google ended forced arbitration for sexual misconduct cases after its employees walked out. Following employee outcry, Google declined to renew its contract with the Pentagon for work on Project Maven.</p><p>When employees asked Microsoft to cancel its contract with ICE, CEO Satya Nadella clarified that the company was not contributing to family separations at the border but supporting email, calendar and document systems.</p><p>A Salesforce spokesperson said conversations with employees led the company to create the Office of Ethical and Humane Use of Technology and \"hire a chief ethical and humane use officer to develop guidelines and evaluate situations around the ethical use and development of our technology.\"</p><p>In the wake of concerns about tech's impact on the Bay Area housing crisis, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff this year gave $30 million to UC San Francisco to research homelessness, after donating $6 million to the city last year to help provide supportive housing for the formerly homeless. Pichai, Google's CEO, also pledged $1 billion to build 20,000 homes over a decade.</p><p>Such responsiveness is good for business and for building trust with customers and employees who are more inclined to express their demands, according to McElhaney.</p><p>\"Those who are not responding are ... missing a huge ocean liner that's already left the dock,\" she said.</p><p>Still, some tech workers say the companies' efforts fall short. In some cases, employees have said they've seen or experienced retaliation after they or others have spoken out.</p><p>\"We say that tech workers have a lot of power, but tech executives have more,\" said O'Sullivan, who quit on principle and now has a job at a young tech company pursuing transparency in the use of artificial intelligence. \"The best way to impact change is through legislation and regulation.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Two years later, she found herself facing a moral dilemma.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clarifai was developing aerial photography and object detection tools as one of several companies working on Project Maven, a Pentagon drone surveillance program. After several conversations with friends and colleagues, O'Sullivan realized this type of technology eventually could be used for autonomous weapons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In January, she wrote to Clarifai CEO Matt Zeiler on behalf of a group of employees, seeking clarification on whether the technology would be used to create weapons and asking him to commit to a series of ethical measures. Zeiler later explained at a meeting that Clarifai likely would provide tech for autonomous weapons. O'Sullivan quit the next day.</p><p>\"I was very surprised and had to follow my conscience,\" she said. Zeiler and Clarifai didn't respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press, though Zeiler has previously said the company's Project Maven involvement aligns with its mission of accelerating human progress with continually improving AI.</p><p>O'Sullivan, 34, considers herself part of a \"growing backlash against unethical tech,\" a groundswell in the past two years in which U.S. tech employees have tried to remake the industry from the inside out - pushing for more control over how their work is used and urging better conditions, job security and wages for affiliated workers.</p><p>While some speak out and others sign petitions and attend rallies, workers are collectively taking action like never before:</p><p>- Amazon and Microsoft employees demanded the companies stop providing services to software company Palantir, which provides technology to federal agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Army.</p><p>- Amazon employees also have urged the company to transition to renewable energy and confronted CEO Jeff Bezos at a shareholder meeting.</p><p>- Following last year's walkouts over Google's handling of sexual misconduct cases, employees signed a letter protesting Project Dragonfly, a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship.</p><p>- Staff at Salesforce, Microsoft and Google have protested their companies' ties to Customs and Border Protection, ICE and the military.</p><p>Despite six-figure salaries and unlimited vacation time, many tech workers are questioning the effects of their work and joining forces with their more precarious blue-collar, service and contract-worker counterparts, pressing for better work conditions and pay.</p><p>\"It's unprecedented, both the magnitude of the power of these companies and the willingness of white-collar employees to shake themselves of the privilege that they have and to really see the impact of the work they're doing,\" said Veena Dubal, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law who has interviewed dozens of tech workers involved in organizing.</p><p>They're feeling emboldened because of national and global \"existential crises\" and the realization that tech companies \"have more power than any multinational corporation has had in a long time,\" Dubal said.</p><p>The phenomenon is particularly strong in the San Francisco Bay Area, home to Salesforce, Google and Palantir, among others. The bastion of activism and progressive culture has been hit hard by the tech boom's housing affordability crisis.</p><p>\"There's a lot of power (that) people are being asked to build for the shareholders of these companies and the management of these companies,\" said Ian Busher, 28, a former contract analyst for Google and an organizer with the Bay Area chapter of Democratic Socialists of America. \"If you want to make the world a better place, you should exercise judgment and democracy with the people you're working with to build these tools.\"</p><p>Facebook and Palantir did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on employee activism but noted the Seattle-based company is committed to sustainability and said it provides good pay and benefits and humane conditions at its warehouses. At the stakeholder meeting, Bezos didn't directly address employees' renewable energy demands but referred to some sustainability efforts already underway.</p><p>A Microsoft spokesperson said the company, headquartered in the Seattle area, appreciates employee feedback, respects differing views and provides \"many avenues for all voices to be heard.\"</p><p>A Google spokesperson did not comment on specific incidents but emphasized that retaliation is prohibited and pointed to CEO Sundar Pichai's previous statements on worker dissent.</p><p>\"There are many things good about giving employees a lot of voice,\" he said at a November conference. \"There are decisions we make which they may not agree with.\"</p><p>Congress has begun to aggressively scrutinize the industry in recent years, and the Justice Department last month launched an investigation into big tech companies amid antitrust allegations. A recent Pew Research Center survey indicated Americans have an increasingly negative view of tech's effect on the country.</p><p>\"As an employee in the tech sector right now, there is a fair bit of guilt or (asking), 'What is my responsibility?'\" said Kellie McElhaney, a professor at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.</p><p>Amr Gaber, 32, a Google engineer, was among several tech workers at a July demonstration in front of Facebook's San Francisco office supporting cafeteria workers seeking a new contract. He said although the white-collar workers are more privileged, they're all working people.</p><p>\"Our fortunes are tied together,\" Gaber said. \"If the (companies) can't even treat the people who work for them well, then how can we expect them to have a positive impact on society?\"</p><p>There's evidence companies are listening.</p><p>Google and Facebook pledged to pay contract workers better and provide some benefits. Google ended forced arbitration for sexual misconduct cases after its employees walked out. Following employee outcry, Google declined to renew its contract with the Pentagon for work on Project Maven.</p><p>When employees asked Microsoft to cancel its contract with ICE, CEO Satya Nadella clarified that the company was not contributing to family separations at the border but supporting email, calendar and document systems.</p><p>A Salesforce spokesperson said conversations with employees led the company to create the Office of Ethical and Humane Use of Technology and \"hire a chief ethical and humane use officer to develop guidelines and evaluate situations around the ethical use and development of our technology.\"</p><p>In the wake of concerns about tech's impact on the Bay Area housing crisis, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff this year gave $30 million to UC San Francisco to research homelessness, after donating $6 million to the city last year to help provide supportive housing for the formerly homeless. Pichai, Google's CEO, also pledged $1 billion to build 20,000 homes over a decade.</p><p>Such responsiveness is good for business and for building trust with customers and employees who are more inclined to express their demands, according to McElhaney.</p><p>\"Those who are not responding are ... missing a huge ocean liner that's already left the dock,\" she said.</p><p>Still, some tech workers say the companies' efforts fall short. In some cases, employees have said they've seen or experienced retaliation after they or others have spoken out.</p><p>\"We say that tech workers have a lot of power, but tech executives have more,\" said O'Sullivan, who quit on principle and now has a job at a young tech company pursuing transparency in the use of artificial intelligence. \"The best way to impact change is through legislation and regulation.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Two years later, she found herself facing a moral dilemma.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clarifai was developing aerial photography and object detection tools as one of several companies working on Project Maven, a Pentagon drone surveillance program. After several conversations with friends and colleagues, O'Sullivan realized this type of technology eventually could be used for autonomous weapons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In January, she wrote to Clarifai CEO Matt Zeiler on behalf of a group of employees, seeking clarification on whether the technology would be used to create weapons and asking him to commit to a series of ethical measures. Zeiler later explained at a meeting that Clarifai likely would provide tech for autonomous weapons. O'Sullivan quit the next day.</p><p>\"I was very surprised and had to follow my conscience,\" she said. Zeiler and Clarifai didn't respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press, though Zeiler has previously said the company's Project Maven involvement aligns with its mission of accelerating human progress with continually improving AI.</p><p>O'Sullivan, 34, considers herself part of a \"growing backlash against unethical tech,\" a groundswell in the past two years in which U.S. tech employees have tried to remake the industry from the inside out - pushing for more control over how their work is used and urging better conditions, job security and wages for affiliated workers.</p><p>While some speak out and others sign petitions and attend rallies, workers are collectively taking action like never before:</p><p>- Amazon and Microsoft employees demanded the companies stop providing services to software company Palantir, which provides technology to federal agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Army.</p><p>- Amazon employees also have urged the company to transition to renewable energy and confronted CEO Jeff Bezos at a shareholder meeting.</p><p>- Following last year's walkouts over Google's handling of sexual misconduct cases, employees signed a letter protesting Project Dragonfly, a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship.</p><p>- Staff at Salesforce, Microsoft and Google have protested their companies' ties to Customs and Border Protection, ICE and the military.</p><p>Despite six-figure salaries and unlimited vacation time, many tech workers are questioning the effects of their work and joining forces with their more precarious blue-collar, service and contract-worker counterparts, pressing for better work conditions and pay.</p><p>\"It's unprecedented, both the magnitude of the power of these companies and the willingness of white-collar employees to shake themselves of the privilege that they have and to really see the impact of the work they're doing,\" said Veena Dubal, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law who has interviewed dozens of tech workers involved in organizing.</p><p>They're feeling emboldened because of national and global \"existential crises\" and the realization that tech companies \"have more power than any multinational corporation has had in a long time,\" Dubal said.</p><p>The phenomenon is particularly strong in the San Francisco Bay Area, home to Salesforce, Google and Palantir, among others. The bastion of activism and progressive culture has been hit hard by the tech boom's housing affordability crisis.</p><p>\"There's a lot of power (that) people are being asked to build for the shareholders of these companies and the management of these companies,\" said Ian Busher, 28, a former contract analyst for Google and an organizer with the Bay Area chapter of Democratic Socialists of America. \"If you want to make the world a better place, you should exercise judgment and democracy with the people you're working with to build these tools.\"</p><p>Facebook and Palantir did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on employee activism but noted the Seattle-based company is committed to sustainability and said it provides good pay and benefits and humane conditions at its warehouses. At the stakeholder meeting, Bezos didn't directly address employees' renewable energy demands but referred to some sustainability efforts already underway.</p><p>A Microsoft spokesperson said the company, headquartered in the Seattle area, appreciates employee feedback, respects differing views and provides \"many avenues for all voices to be heard.\"</p><p>A Google spokesperson did not comment on specific incidents but emphasized that retaliation is prohibited and pointed to CEO Sundar Pichai's previous statements on worker dissent.</p><p>\"There are many things good about giving employees a lot of voice,\" he said at a November conference. \"There are decisions we make which they may not agree with.\"</p><p>Congress has begun to aggressively scrutinize the industry in recent years, and the Justice Department last month launched an investigation into big tech companies amid antitrust allegations. A recent Pew Research Center survey indicated Americans have an increasingly negative view of tech's effect on the country.</p><p>\"As an employee in the tech sector right now, there is a fair bit of guilt or (asking), 'What is my responsibility?'\" said Kellie McElhaney, a professor at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.</p><p>Amr Gaber, 32, a Google engineer, was among several tech workers at a July demonstration in front of Facebook's San Francisco office supporting cafeteria workers seeking a new contract. He said although the white-collar workers are more privileged, they're all working people.</p><p>\"Our fortunes are tied together,\" Gaber said. \"If the (companies) can't even treat the people who work for them well, then how can we expect them to have a positive impact on society?\"</p><p>There's evidence companies are listening.</p><p>Google and Facebook pledged to pay contract workers better and provide some benefits. Google ended forced arbitration for sexual misconduct cases after its employees walked out. Following employee outcry, Google declined to renew its contract with the Pentagon for work on Project Maven.</p><p>When employees asked Microsoft to cancel its contract with ICE, CEO Satya Nadella clarified that the company was not contributing to family separations at the border but supporting email, calendar and document systems.</p><p>A Salesforce spokesperson said conversations with employees led the company to create the Office of Ethical and Humane Use of Technology and \"hire a chief ethical and humane use officer to develop guidelines and evaluate situations around the ethical use and development of our technology.\"</p><p>In the wake of concerns about tech's impact on the Bay Area housing crisis, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff this year gave $30 million to UC San Francisco to research homelessness, after donating $6 million to the city last year to help provide supportive housing for the formerly homeless. Pichai, Google's CEO, also pledged $1 billion to build 20,000 homes over a decade.</p><p>Such responsiveness is good for business and for building trust with customers and employees who are more inclined to express their demands, according to McElhaney.</p><p>\"Those who are not responding are ... missing a huge ocean liner that's already left the dock,\" she said.</p><p>Still, some tech workers say the companies' efforts fall short. In some cases, employees have said they've seen or experienced retaliation after they or others have spoken out.</p><p>\"We say that tech workers have a lot of power, but tech executives have more,\" said O'Sullivan, who quit on principle and now has a job at a young tech company pursuing transparency in the use of artificial intelligence. \"The best way to impact change is through legislation and regulation.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Two years later, she found herself facing a moral dilemma.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clarifai was developing aerial photography and object detection tools as one of several companies working on Project Maven, a Pentagon drone surveillance program. After several conversations with friends and colleagues, O'Sullivan realized this type of technology eventually could be used for autonomous weapons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In January, she wrote to Clarifai CEO Matt Zeiler on behalf of a group of employees, seeking clarification on whether the technology would be used to create weapons and asking him to commit to a series of ethical measures. Zeiler later explained at a meeting that Clarifai likely would provide tech for autonomous weapons. O'Sullivan quit the next day.</p><p>\"I was very surprised and had to follow my conscience,\" she said. Zeiler and Clarifai didn't respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press, though Zeiler has previously said the company's Project Maven involvement aligns with its mission of accelerating human progress with continually improving AI.</p><p>O'Sullivan, 34, considers herself part of a \"growing backlash against unethical tech,\" a groundswell in the past two years in which U.S. tech employees have tried to remake the industry from the inside out - pushing for more control over how their work is used and urging better conditions, job security and wages for affiliated workers.</p><p>While some speak out and others sign petitions and attend rallies, workers are collectively taking action like never before:</p><p>- Amazon and Microsoft employees demanded the companies stop providing services to software company Palantir, which provides technology to federal agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Army.</p><p>- Amazon employees also have urged the company to transition to renewable energy and confronted CEO Jeff Bezos at a shareholder meeting.</p><p>- Following last year's walkouts over Google's handling of sexual misconduct cases, employees signed a letter protesting Project Dragonfly, a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship.</p><p>- Staff at Salesforce, Microsoft and Google have protested their companies' ties to Customs and Border Protection, ICE and the military.</p><p>Despite six-figure salaries and unlimited vacation time, many tech workers are questioning the effects of their work and joining forces with their more precarious blue-collar, service and contract-worker counterparts, pressing for better work conditions and pay.</p><p>\"It's unprecedented, both the magnitude of the power of these companies and the willingness of white-collar employees to shake themselves of the privilege that they have and to really see the impact of the work they're doing,\" said Veena Dubal, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law who has interviewed dozens of tech workers involved in organizing.</p><p>They're feeling emboldened because of national and global \"existential crises\" and the realization that tech companies \"have more power than any multinational corporation has had in a long time,\" Dubal said.</p><p>The phenomenon is particularly strong in the San Francisco Bay Area, home to Salesforce, Google and Palantir, among others. The bastion of activism and progressive culture has been hit hard by the tech boom's housing affordability crisis.</p><p>\"There's a lot of power (that) people are being asked to build for the shareholders of these companies and the management of these companies,\" said Ian Busher, 28, a former contract analyst for Google and an organizer with the Bay Area chapter of Democratic Socialists of America. \"If you want to make the world a better place, you should exercise judgment and democracy with the people you're working with to build these tools.\"</p><p>Facebook and Palantir did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on employee activism but noted the Seattle-based company is committed to sustainability and said it provides good pay and benefits and humane conditions at its warehouses. At the stakeholder meeting, Bezos didn't directly address employees' renewable energy demands but referred to some sustainability efforts already underway.</p><p>A Microsoft spokesperson said the company, headquartered in the Seattle area, appreciates employee feedback, respects differing views and provides \"many avenues for all voices to be heard.\"</p><p>A Google spokesperson did not comment on specific incidents but emphasized that retaliation is prohibited and pointed to CEO Sundar Pichai's previous statements on worker dissent.</p><p>\"There are many things good about giving employees a lot of voice,\" he said at a November conference. \"There are decisions we make which they may not agree with.\"</p><p>Congress has begun to aggressively scrutinize the industry in recent years, and the Justice Department last month launched an investigation into big tech companies amid antitrust allegations. A recent Pew Research Center survey indicated Americans have an increasingly negative view of tech's effect on the country.</p><p>\"As an employee in the tech sector right now, there is a fair bit of guilt or (asking), 'What is my responsibility?'\" said Kellie McElhaney, a professor at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.</p><p>Amr Gaber, 32, a Google engineer, was among several tech workers at a July demonstration in front of Facebook's San Francisco office supporting cafeteria workers seeking a new contract. He said although the white-collar workers are more privileged, they're all working people.</p><p>\"Our fortunes are tied together,\" Gaber said. \"If the (companies) can't even treat the people who work for them well, then how can we expect them to have a positive impact on society?\"</p><p>There's evidence companies are listening.</p><p>Google and Facebook pledged to pay contract workers better and provide some benefits. Google ended forced arbitration for sexual misconduct cases after its employees walked out. Following employee outcry, Google declined to renew its contract with the Pentagon for work on Project Maven.</p><p>When employees asked Microsoft to cancel its contract with ICE, CEO Satya Nadella clarified that the company was not contributing to family separations at the border but supporting email, calendar and document systems.</p><p>A Salesforce spokesperson said conversations with employees led the company to create the Office of Ethical and Humane Use of Technology and \"hire a chief ethical and humane use officer to develop guidelines and evaluate situations around the ethical use and development of our technology.\"</p><p>In the wake of concerns about tech's impact on the Bay Area housing crisis, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff this year gave $30 million to UC San Francisco to research homelessness, after donating $6 million to the city last year to help provide supportive housing for the formerly homeless. Pichai, Google's CEO, also pledged $1 billion to build 20,000 homes over a decade.</p><p>Such responsiveness is good for business and for building trust with customers and employees who are more inclined to express their demands, according to McElhaney.</p><p>\"Those who are not responding are ... missing a huge ocean liner that's already left the dock,\" she said.</p><p>Still, some tech workers say the companies' efforts fall short. In some cases, employees have said they've seen or experienced retaliation after they or others have spoken out.</p><p>\"We say that tech workers have a lot of power, but tech executives have more,\" said O'Sullivan, who quit on principle and now has a job at a young tech company pursuing transparency in the use of artificial intelligence. \"The best way to impact change is through legislation and regulation.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Two years later, she found herself facing a moral dilemma.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clarifai was developing aerial photography and object detection tools as one of several companies working on Project Maven, a Pentagon drone surveillance program. After several conversations with friends and colleagues, O'Sullivan realized this type of technology eventually could be used for autonomous weapons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In January, she wrote to Clarifai CEO Matt Zeiler on behalf of a group of employees, seeking clarification on whether the technology would be used to create weapons and asking him to commit to a series of ethical measures. Zeiler later explained at a meeting that Clarifai likely would provide tech for autonomous weapons. O'Sullivan quit the next day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"I was very surprised and had to follow my conscience,\" she said. Zeiler and Clarifai didn't respond to a request for comment from the Associated Press, though Zeiler has previously said the company's Project Maven involvement aligns with its mission of accelerating human progress with continually improving AI.</p><p> O'Sullivan, 34, considers herself part of a \"growing backlash against unethical tech,\" a groundswell in the past two years in which U.S. tech employees have tried to remake the industry from the inside out \u2014 pushing for more control over how their work is used and urging better conditions, job security and wages for affiliated workers.</p><p> While some speak out and others sign petitions and attend rallies, workers are collectively taking action like never before:</p><p>Amazon and Microsoft employees demanded the companies stop providing services to software company Palantir, which provides technology to federal agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Army.</p><p>Amazon employees also have urged the company to transition to renewable energy and confronted CEO Jeff Bezos at a shareholder meeting.</p><p>   Following last year's walkouts over Google's handling of sexual misconduct cases, employees signed a letter protesting Project Dragonfly, a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship.</p><p>   Staff at Salesforce, Microsoft and Google have protested their companies' ties to Customs and Border Protection, ICE and the military.</p><p> Despite six-figure salaries and unlimited vacation time, many tech workers are questioning the effects of their work and joining forces with their more precarious blue-collar, service and contract-worker counterparts, pressing for better work conditions and pay.</p><p> \"It's unprecedented, both the magnitude of the power of these companies and the willingness of white-collar employees to shake themselves of the privilege that they have and to really see the impact of the work they're doing,\" said Veena Dubal, a professor at UC Hastings College of the Law who has interviewed dozens of tech workers involved in organizing.</p><p> They're feeling emboldened because of national and global \"existential crises\" and the realization that tech companies \"have more power than any multinational corporation has had in a long time,\" Dubal said.</p><p> The phenomenon is particularly strong in the Bay Area, home to Salesforce, Facebook, Google and Palantir, among others. The bastion of activism and progressive culture has been hit hard by the tech boom's housing affordability crisis.</p><p> \"There's a lot of power (that) people are being asked to build for the shareholders of these companies and the management of these companies,\" said Ian Busher, 28, a former contract analyst for Google and an organizer with the Bay Area chapter of Democratic Socialists of America. \"If you want to make the world a better place, you should exercise judgment and democracy with the people you're working with to build these tools.\"</p><p> An Amazon representative declined to comment on employee activism but noted the company is committed to sustainability and said it provides good pay and benefits and humane conditions at its warehouses.</p><p> A Microsoft representative said the company appreciates employee feedback, respects differing views and provides \"many avenues for all voices to be heard.\"</p><p> A Google spokesperson did not comment on specific incidents but emphasized that retaliation is prohibited and pointed to CEO Sundar Pichai's previous statements on worker dissent.</p><p> \"There are many things good about giving employees a lot of voice,\" he said at a November conference. \"There are decisions we make which they may not agree with.\"</p><p>Facebook and Palantir did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Congress has begun to aggressively scrutinize the industry in recent years, and the Justice Department began an investigation in July into big tech companies amid antitrust allegations. A recent Pew Research Center survey indicated Americans have an increasingly negative view of tech's effect on the country.</p><p> \"As an employee in the tech sector right now, there is a fair bit of guilt or (asking), 'What is my responsibility?'\" said Kellie McElhaney, a professor at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.</p><p> Amr Gaber, 32, a Google engineer, was among several tech workers at a July demonstration in front of Facebook's San Francisco office supporting cafeteria workers seeking a new contract. He said although the white-collar workers are more privileged, they're all working people.</p><p> \"Our fortunes are tied together,\" Gaber said. \"If the (companies) can't even treat the people who work for them well, then how can we expect them to have a positive impact on society?\"</p><p> There's evidence companies are listening.</p><p>Google and Facebook pledged to pay contract workers better and provide some benefits. Google ended forced arbitration for sexual misconduct cases after its employees walked out. Following employee outcry, Google declined to renew its contract with the Pentagon for work on Project Maven.</p><p> When employees asked Microsoft to cancel its contract with ICE, CEO Satya Nadella clarified that the company was not contributing to family separations at the border but supporting email, calendar and document systems.</p><p> A Salesforce spokesperson said conversations with employees led the company to create the Office of Ethical and Humane Use of Technology and \"hire a chief ethical and humane use officer to develop guidelines and evaluate situations around the ethical use and development of our technology.\"</p><p> In the wake of concerns about tech's impact on the Bay Area housing crisis, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff this year gave $30 million to UCSF to research homelessness, after donating $6 million to the city last year to help provide supportive housing for the formerly homeless. Pichai, Google's CEO, also pledged $1 billion to build 20,000 homes over a decade.</p><p> Still, some tech workers say the companies' efforts fall short. In some cases, employees have said they've seen or experienced retaliation after they or others have spoken out.</p><p> \"We say that tech workers have a lot of power, but tech executives have more,\" said O'Sullivan, who quit on principle and now has a job at a young tech company pursuing transparency in the use of artificial intelligence. \"The best way to impact change is through legislation and regulation.\"</p><p> Samantha Maldonado is an Associated Press writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-f980b3b73c333900429ffc78b1163e6b4a153d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYH-PD81-JBCN-42HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1223\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Two years later, she found herself facing a moral dilemma.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clarifai was developing aerial photography and object detection tools as one of several companies working on Project Maven, a Pentagon drone surveillance program. After several conversations with friends and colleagues, O'Sullivan realized this type of technology eventually could be used for autonomous weapons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In January, she wrote to Clarifai CEO Matt Zeiler on behalf of a group of employees, seeking clarification on whether the technology would be used to create weapons and asking him to commit to a series of ethical measures. Zeiler later explained at a meeting that Clarifai likely would provide tech for autonomous weapons. O'Sullivan quit the next day.</p><p>\"I was very surprised and had to follow my conscience,\" she said. Zeiler and Clarifai didn't respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press, though Zeiler has previously said the company's Project Maven involvement aligns with its mission of accelerating human progress with continually improving AI.</p><p>O'Sullivan, 34, considers herself part of a \"growing backlash against unethical tech,\" a groundswell in the past two years in which U.S. tech employees have tried to remake the industry from the inside out - pushing for more control over how their work is used and urging better conditions, job security and wages for affiliated workers.</p><p>While some speak out and others sign petitions and attend rallies, workers are collectively taking action like never before:</p><p>- Amazon and Microsoft employees demanded the companies stop providing services to software company Palantir, which provides technology to federal agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Army.</p><p>- Amazon employees also have urged the company to transition to renewable energy and confronted CEO Jeff Bezos at a shareholder meeting.</p><p>- Following last year's walkouts over Google's handling of sexual misconduct cases, employees signed a letter protesting Project Dragonfly, a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship.</p><p>- Staff at Salesforce, Microsoft and Google have protested their companies' ties to Customs and Border Protection, ICE and the military.</p><p>Despite six-figure salaries and unlimited vacation time, many tech workers are questioning the effects of their work and joining forces with their more precarious blue-collar, service and contract-worker counterparts, pressing for better work conditions and pay.</p><p>\"It's unprecedented, both the magnitude of the power of these companies and the willingness of white-collar employees to shake themselves of the privilege that they have and to really see the impact of the work they're doing,\" said Veena Dubal, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law who has interviewed dozens of tech workers involved in organizing.</p><p>They're feeling emboldened because of national and global \"existential crises\" and the realization that tech companies \"have more power than any multinational corporation has had in a long time,\" Dubal said.</p><p>The phenomenon is particularly strong in the San Francisco Bay Area, home to Salesforce, Google and Palantir, among others. The bastion of activism and progressive culture has been hit hard by the tech boom's housing affordability crisis.</p><p>\"There's a lot of power (that) people are being asked to build for the shareholders of these companies and the management of these companies,\" said Ian Busher, 28, a former contract analyst for Google and an organizer with the Bay Area chapter of Democratic Socialists of America. \"If you want to make the world a better place, you should exercise judgment and democracy with the people you're working with to build these tools.\"</p><p>Facebook and Palantir did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on employee activism but noted the Seattle-based company is committed to sustainability and said it provides good pay and benefits and humane conditions at its warehouses. At the stakeholder meeting, Bezos didn't directly address employees' renewable energy demands but referred to some sustainability efforts already underway.</p><p>A Microsoft spokesperson said the company, headquartered in the Seattle area, appreciates employee feedback, respects differing views and provides \"many avenues for all voices to be heard.\"</p><p>A Google spokesperson did not comment on specific incidents but emphasized that retaliation is prohibited and pointed to CEO Sundar Pichai's previous statements on worker dissent.</p><p>\"There are many things good about giving employees a lot of voice,\" he said at a November conference. \"There are decisions we make which they may not agree with.\"</p><p>Congress has begun to aggressively scrutinize the industry in recent years, and the Justice Department last month launched an investigation into big tech companies amid antitrust allegations. A recent Pew Research Center survey indicated Americans have an increasingly negative view of tech's effect on the country.</p><p>\"As an employee in the tech sector right now, there is a fair bit of guilt or (asking), 'What is my responsibility?'\" said Kellie McElhaney, a professor at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.</p><p>Amr Gaber, 32, a Google engineer, was among several tech workers at a July demonstration in front of Facebook's San Francisco office supporting cafeteria workers seeking a new contract. He said although the white-collar workers are more privileged, they're all working people.</p><p>\"Our fortunes are tied together,\" Gaber said. \"If the (companies) can't even treat the people who work for them well, then how can we expect them to have a positive impact on society?\"</p><p>There's evidence companies are listening.</p><p>Google and Facebook pledged to pay contract workers better and provide some benefits. Google ended forced arbitration for sexual misconduct cases after its employees walked out. Following employee outcry, Google declined to renew its contract with the Pentagon for work on Project Maven.</p><p>When employees asked Microsoft to cancel its contract with ICE, CEO Satya Nadella clarified that the company was not contributing to family separations at the border but supporting email, calendar and document systems.</p><p>A Salesforce spokesperson said conversations with employees led the company to create the Office of Ethical and Humane Use of Technology and \"hire a chief ethical and humane use officer to develop guidelines and evaluate situations around the ethical use and development of our technology.\"</p><p>In the wake of concerns about tech's impact on the Bay Area housing crisis, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff this year gave $30 million to UC San Francisco to research homelessness, after donating $6 million to the city last year to help provide supportive housing for the formerly homeless. Pichai, Google's CEO, also pledged $1 billion to build 20,000 homes over a decade.</p><p>Such responsiveness is good for business and for building trust with customers and employees who are more inclined to express their demands, according to McElhaney.</p><p>\"Those who are not responding are ... missing a huge ocean liner that's already left the dock,\" she said.</p><p>Still, some tech workers say the companies' efforts fall short. In some cases, employees have said they've seen or experienced retaliation after they or others have spoken out.</p><p>\"We say that tech workers have a lot of power, but tech executives have more,\" said O'Sullivan, who quit on principle and now has a job at a young tech company pursuing transparency in the use of artificial intelligence. \"The best way to impact change is through legislation and regulation.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-80c76d32c7de48269cbd7bb9f838834c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WX0-TYN1-DY9S-T472-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1300\"/><timeReceived>04:41 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 25, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
