Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) News Release</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Washington- The top Democrats across four key Senate committees (Commerce, Judiciary, Banking, and HELP) today unveiled a new set of core principles they say should be the baseline for any comprehensive federal privacy and data protection legislation. Under the new framework agreed upon by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) consumers would be able to control their personal information, and corporations, non-profits, and political entities would be held to higher standards for when and how they collect, use, share and protect consumer data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Specifically, the privacy principles strengthen individual consumer and civil rights protections, including for children and teens, invigorate competition by increasing consumer choice, establish data safeguards to ensure use abides by consumer expectations and increase accountability over data practices by those at the highest levels of organizations. The principles also put more teeth into enforcement by ensuring that both regulators and individuals have the tools they need to aggressively identify harmful or invasive privacy practices and pursue legal remedies.</p><p>The group of Senate Democratic ranking members first came together after Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) tasked the committees of primary jurisdiction over various privacy and data protection issues, like data security and civil rights, with developing principles to fill in the serious gaps in consumer protection not currently covered by existing federal laws and provide a strong nationwide foundation for comprehensive federal legislation. Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) were also consulted and support the new principles.</p><p>Currently, there are a number of laws that are designed to protect privacy, however these laws provide specific privacy protections and are limited in scope by data types such as credit information protected by the Financial Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), protected health information created and maintained by payers and providers of healthcare, as is governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or safeguards afforded to children's data by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The newly unveiled principles should not be interpreted to change or displace existing privacy laws, or privacy laws scheduled to go into effect.</p><p>The Senate Democrats' privacy principles can be found here <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Final_CMTE%20Privacy%20Principles_11.14.19.pdf\">https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Final_CMTE%20Privacy%20Principles_11.14.19.pdf</url>.</p><p>\"Individuals should have the ability to control their personal data, period. To prevent companies from abusing our personal data, we need to create more transparency and accountability and allow individuals to determine how their data is used. That is what we hope to accomplish with this framework,\" said Senator Feinstein.</p><p>\"In an ever-evolving information age, consumers deserve to have protections from websites and online services harvesting their personal data. They deserve to have privacy rights and have those rights protected,\" said Senator Cantwell.</p><p>\"Too many corporations require Americans to sacrifice their privacy and share the most intimate details of their lives just to visit a website or to receive and use services,\" said Senator Brown. \"We must establish rules that take the power away from companies like Facebook, Equifax, and others to violate Americans' privacy for profits and give it back to hardworking Americans.\"</p><p>\"As data continues to play an important new role in families' lives in the 21st century, we need to make sure the constant development of new technology is matched by the development of new best practices and protections that speak to the needs for security, privacy, and good data stewardship,\" said Senator Murray. \"People should be able to expect tech companies are going to treat their most sensitive information responsibly, and give them the tools they need to be able to control how and when their information is disclosed. Our objective should be to make sure tech companies are putting people in the driver's seat, not the other way around.\"</p><p>\"I applaud my colleagues for their great work and am proud to support these strong principles,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.</p><p>\"I've said for more than a year now that corporations need to mind their own business when it comes to misusing Americans' private information. These principles make clear that Democrats support strong new protections for Americans' data, unprecedented transparency over how our information is used, and new enforcement with teeth that will hold corporations accountable,\" said Senator Wyden. \"Leader Schumer and Ranking Members Cantwell, Feinstein, Brown and Murray deserve enormous credit for putting together a tough, comprehensive list of principles to protect Americans' private data and put consumers back in control of their most sensitive information.\"</p><p>\"I know from having fought for stronger privacy protection over decades, federal action is woefully overdue and urgently necessary now. I will continue to work for bipartisan federal action because Americans absolutely want stronger privacy protection,\" said Senator Blumenthal. \"They know from painful experience that the intimate details of our personal lives are used against us every day by unaccountable corporations and foreign actors, deeply endangering our safety and democracy. Americans deserve and rightly expect stronger privacy safeguards, regardless of their politics or their personal circumstance. I look forward to collaborating with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass--as soon as possible--new privacy laws that are as strong and comprehensive as possible.\"</p><p>\"We need to update our privacy laws for the internet age.\" said Senator Schatz. \"When consumers let companies use their information they should be able to trust that it will be protected, used ethically, and won't be used to harm them. These principles provide a framework for clear rules of the road for companies, and would give prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"The American people are overdue for a privacy bill of rights that puts consumers first and effectively protects our personal information. And any comprehensive privacy legislation must include heightened safeguards for children and teens, who are uniquely vulnerable in today's digital age,\" said Senator Markey. \"We cannot afford to shrug off the daily data breaches and privacy invasions as a new normal. I am pleased to work with my colleagues on this framework for comprehensive privacy legislation, and I look forward to continuing this important collaboration.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=88FDB784-DBE0-4342-AE0F-FD2C0722BE52\">https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=88FDB784-DBE0-4342-AE0F-FD2C0722BE52</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSSMB18929K6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ4-KMV1-DYVR-P0Y2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1155\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 18, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Fair Credit Reporting</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTBENkY4NTNENTk0NEE0RUJBMDVBMTYyNjJBNjU2Njc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDIxRTY0QTMzQUVENDBEQjlDQTFBOTg1NzlFOEYzODk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Edward J. Markey (D-MA) News Release</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Washington, D.C. - The top Democrats across four key Senate committees (Commerce, Judiciary, Banking, and HELP) today unveiled a new set of core principles they say should be the baseline for any comprehensive federal privacy and data protection legislation. Under the new framework agreed upon by Senate Committee on Commerce Ranking Member Maria Cantwell, Senate Committee on the Judiciary Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Ranking Member Sherrod Brown, and Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Ranking Member Patty Murray, consumers would be able to control their personal information, and corporations, non-profits, and political entities would be held to higher standards for when and how they collect, use, share and protect consumer data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Specifically, the privacy principles strengthen individual consumer and civil rights protections, including for children and teens, invigorate competition by increasing consumer choice, establish data safeguards to ensure use abides by consumer expectations and increase accountability over data practices by those at the highest levels of organizations. The principles also put more teeth into enforcement by ensuring that both regulators and individuals have the tools they need to aggressively identify harmful or invasive privacy practices and pursue legal remedies.</p><p>The group of Senate Democratic Ranking Members first came together after Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer tasked the committees of primary jurisdiction over various privacy and data protection issues, like data security and civil rights, with developing principles to fill in the serious gaps in consumer protection not currently covered by existing federal laws and provide a strong nationwide foundation for comprehensive federal legislation. Senators Ron Wyden, Richard Blumenthal, Brian Schatz and Ed Markey, four of the Senate's leading advocates for comprehensive privacy protections, were also consulted and support the new principles.</p><p>Currently, there are a number of laws that are designed to protect privacy, however these laws provide specific privacy protections and are limited in scope by data types such as credit information protected by the Financial Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), protected health information created and maintained by payers and providers of healthcare, as is governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or safeguards afforded to children's data by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The newly unveiled principles should not be interpreted to change or displace existing privacy laws, or privacy laws scheduled to go into effect.</p><p>The Senate Democrats' privacy principles can be found here <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Final_CMTE%20Privacy%20Principles_11.14.19.pdf\">https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Final_CMTE%20Privacy%20Principles_11.14.19.pdf</url>.</p><p>\"In an ever-evolving information age, consumers deserve to have protections from websites and online services harvesting their personal data. They deserve to have privacy rights and have those rights protected,\" said Senator Cantwell.</p><p>\"Individuals should have the ability to control their personal data, period. To prevent companies from abusing our personal data, we need to create more transparency and accountability and allow individuals to determine how their data is used. That is what we hope to accomplish with this framework,\" said Senator Feinstein.</p><p>\"Too many corporations require Americans to sacrifice their privacy and share the most intimate details of their lives just to visit a website or to receive and use services,\" said Senator Brown. \"We must establish rules that take the power away from companies like Facebook, Equifax, and others to violate Americans' privacy for profits and give it back to hardworking Americans.\"</p><p>\"As data continues to play an important new role in families' lives in the 21st century, we need to make sure the constant development of new technology is matched by the development of new best practices and protections that speak to the needs for security, privacy, and good data stewardship,\" said Senator Murray. \"People should be able to expect tech companies are going to treat their most sensitive information responsibly, and give them the tools they need to be able to control how and when their information is disclosed. Our objective should be to make sure tech companies are putting people in the driver's seat, not the other way around.\"</p><p>\"I applaud my colleagues for their great work and am proud to support these strong principles,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.</p><p>\"I've said for more than a year now that corporations need to mind their own business when it comes to misusing Americans' private information. These principles make clear that Democrats support strong new protections for Americans' data, unprecedented transparency over how our information is used, and new enforcement with teeth that will hold corporations accountable,\" said Senator Wyden. \"Leader Schumer and Ranking Members Cantwell, Feinstein, Brown and Murray deserve enormous credit for putting together a tough, comprehensive list of principles to protect Americans' private data and put consumers back in control of their most sensitive information.\"</p><p>\"I know from having fought for stronger privacy protection over decades, federal action is woefully overdue and urgently necessary now. I will continue to work for bipartisan federal action because Americans absolutely want stronger privacy protection,\" said Senator Blumenthal. \"They know from painful experience that the intimate details of our personal lives are used against us every day by unaccountable corporations and foreign actors, deeply endangering our safety and democracy. Americans deserve and rightly expect stronger privacy safeguards, regardless of their politics or their personal circumstance. I look forward to collaborating with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass--as soon as possible--new privacy laws that are as strong and comprehensive as possible.\"</p><p>\"We need to update our privacy laws for the internet age.\" said Senator Schatz. \"When consumers let companies use their information they should be able to trust that it will be protected, used ethically, and won't be used to harm them. These principles provide a framework for clear rules of the road for companies, and would give prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"The American people are overdue for a privacy bill of rights that puts consumers first and effectively protects our personal information. And any comprehensive privacy legislation must include heightened safeguards for children and teens, who are uniquely vulnerable in today's digital age,\" said Senator Markey. \"We cannot afford to shrug off the daily data breaches and privacy invasions as a new normal. I am pleased to work with my colleagues on this framework for comprehensive privacy legislation, and I look forward to continuing this important collaboration.\"</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/-top-democrats-on-key-senate-committees-unveil-principles-for-comprehensive-federal-privacy-legislation\">https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/-top-democrats-on-key-senate-committees-unveil-principles-for-comprehensive-federal-privacy-legislation</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSSMB18960O1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ4-KMV1-DYVR-P105-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1202\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 18, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Fair Credit Reporting</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTBENkY4NTNENTk0NEE0RUJBMDVBMTYyNjJBNjU2Njc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDIxRTY0QTMzQUVENDBEQjlDQTFBOTg1NzlFOEYzODk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Widely considered friendly with the tech industry, Mr. Khanna criticized <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>on Friday for its aggressive tactics, and said the company should ''certainly fire the people who were in any way involved in the decision to peddle opposition research.''</p><p>  The clash intensified on Friday when four Democratic senators wrote to the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, asking him to provide more details about <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>lobbying activities. The lawmakers also raised a potentially more explosive issue: whether <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had ever used its own data and platform against critics.</p><p>  ''We need to know if <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>or any entity affiliated with or hired by <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>ever used any of the vast financial and data resources available to them to retaliate against their critics, including elected officials who were scrutinizing them,'' said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, one of the Democrats who wrote the letter.</p><p>  Many Democrats now believe that <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Googleand Twitter have been too slow to challenge the abusive speech and disinformation on their platforms. Some argue that the companies have bowed to misplaced Republican criticism about bias -- <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>falsely accused Googlein August of playing down his State of the Union -- in order to protect their businesses from political pressure.</p><p>  ''As more and more information comes out about how these guys operate, it's becoming conventional wisdom among Democrats that there is a serious policy problem here,'' said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated.</p><p>  ''These companies are not credible,'' Mr. Stoller added. ''And it's becoming clear to Democrats that they aren't friends -- they are the problem.''</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>cut ties with the opposition research firm this past week even as executives there denied acting improperly.</p><p>  ''Our strategy was to shore up the security on <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and make major investments there,'' said Sheryl Sandberg, <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>chief operating officer, in an interview with CBS on Friday. ''It was not what I was doing, nor was it the company's strategy, to deflect, to deny or to hire P.R. firms to do things.''</p><p>  But <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and other tech companies now face increasing criticism from within their own ranks. In an interview, Marc Benioff, the billionaire co-founder of the software company Salesforce and a major donor to Democratic causes, said his industry faced ''a tension between trust and growth.''</p><p>  ''These companies are going to have to recognize that they have to change,'' Mr. Benioff added. ''And the C.E.O.s have to change. And if they don't change, those C.E.O.s will be removed by boards and by shareholders.''</p><p>  No Democrat embodies the tensions between tech and Washington like Mr. Schumer himself. In 2011, he joined Ms. Sandberg to announce the opening of the company's first East Coast engineering office, in New York City, where he had worked to promote start-ups and other tech businesses.</p><p>  In 2015, Ms. Sandberg co-hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Schumer in her Bay Area home, according to a <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>employee briefed on the event. (The same trip featured a Schumer fund-raiser held by Bruce Sewell, then Apple's general counsel, and attended by Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, according to an executive who declined to be named.).</p><p>  By the end of the 2016 cycle, Mr. Schumer had raised more money from <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>employees than any other Washington lawmaker. All told, Senate Democrats have benefited from over $3 million in political contributions from <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>employees and founders over the years.</p><p>  The technology industry -- and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in particular -- was also a partner to Democrats in policy battles. Mr. Zuckerberg founded a Washington advocacy group to press for immigration reform, a top priority for Mr. Schumer and other Democratic leaders. More recently, tech companies like Netflix allied with Democrats in the fight over net neutrality rules.</p><p>  Relations began to cool after the 2016 elections, when evidence mounted that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and YouTube had become fertile ground for foreign interference and domestic misinformation, threatening not only the party's values but also its electoral prospects.</p><p>  Early last year, Senator Jon Tester, the Montana Democrat, walked over to the Capitol to deliver a warning to Mr. Schumer, newly elected as Democratic minority leader.</p><p>  Mr. Tester, the departing chief of the Senate Democrats' campaign arm, looked at social media companies like <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and saw propaganda platforms that could cost his party the 2018 elections, according to two congressional aides. If Russian agents mounted a disinformation campaign like the one that had just helped elect Mr. Trump, he told Mr. Schumer, ''we will lose every seat.''</p><p>  Mr. Tester's warning grabbed the attention of Mr. Schumer and other Democrats, who began to press <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and other social media companies to fix the problem.</p><p>  Disinformation was a particular focus for Mr. Schumer, according to an aide with knowledge of the senator's thinking. In March last year, Mr. Schumer summoned Adam Mosseri, then a vice president overseeing <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>News Feed feature, for a briefing on how the company would limit the spread of bogus news and propaganda. He later sent two aides to Silicon Valley to keep pressure on executives at <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Googleand Twitter.</p><p>  But as it became clear that the companies had understated their problems -- and were moving slowly to fix them -- the senator steered a middle course. When he and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House leader, unveiled the party's ''Better Deal'' platform for the midterm elections, a proposal to attack ''corporate monopolies'' focused on airlines, beer companies and eyeglass makers.</p><p>  The proposal, drafted in part by Mr. Schumer's chief counsel, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, did not mention companies like Googleand <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>which together dominate the search and digital advertising markets. (Ms. Slaughter, whom Mr. Schumer helped place on the Federal Trade Commission this spring, is now one of five commissioners investigating whether <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>violated a 2011 consent agreement over privacy practices.)</p><p>  As recently as March, in an interview with Recode, Mr. Schumer called <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>''a very positive force'' overall and expressed concern that overly strict rules for tech companies would affect economic growth.</p><p>  ''I am more sympathetic because I think they're in very difficult position and I worry about government regulation,'' he said.</p><p>  But in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal that month, which showed how <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>weak privacy controls had allowed a Trump-connected firm to collect information about tens of millions of people, some Democrats called for broader scrutiny.</p><p>  Senator Mark Warner of Virginia -- a former telecommunications executive generally regarded as pro-business, and a ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee -- excoriated Mr. Zuckerberg and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>this summer for failing to disclose major data-sharing arrangements with handset makers, including a Chinese company flagged by American intelligence agencies. At the time, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Twitter were also coming under attack by prominent Republicans, who said the companies' new anti-abuse policies were discriminating against conservatives.</p><p>  Mr. Warner's growing focus on privacy concerns led to a clash with Mr. Schumer, who confronted Mr. Warner in July, The Times reported this week, warning him to back off <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>  Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer, said that the senator ''worried that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>would bow to pressure from Republicans, who oppose the purging of the fake accounts and bots, and has urged Senator Warner and the Senate Intelligence Committee to make this the priority in their ongoing investigation of the company.''</p><p>  Mr. Warner has continued to press Silicon Valley about privacy. In August, he issued a white paper outlining ways to rein in Big Tech, including passing privacy laws like those enacted in Europe this year, and making social media platforms liable for defamatory content.</p><p>  ''It's important for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>to recognize that this isn't a public relations problem -- it's a fundamental challenge for the platform and their business model,'' Mr. Warner said.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>previously signaled that it was ready to work with Mr. Warner and others in Congress on new regulation. Yet at the same time, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>turned to a conservative opposition research firm that sought to undermine detractors by publicizing financial links to Mr. Soros, a harsh critic of both <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Google.</p><p>  The revelations angered Democrats, who accused <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>of tapping into anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about Mr. Soros -- the very kind of propaganda the company has claimed to be battling. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has denied that the effort was anti-Semitic.</p><p>  ''Their mantra has been, 'We're different, we're special, we're tech, all we do is good,''' said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the Senate subcommittee that oversees consumer protection and data security. ''We've come to find out, very graphically, that they do a lot of harm, and in fact they cover up the harm they do.''</p><p>  He added, ''Tech is now like every other industry, in my view.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Clockwise from top: Senators showing a post about a fictitious Trump rally at a hearing last fall on Russian misinformation</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Senator Chuck Schumer at <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>Manhattan offices in 2011</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>and Senator Amy Klobuchar at a Judiciary Committee hearing this fall.

<br/>A turning point was the US presidential election campaign in 2016, when Facebook and Twitter in particular were not only used by clever campaign strategists, but also to an unprecedented degree by propaganda teams from Russia.<br/>Nor was the public image of social media helped when Zuckerberg described the notion that fake news on Facebook may have influenced the election outcome as a \"pretty crazy idea,\" an assessment he later walked back.<br/>Then Facebook was pilloried in 2018 for the scandal involving the British political data firm Cambridge Analytica, hired by US President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign.<br/>In 2014, the firm gained access to private information on tens of millions of American Facebook users, which was used to target voters with personalised political advertisements.<br/>The uproar over the data breach, which had occurred years earlier and looked almost harmless compared with several other slip-ups by Facebook, was a sign of the times.<br/>However, the mood of the US populace is darkening.<br/>According to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based \"fact tank,\" the share of Americans who see technology companies as having a positive impact on the United States has tumbled to 50% from 71% four years ago.<br/>What's more, negative views of the companies' impact on the country have nearly doubled during this period, from 17-33%.<br/>US politicians have left no doubt that the country's big technology companies face tighter regulations.<br/>But with a presidential election less than a year away, political calculation may be playing a part.<br/>An investigation by the Justice Department into whether major digital technology companies engage in anti-competitive practices comes amid claims by Trump that they suppress conservative views.<br/>At the same time, Facebook has been criticised for its decision not to automatically take down provably false content from politicians \u2014 and thereby stay out of the political fray.<br/>That said, business continues to go splendidly for the technology giants.<br/>Facebook easily digested the FTC fine in just a quarter.<br/>And Google, hit with antitrust fines from the European Union now totalling more than 8bn euros (about $9bn), ploughs ahead unfazed.<br/>The companies' users also keep growing in numbers..</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLFTMS-163740553</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLFTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWW-92B1-JDJN-6135-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381159</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"610\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gulf Times Newspaper Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Predominantly passively managed, these products could be used in their own right or sit alongside active funds and individual stocks in a portfolio.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have maintained the structure introduced last year, with ETFs falling into three broad categories, both for simplicity and to reflect investor priorities. The ETFs in our list are categorised as Core (buy and hold), Satellite (growth and income boosters) or Niche (specialist). Our list remains biased towards equity ETFs, reflecting where the bulk of returns tend to stem from, with a limited selection of fixedincome products.</p><p>This year's changes We have made some notable structural changes this year. Dividend ETFs may be a popular part of this list, but the outlook for such products has deteriorated significantly amid the coronavirus lockdown. Many companies have already cut, cancelled or postponed their dividends and these payouts will remain under severe pressure for some time - Janus Henderson, the fund provider, has predicted that global dividends could decline by between 15 and 35 per cent this year. Chasing dividend yields comes with big risks, especially in a passive format.</p><p>Bearing in mind how popular they can be among income-oriented investors, we have kept what we judge to be the best dividend ETFs in this year's list. But in recognition of the uncertainties surrounding these products we have moved them from the Core category to Satellite and dropped some of last year's choices in favour of products with a more defensive methodology.</p><p>The core equity categories also look slightly different because the vast majority of these now include an ETF with an environmental, social and governance (ESG) twist. ESG strategies are gaining mass appeal, and have confounded some critics by performing well in their first major market sell-offearlier this year.</p><p>In recognition of investor demand we have included some core ESG equity options. For now, we are opting for products with a light ESG slant, but do not deviate too dramatically from mainstream markets, although our choices could change as this part of the market evolves over time.</p><p>A total of 12 products have been removed from the list, although much of this is down to the aforementioned dividend ETF changes, as well as more niche ESG strategies being removed to make way for mainstream options.</p><p>Staying the course We have made a handful of tweaks elsewhere, including the removal of one bond fund to make way for an option that may prove useful if inflation makes a comeback in the wake of major fiscal stimulus around the world.</p><p>But broadly the panellists who assist with the construction of the list were content with many of last year's selections, especially the core options. Our choices have been dictated by criteria including the ETF's size and liquidity, how competitively priced it looks, and whether it uses the best index and methodology for the relevant market. Many of our core choices continue to stand out versus their peers. This has meant that iShares, the dominant ETF provider, is notably present once again, as it remains difficult to deny the quality and scale of the company's products.</p><p>Some satellite options may appear to go against the grain. Value funds have continued to struggle, for example, while minimum volatility ETFs with good levels of exposure to the US have recently lagged in a market dominated by the big tech stocks. But these names have kept their place in the list to cater for investors who want a degree of diversification away from the leaders of what has been an unusual market rally, and for those with a contrarian bent.</p><p>Finally, those perusing the list will see that we have maintained a fairly short list of thematic ETFs, even as this market and the demand for such products continues to grow. This reflects the constraints of the list in its current format rather than our view on thematic investing. Our panellists provided us with a number of compelling ETF suggestions, but expanding this category would require us to cut many worthy products from other parts of the list. As such, we have stuck with last year's four-strong thematic cohort, but will increasingly look into thematic ETFs (and other thematic funds) in our personal finance coverage.</p><p>Due diligence As part of our process, we asked the panellists to consider which ETFs provided the best form of exposure to the relevant market, how they compared with rivals on cost and whether they stood out in terms of liquidity. We have broadly favoured larger ETFs, which should theoretically provide a good secondary market and be easy to trade. In some growing areas such as ESG, we have backed some smaller names that have the potential to take on greater assets in time. As there is no one metric that determines the best ETF, we have accounted for a balance of different factors.</p><p>If we have dropped an ETF this does not necessarily mean we think you should sell or avoid it. Also, do bear in mind that this is not a suggestion to buy every ETF mentioned, nor is this a list of the 50 ETFs we judge to be the best performers in the near future. The premise of the Top 50 is to provide a succinct list of what we see as the best possible ETFs across different asset classes and styles of investing.</p><p>As with any set of investments, you should be wary of duplicating holdings. For example, some names in our core equity categories will access the same, or similar, markets. Often, core ETFs with a broad focus (such as the FTSE All-Share tracker in our UK category) will have a degree of overlap with some satellite names (in this case, a FTSE 250 tracker). In instances like this, the satellite option promises more targeted exposure to a specific area that may offer better long-term returns, but you can find yourself doubling up to an extent by buying both ETFs.</p><p>Finally, note that ETFs, and passives more generally, might not be the best investment vehicle for every region and asset class. Dividend ETFs, for example, may offer you a less selective dividend approach than active equity income funds or even picking your own stocks. And passive fixed-income funds tend to have higher levels of duration, or sensitivity to interest rates, than their active counterparts.</p><p>OUR CORE ETF SELECTIONS FOR 2020 UK EQUITIES (FOUR ETFS) Mass dividend cuts and a slumping oil price have seen UK equities suffer more than most this year, with the FTSE All-Share losing around 17 per cent of its value in the first five months of 2020. But investors still have good reason to focus on their home market, from seemingly cheap valuations to a sense of familiarity and the convenience of holding sterling assets. A lingering home bias means that many investors start here before focusing on other equity regions.</p><p>iShares Core FTSE 100 UCITS ETF (ISF) A flagship offering from ETF giant iShares, this remains a firm favourite among our panel of experts. The fund had \u00a37.9bn in assets at the end of May, making it extremely liquid for those looking to trade in and out. This liquidity results in a low bid/ask spread which, combined with the ETF's annual fee of just 0.07 per cent, translates into an extremely low total cost of investing. The ETF can also generate some extra returns via securities lending.</p><p>Because ISF is a distribution share class, investors will receive those dividends generated from the FTSE 100, with the shares on a dividend yield of 5.5 per cent at the end of May. But remember that, as with some other names in the list, dividends and those companies that pay them are under severe pressure.</p><p>Lyxor Core Morningstar UK UCITS ETF (LCUK) Lyxor Core Morningstar UK, which entered the list last year, continues to showcase its original merits. While ISF focuses on the largest UK-listed companies, this product tracks the broader market. The index it uses, Morningstar UK, focuses on the largeand mid-cap segments of the market, with around 320 holdings.</p><p>This ETF continues to impress us on price, charging just 0.04 per cent and coming in much cheaper than a FTSE All-Share tracker. Having only launched in 2018 it remains fairly small, with just \u00a337m in assets. But this product could achieve greater scale in future thanks to its eye-catching price tag.</p><p>SPDR FTSE UK All Share UCITS ETF (FTAL) Some of our panel had issues with this ETF, given that elements of the FTSE All-Share index can be difficult to track and cheaper sources of UK exposure, such as LCUK, are available. But we have retained it in our list for those investors familiar and comfortable with the All-Share as a play on UK equities.</p><p>Investors get exposure to a broad range of UK companies, taking in the FTSE 100, FTSE 250 and FTSE Small Cap indices. This ETF's underlying index contained nearly 600 stocks in early June. FTAL is of a reasonable size, with around \u00a3500m in assets, and has an ongoing charge of 0.2 per cent that remains competitive among those tracking this market.</p><p>NEW L&amp;G UK Equity UCITS ETF (LGUK) Investors who want to add an ESG twist to their UK exposure without deviating too drastically from the market might consider this L&amp;G ETF, which tracks the Solactive Core United Kingdom Large &amp; Mid Cap index.</p><p>In order to sit in this index, companies must meet certain liquidity requirements and refrain from engaging in areas such as pure coal mining and the production of controversial weapons, as well as not breaching the UN Global Compact principles - global standards covering human rights, the environment and corruption.</p><p>Like some other ESG products, this fund is not currently as large as we would like. However, it only launched in late 2018 and could see an uptick in growth, given its mainstream ESG focus and a highly attractive 0.05 per cent charge.</p><p>GLOBAL EQUITIES (THREE ETFS) As appealing as it can be to pick (or avoid) specific geographical regions, some investors prefer the simplicity of using a global equity tracker. This can provide a straightforward and diversified source of returns - but those simply using a global tracker as a core holding should be wary of duplicating positions with any fund or stock picks elsewhere. US equities, in particular, make up a large chunk of global indices, creating a risk of overlap.</p><p>HSBC MSCI World UCITS ETF (HMWO) This ETF continues to appeal as a highly reliable global equity core position. With a 0.15 per cent charge and notable assets, this is a cheap and easily traded source of exposure to the most well established global equity index.</p><p>Rival offerings have failed to dislodge this entrant so far: iShares offers its own large, liquid global equity ETF, but this comes at a higher price of 0.2 per cent, and some investors may wish to diversify away from the market's biggest provider, where they can.</p><p>iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF GBP Hedged (IWDG) With US equities making up a significant portion of the MSCI World index and plenty of other overseas stocks included, investors again run the risk of currency fluctuations distorting their end returns. It can be worth paying a little extra to manage this risk at a time of lingering uncertainty for the UK economy (and currency).</p><p>For those who wish to hedge out such risks, this remains a reliable option. Large, liquid and with a reasonably low cost of 0.3 per cent, iShares Core MSCI World retains the backing of our panel.</p><p>NEW iShares MSCI World ESG Screened UCITS ETF (SAWD) As with our other core ESG picks, this ETF was highlighted as a way to get cheap, simple market exposure that applies an ESG tilt without deviating too drastically from conventional indices.</p><p>The fund's underlying index screens out exposure to controversial weapons, tobacco, thermal coal and nuclear weapons, among other areas. But the fact that it relies on a light ESG screen means it retains \"all the core benefits of a global tracker\", one panellist adds. Investors are also not compromised on cost: the ETF has an ongoing charge of 0.2 per cent, the same fee levied on its non-ESG equivalent.</p><p>As with our US ESG pick, this fund retains exposure to some of the big tech names that have driven returns. For those with qualms about any of these companies, it is worth remembering that plenty of funds do avoid some of these stocks as part of ESG processes. As such, an active fund or a passive with a more stringent ESG process may be a better fit for some.</p><p>JAPANESE EQUITIES (THREE ETFS) Often further from investors' thoughts than the previous categories, Japan is worth consideration in part because its corporations are making a slow but steady move towards a more shareholder-friendly approach, with dividends among the areas designated for ongoing improvement. Japan also acts as a gateway to growth, through its dealings with expanding economies in Asia and its own innovation in areas such as robotics.</p><p>iShares Core MSCI Japan IMI UCITS ETF (SJPA) Like many of our core equity ETF picks, this iShares product has caused no real discord between the panellists. Still large and liquid with nearly $3.5bn in assets, the fund is now even cheaper than when it featured in last year's list. Its ongoing charge comes in at 0.15 per cent, down from 0.2 per cent when our last list was published.</p><p>The fund's underlying index, MSCI Japan Investable Market Index, is well diversified, with nearly 1,300 holdings, covering almost all of the country's market. It features some globally established names in its top positions, from automaker Toyota (JPN:7203) to Sony (JPN:6758), manufacturer Keyence (JPN:6861) and the Softbank Group (JPN:9984) conglomerate.</p><p>NEW Lyxor Core MSCI Japan UCITS ETF GBP Hedged (LCJG) As one panellist noted, investors have limited options when it comes to Japanese equity indices. The Nikkei 225, for example, can be heavily weighted towards its 10 largest constituents, leaving investors overly US EQUITIES (THREE ETFS) US equities have outpaced other stock markets for several years and the coronavirus crisis has done nothing to stop that so far. It is also a region that has tended to reward passive investors: the efficiency of the US market, and the difficulty of establishing overweight positions in the big tech firms that already make up a large part of the index, has made this a harsh environment for active managers. While such trends may not last forever, we believe this is an area where ETFs can really stand out.</p><p>iShares Core S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF (CSP1) This well-established iShares offering remains a popular core holding among our panellists because of its liquidity and low costs. With around $36.5bn (\u00a329.1bn) across its various share classes in late May, it provides a very liquid route into the S&amp;P 500, one of the main US markets and a home to the tech giants that have generated huge returns in recent years. The ongoing charge comes to just 0.07 per cent.</p><p>Xtrackers S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF GBP Hedged (XDPG) Currency fluctuations can have a significant impact on the end returns from overseas investments, and this is a risk worth monitoring when it comes to US equity exposure. With sterling likely to remain volatile as we move through the Brexit process, investors may wish to offset these moves.</p><p>The vast majority of our panellists continued to back this option. The Xtrackers ETF continues to stand out, in part because it has a 'dynamic' strategy that involves hedging continuously, rather than daily or monthly as other products tend to do, meaning currency fluctuations are mitigated more thoroughly.</p><p>NEW Invesco S&amp;P 500 ESG UCITS ETF (SPEP) This ETF may appeal to investors who wish to build a more ESGfriendly portfolio without deviating too drastically from traditional markets. Invesco S&amp;P 500 ESG still gives investors exposure to some leading companies in the market, from the FAANG stocks to Microsoft (US:MSFT) and Visa (US:V), but it also comes with a light ESG overlay. The index tracked by this ETF excludes companies involved with tobacco and controversial weapons, as well as businesses with a low UN Global Compact score and those in the bottom quartile by S&amp;P Dow Jones Index ESG Score. The fund comes with a fairly competitive ongoing charge of 0.09 per cent.</p><p>exposed to the fortunes of a handful of companies. Looking for a sterling-hedged ETF can further limit your options, but one name highlighted by some panellists was Lyxor Core MSCI Japan. The underlying index is more concentrated than SJPA's, but still fairly broad, capturing the performance of the large-and mid-cap segment of Japan's equity market. It covers around 85 per cent of the market and included 321 companies at the end of May.</p><p>This is an attractively priced hedged ETF, with an ongoing charge of 0.2 per cent, and its daily hedging process means you are consistently adjusting for currency moves. It had just shy of \u00a3600m in assets under management at the end of May, suggesting ample liquidity, with one panellist expecting this product to grow further.</p><p>NEW L&amp;G Japan Equity UCITS ETF (LGJG) Strictly speaking, L&amp;G Japan Equity is not a new entrant on our list, but it does enter our core category as a 'light' ESG option. This ETF's underlying index, Solactive Core Japan Large &amp; Mid Cap, is similar to MSCI's index in giving you fairly broad exposure. The Solactive index covers around 85 per cent of the market.</p><p>But the index also applies some limited ESG screening, shunning companies involved in pure coal mining or the production of controversial weapons such as cluster bombs, as well as those deemed to have breached at least one of the UN Global Compact principles. Having only launched in 2018, the ETF has already built up a decent level of assets and has a reasonably low ongoing charge of 0.1 per cent.</p><p>As with our other ESG options, this could serve as an alternative to one of our other core names.</p><p>Dropped from the 2019 selection: Lyxor JPX-Nikkei 400 UCITS ETF GBP Hedged (JPXX) The Japanese yen is widely viewed as a safe-haven asset, meaning the currency can strengthen at times of volatility. In a turbulent 2020, this has created benefits for sterling investors: the yen has gained more than 8 per cent in sterling terms over the first five months of the year, meaning returns from Japanese stocks will be worth more to the end investor in the UK.</p><p>Because of the possibility of moves in the other direction, we would not rule out the use of a hedged Japanese equity ETF. But we are removing this Lyxor ETF from the list following substantial criticism of its underlying index.</p><p>The JPX-Nikkei 400 index was constructed with good intentions, consisting of companies that \"meet requirements of global investment standards, such as efficient use of capital and investor-focused management perspectives\". This fits in well with Japan's much-vaunted corporate improvement plans. But the panel warned that this was a \"strange\" index in terms of how it was constructed, and may prove unreliable as a predictable and straightforward route to Japanese equity exposure.</p><p>EUROPEAN EQUITIES (THREE ETFS) With plenty of European economies facing deepseated issues and even Germany narrowly avoiding a recession in 2019, this region was out of favour long before the coronavirus crash engulfed markets. But investors would do well not to write it off- Europe is still home to plenty of world-leading businesses and can sometimes produce surprisingly good returns.</p><p>Like other mainstream markets, it can be accessed easily and at low cost via ETFs. However, investors looking for the benefits of a good stockpicker should not rule out the merits of a more expensive active approach.</p><p>Vanguard FTSE Developed Europe ex-UK UCITS ETF (VERX) The first appearance from index-tracking giant Vanguard in this year's list, this ETF offers broad exposure to European equities, with 479 stocks in the underlying index at the end of April. With $1.2bn in assets, it remains a substantial, highly liquid play on European stocks. The ETF does have some competition from iShares, among others, but still looks attractive on price. VERX comes with an ongoing charge of 0.1 per cent, compared with a 0.12 per cent fee on iShares' MSCI EMU product, which also invests in a narrower range of stocks.</p><p>iShares MSCI EMU UCITS ETF GBP Hedged (CEUG) Panellists were divided both on whether to keep this name in the list and what the best replacement might be, with one suggesting we reintroduce a Eurostoxx 50 tracker to the top 50. But we are sticking with iShares MSCI EMU as a hedged option, on the basis that it still offers a reasonably diversified level of exposure to a market with plenty of troubles, with around 250 holdings. Importantly, it also does this in a cheap and liquid manner.</p><p>NEW L&amp;G Europe ex UK Equity UCITS ETF (LGEU) Once more we are including a 'vanilla' ETF with an ESG twist and an attractive price tag in this core category. This ETF has attracted a decent level of assets since its 2018 launch, with $95m across its different share classes in late May. Investors are again getting a fairly broad level of market exposure, with around 330 companies in the underlying index. On top of this, a level of ESG screening is carried out.</p><p>ASIA PACIFIC EX JAPAN EQUITIES (ONE ETF) Much like emerging market stocks, Asian equities give you a stake in companies from some of the world's fastest-growing economies, provided you can stomach the risks. But anyone building a globally diversified portfolio should be aware that Asia and emerging market indices (and funds) can experience a high level of overlap - something we take into account with the recommendation below.</p><p>iShares Core MSCI Pacific ex-Japan UCITS ETF (CPJ1) This ETF continues to justify a spot in the list in large part because of where it invests. The index tracked by this fund had a 57.8 per cent allocation to Australia at the end of May, with smaller weightings in Singapore and New Zealand. This clearly differentiates it from funds and indices with substantial exposure to emerging markets, and should add a level of diversification to our core picks. It is also a large, liquid ETF with a reasonable ongoing charge of 0.2 per cent.</p><p>EMERGING MARKET EQUITIES (TWO ETFS) Emerging market equities have had a disappointing decade, with the region's main index tending to trail other regions by returns. But investors might still be tempted to make a small core allocation here, given the prospect of corporate improvements and the enduring appeal of exposure to high-growth economies.</p><p>Our inclusion of an ESG product in this year's list could give investors a more defensive play on emerging markets, because ESG metrics often reward 'quality' companies with good governance. These could well prove less exposed to the ups and downs of volatile markets.</p><p>iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets IMI UCITS ETF (EMIM) Tracking the most established emerging markets index, this ETF promises broad exposure to the region for a fee of 0.18 per cent. A variety of high-growth economies are prominent here: China made up around a third of the index at the end of May, with Taiwan, South Korea, India and Brazil among the other major regional weightings.</p><p>Investors might recognise some of the index's biggest constituents, from South Korean smartphone maker Samsung (SK:005930) to Chinese tech giants Alibaba (US:BABA) and Tencent (HK:0700). With some $13bn of assets in the fund, it remains highly liquid.</p><p>iShares MSCI Emerging Markets IMI ESG Screened UCITS ETF (SAEM) An ESG-minded version of the above ETF, this product's underlying index screens out exposure to areas including controversial weapons, tobacco, nuclear weapons and thermal coal. The fund is smaller than its more mainstream counterpart, but still has around $600m of assets, and should prove sufficiently liquid. It has the same ongoing charge.</p><p>Investors should note that some ESG approaches will prove more defensive than their mainstream counterparts in volatile times, although they may also fall behind in rising markets. This is the case here: this ETF suffered less than its mainstream counterpart in the coronavirus sell-off, but has rebounded less sharply since markets began to recover in April.</p><p>BONDS (FOUR ETFS) Long viewed as overvalued and vulnerable to a whole range of risks, the bond market has again been vindicated as a diversifying asset class in the coronavirus sell-off. Government bonds protected investors when equity markets sold offheavily earlier this year, and while some corporate bond ETFs saw their shares trade at a discount to the value of underlying assets at the height of the volatility in March, this was the closest the ETF sector came to the existential crisis often loudly predicted by its critics. Such discounts, which relate to scarce liquidity in the bond market itself at moments of stress rather than problems with the ETFs themselves, disappeared once calm was restored. As such, it is worth considering some core fixedincome positions in any diversified ETF portfolio. But because equities drive the bulk of long-term returns and many investors prefer a more selective approach to fixed-income instruments, we continue to run a relatively tight list of preferred bond ETFs.</p><p>Lyxor FTSE Actuaries UK Gilts UCITS ETF (GILS) A long-standing constituent of the list, this Lyxor ETF keeps its place for another year. The FTSE Actuaries UK Conventional Gilts All Stocks index tracks a variety of UK government bonds with different levels of duration, or sensitivity to interest rates.</p><p>Like many passive bond products, this ETF has a high level of duration, which came to an average of 12.94 years in late May. The greater the duration, the bigger losses a bond can make when interest rates rise, and vice versa. With interest rates falling this has boosted returns, but it is important to know it could be vulnerable if interest rate do eventually rise. Many active bond fund managers tend to keep a tighter grip on duration.</p><p>Importantly, the recent sell-offsuggests that broad exposure to UK government bonds remains a good way to offset falls in equity markets. This ETF is a low-cost option, with a 0.07 per cent charge and strong liquidity.</p><p>NEW iShares \u00a3 Index-Linked Gilts UCITS ETF (INXG) Predicting the outlook for inflation has often seemed impossible, and you should never base your entire investment strategy around just one possible future outcome. But there is a plausible argument that the substantial fiscal stimulus carried out in response to the coronavirus could, in the medium term, see an uptick in prices - something that tends to be problematic for bonds.</p><p>With this possibility in mind we have introduced an ETF that gives investors access to inflation-linked gilts, or UK government bonds that adjust their interest payments in line with inflation. This is a large and cheap option, with a charge of 0.1 per cent. But investors concerned about an eventual hike in interest rates should remember that index-linked bonds do tend to have high levels of duration.</p><p>iShares Global Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF GBP Hedged (AGBP) The panel continues to rate this as a good source of broad, sterling-hedged exposure to global bonds. The ETF is invested across a broad swathe of the fixedincome universe, with nearly 5,500 bonds in the underlying index in late May. Around half of the fund's assets are in US government bonds, with money also allocated to corporate bonds in a variety of sectors. The ETF is extremely large and liquid, with a 0.1 per cent charge.</p><p>iShares Core \u00a3 Corporate Bond UCITS ETF (SLXX) As noted in our introduction, large corporate bond ETFs such as this iShares offering saw their shares trade at a notable discount to the stated value of underlying assets when volatility tore through markets in March. But such ETFs have otherwise weathered the crisis well, and this option continues to stand out when it comes to size and liquidity.</p><p>Investors get access to a reasonably broad array of investment-grade bonds, but it is worth noting that around half of the fund's assets are in BBB-rated bonds. This is the riskiest part of the investment-grade sector, and vulnerable companies could well see themselves downgraded to 'high yield' status as the coronavirus crisis continues to bite, hurting returns.</p><p>Panellists would still like to see this ETF charge less than its current 0.2 per cent fee, but conceded that few offerings can compete with it in terms of size for the time being.</p><p>Dropped from the 2019 selection: Lyxor FTSE Actuaries UK Gilts 0-5yr UCITS ETF (GIL5) This product exits the list for investment and portfolio construction reasons rather than any issues with the ETF itself. We wanted to make room for a different bond ETF that should protect investors if inflation finally returns, and felt that this Lyxor offering could be removed because another gilt product with a broader approach was already in the list.</p><p>SATELLITE ETFS UK EQUITIES (TWO ETFS) Vanguard FTSE 250 UCITS ETF (VMID) As one panellist put it, this Vanguard FTSE 250 ETF stands out because it is \"cheap and does what it says on the tin\". The fund provides exposure to a popular US EQUITIES (FOUR ETFS) iShares S&amp;P SmallCap 600 UCITS ETF (ISP6) Smaller companies were hit harder in the coronavirus sell-off than their large-cap peers, but it is worth looking down the market cap scale for the sake of both diversification and growth potential. And when it comes to US smaller companies, this option continues to stand out because of its underlying index. The S&amp;P SmallCap 600 is designed to ensure stocks are liquid enough to be held within an ETF.</p><p>As we discussed last year, this ETF is not the cheapest, with a 0.4 per cent charge. But its robust methodology, combined with the ETF's scale, continue to impress us.</p><p>Invesco EQQQ NASDAQ-100 UCITS ETF (EQQQ) At a time when big tech companies appear to be consolidating their position as market leaders, this ETF retains its appeal as a play on high-growth businesses. The Nasdaq 100 index tracks the biggest non-financial US stocks, leading it to big allocations in the technology, telecommunications and consumer discretionary sectors. The FAANG stocks, Microsoft (US:MSFT), Intel (US:INTC) and Cisco Systems (US:CSCO) were among the ETF's top 10 holdings at the end of April.</p><p>iShares continues to offer a larger rival product, but the Invesco ETF charges slightly less and has more than ample assets and liquidity. Investors may also like the chance to diversify in terms of which ETF providers they use.</p><p>iShares Edge S&amp;P 500 Minimum Volatility UCITS ETF (MVUS) This ETF has not covered itself in glory, falling roughly in line with the main S&amp;P 500 index during the sell-off and slightly lagging behind as prices have recovered. However, its characteristics may still appeal to some.</p><p>As we noted, the biggest US tech companies have held up relatively well in the crisis, and have led the recent market recovery. But their shares could be vulnerable to any resumption of volatility, while some of the FAANG companies themselves remain exposed to regulatory pressures in future.</p><p>This minimum volatility ETF has less exposure to the likes of the FAANGs than the main index, which in part explains its underwhelming performance. Investors looking to take a slightly contrarian position by underweighting these leading stocks within their US exposure may still be tempted to use this fund.</p><p>NEW Fidelity US Quality Income (FUSD) This ETF stood out as an equity income option because of its conservative methodology. Rather than just chasing high yields or seeking out businesses with the longest dividend track records, Fidelity US Quality Income focuses on large-and mid-cap dividend-paying companies with robust fundamental characteristics.</p><p>Index constituents are screened using metrics such as free-cash-flow margins, the return on invested capital and free-cash-flow stability. As such, investors are getting some benefit from dividends, but also enjoy a more defensive, total return approach.</p><p>We would add a note of caution that some robust companies could (and have) cut dividends out of prudence, so this ETF is not entirely shielded from coronavirusinduced troubles.</p><p>Dropped from the 2019 selection: \u00a6 SPDR S&amp;P US Dividend Aristocrats UCITS ETF (USDV) Dividend pressures are less of a concern in the US than they are closer to home. US equities have traditionally offered a much lower yield than other markets, and those dividends that are on offer look safer than those in the UK. Janus Henderson's Global Dividend Index for May 2020 notes that 79 per cent of US payouts should be safe this year, although companies may carry out fewer share buybacks as they move through the coronavirus crisis.</p><p>However, risks do exist. And while this ETF arguably has a more defensive approach than those that invest based purely on high yields, some on the panel worried its methodology may not prove as robust as others available in this category. It focuses on companies that have increased dividends every year for at least two decades - but as we noted, even those with such an impressive record could be caught out by the challenges of the coronavirus crisis.</p><p>mid-cap market at a low cost of 0.1 per cent. With \u00a31.6bn in assets, it is much larger than both an equally cheap Xtrackers product and an iShares ETF that was once superior in terms of size.</p><p>NEW SPDR S&amp;P UK Dividend Aristocrats (UKDV) Some on the panel wanted to avoid UK dividend ETFs outright, but the sheer popularity of such strategies means we have instead looked for the most defensive option available. One name that stood out here was SPDR's S&amp;P UK Dividend Aristocrats ETF. Rather than simply targeting the highest-yielding companies, this ETF invests in companies with a long record of dividend increases. This adds a level of security to some of the dividends the ETF is exposed to, as businesses with a reputation based on longstanding payments could prove more hesitant to make cuts.</p><p>However, we would stress that this approach is not a silver bullet. The fact that even some well-financed names with long track records are cutting dividends out of prudence means that this ETF could still take some pain, but it looks less risky than IUKD's approach at this point. This is also a reasonably large ETF with a lower fee than the iShares product.</p><p>Dropped from the 2019 selection: iShares UK Dividend UCITS ETF (IUKD) Favoured by many investors for its attractive level of equity income, the UK market has run into trouble amid a slew of dividend cuts and suspensions. Link Asset Services has predicted that UK dividend payouts for 2020 could be down by between 27 and 51 per cent from 2019's total of \u00a398.5bn.</p><p>In this context, our panellists have grown concerned about the focus of this ETF, which invests in 50 higheryielding companies from the FTSE 350. Because dividend yields move inversely to share prices, it may well find itself exposed to companies that are cheaply priced either because they are struggling or because investors fear they will cut their dividends. These troubles are evident from some of its recent holdings: on 28 May the ETF's 20 biggest positions included Royal Dutch Shell, which has cut its dividend for the first time since the second world war, and insurer Aviva, which recently announced a suspension of its payouts.</p><p>Because retail investors are so enthusiastic about equity income, we have continued to include what we judge to be the best dividend ETFs in the list. But in recognition of the elevated risks in the equity income space, we have moved all dividend ETFs into our satellite category, as well as replacing riskier plays like this with more defensive products.</p><p>GLOBAL EQUITIES (FOUR ETFs) iShares MSCI World Small Cap UCITS ETF (WLDS) Our panel had no complaints about this ETF, which remains an attractive prospect when it comes to cost and liquidity. It has a charge of 0.35 per cent and the fund has more than $1bn in assets across its various share classes. Small-cap investing can often mean elevated risks, so the fact that the underlying index is diversified across more than 3,000 holdings will come as a relief to some.</p><p>iShares Edge MSCI World Minimum Volatility UCITS ETF (MINV) This ETF's strategy has held up better than its US counterpart's this year, registering less of a loss than the mainstream MSCI World index. Cautious investors, and those with a slightly contrarian bent, may again be tempted by a satellite position with less of a focus on the current market leaders. This ETF, for example, has slightly less exposure to the US than a regular MSCI World tracker.</p><p>Investors will pay extra for this differentiation, with the 0.3 per cent charge making this product more expensive than a vanilla global equity ETF. But in uncertain times, you may be willing to pay up for something different.</p><p>As with other global products, do remember the risk that you might be duplicating positions held via regional funds.</p><p>Vanguard Global Value Factor UCITS ETF (VVAL) The value investment style has continued to take a drubbing this year, with few obvious signs of a decisive comeback. But the need for diversification, and the fact that some investors will feel doubtful of the recent market rally and wish to go against the grain, has compelled us to stick with last year's value ETF picks for the time being.</p><p>This ETF continues to stand out on some of the usual metrics, given its low cost and good levels of liquidity. But eagle-eyed readers will note that this is, in fact, an actively managed fund. Vanguard uses quantitative analysis to pick stocks based on criteria such as their prices and estimated future earnings.</p><p>NEW Fidelity Global Quality Income UCITS ETF (FGQI) Taking a global approach to dividend investing is a good way to mitigate some of the challenges that have become most obvious in the UK market, but no region is entirely safe from the pressures of the coronavirus crisis. As such, we have again erred on the side of caution here, replacing a Dividend Aristocrats ETF with the quality-biased Fidelity product.</p><p>The composition of global indices means that investors will get hefty exposure to the lower-yielding but better-performing US equity market, but the ETF takes in plenty of other markets, from Japan to the UK, Europe and Australia. The fund has a decent level of assets and a 0.4 per cent charge.</p><p>Dropped from the 2019 selection: SPDR S&amp;P Global Dividend Aristocrats UCITS ETF (GBDV) In keeping with our thinking for regional dividend ETFs, we have opted to back what we deem to be the most defensive global option available. And while the Dividend Aristocrats focus on track records may provide one level of safety around certain payouts, we believe a better choice exists in these uncertain times.</p><p>JAPANESE EQUITIES (ONE ETF) iShares MSCI Japan Small Cap UCITS ETF (ISJP) The panel still views this as a standout product when it comes to tracking Japanese smaller companies - although this in part relates to a lack of competitive alternatives. WisdomTree, for example, offers a Japanese small-cap ETF, but this has much less in the way of assets.</p><p>The iShares offering is large and liquid, with a broad underlying index that tracks nearly 1,000 companies. However, this ETF still looks far from cheap, with a 0.58 per cent charge.</p><p>EUROPEAN EQUITIES (TWO ETFS) iShares Edge MSCI Europe Value Factor UCITS ETF (IEFV) The usual caveats about value investing apply to this pick, but it continues to stand out in its field because of the exposures investors are getting. Unlike many European equity funds and ETFs, this product includes an allocation to the UK - important because, as we noted last year, getting exposure to UK value stocks via an ETF can be a difficult task. This ETF's index also offers a reasonably wide range of different geographical exposures. It charges 0.25 per cent - not unreasonable for a factor ETF - and has significant assets.</p><p>NEW Fidelity Europe Quality Income UCITS ETF (FEUI) We have again opted for a dividend strategy that seeks out financially robust companies to provide a layer of protection for equity income investors. Like the other offerings in this product range, Fidelity Europe Quality Income has an attractive 0.3 per cent fee.</p><p>This is arguably the Fidelity dividend ETF that may raise the most questions, because it has a limited level of assets under management so far. But it could well take on more money if dividend investors look for a more cautious approach, and benefits from being part of a wider product range that has fared well.</p><p>ASIA PACIFIC EX JAPAN EQUITIES (ONE ETF) SPDR S&amp;P Pan Asia Dividend Aristocrats UCITS ETF (PADV) This ETF remains the most attractive prospect in its field, in part because of a lack of alternatives. A lack of competition has also meant little pressure on prices, with this product charging a fairly high 0.55 per cent fee.</p><p>However, it may still be worth considering as a satellite income play: Asia could well bounce back from the current crisis quicker than other regions, while economic growth and corporate improvements could result in a rosy outlook for dividends. And as we noted, a focus on companies with a good track record of increasing dividends does add a level of reassurance, even if it is no guarantee that payouts will keep rising.</p><p>EMERGING MARKET EQUITIES (THREE ETFS) iShares Edge MSCI Emerging Markets Minimum Volatility UCITS ETF (EMV) Unlike some other minimum volatility ETFs, this product has fared well versus the mainstream market in what has been a turbulent year. And investors may be especially tempted to take a minimum volatility approach here, given that emerging markets can be a racier investment than other regions.</p><p>This iShares product takes the same approach as the others in the same range. It does charge a slightly higher fee than the others, but investors may value such an approach here.</p><p>SPDR MSCI Emerging Markets Small Cap UCITS ETF (EMSM) A high-octane option, this may nevertheless appeal to those with a long-term mindset and an appetite for risk. The fund is not huge in size, but does offer exposure to a very broad range of companies, with 1,517 holdings in the underlying index towards the end of May. The 0.55 per cent charge means this is not the cheapest ETF, but some of this is understandable given the specialist area it focuses on.</p><p>Xtrackers Harvest CSI300 UCITS ETF (RQFI) A promising but risky play, this ETF stands out because it grants investors access to Chinese mainland stocks (A Shares), which were only recently included in MSCI indices. The CSI 300 ETF index includes businesses from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, with a focus on the biggest and most liquid equities in these markets.</p><p>The specialist nature of this ETF, combined with its good liquidity, goes some way toward justifying the steep 0.65 per cent ongoing charge. But the risky nature of the market in question means investors should not overlook active funds, or funds that allocate to China as part of a more diversified approach, as an alternative option.</p><p>BONDS (THREE ETFS) Invesco US Treasury Bond 7-10 Year UCITS ETF (TRXG) Investors looking to diversify their government bond exposure beyond the UK can also turn to US Treasuries, which generally held up well in this year's sell-off. This ETF, which focuses on one of the most popular parts of the Treasury market, stands out both in terms of its significant scale and a very attractive price of just 0.06 per cent.</p><p>As with some of our satellite options, you should remember the risk of overlap with the core ETFs. AGBP has a good chunk of its assets in the US government bond market. This satellite option, instead, gives more targeted exposure.</p><p>iShares Fallen Angels High Yield Corp Bond UCITS ETF (RISE) The ETF that generated the most enthusiasm among this year's panel, this product looks to generate yield and returns from 'fallen angel' bonds, which have been downgraded from investment-grade to high-yield status. Such bonds tend to be oversold as a result of their downgrade, but often retain an element of quality.</p><p>With many well-known companies, from Ford (US:F) to Kraft Heinz (US:KHC), seeing their debt downgraded amid the coronavirus crisis, the fallen angel market has grown markedly and could offer plenty of opportunities. It is not without risks - some downgrades may well prove to be justified, while fallen angel bonds tend to have longer maturities, and thus could be more sensitive to moves in interest rates. But investing in line with this theme in a diversified way could pay off.</p><p>This iShares ETF continues to appeal on various fronts. It is large and liquid, has a broad array of bonds, with around 460 bonds in early June, and recently offered a yield of around 4.5 per cent. The 0.5 per cent charge makes sense, given the specialist nature of this offering.</p><p>NEW iShares JPMorgan $ EM Bond UCITS ETF (EMHG) At a time when 'safe' bond yields have collapsed, interest rates have been slashed and equity dividends are coming under pressure, brave income investors might find themselves turning to riskier parts of the market. Emerging market debt is one option, but the uncertainties of the Covid-19 era could mean the risks are especially elevated.</p><p>While no guarantee of safety, emerging market debt denominated in 'hard' currencies has tended to be less volatile than local currency bonds. This iShares ETF stood out as a route to hard currency exposure, given its substantial assets and broad focus. The fund's underlying index has around 500 bonds and can hold both government and corporate debt, although it recently had a heavy skew towards the former. The 0.5 per cent charge makes this product slightly cheaper than the emerging market debt ETF included in last year's list.</p><p>Dropped from the 2019 selection: SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Emerging Markets Local Bond UCITS ETF (EMDL) This ETF still does its job, but we are dropping it in favour of a product that focuses instead on hard currency emerging market debt. Local currency debt can prove more volatile, and we are opting for something slightly more stable in what could be a challenging time for some developing economies.</p><p>NICHE ETFS With ESG investments growing increasingly mainstream and successfully enduring their first major market selloff, we have moved 'light' ESG options into most of our core equity groupings. This has left no room in the list for the following: \u00a6 UBS MSCI ACWI Socially Responsible UCITS ETF GBP Hedged (AWSG) \u00a6 UBS MSCI EMU Socially Responsible UCITS ETF (UB39) \u00a6 JPMorgan Global Research Enhanced Index Equity UCITS ETF (JGRE) \u00a6 UBS Bloomberg Barclays MSCI US Liquid Corporates Sustainable UCITS ETF GBP Hedged (BSUS) We have also dropped Lyxor Global Gender Equality UCITS ETF (GEND), both for space and because of reservations among our panellists: THEMATIC (FOUR ETFS) As the coronavirus crisis has demonstrated, investing based on themes rather than geographies or sectors can pay off when you get it right. From remote working to e-commerce, there are plenty of trends that are due to accelerate and promise strong returns for those in the right place.</p><p>One issue with thematic investing is the sheer amount of choice on offer: this was one area where our panellists were especially forthcoming with suggestions for new entrants. However, significantly expanding this section would mean narrowing the options available when it comes to the core and satellite holdings elsewhere in the list. For many individuals, choosing core and satellite holdings will still be a sensible starting point for portfolio construction rather than anything more niche.</p><p>As such, we have stuck with the four options already in this category, believing that these are still solid choices and a good way to play continued trends. But we will increasingly look for the best thematic funds - both passive and active - in our ongoing personal finance coverage.</p><p>iShares Automation &amp; Robotics UCITS ETF (RBTX) This ETF, which launched in late 2016, tracks the iStoxx FactSet Automation &amp; Robotics index, which allocates to companies based on how much revenue they derive from the automation and robotics industries. We believe this trend remains a compelling one, while the ETF itself stands out because of its substantial assets and a 0.4 per cent charge.</p><p>iShares Ageing Population UCITS ETF (AGES) This ETF is still much smaller than RBTX, but has a respectable $280m and enough scale to provide good levels of liquidity. The underlying index holds companies that specifically provide products or services to those aged 60 or older.</p><p>The composition of the benchmark could spell mixed fortunes for this ETF's performance as we move through the coronavirus crisis. While around 45 per cent of the index consists of healthcare holdings, some of which will benefit from the crisis, holdings in areas such as the consumer discretionary sector could suffer. But with more than 300 holdings, the diversification of this index could help smooth out returns in the near term. It is also good to remember that thematic products, like many investments, are plays on a long-term trend with natural ups and downs.</p><p>iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF (INRG) This ETF has proved hugely popular in the past year: it has amassed more than $800m in assets, up from $300m when we introduced it to the 2019 list.</p><p>The fund's underlying index, S&amp;P Global Clean Energy, tracks 30 companies operating in clean energy production or clean energy technology. While having just 30 holdings makes this a concentrated approach, it seeks out the biggest companies in the sector, and looks for names that are themselves diversified. Stocks are weighted in the index based on a combination of their market cap and a 'clean energy score' allocated to them by S&amp;P. The ETF is fairly diversified geographically, with around 40 per cent of assets in the US, 10 per cent in China and allocations to other countries including New Zealand, Canada and Brazil. However, it could still arguably be cheaper, with its ongoing charge coming to 0.65 per cent.</p><p>iShares Digitalisation UCITS ETF (DGIT) An ETF poised to benefit from trends accelerated by the coronavirus lockdown, this has made a 10 per cent share price total return in the first five months of 2020. The underlying index includes companies based on how much revenue they derive from digital activity.</p><p>The US makes up nearly 60 per cent of the index, with the likes of Japan, Australia and South Korea also represented. While some of the FAANG stocks are present here, they are much less heavily represented than in some mainstream markets. This large ETF offers good liquidity, and comes at a price of 0.4 per cent.</p><p>This ETF remained in last year's list as a play on a socially important theme with an apparent correlation to better returns. However, concerns have now arisen about the underlying methodology, making this an easy fund to remove.</p><p>The fund tracks the Solactive Equileap Global Gender Equality index, an equally weighted benchmark of 150 global companies that score highly based on 19 criteria. But with such scores relying on company disclosures, some of our panel worried that it was proving difficult to correctly identify the best businesses for gender equality, making it difficult to know whether the best holdings are actually being included in the fund.</p><p>COMMODITIES &amp; PRECIOUS METALS (THREE ETFS) ETFs are a cheap, straightforward way to invest directly in commodities and precious metals. We have made no changes to this category in the belief that the current options are good building blocks.</p><p>Invesco Bloomberg Commodity UCITS ETF (CMOD) The vast majority of our panel continued to back this option, which launched in 2017. This Invesco ETF looks competitive both in terms of size and fee, although investors need to remember what exactly they are paying. As with other ETFs, an ongoing charge is applicable, in this case of 0.19 per cent. But they also need to pay a swap fee of 0.15 per cent.</p><p>The ETF's underlying index, Bloomberg Commodity, had more than 20 different constituents at the end of May, from an 18.2 per cent position in gold to holdings in natural gas, copper, soybeans, corn, oil and silver.</p><p>As such, do check this against the other ETFs in this category for potential overlap. As one panellist noted, investors who want to do without pure plays on commodities can also alternatively get some form of exposure via equity markets. The UK, for example, offers a good deal of exposure to the energy sector.</p><p>Invesco Physical Gold ETC (SGLD) Gold, alongside government bonds, has proved itself to be among the few reliable diversifiers in the coronavirus sell-off, and some argue it can also act as a hedge against inflation.</p><p>This ETF is still a strong choice. Its charge has fallen from 0.24 to 0.19 per cent since it featured on last year's list, bringing its fees in line with those of an iShares rival. The iShares product is now larger than this ETF, but Invesco's offering remains extremely large. Although both are good products, we stick with the Invesco option in part to help investors diversify across different providers.</p><p>Invesco Physical Silver P-ETC (SSLV) Silver has performed relatively well this year, and can prove useful in times of inflation. Panellists had no qualms with the inclusion of this ETF on the list, considering its reasonable ongoing charge of 0.39 per cent and efficient tracking of the silver price.</p><p>This year our panel consists of:  ;

Rather, the EU and US\u00a0will likely have to find a new agreement that guarantees that Europeans' data is afforded the same privacy protection in the U.S. as it is in the EU, which has some of the toughest standards in the world.</p><p>The case began after former US\u00a0National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed in 2013 that the American government was snooping on people's online data and communications. The revelations included detail on how Facebook gave US\u00a0security agencies access to the personal data of Europeans.</p><p>Austrian activist and law student Max Schrems that year filed a complaint against Facebook, which has its EU base in Ireland, arguing that personal data should not be sent to the US, as many companies do, because the data protection is not as strong as in Europe.</p><p>Far-reaching implications for tech firms</p><p>Though the legal case was triggered by concerns over Facebook in particular, it could have far-reaching implications for all tech companies that move large amounts of data over the internet if regulators find that US\u00a0privacy protections are insufficient and block the transfers.

Electric cars were expensive, the vehicle range was too short, and there was a dearth of charging infrastructure. Talk centred around the enduring nature of the internal combustion engine. Today, we are at a tipping point in the adoption of EVs. \u201cThe electric car revolution has tilted into gear,\u201d says Michael Dunne, chief executive officer at ZoZo Go.    The highest value automaker in the world is now the Palo Alto-based Telsa, dwarfing the giants of the industry, despite selling only a fraction of the volume of cars.  In Europe, electrified vehicles (battery electric vehicles and hybrids) accounted for almost 20 percent of sales last month.    Without regulations in the United States, China and Europe mandating the adoption of EVs, it is possible electrification may have never gotten off the ground, says Dunne. Regulations are forcing automakers to find a way to make electrics work, he says.    ZoZo Go is an investment advisory firm that specialises in electric, autonomous, and connected technologies. Since 1990, the organisation has been linking Western tech companies with market opportunities in Asia. Michael Dunne joined Vicky Villena-Denton, CEO and Editor-in-Chief of F&amp;L Asia Ltd, on F+L Webcast to discuss the major trends upending the automotive industry.    Photo courtesy of VinFast    A shift to electrification is the number one trend in the automotive industry, says Dunne. China is \u201cking of the hill\u201d right now, and accounts for approximately half of global EV volumes. While Japan and Korea are also actively developing EVs, the most exciting story in Asia is start-up VinFast in Vietnam. Founded in 2017, VinFast is the brainchild of Vietnam\u2019s richest man, Mr Ph\u1ea1m Nh\u1eadt V\u01b0\u1ee3ng, and is rumoured to begin production on Vietnam\u2019s very own electric SUV as early as next year, says Dunne.    Pham, who is set to invest billions of dollars of his personal wealth in the project, has confirmed plans to export electric cars to the United States by 2022. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that is realistic, but you cannot doubt the ambition is there\u201d, says Dunne. Pham\u2019s efforts also enjoy the full support of the government in Hanoi, he says. Investors from the West are increasingly looking at Vietnam as an alternative to China.    The rest of Southeast Asia is still relatively quiet on the EV front, with a continuing emphasis on gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles. A lack of infrastructure to charge vehicles is a key limitation. \u201cI don\u2019t see big penetration numbers in Southeast Asia in the next five years,\u201d says Dunne.    Automobile manufacturers used to think in terms of selling a \u201cunit\u201d. Moving forward, automakers will need to act like a technology company. A car will basically be a computer on wheels, says Dunne.  The second major trend highlighted by Dunne is connectivity, which is set to unlock the next big revolution \u2014 connected car capabilities.    Automakers are increasingly looking at how to sustain revenues after a person has purchased a car. As connectivity improves, Dunne foresees huge opportunities in infotainment \u2013 streaming, texting, watching movies and e-commerce. Infotainment will flow through the centre stack screen as automakers and tech companies try to turn your car into the next iPhone or iPad \u2014 with a seamless experience from home to vehicle. The big tech companies are highly active in this space, says Dunne. Apple may be the market leader, but Google is particularly aggressive, he says.    With an estimated 1.5 billion passenger cars on the road, the internal combustion engine is not going away anytime soon. However, connectivity gives rise to an extremely complicated aftermarket and a transition towards diagnostic solutions. A typical car repair may require one-part mechanic, and two parts computer technician.    China has the edge on the rest of the world when it comes to the mouth-watering trend of autonomous vehicles, says Dunne. The Chinese Government\u2019s ability to knock down barriers to commercial application means China will surely leapfrog democratic countries in the adoption of this technology. In the United States, each state has its own set of rules creating a difficult regulatory environment. There are also considerations around insurance liability. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a lot longer to get there,\u201d says Dunne. The ZoZo Go CEO expects autonomous vehicles will initially happen in isolated cases in geofenced areas, with particular application in trucking.    The extent to which people in cities are willing to give up their cars in favour of ride-hailing services has major implications for the industry. Chinese company Didi, the world\u2019s largest ride-sharing company by number of rides, delivers more than 10 billion trips per year. Uber and Lyft are not far behind. Cars are no longer aspirational for young people, suggests Dunne. They want experiences, the freedom to travel. \u201cI have insurance payments, I have to find a parking space, there are traffic jams, this is so stressful, why do I own a car?\u201d he jests.    Michael Dunne    Some industry insiders believe ride-hailing will increase car volumes due to growing fleet sizes. Conversely, many believe we are approaching \u201cpeak car\u201d in developed regions due to our connectedness, the advent of autonomous driving, and ride-hailing. We will not need as many cars to get the same job done; they say. \u201cI am in the latter camp\u201d, says Dunne. A Covid-19 initiated shift to working from home will also have an impact on car volumes, he says.    For many years, companies were content to put all their supply chain eggs in one basket \u2013 China. However, tensions between the United States and China have reached boiling point. \u201cThe relationship has not been this bad in 45-50 years\u201d, says Dunne.    While companies are unlikely to admit they made a strategic blunder, Dunne indicates there has been a change in mindset \u201cat the top of the boardroom\u201d. Companies are moving fast to reconfigure their supply chains. It may not be as efficient or profitable but it is probably safer long-term. \u201cI\u2019m getting calls from clients saying how do we diversify our investment and our supply?\u201d Southeast Asia will be a big beneficiary of that Trend, he says. The Japanese government is providing incentives to Japanese companies to move their plants out of China, says Dunne. There is a possibility there will be two supply chains globally, one for China and one for the United States and all of its friends.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43024264951</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SV-9GY1-F07F-80T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1126\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Fuels and Lubes</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 8, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Electric Car Co Inc</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eastern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>ELCR</className><className>PINX</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>STX000565</classCode><className>ELECTRIC VEHICLES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00092SR</classCode><className>AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPM9</classCode><className>ELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DFAA</classCode><className>INDUSTRY TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPPQ</classCode><className>GOSSIP &amp;

The letters also asked whether the phones collect location data even when location services and similar capabilities are disabled.<br/><br/>Users of iPhones and of Google\u2019s Android mobile operating system \"have a reasonable expectation of privacy when taking active steps to prevent being tracked by their device,\" the letters say.<br/><br/>A Google representative said in a statement the company looks \"forward to answering the committee\u2019s questions.\"<br/><br/>\"Protecting our users\u2019 privacy and securing their information is of the utmost importance to Google,\" the representative said.<br/><br/>Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br/><br/>The Wall Street Journal first reported on the letters and the access to Gmail users\u2019 messages allegedly afforded to outside developers, which was said to come despite the company\u2019s moves to limit access internally.<br/><br/>Big tech companies, particularly Facebook Inc., have been targets of increasing public scrutiny and calls, even from some Republican lawmakers, for potential regulation.<br/><br/>In June, for instance, the top members of the Senate Intelligence Committee said they wanted top executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter Inc. to appear before Congress to discuss the security of their platforms and the companies\u2019 relationships with Chinese telecommunications firms. The House committee also questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in April over Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that secured access to the information of as many as 87 million of the site\u2019s users without their consent.<br/><br/>Apple, however, has largely stayed above the fray, and has even upped its privacy controls in a jab at Facebook.<br/><br/>Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, chairman of the House panel that oversees most technology policy issues, was the lead signer of the letters. Three fellow Republicans, Representatives Gregg Harper of Mississippi, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Robert Latta of Ohio, also signed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WINITP-393292</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WINITP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SWR-33G1-DY2V-D02N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">337441</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"464\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Penton Business Media, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Windows IT Pro Magazine</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 11, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The letters also asked whether the phones collect location data even when location services and similar capabilities are disabled.<br/><br/>Users of iPhones and of Google\u2019s Android mobile operating system \"have a reasonable expectation of privacy when taking active steps to prevent being tracked by their device,\" the letters say.<br/><br/>A Google representative said in a statement the company looks \"forward to answering the committee\u2019s questions.\"<br/><br/>\"Protecting our users\u2019 privacy and securing their information is of the utmost importance to Google,\" the representative said.<br/><br/>Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br/><br/>The Wall Street Journal first reported on the letters and the access to Gmail users\u2019 messages allegedly afforded to outside developers, which was said to come despite the company\u2019s moves to limit access internally.<br/><br/>Big tech companies, particularly Facebook Inc., have been targets of increasing public scrutiny and calls, even from some Republican lawmakers, for potential regulation.<br/><br/>In June, for instance, the top members of the Senate Intelligence Committee said they wanted top executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter Inc. to appear before Congress to discuss the security of their platforms and the companies\u2019 relationships with Chinese telecommunications firms. The House committee also questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in April over Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that secured access to the information of as many as 87 million of the site\u2019s users without their consent.<br/><br/>Apple, however, has largely stayed above the fray, and has even upped its privacy controls in a jab at Facebook.<br/><br/>Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, chairman of the House panel that oversees most technology policy issues, was the lead signer of the letters.

We welcome [outside investment firms] and need them, really.\"</p><p>On breaking up big tech</p><p>\"Any time there are companies that may have too big of a share and engage in monopolistic behavior, it's a question of how to address that,\" Surycheva said. \"How startups and them are able to compete on an equal footing, and that's what those policies aim to support.\u00a0The rules will always follow innovation, but the question is, 'How can we preserve the spirit of innovation for companies?' Especially in the early stage, to have a fair shake without losing the fight very early on.\"</p><p>On artificial intelligence and its effect on the labor force\u00a0</p><p>\"It's evolving and will be part of our futures,\" Jennifer Dunham, partner at Arsenal Venture Partners, said. \"And there are a lot of jobs that focus on human interaction, which is how you treat your jobs, how you treat your customers.\u00a0There's this idea you have to be technologically advanced, but you can't forget about the human element. Because, in some cases, it's more important. And we are losing that a little bit.\"</p><p>\"Being around tech for a long time, you always see this problem with new technology that will it take away jobs,\" Wallace said. \"And it seems to have given more than taken away. Clearly, we will need less truck drivers, other jobs and not just blue-collar ones. It will affect a lot of different aspects of the labor force, but I am hopeful it creates more job than it displaces.\"</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

That method could spell trouble for the other tech giants, like Google and Facebook, that are currently facing antitrust investigations in the United States. It would likely have a lesser effect on Microsoft itself. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Smith says tech companies can learn from such probes --- and he knows from experience. He was the general counsel for Microsoft and a trusted adviser to Bill Gates throughout Microsoft's own antitrust case in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p><p>\"I think you can think of Microsoft, the antitrust battles that started in the 1990s, as sort of technology's first collision with the modern world as we know it,\" Smith told CNN's Poppy Harlow in a recent interview for Boss Files. \"Microsoft had to change. We had to do more to listen to other people, understand their concerns, acknowledge their concerns and then ultimately address them and that required a lot of change.\"</p><p>A new method of measuring monopolies is just one of the ways Smith said he'd like to see laws change so that big tech is better regulated in the United States.</p><p>Those changes, Smith said, are necessary in light of the massive power and influence technology now has in society, in business and in government. Smith explores that power in his new book, Tools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age, co-written with Microsoft senior director of external relations Carol Ann Browne.</p><p>\"I think there are lots of technology companies that have been founded on a desire to do good for the world,\" Smith said. \"But I also think that there is an opportunity for introspection, because it's one thing to do what you love to do and be committed to it doing good for the world. It's another thing to step back and ask the harder questions ... Are we [doing good for the world]? Are there unintended consequences?\" </p><p>Privacy </p><p>Smith, like Apple CEO Tim Cook, said he thinks privacy (or the lack thereof) has reached a \"crisis\" point, \"and it would benefit us to treat it that way,\" he said. </p><p>The solution, he said, should be twofold: Federal regulators should pass a national privacy law, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, the likes of which Smith has been advocating for since 2005. GDPR gives consumers the right to know when their personal data is being collected online and how it will be used. As the United States awaits such a federal law, Smith said companies in the industry should begin offering customers those rights on their own. </p><p>Smith recalled a December 2013 meeting he and several other tech executives had with then-President Barack Obama, not long after Edward Snowden leaked secret documents showing the National Security Agency was spying on American citizens. As the executives worked with Obama on a government solution, the President told them the tech industry would one day soon have to do the same. </p><p>\"President Obama said, 'I have a suspicion that the guns will turn (on you),'\" Smith said. \"He followed up that statement by explaining that in his view --- which I think was also correct --- the companies around the table had as much or more data about the American population, [about] people as consumers, than the government did.\" </p><p>One bright spot, he said, is a privacy law set to go into effect in California in 2020 that grants internet users more control over their personal data, allowing them to opt out of having their information shared or sold to third parties, for example. Smith said he thinks California's consumer privacy law will push most companies to change the way they handle user privacy even before any federal legislation passes.</p><p>Facial recognition </p><p>Another area in urgent need of regulation is facial recognition, Smith said. </p><p>For one thing, facial recognition technology can be biased since it more accurately detects men and white people's faces than others'. Smith said it could also have potentially problematic implications for companies' or governments' abilities to track people's movements, their spending habits, or their participation in political movements --- the kind of tracking that leaders in China may already be using to monitor pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. </p><p>\"If you just think about the right to assemble peacefully, which I think is at the core of democratic freedoms, it puts that at risk --- the mass surveillance future that George Orwell imagined,\" Smith said. </p><p>Still, Microsoft is one of many companies working on developing facial recognition technology, and Smith doesn't think it should be banned altogether. </p><p>He spoke about one bill that was proposed in Microsoft's home state of Washington that would have put stipulations on the use of facial recognition software by government agencies and would have required the makers of such software to allow third-party testing of their products, as well as to establish GDPR-like privacy protections. Microsoft urged lawmakers to pass that law, rather than another Washington bill that would have put a moratorium on the use of facial recognition by local and state governments.</p><p>\"I actually don't think a ban makes sense because you cannot improve a technology if you can't use it, and you can't use it if it's banned,\" Smith said. </p><p>Neither Washington bill passed, and Smith said he thinks companies themselves need to be selective about who they will provide their software to until regulations are in place </p><p>\"There should be regulations and restrictions on its use. Companies should be applying these voluntarily at this stage,\" he said. \"That's what we're doing ... If it leads to the risk of bias, we've turned down deals that do that. If it is going to put peoples' fundamental human rights at risk through mass surveillance, we should be and are saying no.\"</p><p>This kind of cooperation between tech companies and regulators could be key to the industry's future. </p><p>\"I don't think it's enough to say that this is some problem that the government alone should solve and that we, who create the technology, have no responsibility to address ourselves,\" Smith said. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

That method could spell trouble for the other tech giants, like Google and Facebook, that are currently facing antitrust investigations in the United States. It would likely have a lesser effect on Microsoft itself.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">READ ALSO: Microsoft Releases 2019 Earnings Report</p><p>But Smith says tech companies can learn from such probes \u2014 and he knows from experience. He was the general counsel for Microsoft (MSFT) and a trusted adviser to Bill Gates throughout Microsoft's own antitrust case in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p><p>\"I think you can think of Microsoft, the antitrust battles that started in the 1990s, as sort of technology's first collision with the modern world as we know it,\" Smith told CNN's Poppy Harlow in a recent interview for Boss Files. \"Microsoft had to change. We had to do more to listen to other people, understand their concerns, acknowledge their concerns and then ultimately address them and that required a lot of change.\"</p><p>A new method of measuring monopolies is just one of the ways Smith said he'd like to see laws change so that big tech is better regulated in the United States.<br/>House antitrust probe of Big Tech seeks documents from Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google<br/>Those changes, Smith said, are necessary in light of the massive power and influence technology now has in society, in business and in government. Smith explores that power in his new book, Tools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age, co-written with Microsoft senior director of external relations Carol Ann Browne.<br/>\"I think there are lots of technology companies that have been founded on a desire to do good for the world,\" Smith said. \"But I also think that there is an opportunity for introspection, because it's one thing to do what you love to do and be committed to it doing good for the world. It's another thing to step back and ask the harder questions \u2026 Are we [doing good for the world]? Are there unintended consequences?\"</p><p>Privacy<br/>Smith, like Apple CEO Tim Cook, said he thinks privacy (or the lack thereof) has reached a \"crisis\" point, \"and it would benefit us to treat it that way,\" he said.<br/>The solution, he said, should be twofold: Federal regulators should pass a national privacy law, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, the likes of which Smith has been advocating for since 2005. GDPR gives consumers the right to know when their personal data is being collected online and how it will be used. As the United States awaits such a federal law, Smith said companies in the industry should begin offering customers those rights on their own.<br/>Smith recalled a December 2013 meeting he and several other tech executives had with then-President Barack Obama, not long after Edward Snowden leaked secret documents showing the National Security Agency was spying on American citizens. As the executives worked with Obama on a government solution, the President told them the tech industry would one day soon have to do the same.</p><p>President Obama said, 'I have a suspicion that the guns will turn (on you),'\" Smith said. \"He followed up that statement by explaining that in his view \u2014 which I think was also correct \u2014 the companies around the table had as much or more data about the American population, [about] people as consumers, than the government did.\"<br/>One bright spot, he said, is a privacy law set to go into effect in California in 2020 that grants internet users more control over their personal data, allowing them to opt out of having their information shared or sold to third parties, for example. Smith said he thinks California's consumer privacy law will push most companies to change the way they handle user privacy even before any federal legislation passes.<br/>Facial recognition<br/>Another area in urgent need of regulation is facial recognition, Smith said.<br/>For one thing, facial recognition technology can be biased since it more accurately detects men and white people's faces than others'. Smith said it could also have potentially problematic implications for companies' or governments' abilities to track people's movements, their spending habits, or their participation in political movements \u2014 the kind of tracking that leaders in China may already be using to monitor pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.<br/>\"If you just think about the right to assemble peacefully, which I think is at the core of democratic freedoms, it puts that at risk \u2014 the mass surveillance future that George Orwell imagined,\" Smith said.<br/>Kara Swisher has no plans to stop calling out Big Tech CEOs<br/>Still, Microsoft is one of many companies working on developing facial recognition technology, and Smith doesn't think it should be banned altogether.<br/>He spoke about one bill that was proposed in Microsoft's home state of Washington that would have put stipulations on the use of facial recognition software by government agencies and would have required the makers of such software to allow third-party testing of their products, as well as to establish GDPR-like privacy protections. Microsoft urged lawmakers to pass that law, rather than another Washington bill that would have put a moratorium on the use of facial recognition by local and state governments.<br/>\"I actually don't think a ban makes sense because you cannot improve a technology if you can't use it, and you can't use it if it's banned,\" Smith said.<br/>Neither Washington bill passed, and Smith said he thinks companies themselves need to be selective about who they will provide their software to until regulations are in place<br/>\"There should be regulations and restrictions on its use. Companies should be applying these voluntarily at this stage,\" he said. \"That's what we're doing \u2026 If it leads to the risk of bias, we've turned down deals that do that. If it is going to put peoples' fundamental human rights at risk through mass surveillance, we should be and are saying no.\"<br/>This kind of cooperation between tech companies and regulators could be key to the industry's future.<br/>\"I don't think it's enough to say that this is some problem that the government alone should solve and that we, who create the technology, have no responsibility to address ourselves,\" Smith said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDNIG-156958310</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDNIG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8P-47V1-JDJN-640K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428125</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1077\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Daily Independent.

But an Executive Order that would turn the FCC into the President's speech police is not the answer,\" said Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic member of Federal Communications Commission, one of the agencies tasked with enforcing the executive order.</p><p>Matt Schruers, president of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, a trade group, warned that \"retaliation against the private sector for fact-checking leadership is what we expect from foreign autocracies, not the US.\"</p><p>Internet firms have denied Trump's claims of bias, and point to his massive social media following. But the president's move plays into his narrative ahead of his difficult November reelection battle that liberal forces are trying to censor Republicans.</p><p>Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican and fierce critic of social media, said that if online firms \"are going to editorialize and censor and act like traditional publishers, they should be treated like traditional publishers and stop receiving the special carve out from the federal government.\"</p><p>But Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, one of the authors of the 1996 law, called Trump's order a \"plainly illegal\" political ploy.</p><p>\"Trump is desperately trying to steal for himself the power of the courts and Congress to rewrite decades of settled law around Section 230. All for the ability to spread lies,\" Wyden said.</p><p>A wider debate has long been underway on the power that social media companies wield and what responsibility they bear for posts that are misleading or hurtful.</p><p>Internet services like Twitter and Facebook Inc have been struggling to root out misinformation, while at the same time keeping their platforms open to users.</p><p>The massive amount of unverified content in circulation has prompted a rise in fact-checking operations, including a vast Facebook effort in which AFP plays a role.</p><p>After long resisting calls to censure Trump over his frequent factually inaccurate posts, Twitter on Tuesday flagged the president for the first time for making false claims.</p><p>Trump had tweeted \u2013 without any evidence \u2013 that more mail-in voting would lead to what he called a \"Rigged Election\" this November.</p><p>Some analysts claimed the president's arguments against Twitter had turned upside down the interpretation of the constitution's First Amendment, designed to prevent the government from limiting free expression.</p><p>\"The First Amendment applies to the government not to private actors like Twitter,\" wrote law professors Laurence Tribe of Harvard and Joshua Geltzer of Georgetown University in the Washington Post.</p><p>\"Trump is wrong on the law, but this time he's even more wrong than usual.

In contrast, the list of top 10 companies has of late become rather sticky, notwithstanding the recent arrival of Saudi Aramco at number one \u201cwith a bullet\u201d, to quote the weekly music shows of my youth. </p><p>Today, the so-called top 10 for equities is dominated by the \u201cfabulous five\u201d US technology titans, with China\u2019s Alibaba and Tencent also in the mix. There is naturally some concern at how Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (which this week joined the $1tn market-capitalisation club) Facebook and Amazon account for almost a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 index and are responsible for a quarter of the broad market\u2019s return over the past 12 months. Just how long this remarkable run can last is currently dominating the market conversation.</p><p>Some look back at the peak of the dotcom boom in 2000, or the era of Wall Street\u2019s \u201cNifty 50\u201d blue-chips from the 1960s and 1970s, and worry a reckoning awaits. Others highlight how the current leaders are very good companies with strong business models, huge revenues and a proven ability to keep growing a lot faster than the rest of the S&amp;P 500. </p><p>The start of a new decade merits looking at the biggest stocks in terms of market capitalisation with the understanding that this list will change over the next 10 years. From 2010 only two companies, Apple and Microsoft, have remained in the top 10 list of the world\u2019s biggest companies as the likes of HSBC, BHP, Walmart and ExxonMobil have fallen by the wayside. This highlights the prowess of tech at the expense of old economy companies at the coalface of disruption. But the idea that winners can reign for longer is questioned given the lessons of the past. </p><p>Rob Arnott at Research Affiliates has counselled that the \u201ctop dogs\u201d duly slide down the rankings as they enter a period of natural underperformance after reaching an expensive valuation that proves far too rich for most investors. </p><p>But of late, the top 10 list has become decidedly sticky. In 2014 the two tech titans of Apple and Microsoft were joined by Google (now Alphabet), then Amazon arrived in 2016, while Facebook has been a presence since 2018. Tencent, Alibaba, Berkshire Hathaway, Johnson &amp; Johnson and JPMorgan have also maintained a presence among the top ranks. </p><p>For example, buying the largest stock within the S&amp;P 500 at the end of each year would have resulted in an underperformance of 50 per cent between 1992 and 2013, however over the past six years such a strategy would have beaten the broad market by 72 per cent, according to Vincent Dulard at INTL FCStone Financial.</p><p>A look at the backdrop for financial markets helps explain why the big are getting bigger and not shuffling down the list. A world of low growth, modest inflation pressure, poor demographics and a propensity for high savings is also accompanied by many companies lacking pricing power. That has shifted the equity needle towards faster growing companies and away from smaller groups in particular, a phenomenon some dub \u201ccorporate inequality\u201d. Buybacks, certainly by the likes of Apple and Microsoft, have also helped them maintain their chart-topping positions.</p><p>The staying power of large tech has not been knocked by falling earnings estimates. Russ Mould at AJ Bell notes how for the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet) their \u201cconsensus earnings estimates for 2019 and 2020 have fallen by 7 per cent and 8 per cent, or $10.7bn and $9.6bn respectively\u201d. The net result is that as a group, the Faangs \u201chugely re-rated from 21 times earnings for 2020 to nearly 30 times now\u201d.</p><p>Russ explains the rationale of investors at the moment:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cEven if earnings forecasts have dropped slightly in the past year, analysts and investors continue to expect rapid progress going forward. Such consistent growth is rare in the current low-growth, low-inflation and low-interest environment and as a result firms that can increase profits on a secular basis thanks to the strength of their products, services and competitive position will naturally be very highly prized.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>That the bigger only keeps getting bigger also reflects mergers, whereby smaller companies are scooped up and used to bolster economies of scale and innovation for their larger buyers, a hallmark of big tech\u2019s expansion down the years. This naturally raises talk of corporate inequality, while the lobbying efforts of large companies appear for now to have limited the prospect of far-reaching antitrust or anti-competitive legislation. </p><p>Michael Wilson and the equity team at Morgan Stanley argue that corporate inequality \u201cis the result of the extraordinary liquidity being provided by the world\u2019s central banks, which is flowing to the most liquid and largest names in the S&amp;P 500\u201d.</p><p>The team observes:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cThis also recalls 1999, when the Fed expanded its balance sheet at the end of the year and early in 2000 as a precaution against Y2K disruption. The bottom line: this income/market cap divergence looks likely to continue over the near term, given the Fed\u2019s expected balance sheet expansion through April. More importantly, if we\u2019re right, these companies will then need to deliver on the income side of the inequality divide or risk a sharp decline in price.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>Another aspect of investors crowding into large-cap companies has been the relentless rise of passive investment funds that track the equity market.</p><p>Mr Deluard from INTL FCStone makes the point that much of the money flowing into passive funds comes from high-fee mutual funds. Among the largest 250 actively-managed US equity funds, he says a majority \u201chave no significant exposure to the fantastic five stocks because of the size and value tilts of most active funds\u201d. The point here:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cOutflows from these funds into market cap-based funds ultimately leads to net purchases of the fantastic five and net sales of everything else.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>That, he argues, means when money leaves actively managed funds and enters the realm of passive vehicles, this great rotation \u201cshould result in steadily rising prices and disproportionate gains for its largest components\u201d. Or, as Mr Deluard, adds: \u201cThat seems like a fair description of market action in the past 10 years.\u201d</p><p>At some point the music will stop. In fact, upcoming tech earnings may briefly test the current record-setting tone in equities led by the top dogs. Investors have enjoyed a great run, but recent arrivals will have less staying power in the event of a shakeout. Above all, investors building portfolios for the long haul need the infusion of dynamic new companies rather than crowding into a small segment of the market. Sticking with these larger companies that are arguably closer to their mature stage risks a lower return over time for the younger generation of investors. </p><p>Mr Deluard notes:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cOver the long term, it is probably wiser to buy the \u2018anti-bubble\u2019 assets that nobody wants to own: cash, value stocks, banks, energy companies, cyclicals, commodities, emerging markets and European stocks.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>As seen during late 2018, it takes a sharp rise in real yields (a barometer of broader economic growth) before the market questions paying a hefty premium for owning tech. Such a prospect looks low at the moment given the supportive attitude of central banks and expectations for modest economic growth. Barring a far more aggressive response from regulators, the likelihood that many of today's large companies will reap the benefits of coming technological innovation before finally maturing suggests a sticky top 10 list for a while yet.</p><p>Programming note</p><p>Market Forces returns on Tuesday and to all readers, have a great weekend. </p><p>Quick Hits \u2014 What\u2019s on the markets radar</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">China\u2019s economy expanded</emphasis> at its slowest pace in 29 years during 2019, but the size of the pie is what really matters. The current annual rate of 6.1 per cent has eased from 9.4 per cent a decade ago, but as Andy Rothman at Matthews Asia calculates:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cGDP growth was 188 per cent larger than the base 10 years ago, meaning the incremental expansion in the size of China\u2019s economy in 2019 was 145 per cent bigger than it was at the faster growth rate a decade ago. In other words, there was a greater opportunity last year for Chinese companies selling goods and services to Chinese consumers than compared to 10 years ago, when the GDP growth rate was much faster.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>Meanwhile, the de-risking of China\u2019s financial sector will continue. Andy writes: </p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cI also expect a continuation of last year\u2019s experiments of selected defaults by state-owned and private firms, in an effort to push investors to price risk. I do not expect the government to relax their tight controls over off-balance-sheet (shadow) financial activity.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The US Treasury jumped ahead of the February refunding announcement</emphasis> with the news late on Thursday that sales of 20-year bonds would return for the first time since 1986. Now the question is what cutbacks if any occur for other Treasury maturities. On that score, here\u2019s Wrightson Icap\u2019s initial take:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cIt seems obvious that the Treasury won\u2019t offset much, if any, of the new 20-year bond issuance in the 10 and 30-year sector. The administration\u2019s decision to introduce a new long-term borrowing vehicle is driven by the desire to take advantage of historically low long-term interest rates, and the benefits of doing so would obviously be diluted by scaling back issuance in other long maturities.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>Another issue raised by Bill O\u2019Donnell and the Treasury team at Citi is whether there is sufficient demand for 20-year bonds, particularly as the first monthly 30-year bonds sold back in 2009 are now entering that area of the market.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cOur fear is that the new supply in 20s could eventually outweigh the demand for paper at that maturity point \u2014 rendering 20s a bit of an expensive (for Treasury) benchmark orphan too. This is one of the key reasons why [the] Treasury decided to abandon 20-year issuance back in the mid-1980s.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The upcoming policy meetings</emphasis> of both the European Central Bank (next week) and the US Federal Reserve (end of January) are not expected to provide much in the way of surprises. DWS looks at central banks, rates, yields and currencies via its chart of the week and highlights how a narrowing gap between US and eurozone interest rates has yet to help the euro. </p><p>DWS notes:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cThe yield gap between US and German two-year bonds stood at 3.5 percentage points at the end of 2018 and has since dropped to 2 percentage points, where it was at the beginning of 2018.

While any capitalist wants to see business thrive, corporations reduce the market to a state of oligopoly - depriving small, innovative businesses of the ability to make positive developments in the market. Within the technology sector, big companies have been stealthily choking competition for years. Now is the time to find a solution.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The current system permits major tech firms such as GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon) to abuse their dominant positions and exclude smaller rivals. In order to maintain their dominant positions, GAFA companies have pursued an acquisition policy that buys out small companies seeking to innovate - a so-called \"kill in the crib\" strategy.</p><p>Since 2001, <url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/abc86a9e-1dbb-41a4-b0ed-34e8114cafb8.html\">Google has acquired at least 215 businesses</url> . The rate of these acquisitions continues to increase each year. Overall, the big five tech companies have made close to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/abc86a9e-1dbb-41a4-b0ed-34e8114cafb8.html\">500 acquisitions worth a total of around $140 billion</url> .</p><p>These acquisitions have allowed big tech companies to seize total control of the market; driving out competition and innovation. As of July 2018, <url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/abc86a9e-1dbb-41a4-b0ed-34e8114cafb8.html\">Google consolidated its dominance in the search engine market, maintaining an 86.02 per cent market share</url>, and likewise, Amazon is currently responsible for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/abc86a9e-1dbb-41a4-b0ed-34e8114cafb8.html\">93% of total ebook sales.</url> Similarly, Facebook's acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp strengthened their grip on the social media market by increasing the company's reach from 2 billion Facebook users to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/abc86a9e-1dbb-41a4-b0ed-34e8114cafb8.html\">95 per cent of young people.</url></p><p>But what exactly is the problem with this? The main concern, as previously highlighted, is that it stifles innovation in the rest of the technology market. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/abc86a9e-1dbb-41a4-b0ed-34e8114cafb8.html\">report by Goldman Sachs</url> states that oligopolistic markets allow big companies to face lower competitive intensity and increased pricing power with customers due to reduced choice. Tommaso Valletti, the chief economist at the EU Commission, also concluded in a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/abc86a9e-1dbb-41a4-b0ed-34e8114cafb8.html\">research paper</url> that takeovers in an oligopolistic market reduces overall innovation.</p><p>Furthermore, tech giants consistently use their dominance to give themselves \"special treatment\".</p><p>One frequently reported example of this is how Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google have used their privileged positions to pay less tax.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/abc86a9e-1dbb-41a4-b0ed-34e8114cafb8.html\">Refresh | A free-market response to Britain's biggest issues</url></p><p>Google has also used its market dominance to give itself an unfair advantage by giving its own products higher rankings and hiding a new company's competing products. Not only is this unfair to smaller businesses, but it also poses a threat to consumers who lose the ability to become aware of innovative products that small businesses may offer. Poor government legislation has also made mounting a legal claim against big tech financially ruinous and impossible.</p><p>With small businesses representing nearly half of all job growth in the UK, and with one <url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/abc86a9e-1dbb-41a4-b0ed-34e8114cafb8.html\">report</url> claiming that 50 per cent of all productivity gains can be attributed to technological improvements, big tech companies are draining the market of innovation and creativity. Healthy competition without unfair acquisitions is required in order to sustain a dynamic economy that produces cost-effective methods of production and the improved quality of goods/services.</p><p>So, how do we solve the problem? Fines and breakups have been the two most commonly tested methods.</p><p>The European Union instated a <url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/abc86a9e-1dbb-41a4-b0ed-34e8114cafb8.html\">(EURO)2.42 billion fine</url> on Google over their comparative shopping search results, though this has been to minimal effect. Breakups into smaller firms such as those experienced by IBM in the 1990s, Standard Oil, and AT&amp;T could potentially be another option. However, with most of the tech businesses being global, the chance this would prove effective is slim.</p><p>Instead, to protect competition and what it's meant to ensure (lower prices, innovation, and consumer choice) we need to take several different measures.</p><p>As <url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/abc86a9e-1dbb-41a4-b0ed-34e8114cafb8.html\">outlined in a paper</url> published by the think tank ResPublica, Brexit provides us with a unique opportunity to create our own system and not be tied to European laws on mergers and acquisitions. New antitrust laws could help small businesses compete fairly with the tech giants. This means introducing effective new merger control laws and scrupulous competition law enforcement.</p><p>For too long, big tech has unfairly capitalised on the fact merger control laws aren't wholly inclusive of innovation mergers. Changing this law, with the addition of providing safe harbour protection for small businesses could prevent mass acquisitions and support the innovation driven by small businesses. It could also provide small businesses with the legal protection they need to mount legal cases if they've been dealt with unfairly - a right they currently lack.</p><p>The primary rationale behind these measures is to protect producers, consumers and the free market economy from the business behaviours of an oligopolistic market and ruthless big tech firms. With technology being the fastest growing industry the UK has to offer, we need to make sure we protect our small businesses while encouraging the effective innovation and competitive environment that can make the UK a technology haven of the future.</p><p>                       For more from Refresh, including lively debate, videos and events, \u00a0join our\u00a0 <url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/abc86a9e-1dbb-41a4-b0ed-34e8114cafb8.html\">Facebook group</url> \u00a0here and follow us on Twitter at\u00a0       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/abc86a9e-1dbb-41a4-b0ed-34e8114cafb8.html\">@TeleRefresh\u00a0</url></p><p>\u200b</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-51377288</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VB3-NCS1-F021-64N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><timeReceived>3:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 1, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Privacy Shield, created in 2016, allows businesses in the European Union and the United States to move data more easily between the two regions. More than 5,000 companies use the system.</p><p>  The decision is the latest twist in a long-running campaign by privacy-rights activists in Europe who want to prevent companies from moving their personal information to countries with looser data protection rules. The efforts stem from revelations in 2013 by the American former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden about how U.S. government surveillance programs collected electronic communications from private businesses.</p><p>  The overall effect of the court's decision was not immediately clear beyond creating a dizzying amount of new work for corporate legal departments. Few expect a sudden disruption for moving data between Europe and the United States. Before the decision was announced, European officials played down the potential fallout, saying plans were in place to ensure commerce would not be interrupted. American and European officials will now try to negotiate a new deal for transferring digital information.</p><p>  The court said some alternative data-transfer contracts struck between organizations were acceptable, though it cautioned that companies must be sure that a government outside Europe -- in the United States or elsewhere -- meets European privacy standards. Some companies may respond by storing more data inside the European Union.</p><p>  The ruling affects big tech companies like Facebook and Google, as well as thousands of other multinational businesses. Lawyers said the data subject to transfer rules could include communications like emails and social media posts, financial records, business files, human resources materials about employees, marketing databases and customer records.</p><p>  Business groups have called for a grace period that would allow companies to find new legal mechanisms to continue moving data.</p><p>  ''This decision cuts off legal means to transfer personal data to the United States and will demand immediate attention by policymakers and U.S. companies doing business in Europe,'' said Caitlin Fennessy, research director at the International Association of Privacy Professionals, an industry group based in New Hampshire.</p><p>  Seven years after Mr. Snowden disclosed the existence of the bulk surveillance programs, the case is an example of the lingering conflict between European privacy rights and American surveillance laws. In the European Union, the protection of personal data is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, alongside civil rights like freedom of expression.</p><p>  The protections are further supported by the European Union's landmark privacy law enacted in 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation.</p><p>  The case started when an Austrian data-protection campaigner, Max Schrems, filed a complaint against Facebook, arguing that his privacy rights were violated once his data was transferred to the United States, where it be would be vulnerable to American snooping. The case became a broader referendum on the validity of data-transfer agreements when information leaves the European Union.</p><p>  Mr. Schrems, who now runs a privacy-rights group called NOYB -- taken from the phrase ''none of your business'' -- released a statement after the ruling. ''It is clear that the U.S. will have to seriously change their surveillance laws if U.S. companies want to continue to play a role on the E.U. market,'' the statement said.</p><p>  The decision is the second time Mr. Schrems has overturned an E.U.-U.S. data-sharing pact. In 2015, he fought to have the court invalidate the predecessor to Privacy Shield over concerns that American spy agencies could have access to data coming from the European Union.</p><p>  Privacy Shield was meant to address those issues, providing new safeguards to Europeans, including more control over how their information is used and the right to go to American courts if they thought that a company or the United States government had misused their data. The deal included an American guarantee that government could not collect data without sufficient cause.</p><p>  Wilbur Ross, the U.S. secretary of commerce, said in a statement that the United States was ''deeply disappointed'' by the ruling, but that it would work with European officials to ''limit the negative consequences to the $7.1 trillion trans-Atlantic economic relationship that is so vital to our respective citizens, companies and governments.''</p><p>  United States representatives participated in arguments for the case last year, an unusual step that signaled its importance. They argued that government surveillance programs were narrowly targeted and provided sufficient data-access protections, and that European privacy rights could not dictate the national security policy of a foreign government.</p><p>  European officials expressed optimism about finding a solution.</p><p>  ''Today's judgment is another steppingstone in our commitment to ensuring that personal data is fully protected in the E.U. and its transfers outside of the E.U.,'' said Didier Reynders, European commissioner for justice. ''I will reach out to my U.S. counterparts and look forward to working constructively with them to develop a strengthened and durable transfer mechanism.''</p><p>  Eduardo Ustaran, a lawyer specializing in privacy and cybersecurity at the law firm Hogan Lovells in London, said that while average people were unlikely to notice any major changes as a result of the decision, it left thousands of companies in legal limbo.</p><p>  ''The practical effect is actually huge,'' he said. ''Any company that wants to transfer data overseas must now check the powers of other countries to have access to that data.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: An Austrian lawyer had argued in a complaint against Facebook that his privacy rights were violated once his data was transferred to the United States.

The fund also has been dominant over longer periods. Putnam Growth Opportunities has posted average annual returns of 11.84%, 17.52% and 10.25% over the past three, five and 10 years. These results have bested the S&amp;P 500 in each of those years, putting the fund on the path to win an IBD Mutual Fund Award.</p><p>Brookby has been at the helm of the $4.6 billion fund\u00a0 since 2009. IBD recently caught up with him to discuss which of his investment themes prospered in 2017 and how he sees the landscape for large-cap .</p><p>IBD:\u00a0What makes a company a good candidate to be included in your portfolio?</p><p>Rob Brookby:\u00a0 I focus on three key growth investor metrics: the revenue growth rate of a business, the duration of the growth, and return on capital.</p><p>IBD:\u00a0How does your investing strategy differentiate the fund from other large growth funds?</p><p>Brookby:\u00a0I follow a thematic process to identify the duration of growth. What we want to try to understand is what the big picture or story is that is intersecting with the business that is driving the growth. At any given time, I am working with two or three dozen themes across the portfolio.</p><p>IBD'S TAKE:\u00a0Looking for actionable stocks? Check out our\u00a0\u00a0page, where you can find stocks near buy zones, stocks hitting new highs, sector leaders, tech leaders, IPO leaders and more.</p><p>IBD:\u00a0Have there been any  that have fared particularly well this year for the fund?</p><p>Brookby:\u00a0We have seen the FANG stocks perform very well. We have owned Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). These companies are disrupting very big traditional markets. Our exposure to U.S. internet and U.S. cloud are underpinning FANG.</p><p>The autonomous and EV innovation of automobiles is another theme that has fared well. We are exposed to autonomous driving on the semiconductor side. There are a lot of different technologies that are now showing up in automobiles, whether it is driver-assisted vision or integrated steering and braking, that are powered by semiconductors \u2014 companies like STMicroelectronics (STM) that we are invested in and have been for a while.</p><p>Lastly, in the consumer space, we have been exposed over time to digital marketing, and the idea we have expressed it the most clearly through is our investment in Live Nation Entertainment (LYV). They have found ways to create advertising units, whether that is the headline sponsor at a concert, the naming rights to a venue or the signage in the parking lot. Advertisers are fighting in a crowded space for the consumer's attention and they have found clever ways to take an event and drive marketing around it.</p><p>IBD:\u00a0What is your outlook for large-cap growth stocks for 2018?</p><p>Brookby:\u00a0The rampage that large-cap growth stocks have gone on this year should give way to a more balanced performance between growth and value. Within the large-cap growth space, we are more interested in industrial cyclicals and financials and less interested in the big tech and big health care stocks that have done much of the heavy lifting this year and have seen their valuations expand greatly.</p><p>IBD:\u00a0Are there any particular industrial stocks that you like right now?</p><p>Brookby:\u00a0We have a major investment in Norfolk Southern (NSC). There are really only four railroads in this country. We haven't started another railroad in many, many decades. As economic growth picks up, you should see more freight in general moving over rails. The thing that makes them particularly interesting is not what is going on in rails, but what is going on in trucking. The major competitor of a rail is a truck, and there have been a number of regulatory changes in the trucking market that have really tightened up trucking capacity.</p><p>IBD:\u00a0What themes are you seeing at Alphabet that has led it to be a top holding in your portfolio?</p><p>Brookby:\u00a0The major one is YouTube. They have 1.5 billion monthly active users of YouTube that are using the service an average of an hour a day. The growth of YouTube this past quarter was just north of 30%. It is an amazing property that is hoovering up advertising dollars. Another major theme is Google Cloud Platform. It has some powerful technologies underlying it that are allowing for pretty explosive growth.</p><p>IBD:\u00a0What aspects of Amazon's business do you find to be the most intriguing?</p><p>Brookby:\u00a0The two things that intrigue me the most are what they are going to do with voice search expressed through Alexa and advertising in general. They have a high-margin opportunity to start to monetize the opportunity to advertise more directly on their platform. The big three advertising agencies\u00a0\u2014 Publicis, Omnicom and WPP\u00a0\u2014 announced earlier this fall that they were going to more than double the spend they are allocating to Amazon.</p><p>IBD:\u00a0How significant do you see Apple's services segment being for future growth?</p><p>Brookby:\u00a0 I don't think it is too strong to say it is really the key to the company's future. The iPhone business is down to about 55% of revenue and has been coming down as a percentage as the other parts of the business have picked up. Myself and many growth investors really want to see Apple transform itself into a more recurring revenue type of subscription business where customers are paying Apple $30, $40 or $50 a month, every month, to consume a set of services around its ecosystem, whether it be Apple Music, Apple Pay, the iTunes app store, iCloud or Apple Care.</p><p>RELATED:</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-3046526</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R95-JBY1-DYTD-902F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

But it wasn't all smooth sailing, as many of the largest companies faced public and regulatory scrutiny along with company-level issues. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told Markets Insider that he sees little risk to the future growth of the largest tech companies. Tech has been the fastest-growing sector this year, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100[1] nearly doubling the gains of the S...00[2]. But tech has made its share of negative headlines this year. Facebook and Google have been facing investigations[3] over their roles in allowing foreign influence in the 2016 presidential elections. </p><p>Additionally, Apple has seen highly mixed results to its newest editions of the iPhone[4]. As the EU cracks down on tax evasion and anticompetitive practices by tech companies in its member states[5], American lawmakers have started to ponder regulating or even breaking up some of the big tech companies. As the capabilities of AI programs skyrocket, and tech companies successfully automate more human jobs, anxiety over the future of work in the US seems to grow with the market cap of many of the tech giants. But is it all doom and gloom for some of the world's largest companies? With 2018 fast approaching, Markets Insider sat down RBC's Mark Mahaney to find out what could be in store for the tech sector next year. Mahaney is one of the most widely respected analysts in the tech space and is rated in the top five analysts by Bloomberg for 14 of the 25 stocks he covers. Following is transcript of a phone interview with Mahaney. It has been edited for clarity. Seth Archer: Going into 2018, what are you looking out for, what gets you excited, and what are you worried about? Mark Mahaney: Three things have remained constant about the large-cap internet stocks, at least the high-quality ones. One of these facts is that revenue growth is extraordinarily consistent. The expression we use is 'insanely consistent' in our last earnings preview. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix \u2014 all four of the FANGs[6] \u2014 have had almost the exact same growth rate in '17, '16 and '15. Facebook has faded a little bit, but it's faded from, like, 60 down to high 40. I've been struck by how consistent the growth rates have been. I've also been struck by how consistent the aggressive investment has been by these companies. All these companies have been spending aggressively on new areas of growth: whether it's Netflix spending more money on original content and expanding internationally, whether its Amazon spending more money on buying Whole Foods and on distribution centers for its retail business and data centers for its cloud business, whether it's Facebook investing aggressively into artificial intelligence and machine learning and into video content. And Google is still aggressively investing in cloud \u2014 also into its projects like autonomous vehicles. The investment outlook remains aggressive for all four of those companies, and the revenue growth has remained very consistent. And the third thing that is constant is really the multiples. The valuations on these names are very similar to where they were two years ago. The multiples have either held or have come down. It's interesting: They've had three years in a row of dramatic market outperformance. It's not been due to a multiple rerating. That would typically be it, you'd expect. It's been entirely been due to earnings growth. The stocks have gone up because the earnings have gone up, and the earnings have gone up because the revenue growth has been consistent.So those are the three constants. As I think about '18, I don't see a reason why the fundamental trends behind the leading internet platforms, so I call them \"PEFANG\": Priceline, Expedia, FANG. I don't think there is any reason \u2014 except for the online travel names \u2014 I don't think there is any reason to expect a change, either a material change in their revenue growth or in their aggressive investment outlook. And the multiples. It's sort of interesting. I feel less conviction about the multiples than I do about the fundamentals of the company. Because I feel like the fundamentals are extremely intact, and since multiples have been very consistent the last three years, I don't know why they wouldn't be this year. But as a stock picker, I would worry about if there's a rotation out of growth into value. Then, clearly, no matter how high quality they are, the internet names would underperform if there's a material rotation out of growth into value. Archer: So you are worried about multiples going down, not them going higher right? Mahaney: Yeah, I guess that's right. I don't think that given where the multiples are, I don't know that there's room for a lot of correction in the multiples. But I could see the multiples go down by a couple of points on each of the names as a part of the trade rotation out of growth and into value. That's a risk that I would think about. I think the high-quality internet names, they probably face portfolio risk. I don't foresee any particular macro risk and I don't see any particular fundamentals risk. You know, famous last words \u2014 but they've been very consistent the last three years.Archer: You mentioned government regulations. Does that come to a head in 2018, and how does that affect earnings? Mahaney: I don't know if it comes to a head, but there's no doubt that there is greater regulatory scrutiny of these names. OK, maybe not Netflix \u2014 but Google, Amazon and Facebook. There's no doubt that there's greater public and regulatory scrutiny now than there was 12 and 24 months ago. And it's not only that, but there's been actual, regulatory action taken against Google in the EU. And there are two more investigations that the EU is undergoing. I'm skeptical that the regulatory public scrutiny will lead to either a material change in their revenue growth outlooks or in their cost structures. But the latter is a possibility. It's possible that they are going to have to spend more money to comply with regulations. Whether that's data-privacy regulations like those that are going to be imposed by the EU in 2018, that could lead to a rise in their cost structure. I don't think it would be material, but it's possible. Facebook \u2014 one of the reasons they are going to be accelerating their expense growth in '18 is the need to spend more on security because of the Russian hacking of the US elections. So that's an odd expense. I don't know if that really falls under scrutiny, except that it was public scrutiny that made Facebook get more aggressive about it. I guess that's probably the biggest variable I can think of. Does regulatory and public scrutiny cause their operating costs to rise more aggressively than they would otherwise? That, to me, is one of the most interesting changes. A couple of other trends I find interesting in the group are the increasing focus on AI and machine learning. It's very hard to see that impact from a financial perspective; it's hard to find their line in the P...hat says this is artificial intelligence, but it's in there in terms of the expenses. And it should be in there in the form of more relevant and more effective services. I guess that's point one.The stocks have gone up because the earnings have gone up, and the earnings have gone up because the revenue growth has been consistent.Point two is, I'm very intrigued by what I call the \"voiceification\" of the internet. It's not only in emerging markets. I'm not certain on this, that voice is much more of a user interface, an application-interaction method than in the developing markets. And more and more of the growth of the internet is in developing markets. In the US, that will essentially carry the internet, or bring the internet into the car and the kitchen. I'm thinking about Alexa devices, Google Home devices, the HomePod, by Apple, whenever that comes out. So I think about that. It's not the most important platform shift of the last five years or next five years. It's still going to be smartphones. But voiceification could also move the needle \u2014 not exactly as smartphones did, but it will move the needle. Archer: And does AI move that needle? You said it's hard to see. Mahaney: Yes, it must. It's one of those \"submarine trends.\" It's impacting the tides, but it's below the surface, so it's very hard to see it.Read more about how tech is in the crosshairs of regulators here[7].

It has been edited for clarity.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Seth Archer:</emphasis> Going into 2018, what are you looking out for, what gets you excited, and what are you worried about?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Mahaney:</emphasis> Three things have remained constant about the large-cap internet stocks, at least the high-quality ones. One of these facts is that revenue growth is extraordinarily consistent. The expression we use is 'insanely consistent' in our last earnings preview.</p><p>Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix - all four of the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-news-fang-futures-tech-companies-2017-11?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">FANGs</url> - have had almost the exact same growth rate in '17, '16 and '15. Facebook has faded a little bit, but it's faded from, like, 60 down to high 40. I've been struck by how consistent the growth rates have been.</p><p>I've also been struck by how consistent the aggressive investment has been by these companies. All these companies have been spending aggressively on new areas of growth: whether it's Netflix spending more money on original content and expanding internationally, whether its Amazon spending more money on buying Whole Foods and on distribution centers for its retail business and data centers for its cloud business, whether it's Facebook investing aggressively into artificial intelligence and machine learning and into video content.</p><p>And Google is still aggressively investing in cloud - also into its projects like autonomous vehicles. The investment outlook remains aggressive for all four of those companies, and the revenue growth has remained very consistent.</p><p>And the third thing that is constant is really the multiples. The valuations on these names are very similar to where they were two years ago. The multiples have either held or have come down. It's interesting: They've had three years in a row of dramatic market outperformance. It's not been due to a multiple rerating. That would typically be it, you'd expect. It's been entirely been due to earnings growth. The stocks have gone up because the earnings have gone up, and the earnings have gone up because the revenue growth has been consistent.</p><p>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</p><p>So those are the three constants. As I think about '18, I don't see a reason why the fundamental trends behind the leading internet platforms, so I call them \"PEFANG\": Priceline, Expedia, FANG. I don't think there is any reason - except for the online travel names - I don't think there is any reason to expect a change, either a material change in their revenue growth or in their aggressive investment outlook.</p><p>And the multiples. It's sort of interesting. I feel less conviction about the multiples than I do about the fundamentals of the company. Because I feel like the fundamentals are extremely intact, and since multiples have been very consistent the last three years, I don't know why they wouldn't be this year.</p><p>But as a stock picker, I would worry about if there's a rotation out of growth into value. Then, clearly, no matter how high quality they are, the internet names would underperform if there's a material rotation out of growth into value.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Archer:</emphasis> So you are worried about multiples going down, not them going higher right?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mahaney:</emphasis> Yeah, I guess that's right. I don't think that given where the multiples are, I don't know that there's room for a lot of correction in the multiples. But I could see the multiples go down by a couple of points on each of the names as a part of the trade rotation out of growth and into value. That's a risk that I would think about.</p><p>I think the high-quality internet names, they probably face portfolio risk. I don't foresee any particular macro risk and I don't see any particular fundamentals risk. You know, famous last words - but they've been very consistent the last three years.</p><p>REUTERS/Francois Lenoir</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Archer:</emphasis> You mentioned government regulations. Does that come to a head in 2018, and how does that affect earnings?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mahaney:</emphasis> I don't know if it comes to a head, but there's no doubt that there is greater regulatory scrutiny of these names. OK, maybe not Netflix - but Google, Amazon and Facebook. There's no doubt that there's greater public and regulatory scrutiny now than there was 12 and 24 months ago.</p><p>And it's not only that, but there's been actual, regulatory action taken against Google in the EU. And there are two more investigations that the EU is undergoing. I'm skeptical that the regulatory public scrutiny will lead to either a material change in their revenue growth outlooks or in their cost structures. But the latter is a possibility. It's possible that they are going to have to spend more money to comply with regulations. Whether that's data-privacy regulations like those that are going to be imposed by the EU in 2018, that could lead to a rise in their cost structure. I don't think it would be material, but it's possible.</p><p>Facebook - one of the reasons they are going to be accelerating their expense growth in '18 is the need to spend more on security because of the Russian hacking of the US elections. So that's an odd expense. I don't know if that really falls under scrutiny, except that it was public scrutiny that made Facebook get more aggressive about it. I guess that's probably the biggest variable I can think of. Does regulatory and public scrutiny cause their operating costs to rise more aggressively than they would otherwise? That, to me, is one of the most interesting changes.</p><p>A couple of other trends I find interesting in the group are the increasing focus on AI and machine learning. It's very hard to see that impact from a financial perspective; it's hard to find their line in the P&amp;L that says this is artificial intelligence, but it's in there in terms of the expenses. And it should be in there in the form of more relevant and more effective services. I guess that's point one.</p><p>The stocks have gone up because the earnings have gone up, and the earnings have gone up because the revenue growth has been consistent.</p><p>Point two is, I'm very intrigued by what I call the \"voiceification\" of the internet. It's not only in emerging markets. I'm not certain on this, that voice is much more of a user interface, an application-interaction method than in the developing markets. And more and more of the growth of the internet is in developing markets.</p><p>In the US, that will essentially carry the internet, or bring the internet into the car and the kitchen. I'm thinking about Alexa devices, Google Home devices, the HomePod, by Apple, whenever that comes out. So I think about that. It's not the most important platform shift of the last five years or next five years.</p><p>It's still going to be smartphones. But voiceification could also move the needle - not exactly as smartphones did, but it will move the needle.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Archer:</emphasis> And does AI move that needle? You said it's hard to see.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mahaney:</emphasis> Yes, it must. It's one of those \"submarine trends.\" It's impacting the tides, but it's below the surface, so it's very hard to see it.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more about how tech is in the crosshairs of regulators here.</emphasis></h><p>NOW WATCH: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-krugman-says-bitcoin-is-a-bubble-2017-12?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">PAUL KRUGMAN: Bitcoin is a more obvious bubble than housing was</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Also:</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/net-neutrality-portugal-how-american-internet-could-look-fcc-2017-11?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Portugal hints at what the American internet could eventually look like without net neutrality</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/crazy-facts-about-bill-gates-house-2016-11?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">19 crazy facts about Bill Gates' $125 million mansion</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-gop-tax-reform-bill-may-save-amazon-facebook-google-billions-2017-12?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">The GOP tax bill could add billions to Amazon, Facebook and Google's bottom lines</url></p></bodyText></listItem></list><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEE ALSO:\u00a0RBC: Google is in the 'crosshairs' of antitrust regulators - and should be kicked out of FANG</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISIUS-5a2afd5fa3b474a60a8b4cc8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISIUS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VD6-SG41-DXY7-W443-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465531</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1491\"/><timeReceived>11:56 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Insider Inc.

It will be the first time that Jeff Bezos , Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai appear for questioning together and comes as the congressional panel hosting the hearing enters the final stretch of its investigation into digital marketplace competition.   For Democrats on the House Judiciary\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, led by Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Wednesday\u2019s testimony will be one of the last major components of that exhaustive process, which started in June 2019 and included hundreds of hours of calls, meetings and briefings, as well as the review of 1.3 million documents. No release date has been announced for the report.   A few Republicans on the subcommittee have signalled they will use the hearing to grill the nation\u2019s top tech CEOs on content moderation, pursuing persistent yet unsubstantiated allegations that social media platforms discriminate against conservatives.   Bezos is the only CEO that will be appearing before Congress for the first time Wednesday, and his inaugural hearing is likely to be combative given that members of the committee have already threatened Amazon with a perjury referral.   He will likely face questioning about Amazon\u2019s dual role as the operator of an online marketplace and a seller of goods on that market.   A bipartisan group of members from the House Judiciary Committee has wanted Bezos to testify ever since the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that the company used information from other sellers on the platform to make decisions regarding its private label business, which includes more than 243,000 products.   The article directly contradicted testimony last year from Amazon associate general counsel Nate Sutton, who told the committee that \u201cwe do not use any seller data to compete with them.\u201d   The European Union\u2019s top antitrust regulator announced last year it was investigating Amazon over its dual role.   Smaller vendors say Amazon also imposes warehouse and shipping fees that make it \u201cvirtually impossible to sustain a profitable business on Amazon's marketplace,\u201d according to Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.   Matt Stoller, director of research at the anti-monopoly organization the American Economic Liberties Project, told The Hill he hopes Wednesday\u2019s hearing will give lawmakers a chance to press Bezos on Amazon Prime, which critics say the company is running at a loss to crowd out other marketplaces.   For the other CEOs testifying, Cicilline has indicated his questioning of Cook will focus on Apple\u2019s App Store and allegations that the company buries apps that could displace its own products.   \u201cBecause of the market power that Apple has, it is charging exorbitant rents \u2014 highway robbery, basically \u2014 bullying people to pay 30 percent or denying access to their market,\u201d the Rhode Island lawmaker said on a podcast with The Verge last month.   \u201cIt\u2019s crushing small developers who simply can\u2019t survive with those kinds of payments. If there were real competition in this marketplace, this wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d   The European Commission has opened a formal probe into the App Store over the mandatory use of Apple\u2019s proprietary in-app purchasing system for distributing paid content, which takes a 30 percent cut.   Apple previewed its response to Cicilline\u2019s likely line of questioning last week, touting a study it commissioned conducted by the Analysis Group that says the App Store\u2019s fees and practices are largely in line with other digital marketplaces.   App developer Blix, which claims it has been suppressed in search functions by Apple, has recommended Cicilline press Cook on the company\u2019s search algorithm.   For Facebook, the company\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 are likely to feature heavily in Wednesday\u2019s testimony.   The company claims that concerns about dominating social media because of those purchases are overblown, emphasizing that the two platforms were not that big before being purchased by Facebook and that it still has to compete with apps like TikTok. Zuckerberg will likely point out that his company\u2019s purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp were approved by federal regulators at the time.   Another concern is how Facebook treats data collected by its different apps. Germany\u2019s top court ruled last month that the social media giant illegally combined data it collected about users across different platforms it owns.   Critics have also argued that Facebook\u2019s massive trove of data collected from users puts it in a dominant position, making it easy to push aside competitors that can\u2019t tailor their products to users in the same hyper-specific fashion Facebook can.   The biggest competition concerns with Google are tied to its dominance in search and the ad tech market.   The company has been accused of self-preferencing in search results, burying vertical search competitors far down the page. The European Commission fined Google $2.7 billion in 2017 for boosting its own shopping results over competing services.   Google has strengthened its position in the ad tech space in recent years with acquisitions of companies like DoubleClick and AdMob that give it dominance in nearly every step of the online advertising chain.   Issues outside of antitrust and competition will inevitably come up at the hearing, especially given the attention that will be paid to the hearing because of its high profile participants.   Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, publicly pushed for Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to testify at the hearing despite the company not having the same competition concerns as the ones already involved because of \u201cits role in moderating content on its platform,\u201d a clear reference to accusations of anti-conservative bias. The heads of the full committee -- Jordan and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) -- will be allowed to participate in the subcommittee hearing.   Stoller warned that Republicans focusing on anti-conservative bias would play into the hands of tech companies.   \u201cThat's actually what the tech CEOs want, they want to have an argument about whether they're screening for conservative content or not,\u201d he told The Hill. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to turn it into a clown show.\u201d   Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives internet companies immunity from lawsuits for content posted on their sites by third parties and allows them to make \"good faith\" efforts to moderate content, is also likely to come up given the administration's efforts to amend or scrap it entirely, according to Arun Sundararajan, an expert in big tech regulation at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business.   Democrats on the subcommittee have brushed off concerns about the hearing being derailed by political fights.   \u201cThis is in the antitrust subcommittee for that exact reason -- we want this hearing to be laser focused on competition problems as part of a year long investigation,\u201d a senior committee aide told reporters last week. \u201cOpening it up to the full committee would have opened up that entire range of topics to cover whereas our subcommittee has been really deeply engaged on this subject.\u201d   Wednesday\u2019s hearing is likely to be a significant moment for antitrust investigations into big tech, whether they come from Congress or other regulatory bodies like the Justice Department or state attorneys general.   \u201cThe House has ended up being the forum in which you have these four guys sitting together for the first time and having this discussion,\u201d Sundararajan said. \u201cAnd so, while Congress may not be the eventual body that makes the case for any particular change, it's certainly a good catalyst.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42702547453</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FW-YM61-F07F-82JW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1358\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>The Hill</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0003SRP</classCode><className>MITCHELL CO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It comes as lawmakers consider new tough regulations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Simply put, they have too much power,\" said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who chairs the panel conducting a year-long investigation into the business practices of the four companies.</p><p>Cicilline said the hearing made clear that the firms \"have monopoly power -- some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable\".</p><p>He added the coronavirus outbreak had strengthened them even further: \"They are likely to emerge (from the pandemic) stronger and more powerful than ever before.\"</p><p>\"With big power comes big responsibilities, and these companies like any other companies have to play by the rules. And I think that message was drawn very clearly yesterday,\" Pinar Akman, Director of the Centre for Business Law and Practice at the University of Leeds, told Euronews.</p><p>But there was also an evident divide among the lawmakers carrying out the grilling: Republicans mainly took issue at what they perceive as anti-conservative bias from tech giants, while Democrats seemed more concerned about the impact of big tech on small competitors.</p><p>\"Competition laws are there not to protect small competitors, but to ensure that effective competition of markets delivers benefits to consumers: lower prices, more innovation, a higher range of products, more choice and so on,\" Akman said.</p><p>\"And what was missing from the hearings was really a discussion of the harms or benefits to consumers that the companies these CEOs represent generate.\"</p><h>CEOs answer accusations of stifling competition and political bias</h><p>The executives did provide bursts of data showing how competitive their markets are, and the value of their innovation and essential services to consumers. But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices.</p><p>They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on US democracy and their role in China.</p><p>Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.</p><p>Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he could not guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.</p><p>Regulators in the US and Europe have scrutinised Amazon\u2019s relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p>\u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d Bezos said in a response to a question from US Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee to you that policy hasn\u2019t been violated.\u201d</p><p>Pichai's opening remarks touted Google's value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in the home districts of the antitrust panel's Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, and its ranking Republican, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.</p><p>But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p>Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline\u2019s attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing.</p><p>Zuckerberg was put on the defensive with regards to the social network\u2019s role as a conduit for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Lawmakers then deployed the company's internal documents against Zuckerberg, asserting that Facebook has gobbled up rivals to squelch competition.</p><h>Trump threatens executive orders on Big Tech</h><p>As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances that the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China. \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio.</p><p>In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.</p><p>\u201cIf Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted.</p><p>Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can't use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.</p><p>Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><h>Powerful giants</h><p>The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world\u2019s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.</p><p>Critics have questioned whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.</p><p>In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.</p><p>Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.</p><p>Cicilline also said that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cthese giants stand to profit\u201d and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online.</p><p>The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices</p><h>No strangers to anti-trust accusations</h><p>Just last year, the European Commission fined Google \u20ac1.49 billion for abusive practices in online advertising.</p><p>The EU's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in 2019 Google had illegally misused \"its dominant position for the brokering of online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anti-contractual restrictions on third-party websites.</p><p>\"This is illegal under EU antitrust rules. The misconduct lasted over 10 years and denied other companies the possibility to compete on the merits and to innovate - and consumers the benefits of competition.\u201d</p><p>In April 2018, Zuckerberg made his debut before the Senate in a five-hour hearing before a joint session of the Commerce and Judiciary committees.</p><p>He not only answered questions about the Cambridge Analytica scandal but also had to defend his company against monopoly power accusations. When asked about his biggest competitor in 2018, Zuckerberg said he could not name one.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUNWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-WGT1-DXJ7-N17R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">277169</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1381\"/><timeReceived>8:39 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 EuroNews All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EuroNews - English Version</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"22820\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

It's where Mary Meeker, a prominent venture capitalist, unveils her sweeping internet trends report, year after year, hundreds of slides long.</p><p>But at this year's conference, held this week in Scottsdale, Arizona, a procession of top tech execs were pressed to answer the same difficult question again and again: What will happen if mounting antitrust scrutiny of the tech industry forces their companies to be broken up?</p><p>One exec, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, seemed wholly unprepared to answer the question on stage Monday. She said \"I don't know\" twice in her response before ending with: \"We would figure it out.\"</p><p>Wojcicki's apparent bafflement, which she explained in part by noting YouTube's \"really busy\" week, hints at just how quickly the latest wave of antitrust scrutiny in the US has escalated. Just this month, the House Judiciary Committee launched a \"top-to-bottom\" antitrust probe of Big Tech reports came out that two federal regulators are divvying up responsibility for oversight of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple. Since then, there have been reports that Facebook is in the process of building up its defense team and Google is overhauling its policy and government affairs teams to manage the heightened scrutiny.</p><p>The antitrust developments have rattled Wall Street, shaving off tens of billions of dollars in market value from the four companies in a single day. Investors have for years bet on the remarkable growth of these four companies, two of which briefly topped $1 trillion in market cap over the last year. It also served as a stark reminder that an industry once hailed as representing the best of American innovation is now being scrutinized by politicians on both sides of the aisle for having too much power. </p><p>At the conference, several execs settled on a talking point that could well be repeated many times in the coming months as antitrust hearings and investigations get under way: Sure, you could break us up, but that won't help consumers or society. </p><p>\"I just think it's a terrible idea,\" Adam Mosseri, the head of Facebook subsidiary Instagram, said on stage on Monday. \"Right now, there are more people who work on integrity and safety issues at Facebook than anyone who works at Instagram. ... If you split us up, you would cut that off, and it would make those problems that much more difficult.\" </p><p>Andy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon's $25 billion cloud computing division, suggested breaking up Amazon would only make it harder for the company to \"stay focused\" on serving its customers. What customers want, he added, is more capabilities, not the company being distracted by having to build new financial systems, an HR system and manage analyst calls.</p><p>Jassy reluctantly admitted that Amazon might not have a choice in the matter in the end. \"If we're forced to do it, I guess we'd have to do it,\" he said.</p><p>While the tech executives predictably balked at having their businesses broken into pieces, many did agree that regulation is needed to tackle a host of issues, including data privacy, content moderation and facial recognition services, such as Amazon's Rekognition tool. </p><p>\"If you want more protection, which I think is totally reasonable, the federal government should regulate it,\" Jassy said, referring to facial recognition technology. \"I wish they'd hurry up -- if they don't, you're going to have 50 different laws in 50 different states.\"</p><p>Wojcicki was equally matter-of-fact: \"There's definitely more regulation in store for us.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Noting a few companies have a lot of market control, he asked \"are we allowing the market to work?\"<br/> Still, Senator Mike Lee, a Republican, said that the complexity of antitrust investigations suited them better to federal agencies, rather than Congress.<br/>Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook, speaking in an interview with CBS News that aired on Tuesday, denied the company is a monopoly, saying the iPhone maker controlled a moderate share of the market but was not too big, and disagreed with calls from some U.S. politicians that the company be broken up.<br/> \"With size, I think scrutiny is fair. I think we should be scrutinized,\" he said. But, he added, \"I don't think anybody reasonable is gonna come to the conclusion that Apple's a monopoly.\"<br/> Cook's comments were broadcast the same day two app developers sued Apple over its App Store practices, saying the company took an unfair commission on sales of iPhone apps.<br/> The claims centre on the same Apple practices highlighted in a lawsuit brought by consumers, arguing that Apple's practices have artificially inflated the price of software in the App Store.<br/> The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, which enforce antitrust laws in the United States, have divided oversight over the four companies, two sources told Reuters on Monday, with Amazon and Facebook under the watch of the FTC, and Apple and Google under the Justice Department.<br/>  The FTC has already been investigating Facebook's sharing of data belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Facebook said in April that it expected to be fined up to $5 billion (4 billion pounds) by the regulator.<br/>  The owner of one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp has more than 1.5 billion daily users and has a huge influence in many countries. It has been criticized for allowing misleading posts and \"fake news\" on its service.<br/>  Cook in the CBS interview also said that \"fake news is not under control\", and in response to a question about Facebook added, \"I worry about any property that today pushes news in a feed.\" Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<br/>  The probes could have financial implications for the companies. Brokerage Cowen cut its target price for Apple to $220 from $245 on Tuesday, citing antitrust enforcement concerns. Shares rose 3.7% to $179.64, as the broader market also rallied.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n11034920</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9S-B771-JBYT-H48P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"644\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 10, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Either way, 70,469 people have flooded into Lisbon's Altice Arena this week for a grand pow-wow of the industry's movers and shakers to discuss the pressing issues of the day.</p><p>Amid the hubbub and the frantic late-night networking at an alcoholfuelled Night Summit held in Lisbon's former red light district, here are five big themes to have emerged this year.</p><p>Two hemispheres of technology Mounting trade tensions between China and the US have escaped nobody this year.</p><p>Although Guo Ping of Huawei opened the conference on Monday with a speech on next generation 5G telecom networks, the Chinese contingent at Web Summit has been less visible than in previous years - a sign of the widening rift between the western and Chinese tech scenes.</p><p>Speaking yesterday, Tony Blair spoke of how it was vital for Europe and the US to collaborate to set common values for the development of new technologies including AI to serve as a bulwark against China, which was exploiting them to strengthen its authoritarianism.</p><p>He claimed the answer to rising populism in western democracies lay in weaving emerging technology into a \"narrative of optimism about the future\".</p><p>Regulating Big Tech In the early days, the Summit was a focus for tech entrepreneurs and industry geeks - but not for the hordes of politicians and others who now show up to participate.</p><p>This year, the presence of heavy hitters including Michel Barnier, Blair and Margrethe Vestager, the EC's newly empowered tech commissioner, have lent the event a new atmosphere.</p><p>\"Tech has become hyper-political,\" said Paddy Cosgrave, the Irish boss of Web Summit, who founded the event in Dublin a decade ago and shifted it to Portugal in 2016.</p><p>Perhaps that comes as no surprise given the myriad problems to have engulfed the sector over tax, data privacy, the use of social media platforms to spread misinformation and extremist material. Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, said it was vital to protect privacy, something he views as a \"fundamental human right\" and one of the coming decade's most defining issues.</p><p>Web Summit also offers a perfect opportunity for Vestager - the world's most powerful tech regulator - to offer up solutions to some of the industry's problems. Her newly beefed-up role, combining responsibilities for digital regulation and competition enforcement, reflects the EU's ambition to be the world's most assertive regulator of an industry, whose power, wealth and influence have swelled in recent years.</p><p>Vestager, who has made reining in the big US tech giants a core part of her mission, will literally have the last word. She is due to close the conference tonight right after Michael Kratsios, who is presenting the US perspective on taxing and regulating internet companies.</p><p>Europe's start-up scene Web Summit remains a powerful platform for Europe's technology start-ups to trumpet their achievements and shine a spotlight on the continent's innovation.</p><p>While Europe has struggled to build champions in the mould of Google, Facebook or Apple, from London to Stockholm, Berlin and Lisbon, its tech industry is booming.</p><p>More than 160 companies across the EU are now valued at more than $1bn including Swedish and German fintech companies Klarna, N26 and Britain's BenevolentAI.</p><p>Europe's tech workforce is growing at 4pc - compared with employment in the EU as a whole which is growing at about 1pc. Fundraising by European companies in 2019 is already poised to surpass the (EURO)28bn raised in 2018 - and the year isn't over yet.</p><p>Colonising space Colonising Mars may sound farfetched to most of us - but not here at Web Summit, where there has been a big focus on exploring and settling outer space.</p><p>With billions of dollars flooding in from tycoons such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, here in Lisbon, tech's elite believe it is only a matter of time before we see permanent settlements on the Moon and beyond - driven chiefly by commercial projects, not by national governments.</p><p>Africa rising Forty-one start-ups from 13 African countries are in Lisbon this week, reflecting the continent's vibrant technology scene.</p><p>Among the big names from Africa speaking at the summit are Swvl's Mostafa Kandil, Lidya's Tunde Kehinde and Vezeeta's Amir Barsoum.</p><p>The list of 13 countries is led by Egypt with 14 start-ups, Angola and Nigeria with five each and Rwanda, Kenya and Tunisia with three apiece.</p><p>'Tech's elite believe it is only a matter of time before we see permanent settlements on the Moon - driven by commercial projects'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-154539013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFH-NF51-DYTY-C1G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"814\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 7, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

Thanks to the upcoming launch of some critical new technologies, including 5G and foldable displays, as well as critical enhancements in on-device AI, personal robotics, and other exciting areas, thereeuro;trade;s a palpable sense of expectation for the new year that we haveneuro;trade;t felt for a while. Plus, 2018 ended up being a pretty tough year for several big tech companies, so there are also a lot of folks who want to shake the old year off and dive headfirst into an exciting future. With that spirit in mind, hereeuro;trade;s my take on some of what I expect to be the biggest trends and most important developments in 2019. Prediction 1: Foldable Phones Will Outsell 5G PhonesAt this point, everyone knows that 2019 will see the euro;oelig;officialeuro; debut of two very exciting technological developments in the mobile world: foldable displays and smartphones equipped with 5G modems. </p><p>Several vendors and carriers have already announced these devices, so now iteuro;trade;s just a question of when and how many.Not everyone realizes, however, that the two technologies woneuro;trade;t necessarily come hand-in-hand this year: we will see 5G-enabled phones and we will see smartphones with foldable displays. As of yet, iteuro;trade;s not clear that weeuro;trade;ll see devices that incorporate both capabilities in calendar year 2019. Eventually, of course, we will, but the challenges in bringing each of these cutting-edge technologies to the mass market suggest that some devices will include one or the other. (To be clear, however, the vast majority of smartphones sold in 2019 will have neither an integrated 5G modem nor a foldable displayeuro;rdquo;high prices for both technologies will limit their impact this year.) In the near-term, Ieuro;trade;m predicting that foldable display-based phones will be the winner over 5G-equipped phones, because the impact that these bendable screens will have on device usability and form factor are so compelling that I believe consumers will be willing to forgo the potential 5G speed boost. Plus, given concerns about pricing for 5G data plans, limited initial 5G coverage, and the confusing (and, frankly, misleading) claims being made by some US carriers about their euro;oelig;versionseuro; of 5G, I believe consumers will limit their adoption of 5G until more of these issues become clear. Foldable phones on the other handeuro;rdquo;while likely to be expensiveeuro;rdquo;will offer a very clear value benefit that I believe consumers will find even more compelling. Prediction 2: Game Streaming Services Go MainstreamIn a year when thereeuro;trade;s going to be a great deal of attention placed on new entrants to the video streaming market (Apple, Disney, Time Warner, etc.), the surprise breakout winner in cloud-based entertainment in 2019 could actually be game streaming services, such as Microsofteuro;trade;s Project xCloud (based on its Xbox gaming platform) and other possible entrants. The idea with game streaming is to enable people to play top-tier games across a wide range of both older and newer PCs, smartphones, and other devices. Given the tremendous growth in PC and mobile gaming, along with the rise in popularity of eSports, the consumer market is primed for a service (or two) that would allow gamers to play popular high-quality gaming titles across a wide range of different device types and platforms. Of course, game streaming isneuro;trade;t a new concept, and there have been several failed attempts in the past. The challenge is delivering a timely, engaging experience in the often-unpredictable world of cloud-driven connectivity. Iteuro;trade;s an extraordinarily difficult technical task that requires lag-free responsiveness and high-quality visuals packaged together in an easy-to-use service that consumers would be willing to pay for. Thankfully, a number of important technological advancements are coming together to make this now possible, including improvements in overall connectivity via WiFi (such as with WiFi6) and wide area cellular networks (and 5G should improve things even more). In addition, thereeuro;trade;s been widespread adoption and optimization of GPUs in cloud-based servers. Most importantly, however, are software advancements that can enable technologies like split or collaborative rendering (where some work is done on the cloud and some on the local device), as well as AI-based predictions of actions that need to be taken or content that needs to be preloaded. Collectively, these and other related technologies seem poised to enable a compelling set of gaming services that could drive impressive levels of revenue for the companies that can successfully deploy them. Iteuro;trade;s also important to add that although strong growth in game streaming services that are less hardware dependent may imply a negative impact on gaming-specific PCs, GPUs and other game-focused hardware (because people would be able to use older, less powerful devices to run modern games); in fact, the opposite is likely to be true. Game streaming services will likely expose an even wider audience to the most compelling games and that, in turn, will likely inspire more people to purchase gaming-optimized PCs, smartphones, and other devices. The gaming service will give them the opportunity to play (or continue playing) those games in situations or locations where they doneuro;trade;t have access to their primary gaming devices. Prediction 3: Multi-Cloud Becomes the Standard in Enterprise ComputingThe early days of cloud computing in the enterprise featured prediction after prediction of a winner between public cloud vs. private cloud and even of specific cloud platforms within those environments. As we enter 2019, iteuro;trade;s becoming abundantly clear that all those arguments were wrong headed and that, in fact, everyone won and everyone lost at the same time. After all, which of those early prognosticators would have ever guessed that in 2018, Amazon would offer a version of Amazon Web Services (called AWS Outpost) that a company could run on Amazon-branded hardware in the companyeuro;trade;s own data center/private cloud? It turns out that, as with many modern technology developments, thereeuro;trade;s no single cloud computing solution that works for everybody. Public, private, and hybrid combinations all have their place, and within each of those groups, different platform options all have a role. Yes, Amazon currently leads overall cloud computing, but depending on the type of workload or other requirements, Microsofteuro;trade;s Azure, Googleeuro;trade;s GCP (Google Cloud Platform), or IBM, Oracle, or SAP cloud offerings might all make sense. The real winner is the cloud computing model, regardless of where or by whom iteuro;trade;s being hosted. Not only has cloud computing changed expectations about performance, reliability, and security, the DevOps software development environment it inspired and the container-focused application architecture it enabled have radically reshaped how software is written, updated, and deployed. Thateuro;trade;s why you see companies shifting their focus away from the public infrastructure-based aspects of cloud computing and towards the flexible software environments it enables. This, in turn, is why companies have recognized that leveraging multiple cloud types and cloud vendors isneuro;trade;t a weakness or disjointed strategy, but actually a strength that can be leveraged for future endeavors. With cloud platform vendors expected to work towards more interoperability (and transportability) of workloads across different platforms in 2019, iteuro;trade;s very clear that the multi-cloud world is here to stay. Prediction 4: On-Device AI Will Start to Shift the Conversation About Data PrivacyOne of the least understood aspects of using tech-based devices, mobile applications, and other cloud-based services is how much of our private, personal data is being shared in the processeuro;rdquo;often without our even knowing it. Over the past year, however, weeuro;trade;ve all started to become painfully aware of how big (and far-reaching) the problem of data privacy is. As a result, thereeuro;trade;s been an enormous spotlight placed on data handling practices employed by tech companies. At the same time, expectations about technologyeuro;trade;s ability to personalize these apps and services to meet our specific interests, location, and context have also continued to grow. People want and expect technology to be euro;oelig;smartereuro; about them, because it makes the process of using these devices and services faster, more efficient, and more compelling. The dilemma, of course, is that to enable this customization requires the use of and access to some level of personal data, usage patterns, etc. Up until now, that has typically meant that most any action you take or information you share has been uploaded to some type of cloud-based service, compiled and compared to data from other people, and then used to generate some kind of response thateuro;trade;s sent back down to you. In theory, this gives you the kind of customized and personalized experience you want, but at the cost of your data being shared with a whole host of different companies. Starting in 2019, more of the data analysis work could start being done directly on devices, without the need to share all of it externally, thanks to the AI-based software and hardware capabilities becoming available on our personal devices. Specifically, the idea of doing on-device AI inferencing (and even some basic on-device training) is now becoming a practical reality thanks to work by semiconductor-related companies like Qualcomm, Arm, Intel, Apple, and many others. What this means is thateuro;rdquo;if app and cloud service providers enable it (and thateuro;trade;s a big if)euro;rdquo;you could start getting the same level of customization and personalization youeuro;trade;ve become accustomed to, but without having to share your data with the cloud. Of course, it isneuro;trade;t likely that everyone on the web is going to start doing this all at once (if they do it at all), so inevitably some of your data will still be shared. However, if some of the biggest software and cloud service providers (think Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yelp, etc.) started to enable this, it could start to meaningfully address the legitimate data privacy concerns that have been raised over the last year or so. Apple, to its credit, started talking about this concept several years back (remember differential privacy?) and already stores things like facial recognition scans and other personally identifiable information only on individualseuro;trade; devices. Over the next year, I expect to see many more hardware and component makers take this to the next level by talking not just about their on-device data security features, but also about how onboard AI can enhance privacy. Leteuro;trade;s hope that more software and cloud-service providers enable it as well. Prediction 5: Tech Industry Regulation in the US Becomes RealRegardless of whether major social media firms and tech companies enable these onboard AI capabilities or not, iteuro;trade;s clear to me that weeuro;trade;ve reached a point in the US social consciousness that tech companies managing all this personal data need to be regulated. While Ieuro;trade;ll be the first to admit that the slow-moving government regulatory process is ill-matched to the rapidly evolving tech industry, thateuro;trade;s still not an excuse for not doing anything. As a result, in 2019, I believe the first government regulations of the tech industry will be put into place, specifically around data privacy and disclosure rules. Iteuro;trade;s clear from the backlash that companies like Facebook have been receiving that many consumers are very concerned with how much data has been collected not only about their online activities, but their location, and many other very specific (and very private) aspects of their lives. Despite the companieseuro;trade; claims that we gave over most all of this information willingly (thanks to the confusingly worded and never read license agreements), common sense tells us that the vast majority of us did not understand or know how the data was being analyzed and used. Legislators from both parties recognize these concerns, and despite the highly polarized political climate, are likely going to easily agree to some kind of limitations on the type of data thateuro;trade;s collected, how iteuro;trade;s analyzed, and how iteuro;trade;s ultimately used. Whether the US builds on Europeeuro;trade;s GDPR regulations, the privacy laws instated in California last year, or something entirely different remains to be seen, but now that the value and potential impact of personal data has been made clear, thereeuro;trade;s no doubt we will see laws that control the valued commodity that it is. Prediction 6: Personal Robotics Will Become an Important New CategoryThe idea of a euro;oelig;sociableeuro; roboteuro;rdquo;one that people can have relatively natural interactions witheuro;rdquo;has been the lore of science fiction for decades. From Lost in Space to Star Wars to WallE and beyond, interactive robotic machines have been the stuff of our creative imagination for some time. In 2019, however, I believe we will start to see more practical implementations of personal robotics devices from a number of major tech vendors. Amazon, for example, is widely rumored to be working on some type of personal assistant-based robot leveraging their Alexa voice-based digital assistant technology. Exactly what form and what sort of capabilities the device might take are unclear, but some type of mobile (as in, able to move, not small and lightweight!) visual smart display that also offers mechanical capabilities (lifting, carrying, sweeping, etc.) might make sense. While a number of companies have tried and failed to bring personal robotics to the mainstream in the recent past, I believe a number of technologies and concepts are coming together to make the potential more viable this year. First, from a purely mechanical perspective, the scarily realistic capabilities now exhibited by companies like Boston Dynamics show how far the movement, motion, and environmental awareness capabilities have advanced in the robotics world. In addition, the increasingly conversational and empathetic AI capabilities now being brought to voice-based digital assistants, such as Alexa and Google Assistant, demonstrate how our exchanges with machines are becoming more natural. Finally, the appeal of products like Sonyeuro;trade;s updated Aibo robotic dog also highlight the willingness that people are starting to show towards interacting with machines in new ways. In addition, robotics-focused hardware and software development platforms, like Nvidiaeuro;trade;s latest Jetson AGX Xavier board and Isaac software development kit, key advances in computer vision, as well as the growing ecosystem around the open source ROS (Robot Operating System) all underscore the growing body of work being done to enable both commercial and consumer applications of robots in 2019. Prediction 7: Cloud-Based Services Will Make Operating Systems IrrelevantPeople have been incorrectly predicting the death of operating systems and unique platforms for years (including me back in December of 2015[1]), but this time iteuro;trade;s really (probably!) going to happen. All kidding aside, iteuro;trade;s becoming increasingly clear as we enter 2019 that cloud-based services are rendering the value of proprietary platforms much less relevant for our day-to-day use. Sure, the initial interface of a device and the means for getting access to applications and data are dependent on the unique vagaries of each tech vendoreuro;trade;s platform, but the real work (or real play) of what we do on our devices is becoming increasingly separated from the artificial world of operating system user interfaces. In both the commercial and consumer realms, iteuro;trade;s now much easier to get access to what it is we want to do, regardless of the underlying platform. On the commercial side, the increasing power of desktop and application virtualization tools from the likes of Citrix and VMWare, as well as moves like Microsofteuro;trade;s delivering Windows desktops from the cloud all demonstrate how much simpler it is to run critical business applications on virtually any device. Plus, the growth of private (on-premise), hybrid, and public cloud environments is driving the creation of platform-independent applications that rely on nothing more than a browser to function. Toss in Microsofteuro;trade;s decision to leverage the open-source Chromium browser rendering engine for its next version of its Edge browser, and iteuro;trade;s clear weeuro;trade;re rapidly moving to a world in which the cloud finally and truly is the platform. On the consumer side, the rapid growth of platform-independent streaming services is also promoting the disappearance (or at least sublimation) of proprietary operating systems. From Netflix to Spotify to even the game streaming services mentioned in Prediction 2, successful cloud-based services are building most all of their capabilities and intelligence into the cloud and relying less and less on OS-specific apps. In fact, it will be very interesting to see how open and platform agnostic Apple makes its new video streaming service. If they make it too focused on Apple OS-based device users only, they risk having a very small impact (even with their large and well-heeled installed base), particularly given the strength of the competition. Crossover work and consumer products like Office 365 are also shedding any meaningful ties to specific operating systems and instead are focused on delivering a consistent experience across different operating systems, screen sizes, and device types. The concept of abstraction goes well beyond the OS level. New software being developed to leverage the wide range of different AI-specific accelerators from vendors like Qualcomm, Intel, and Arm (AI cores in their case) is being written at a high-enough level to allow them to work across a very heterogeneous computing environment. While this might have a modest impact on full performance potential, the flexibility and broad support that this approach enables is well worth it. In fact, iteuro;trade;s generally true that the more heterogeneous the computing environment grows, the less important operating systems and proprietary platforms become. In 2019, iteuro;trade;s going to be a very heterogenous computing world, hence my belief that the time for this prediction has finally come.

Still, he says he has to do plenty of technology regulating in his personal life as well with his children.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I try to limit their exposure to their cell phone and iPads and all of that. As much as possible,\" Delrahim said in an interview with the Washington Examiner at his office within the Robert Kennedy Department of Justice Building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington.</p><p>\"God, I wish I could monitor them a lot more. Maybe some of those [tech] companies [already] do that,\" he joked.</p><p>Delrahim, 50, has three young children, all of whom are 10 years old or younger. </p><p>He said that one of his sons loves to use TikTok, the popular social media video app and that his children spend a good bit of time watching music videos on YouTube as well. </p><p>The antitrust lawyer said the redemptive part of technology for children is that it \"allows them to create things\" and express themselves creatively. </p><p>While in private practice, he was an attorney for several major technology companies, including Google, Apple, and Qualcomm. He has also been a media and television entrepreneur in between his government stints.</p><p>Parenting in the digital age has created a new and unique set of challenges, and Delrahim has experienced them in his own family. </p><p>\"I just want to know where they go [online] because when you're not watching them, just like you would in the physical world, you want to know, who are they talking to? Are they talking to a stranger?\" said Delrahim. </p><p>\"Are they going across the street in the physical world, you worry about what they do. And in the online world, you also worry about that,\" Delrahim said.</p><p>It has been reported that a majority of parents with teenagers spy on their children's online activity, with almost half looking through their child's phone call records or text messages.</p><p>And youth are spending much of their days looking at screens. The National Institutes of Health reported in November that nearly 90% of youth aged 18 months to 5 years old were exposed to screens for much longer than pediatricians recommend. Pediatric researchers have found that by the age of 12 months, the average child was spending about 53 minutes looking at TV, computer, or mobile phone screens, and by age 3, youths experienced about two-and-a-half hours of screen time a day.</p><p>Rising use of the internet by children hasn't escaped those in the tech industry. Many well-known tech moguls, such as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, have been known to raise their children with many technology restrictions. </p><p>Gates and his wife Melinda did not allow their children to have cellphones until the age of 14. Jobs ensured that there were no iPads or iPhones in sight during dinnertime in his household so that the family could focus on face-to-face conversations. Investor and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has gone so far as to have placed special routers in his home that allow him to monitor his children's internet use and shut down all activities if they go over their set screen-time limits. The CEOs of Google and Snapchat also reportedly have strict limits on their children's screen time.</p><p>As for his own free time, Delrahim's interests lie in activities that help sharpen his thinking and his fitness. </p><p>\"I love to play poker. I think poker is a great metaphor for life. You have to constantly be aware of the odds and the effect of every action,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's very much like chess,\" he said. \"That is, everything I do will affect what you do, and everything you do will affect what I do.\"</p><p>As for exercise, he's engaged in yoga in recent years. \"I'm a huge fan of the effects that yoga can have,\" Delrahim said. </p><p>\"And I love my Peloton,\" he said, referring to the stationary indoor bicycle machine.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2319464148</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM9-93S1-JBHT-D238-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

Gaurav Gupta and Ananth Narayanan joined Zomato and Medlife, respectively, years after the companies were launched, but they are still called co-founders. The strategy underscores the importance of executives and operators in the startup ecosystem. The trend is not entirely new. </p><p>In 2006, Makemytrip's Deep Kalra accorded the status to Rajesh Magow, the India CEO. But today, this approach has gained more significance. The Indian internet market is getting more competitive and firms need operators who are also recognised as co-founders by employees.2) India sees 'Techlash'Big tech companies such as Facebook and Google faced greater scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers and employees in the US in 2019. India, too, witnessed a version of the pushback against large digital companies. This included changes in online retail laws, protests against food delivery players and the data privacy bill. Data localisation has become a major sticking point between the industry and the Indian government. A key fight on this front has been the entry of Facebook-owned WhatsApp into the payments business. The payments service has been stuck in beta since early 2018 because of a variety of reasons, including access to encryption and concerns over fake news on Facebook's platform.3) Valuation hype: First death of an Indian unicornA billion-dollar valuation does not necessarily mean success. Shopclues, which was valued at $1.1 billion in 2016, was sold at a valuation of less than $100 million to Singapore-based e-tailer Qoo10 in November. Shopclues had raised over $257 million in funding from the likes of Singapore's GIC, Tiger Global, Helion Venture Partners and Nexus Venture Partners. But it struggled with several issues, including a fight among its founders and competition from Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon and Paytm Mall. Several startups in the Indian market - Jabong and Freecharge, for instance - have been sold for far less than their original or perceived valuations. But Shopclues was the first that claimed to be a unicorn.4) Oyo's busy, busy yearFor SoftBank-backed Oyo Hotels &amp; Homes, 2019 was a year of ups and downs as it hyper-charged its aggressive expansion across the world. The most audacious move was the over $2-billion loan that founder Ritesh Agarwal, 26, took to triple his shareholding to 30% and infuse fresh capital into the business. The secondary transaction has been done at a valuation of $10 billion, double of Oyo's valuation last year. The company has expanded to Europe with $415 million buyout of @Leisure Group and is opening 200 properties in the US. It has bought Hooters Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas.The second half of the year was tough for Oyo. It is facing a revolt by hotel owners in India and China.Recently, Oyo said it had laid off up to 500 employees.5) Say kirana for fundingThere are roughly 12 million kiranas in India. More and more startups are building business models to cater to this section. The services they offer include digitising ledgers and improving the supply chain. Kirana-focused startups raised over $260 million in funding in 2019, according to data compiled by Avendus Capital for TOI as against $70 million in 2018. Digital bookkeeping players OkCredit and Khatabook and logistics tech firm Elasticrun are among them. Udaan, which operates in a broader space, saw some of the largest funding rounds.6) Mobility, e-tail 2.02019 was the breakout year for a new generation of startups in urban mobility and online retail space, as they attracted big funding and witnessed high growth. These firms are seeing faster growth than traditional players, though on a smaller base. It remains to be seen if they become a threat. In mobility, Sequoia- and Accel-backed Bounce is taking on Matrix- and Ola-backed Vogo in the scooter rental space. Bounce CEO Vivekananda HR tweeted in October that the platform had crossed 1 lakh rides a day in Bengaluru, about 13 months after launching a dockless option. Bike taxi player Rapido now records 5 million rides a month, up from 2.2 million rides a month in May this year.New players have also emerged in the area of social commerce. Bulbul, Simsim, Dealshare and Wmall are leveraging video and social media to sell goods, raising their first major rounds of funding. Social commerce platform Meesho, which uses a network of resellers, raised $125 million from Facebook and Naspers this year.7) Serial entrepreneurs attract big bucksIn 2019, serial entrepreneurs and executives, who had previously worked with high-growth startups, were able to raise capital with some ease, at times without a business plan. They include CitrusPay co-founder Jitendra Gupta, who is starting digital banking firm Jupiter; Amit Lakhotia, a former Paytm and Tokopedia executive, who is building a venture for car parking management; and Nipun Mehra, a former Pine Labs and Flipkart executive, who is launching a B2B commerce venture for Southeast Asia. What has also helped VCs build conviction about signing large cheques at the idea stage is the amount of follow-on capital startups like Cred, started by Freecharge co-founder Kunal Shah; Curefit, built by Myntra's Mukesh Bansal; and Udaan, a venture by former Flipkart executives, have attracted. These founders launched companies which have unique localised business models.8) Payment, food delivery cos bleedA battle for market supremacy in online retail and cab hailing marked the Indian startup scene's years from 2014 to 2017. But in the past two years, the fight in digital payments and online food delivery spaces has grabbed the spotlight. It's an expensive battle, according to the latest set of numbers. SoftBank-backed Paytm, Walmart-owned Phonepe and Amazon Pay suffered a collective loss of over Rs 7,283 crore ($1 billion) in the financial year that ended in March 2019. A staggering increase of 167% from Rs 2,729 crore ($386 million) in the fiscal ending March 2018. If one includes Rs 1,028 crore Google Pay spent on cashback during FY19, the loss figure for the industry stands at Rs 8,311 crore.The total reported losses also shot up in online food delivery: Swiggy saw them increase nearly six-fold to Rs 2,364 crore (FY19), while Zomato saw them jump by 24 times to Rs 2,058 crore from Rs 84 crore in FY18. Ola-owned Foodpanda reported 230% increase in losses at Rs 756 crore, while UberEats' India business is dragging down its global margins.

It was a memorable moment amid a broader reckoning that continues to inspire debate over how closely Facebook and other technology giants should be regulated. As Silicon Valley grapples with its version of becoming too big to fail, Zuckerberg and his industry peers might take lessons from Wall Street, whose leaders have some experience with government scrutiny. (On Wednesday, bank chief executives were being grilled by Congress.) Although it won't address all of Big Tech's problems, a simple rule that bolsters the banking system could do a lot to clean up some of the uglier aspects of social media that Zuckerberg felt compelled to apologize for. The concept is 'know your customer' \u2014 or KYC, as it's called on Wall Street \u2014 and it's straightforward: Given concerns about privacy, security and fraud when it comes to money, no bank is allowed to take on a new customer without verifying its existence and vetting its background. The idea of applying such a rule to social media has been floated before, but it has so far failed to take hold. Now may be the right time. AdvertisingConsider this: Facebook has said it shut down more than 1.5 billion fake accounts from April through September last year (yes, that's a 'B' in billion). That was up from the 1.3 billion such accounts it eliminated in the six previous months. To put those numbers in context, Facebook has a reported user base of 2.3 billion. What if social media companies had to verify their users the same way banks do? You'd probably feel more confident that you were interacting with real people and were not just a target for malicious bots. First, let's acknowledge the practical considerations. Vetting the vast universe of those on social media would be a gargantuan task. When I broached the idea of applying a 'know your customer' principle to their business, several senior executives at social media companies recoiled at the prospect, questioning how they would pull off such a huge feat, especially in emerging markets where many people lack credit cards, and even fixed street addresses can be hard to come by. Then there are the legitimate complaints about Facebook and its ilk already knowing too much about users. Who would want them to know even more? And what would the companies do to protect personal information better than they have in the past? After all, not long ago, Facebook disclosed that tens of millions of user passwords had not been stored securely. But the stakes may be too high not to consider some kind of heightened verification process. AdvertisingFacebook and Twitter, at least, clearly appreciate the importance of verification as a concept: Both offer blue-check-mark programs to confirm the authenticity of a small percentage of users, like celebrities. If the vetting of legitimate users were expanded, and the number of phony ones were reduced, the amount of hate speech and fake news polluting the social media platforms would almost certainly dwindle. And it would be hard for the companies to willfully ignore what remained. How would it work? A modified version of what goes on in the financial services industry is one possibility.When you open a bank account, you typically have to provide your name, address, Social Security number and date of birth. That information is cross-checked against databases to ensure that you're a real person, that your credit score is solid and that your name doesn't appear on a list of 'politically exposed persons' that could put you at risk for bribery or corruption. The verification is also used to determine whether you have a criminal record that suggests possible money laundering or identity theft. That kind of vetting helps protect banks from doing business with criminals and helps protect clients who could be vulnerable to fraud.There is a precedent for adapting such a regimen for social media: NextDoor, a social network that helps people communicate in their local communities, won't let new users sign up unless their addresses can be verified. A would-be NextDoor user must submit a credit card or phone number, which the site cross-references against databases. If you don't have either, the site sends a postcard to your address with a code you can use online. The good news is that NextDoor knows its customers very well. The bad news is that its verification process would be extremely difficult to expand widely and quickly.Most Read Business StoriesThe company doesn't disclose user numbers, only that it is in more than 200,000 neighborhoods. Reports suggest it has tens of millions of users, a far cry from the billions using more popular social networks. If introducing such a system at that scale is too daunting, testing it in the United States and Canada first might be one way to start. The need for a 'know your customer' rule could take on a new urgency as social networks evolve to become fully encrypted private-messaging services, as Zuckerberg has indicated he plans to do with Facebook. 'I believe the future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won't stick around forever,' he said. AdvertisingIt's a laudable goal, but if the users are fake, or otherwise unaccountable, from the outset, the ease with which they could spread misinformation on encrypted networks would have even more troubling implications. That is, unless, there was a viable mechanism for vouching for individual identities \u2014 for networks to know their customers, as it were. It just seems like common sense.

The study identifies three main goals that Senator Warner\u2014 who's also a member of theSenate Intelligence Committee \u2014 and his staff believe should be top priorities for U.S. lawmakers in the tech field moving forward: enacting adequate user privacy protections, deciding on measures meant to combat fake news and any other kind of online misinformation, and promoting competition in the stateside technology industry. </p><p>The paper goes over the majority of theoretical options American legislators have at their disposal in regards to regulating big tech in the country, save for two most radical ones: establishing a new agency in charge of policing the segment or breaking up juggernauts such as Google and Facebook[1], something the European Union is already considering[2], at least in regards to the latter firm. One of the more out-there ideas thatwasproposed by the paper is putting a price on every individual's data and demanding the Silicon Valley pays for that information in order to use it for commercial purposes. Stricter account authentication requirements are also on the cards, as are media literacy programs and a privacy ruleset akin to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation which went into effect in late May. The paper is an extension of Senator Warner's existing policy stances that have been highly critical of digital platforms in the past, though the chances of any of them being enacted without a Democratic majority in both Congress houses remain slim. Due to that state of affairs, no major changes on the digital regulation front in the U.S. are expected until the November 6 mid-terms possibly change the composition of the top legislative body in the country. In the meantime, the Trump administration is presently said to be working on a new digital privacy policy[3] that it hopes will eventually be codified by Congress, though that initiative is still in an early phase of development.
