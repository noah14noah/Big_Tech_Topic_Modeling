Big tech companies have been pushing into other arenas such as finance and health care to gain more access to consumer data. The push comes at a time when regulators are looking into privacy practices by firms including Google and Facebook so the deals are likely to be scrutinized. The project is expected to launch next year, a Google executive told The Journal. The financial institutions' brands, not Google's, will front the accounts. Google declined to comment.

The report, 'Who Moderates the Social Media Giants? A Call to End Outsourcing,' presents new findings about how big tech firms regulate the content that appears on their platforms; identifies major problems with the platforms' current approach; and makes concrete recommendations for reforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook, YouTube and Twitter outsource most of their human content moderation-the job of deciding what stays online and what gets taken down-to third-party contractors, which creates a marginalized class of reviewers who are seen as 'second-class citizens.' The NYU report finds that the peripheral status of moderators has contributed to inadequate attention being paid to incendiary content spread in developing countries, sometimes leading to violence offline. Outsourcing has also contributed to the provision of subpar mental health support for content moderators who spend their days staring at disturbing material.</p><p>Paul Barrett, deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights told Capital that the report finds social media companies lack local expertise in countries like Ethiopia. 'They should hire more Ethiopians with broad language skills and a solid grasp of the country's culture' Barrett said.</p><p>'Online speech foments ethnic and religious violence and hostilities, one thing social media companies can do is to remove content that is false and may lead to physical harm,' he further added.</p><p>Focusing primarily on Facebook, the report found that every day, three million Facebook posts are flagged for review by 15,000 moderators. The company has admitted to at least a 10 percent error rate in making content decisions, which suggests 300,000 mistakes a day. At Facebook, outsourced content moderation takes place in more than 20 sites worldwide.</p><p>'The report finds that Facebook and others rely on unpaid local activists and NGOs to monitor online speech, but often ignore their warnings. There have been communication breakdowns and inattentiveness. Facebook says this is changing-that it is listening more closely to its partners on the ground. Perhaps the company has learned from past experience. But all of these problems have not been fully solved,' the deputy director told Capital via email.</p><p>'Social media companies cannot cure all societal ills, including the incitement of violence. These companies need to do more to ensure against the misuse of their platforms. But there is a big role for civil society organizations, journalism outfits, and, in some cases, the government, in fostering civility and diminishing the influence of bad actors. Political leaders must come together and get behind education efforts aimed at enlightening social media users and all citizens,' Barrett said.</p><p>The report also calls on big tech to invest more in countries like Ethiopia to prevent violence from spreading virally.</p><p>'More attentive content moderation and fact-checking, more social media literacy training, and more support for public-spirited journalism and civil society activity should be done,' Barrett said.</p><p>In recent months, the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated problems with content moderation. As content moderators have sheltered in place at home, without access to secure computers, social media companies, including Facebook, announced that they would rely more on AI to remove harmful content. The result has been that the platforms have mistakenly taken down some legitimate content from healthcare professionals and others, whose posts were mistakenly flagged for removal.</p><p>'The widespread practice of relying on third-party vendors for content review amounts to an outsourcing of responsibility for the safety of major social media platforms and their billions of users,' said Paul Barrett adding 'the results of this practice range from moderators not receiving the caliber of mental health care they deserve, to real-world violence in some countries where insufficient moderation leads to hateful content remaining online.'</p><p>This report involved dozens of interviews with executives from Facebook and other tech firms, as well as with former content moderators operating in the U.S. and Europe; scholars and researchers studying the issue; and on-the-ground activists and NGOs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPETH-CAPETH30062020000524</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPETH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:608J-SB91-JCH9-G2CH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433697</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Crown Publishing All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Capital Ethiopia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 30, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But all of these problems have not been fully solved,\" the deputy director told Capital via email.<br/>\"Social media companies cannot cure all societal ills, including the incitement of violence. These companies need to do more to ensure against the misuse of their platforms. But there is a big role for civil society organizations, journalism outfits, and, in some cases, the government, in fostering civility and diminishing the influence of bad actors. Political leaders must come together and get behind education efforts aimed at enlightening social media users and all citizens,\" Barrett said.<br/>The report also calls on big tech to invest more in countries like Ethiopia to prevent violence from spreading virally.<br/>\"More attentive content moderation and fact-checking, more social media literacy training, and more support for public-spirited journalism and civil society activity should be done,\" Barrett said.<br/>In recent months, the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated problems with content moderation. As content moderators have sheltered in place at home, without access to secure computers, social media companies, including Facebook, announced that they would rely more on AI to remove harmful content. The result has been that the platforms have mistakenly taken down some legitimate content from healthcare professionals and others, whose posts were mistakenly flagged for removal.<br/>\"The widespread practice of relying on third-party vendors for content review amounts to an outsourcing of responsibility for the safety of major social media platforms and their billions of users,\" said Paul Barrett adding \"the results of this practice range from moderators not receiving the caliber of mental health care they deserve, to real-world violence in some countries where insufficient moderation leads to hateful content remaining online.\"<br/>This report involved dozens of interviews with executives from Facebook and other tech firms, as well as with former content moderators operating in the U.S. and Europe; scholars and researchers studying the issue; and on-the-ground activists and NGOs.</p><p>Crown Publishing P.L.C.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/362/1223/47/159275685079.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/362/1223/47/159275685079.jpeg</url></p><p>website<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/362/1223/2/159275685082.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/362/1223/2/159275685082.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/362/1223/91/159275685083.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/362/1223/91/159275685083.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/362/1223/39/159275685085.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/362/1223/39/159275685085.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPEN-177664748</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6061-GF01-JDJN-64WS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404352</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"777\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Crown Publishing P.L.C Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

However, it could be brought to life in a \"joint initiative\" between the Japan government and private companies.<br/>The group devising the proposal is said to be handing over its plan next month.<br/>Japan isn't expected to release its own digital currency anytime soon. There are substantial regulatory hurdles that it will have to overcome.<br/>Indeed, if Facebook's Libra is anything to go by, we can expect a centralized digital currency to have to undergo considerable scrutiny before it takes off.<br/>Of course, if it's government backed that will help allay some concerns Libra has faced. Libra is run by a select group of big tech companies which aren't always known for being trusted.<br/>We're going to have to wait a lot longer to see how this one plays out, but it's clear that central bank digital currencies are on their way, whether we need them or not.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-565305</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2V-4VN1-DYDW-7389-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"265\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 27, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Amazon's portfolio has grown from books and music at its inception to encompass fresh groceries, electronics, neighborhood surveillance, professional services, healthcare, government procurement, internet infrastructure and entertainment 6 nearly every aspect of life.</p><p>Amazon sales are expected to hit $238 billion this year, and the company employs 750,000 people, 194,054 of them in tech hubs from Seattle to Atlanta, the report said.</p><p>The report notes Amazon \"procures products and services from nearly every industry in the four-county region,\" with the strongest ties to the real estate, information, shipping, waste management and entertainment sectors, and has received tens of millions in subsidies. Communities in which its warehouses are located, however, have received no sales tax benefits despite the pressures on infrastructure and the environment; rather, the revenue goes to cities in which the merchandise was ordered.</p><p>The report urges Amazon to raise its minimum wage to $20 an hour and to adjust it annually to make sure drivers, warehouse and logistics workers are earning a living wage. The mean annual wage for Amazon warehouse workers was $20,585 in 2017, roughly half of the living wage for the region, with 14% of warehouse workers living below the U.S. poverty threshold and 31% just above it, the report said. The U.S. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines\">https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines</url>) poverty line in 2019 was $12,490 for an individual and $25,750 for a family of four.

Additionally, it calls on Amazon to invest in affordable housing in communities where its facilities are located.</p><p>Amazon estimates it added more than $4 billion to the Southern California economy in 2018, the report said, disputing the benefits since \"Amazon's thousands of blue-collar workers lack sustainable incomes and require public subsidies to survive.\" It notes Amazon paid less than 3% of its $27 billion in profits in federal income taxes.</p><p>The report adds: \"It's time for Amazon to come of age and pay its own way. This means paying its full costs to the communities that host it and the workers who create its profits. Amazon will benefit when its workers have living incomes because they will have the buying power to purchase the products it sells.\"</p><p>The report notes the bulk of Amazon sales come from wealthier communities while its warehouses and warehouse and delivery workers are in or from more marginal areas.</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-606847072</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 606847072</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM2-5T71-DYTM-9542-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"628\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newsweek Media Group</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times - US ed.</publicationName><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 27, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>California</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>News, opinion and commentary</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>High technology industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Reports</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Amazon's portfolio has grown from books and music at its inception to encompass fresh groceries, electronics, neighborhood surveillance, professional services, healthcare, government procurement, internet infrastructure and entertainment 6 nearly every aspect of life.</p><p>Amazon sales are expected to hit $238 billion this year, and the company employs 750,000 people, 194,054 of them in tech hubs from Seattle to Atlanta, the report said.</p><p>The report notes Amazon \"procures products and services from nearly every industry in the four-county region,\" with the strongest ties to the real estate, information, shipping, waste management and entertainment sectors, and has received tens of millions in subsidies. Communities in which its warehouses are located, however, have received no sales tax benefits despite the pressures on infrastructure and the environment; rather, the revenue goes to cities in which the merchandise was ordered.</p><p>The report urges Amazon to raise its minimum wage to $20 an hour and to adjust it annually to make sure drivers, warehouse and logistics workers are earning a living wage. The mean annual wage for Amazon warehouse workers was $20,585 in 2017, roughly half of the living wage for the region, with 14% of warehouse workers living below the U.S. poverty threshold and 31% just above it, the report said. The U.S. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines\">https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines</url>) poverty line in 2019 was $12,490 for an individual and $25,750 for a family of four.

Additionally, it calls on Amazon to invest in affordable housing in communities where its facilities are located.</p><p>Amazon estimates it added more than $4 billion to the Southern California economy in 2018, the report said, disputing the benefits since \"Amazon's thousands of blue-collar workers lack sustainable incomes and require public subsidies to survive.\" It notes Amazon paid less than 3% of its $27 billion in profits in federal income taxes.</p><p>The report adds: \"It's time for Amazon to come of age and pay its own way. This means paying its full costs to the communities that host it and the workers who create its profits. Amazon will benefit when its workers have living incomes because they will have the buying power to purchase the products it sells.\"</p><p>The report notes the bulk of Amazon sales come from wealthier communities while its warehouses and warehouse and delivery workers are in or from more marginal areas.</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-606816569</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 606816569</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM2-5T71-DYTM-94XR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"628\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newsweek Media Group</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times - US ed.</publicationName><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 26, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>California</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>News, opinion and commentary</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>High technology industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Reports</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Dan Bongino joins us in a moment to go through it. Later, we'll also talk to the most prominent democratic socialist in America, Cornell West, about how his movement, which is growing fast, seeks to change this country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, first tonight, according to investigative journalist John Solomon, writing at \"The Hill\" newspaper, new memos conclusively show a systematic effort by FBI officials to cripple the Trump campaign and later the Trump administration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These memos, which were unearthed during recent oversight investigations, reveal politically inflamed FBI employees, activists basically, working to accelerate an investigation into Donald Trump before election day, apparently hoping to influence the outcome of the election.</p><p>At heart of this effort - you guessed it! - disgraced official Peter Strzok, who led the Russia investigation from the beginning, and later promised his girlfriend, Lisa Page, that they would be able to \"stop Trump.\" They did their best.</p><p>In September 2016, for example, Trump advisor Carter Page wrote a letter to the director of the FBI Jim Comey complaining about what he said were false leaks about him.</p><p>Strzok's reaction to Page's letter? \"At a minimum,\" he texted his girlfriend, \"this letter provides us a pretext to interview Carter Page.\" A pretext. In other words, an excuse.</p><p>In another memo, four weeks before election day, Strzok tells Page he is placing \"the hurry the F up\" pressure on Andy McCabe to get a FISA warrant to spy on Carter Page.</p><p>Even after the election, they didn't stop. In one email, Strzok discusses the need to share any potential \"derogatory information\" the FBI might have gleaned from confidential informants.</p><p>Keep in mind, these are the same people - Strzok and Page - who wound up as members of the Mueller investigation. There is no defending any of this. And yet, the left is.</p><p>Carter Page is on the receiving end of all this for years now and he joins us tonight. Carter Page, thank you for joining us.</p><p>CARTER PAGE, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER: Thanks for having me, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Let's go back on the timeline to the letter that you sent to Jim Comey, then director of the FBI, about the leaks against you. What were those leaks?</p><p>PAGE: Well, I sent that on Sunday, September 25th, 2016. Two days before that, on the Friday, the September 23rd, there was a big defamatory article put out by \"Yahoo! News\".</p><p>As we subsequently learned from the House Intelligence memos, that was part of this fake news article that was actually used as part of the FISA application. So, completely outrageous.</p><p>CARLSON: Carter, I am having a little trouble with my audio. I am pretty certain that our audience can hear you just fine.</p><p>So, just clarify for us, the basics here. You have not, after all of this, and you've been under surveillance, in effect under investigation for years now, you haven't been charged with anything. Do you expect that you are going to be charged with anything after all of this?</p><p>CARLSON: Tucker, I couldn't even imagine anything that I could potentially be charged with. Particularly after seeing John Solomon's article today, it just becomes - the whole - using the term from that quote that you had, pretext, the pretext was absolutely outrageous, ridiculous.</p><p>And so, this is pretext wrapped upon pretext. It's completely out of control. So, I can't even imagine what I would be charged with.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you know, after again all of this, what exactly the suspected crime was? You were the subject of a FISA warrant. The federal government turning its awesome surveillance powers on you. That's a big deal.</p><p>We just have a whole court system designed to keep that from being abused. Why would the federal government want to read your emails and spy on you in ways we may not even know about? What did they think you were doing exactly?</p><p>PAGE: Well, I think, as we learned with the first inspector general report from a couple of weeks ago - I call it IG report 1.0 - there is a lot of political motivations behind what was happening earlier in the presidential election campaigns.</p><p>I think what is - a lot of evidence that has come out both from House Intelligence Committee, Senate Judiciary Committee, HouseJudiciary as well as others, there is a lot of abuse that's going on.</p><p>So, I think it's completely political. There is nothing substantive to this whatsoever.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, presumably, if there something substantive, you'd be charged with a felony, right? So, this is not the behavior of a free country, of an open, legitimate government spying on its own citizens for political reasons. What has this cost you financially?</p><p>PAGE: Tucker, it's like President Trump said during the campaign. It's not about me. It's about us. It cost me tremendously. It's cost many people in the Trump movement, the people I was volunteering with, tremendously in terms of all the legal fees and challenges it's created in many cases to their lives. In some cases, a lot of terrorist threats.</p><p>The bigger issue is the obstruction in terms of US foreign policy. The terrible impact that this has had on possibilities in terms of US-Russia relations, creating a better pathway for the world that President Trump was talking about during the campaign.</p><p>And so, I'm hoping there's going to be a lot more of this. This is just the tip of the iceberg, I think, what we've seen here. A lot more coming out over the weeks to come.</p><p>But a bigger thing is coming in with the Helsinki summit. And I'm hoping that the quicker that the truth comes out, the more they'll be able to chart a better course for the future of our country.</p><p>CARLSON: We will be at the Helsinki summit and I look forward to that. Carter Page, thanks very much.</p><p>PAGE: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Chris Hahn is a radio show host, he's a former staffer to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and he joins us tonight.</p><p>There you have it, Chris. I wanted to talk to Carter Page not because we are personal friends or I have any vested interest in his story or his life, but because I am an American and I think the civil liberties of every American matter.</p><p>Here you have a guy who clearly didn't commit a crime, whose life has been completely destroyed by the FBI and the Obama administration. You can't look at that and not, as an American, feel outraged. And yet, the left is totally fine with what's happened to Carter Page. Why is that, do you think?</p><p>CHRIS HAHN, LIBERAL RADIO HOST: Well, I don't think anybody is fine with civil liberties being violated.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, really?</p><p>HAHN: I don't think they actually have. I mean, the man did take the Fifth for a lot of questions when he went to that closed door session with congress.</p><p>CARLSON: Hold on. Wait a second. So, if you take the Fifth, you don't have civil liberties. Taking the Fifth is a civil liberty. Like, what law school did you go to?</p><p>HAHN: Hold on a minute. I went to St. John's and I am proud of that. But let me just also say that the president of the United States once said, if they take the Fifth, it means they are guilty.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't care what Trump said. I'm an American citizen and you have a right not to testify under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights. And by the way, you have a right not to be spied upon for political reasons.</p><p>And my question is, why was Carter Page the subject of a FISA warrant after the FBI had already looked exhaustively into his interactions with the Russians? They clearly abused his civil liberties and nobody cares because he volunteered for Donald Trump. That is police state stuff. And civil libertarians of all stripes ought to be upset about it.</p><p>HAHN: No. Remember, the man started by providing documents to a Russian spy in 2014.</p><p>CARLSON: What were those documents?</p><p>HAHN: That's how they started to recruit -</p><p>CARLSON: Hold on. Slow down. You just accused him of - oh, you don't know what they are?</p><p>HAHN: It's widely known and he will admit that he gave documents to a Russian spy.</p><p>CARLSON: What documents? Was it a pizza menu or was it blueprints to a thermonuclear warhead?</p><p>HAHN: This is how they start to recruit you. They ask you to provide them with something which is legal and they show that you will actually do it. This was a Russian spy attempting to recruit him. That Russian spy was later indicted and convicted and this came up in that.</p><p>CARLSON: Did the Russian spy -</p><p>HAHN: (INAUDIBLE) on a presidential campaign. The FBI was right to start looking into it and they were absolutely right.</p><p>CARLSON: They were. So, they already knew that the documents that you attempted to make sound sinister amounted to nothing, that Carter Page was not, in fact, spying for the Russian government, that he was not a mole.</p><p>They knew that. And yet, they got a FISA warrant against him already. Don't you think that the US government, before it spies on its own citizens, ought to have a good reason and that that reason shouldn't be made up by a political activist like Peter Strzok and his girlfriend Lisa Page?</p><p>HAHN: So, the fact that he had been communication with senior Russian officials, including members of their spy rings in Russia, and then he goes to Russia with the permission of Corey Lewandowski, he goes to Russia in 2016 during the campaign, I think the FBI would be suspicious. And I think that they should have been suspicious.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. hold on. Since you've raised this allegation, we have actually Carter Page in the studio. I want to ask him what these documents were. I mean, let's get very specific here.</p><p>You pass documents to a Russian spy. Did you betray your country? What were the documents? And why aren't you in prison right now if that was a felony?</p><p>PAGE: Tucker, this is complete spin. I was teaching a course at New York University called Energy in the World in the spring semester of 2013. And I had a coffee with a diplomat from the Russian consulate.</p><p>HAHN: Who was a spy.</p><p>PAGE: I showed him a couple of course materials from my -</p><p>HAHN: You gave him documents.</p><p>CARLSON: Slow down. Hold on. Chris, before you impugn - hold on - before you impugn his patriotism as an American, shouldn't you hear what the documents were? Wouldn't that inform your judgment?</p><p>PAGE: Public information.</p><p>CARLSON: The documents - that was a course description. Do you think if you passed, Chris Hahn, a course description for a public university course to a foreigner, who you didn't know was a spy, would you be betraying your country if you did that?</p><p>HAHN: I tend not to hang out with Russian spies because I am trying to get a gas deal with their nationally-owned gas syndicate.</p><p>CARLSON: So, do you think there's something unpatriotic - so you think there's -</p><p>HAHN: And people who love this country tend to love this country.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you are saying that Carter Page doesn't love this country. Carter Page, where did you go to college, by the way?</p><p>PAGE: US Naval Academy.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, you went to US Naval Academy. So, you are accusing him, Chris, of being unpatriotic. This man graduated from Annapolis and was a naval officer, but he's unpatriotic. He doesn't love his country? Is that what you're saying?</p><p>HAHN: I don't know what's in his heart. I have the files on you, Carter, and I hope that you are a good person. And I hope that if you are a good person, all of this goes away from you.</p><p>But from what I've read, it is something I would be concerned about if I was the FBI and you were on a presidential campaign. I would be worried that the Russians would be infiltrating that campaign?</p><p>CARLSON: Carter, do you love your country, Carter Page?</p><p>PAGE: I love my country. And, actually, all of my actions directly speak to that. And I think President Trump and his initiatives in terms of building a better structure for international relations, particularly US- Russia relations, I think, is going to show great love for the country.</p><p>CARLSON: I am embarrassed to live here. This is a shameful moment in our country's history that we would do this to one of our citizens. It's disgusting.</p><p>PAGE: A great code word in that document from John Solomon today. They use the term - there's a new code word \"Dragon,\" right? And that reminded me of dragon energy that Kanye West was talking about.</p><p>We're both dragon energy. President Trump is my brother. I love everyone. It's this very positive approach, trying to create a better world for all American citizens and a better peaceful situation in the world versus, I think, what we heard from Mr. Hahn of just tearing people down.</p><p>The funny part of that is, going back to the dossier, they were pulling these same falsehoods for -</p><p>CARLSON: I don't really know about the dragon stuff, but you don't seem like a spy to me. I'm being told we're out of time. Gentlemen, thank you both.</p><p>Dan Bongino has served his country as well. He's a former secret service agent, now an \"NRATV\" contributor and he joins us now.</p><p>Do you love your country, Dan? By the way, did you ever think - you're about the same age, did you ever think we'd get to a place where the McCarthy era sort of restarted again, but with a different cast where people were accusing one another of not loving their country because they gave a college syllabus to somebody who turns out to be working for a foreign intelligence service without even the knowledge of the person who gave the syllabus? Like, what is going on?</p><p>DAN BONGINO, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT: It's a disgrace, Tucker. This is a stain on our country, what's going on right now.</p><p>CARLSON: It is a stain. What happened to the civil libertarian left. I mean, Alan Dershowitz can't even go to a dinner party in Martha's Vineyard apparently without being threatened. A liberal, by the way, Aland Dershowitz, because he's asking the questions you and I have been asking for months - where is the crime? Where is the crime?</p><p>There's no probable cause a crime was committed. Carter Page is on your television show. If this guy is the greatest kingpin of a spy operation we've seen in modern American history, why is he out there free.</p><p>Well, maybe you've got the story wrong. Has that ever occurred to people in the media?</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not even sure Carter Page is saying some of the time, but he doesn't - he's clearly not betraying his country. He's an Annapolis graduate. And to accuse him of espionage and spy on him with no evidence whatsoever is really shameful behavior.</p><p>I don't know. Will there be a point - I don't want to ask you to prognosticate - where the left wakes up and says, we're abetting something that's really dark and wrong and we should not do this, we should return to our commitment to civil liberties?</p><p>BONGINO: No, because they're not investigating a crime and the left is not looking for a crime. What they're looking for is the scalp of Donald Trump, Tucker. They're not looking for a crime here. There is no crime.</p><p>Tucker, that Solomon piece today in \"The Hill\" is devastating. At one point, it says - get a load of this - they went after Carter Page, the FBI read the media reports they leaked. They then used the media reports Carter Page complained about as an excuse to go interview Carter Page. That's in the report today.</p><p>I mean, is this a Third World country? Are they kidding?</p><p>CARLSON: It sure seems like it. And it's not about Trump, it's not about Carter Page. It's about America and betraying its most basic values, which they are doing.</p><p>Dan Bongino, thank you.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, sir.</p><p>CARLSON: Democratic socialist, they are everywhere. The head of the Democratic Party says they are the future. So, what is democratic socialism exactly? We've got one of the most celebrated leaders of that movement, Cornell West, joining us right after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: You've heard the phrase a lot lately, democratic socialist. It's suddenly very common on the left. Bernie Sanders has called himself a democratic socialist. So, is New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>She's the woman the DNC chair Tom Perez recently said this about.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOM PEREZ, DNC CHAIR: She represents the future of our party. Alexandria's victory was just a remarkable reminder of the depth that we have in the Democratic Party.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So, democratic socialism is the future. But what is democratic socialism? We thought it would be worth pausing for a minute to find out.</p><p>Democratic socialism is not, by the way, a wing of the Democratic Party. At least not yet. It's an entirely separate movement with its own national organization, the Democratic Socialists of America.</p><p>Two years ago, the DSA endorsed Bernie Sanders and opposed Donald Trump, but did not endorse Hillary Clinton. So, at times, it has been antagonistic to the Democratic party.</p><p>What did democratic socialists believe? There's no formal platform, but the outlines are pretty clear. Democratic socialist support socialism, state ownership of major industries. That would include healthcare, technology, manufacturing, some of them explicitly support communism.</p><p>The co-chair of Portland, Oregon's chapter of the DSA recently tweeted this, \"As a DSA chapter co-chair, I just want to set the record straight for a minute - communism is good.\"</p><p>But democratic socialism is about more than economics. The DSA's official Twitter account demands reparations for African-Americans in the form of free and open enrollment at public colleges, retroactive forgiveness of student loans and a guaranteed lifetime minimum income. The DSA has also called for an end to all immigrant deportations everywhere in the United States.</p><p>In New York, the DSA has demanded the abolition of profits, prisons, cash bail and borders. Not all democratic socialists have the same views on everything, but that gives you some idea. Unlimited uncontrolled immigration into the US, coupled with race-based reparations, the abolition of prisons and, by extension, law and order and a massive expansion of a welfare state financed by an economic system that does not recognize profit.</p><p>How would that exactly? Has it ever worked in any country in the world? Those suddenly seem like relevant questions. And at this pace, democratic socialists could get the Democratic nomination at some point and be elected president.</p><p>So, we thought it was a perfect moment to speak to possibly the most famous of all advocates for democratic socialism, Cornell West. He is a professor at Harvard. He's an honorary co-chair of the Democratic Socialists of America and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Cornell, thank you for coming on.</p><p>CORNELL WEST, DSA HONORARY CHAIR: Thank you. And it's good to be in dialogue with you once again.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is. So, give us some sense of what democratic socialism is. Can you point to an example, and extant example of it, that works? Venezuela seems like a an example of democratic socialism? Would you say that it is? And if so, does it work?</p><p>WEST: No, I don't think that democratic socialism as an ideal has been able to be embodied in a larger social context.</p><p>There's different forms of it. Some are bad, some are medium, some are better. But the fundamental commitment is to the dignity of ordinary people and to make sure they can live lives of decency.</p><p>So, it's not an ism, no, brother. It's about decency. It's about fairness. It's about the accountability of the powerful vis-a-vis those who have less power at the workplace, women dealing with a household, gays, lesbians, trans, black people, indigenous peoples, immigrants.</p><p>How do we ensure that they are treated decently and that the powerful don't in any way manipulate, subjugate and exploit them.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean, if that's democratic socialism is, then I'm basically on board. I do think that ordinary people, middle-class people ought to have dignity.</p><p>WEST: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: And I think that our current systems make it hard for them to have dignity. So, I agree with all of that.</p><p>WEST: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: But the details matter.</p><p>WEST: That's precisely why - that's why Albert Einstein, Helen Keller, Norman Thomas, Eugene Debs, Martin Luther King Jr., Ella Baker, we can go on and on, they're all democratic socialists. Michael Harrington, one of the great founders of Democratic Socialism of America -</p><p>CARLSON: I understand. But has it struck as interesting that it's never actually worked anywhere. So, the question is not what are our goals. Our goals are the same. How do we get there is the question.</p><p>So, what happened in Venezuela? They called that democratic socialism, but they don't have toilet paper, and it's less equal than ever.</p><p>WEST: Part of the problem is, though, brother that anytime there's been attempts of ordinary people to engage in self-determination, they can get crushed by external nations. Look at US policies toward Venezuela, has been very, very ugly. Nicaragua in the same way.</p><p>We saw that in so many other instances where countries tried to engage in self-determination and they either get crushed, they either get coerced and they end up oftentimes responding to that kind of authoritarian treatment.</p><p>So, we never had a chance to really pull it off. So, it's only been a movement so far. It's an attempt to resist the greed at the top, the racism, the sexism, the homophobia, the various ways in which humanity is violated rather than affirmed.</p><p>CARLSON: So, here's a gist of the details quickly. The DSA of New York, which is certainly one of the biggest in the country, recently said -</p><p>WEST: Thank god for sister Alexandria. She's my sister comrade -</p><p>CARLSON: So, they said that they're against borders, profits and prisons. What would a country without prisons look like? What would you do with murderers, for example, or rapists? Where would you put them with no prisons?</p><p>WEST: Well, when they prisons, they're talking about the kinds of prisons we have at the present. If you have sites of rehabilitation, education, ways in which transformation can take place, you and I ourselves - you're Episcopalian, I'm Baptist, we're Christians, right? - we believe all human beings are made not just in the image of God, but they can be changed, they can be transformed when the right kind of intervention takes place.</p><p>That's what people mean in the socialist movement when they talk about the elimination of the kind of prisons that are in place.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what they really want is better prisons. Maybe they should be more - OK, so what about borders, though?</p><p>WEST: You're going to have isolation, you're going to have distance, but you don't give up on them. And most importantly, you don't view them in the vicious - through the lens of being less than human, that they can bounce back, they can be better.</p><p>CARLSON: So, if a government's obligation is to its own citizens and you dropped the borders and have no border enforcement at all, what would happen to this country, what would happen to the poor people in this country? Would their lives get better? Would they become more prosperous?</p><p>No, this country become poorer, dirtier, impossible to manage, it would be flooded with the poor of the world, and it would destroy our country instantly. So, why would you say no borders.</p><p>WEST: Well, I mean, again, no, you've got a variety of voices in the Democratic Socialists of America. We're like a jazz orchestra. You've got different perspectives and orientations. We all don't agree on one particular policy all the time.</p><p>This is true in terms of Israeli occupation of Palestinians, some are in the middle, some are much more critical like myself.</p><p>The question is, how do you keep track of the rich humanity of Mexican brothers and sisters, of those coming from Latin America, those coming from Africa, those coming from Haiti, and those coming from Europe and Asia. That's the important thing.</p><p>We know the history of America that indigenous peoples and Africans who've been enslaved was to open the borders, to bringing folk in, to allow people to getting answers. But it's not a matter of no borders at all. It's a matter of how do you ensure that their dignity is affirmed when they arrive so that you don't end up having the kind of neofascist policies of the Trump administration separating these precious children from their mothers and fathers.</p><p>CARLSON: That's silly as you well know. But how you think that the descendent of Americans - hold on, but how do you think the descendants of American slaves benefit when you bring in 25 million illegals - illegal immigrants from the Third World, does that elevate poor Americans?</p><p>I don't see any evidence that they get richer or happier when you bring in more poor people. You ignore their problems. That's why we pay any attention to their problems anymore.</p><p>WEST: But if we were having this discussion 100 years ago and you had millions of people coming from Jew-hating Europe, Irish-hating Britain and Ireland, all the folk who came into the making of slices of this nation, they did not allow for the kind of coming together with poor and working people would be able to straighten their backs up and speak with dignity and decency about issues that affect all of us, that's the history of the nation with the exception of the African slaves and the precious indigenous people.</p><p>So, the idea that somehow now that the immigrants are here, and a lot of the immigrants who've only been here one or two generations, now become the definitive authority defining what it is to be an American, how hypocritical can you get.</p><p>I've been here nine generations, coming out of enslaved people, and I can still embrace my Mexican brothers and sisters. I can embrace the whole host of others coming from around the world.</p><p>But it's not just a matter of no borders. I don't know believe in just no borders myself. It's a question of making sure their dignity is affirmed when they get here.</p><p>CARLSON: Then you've got to get a hold of the DSA of New York's Twitter account because they're saying some pretty reckless things over there.</p><p>WEST: Well, we've got a number of voices in DSA. I love them. We believe in disagreement. We believe in disagreement. You were just talking about disagreement in terms of defending civil liberty. I believe in protecting civil liberties, yours, mine, Page's, Bernie Sanders', (INAUDIBLE), a whole host of folks. But we have to be consistent.</p><p>CARLSON: You always lose me at the end, Cornell. Thank you so much for coming on. I hope you will come back. Cornell West.</p><p>Well, the woman who shut down the Statue of Liberty on July 4 recently credited Michelle Obama for what you did. We'll show you that and more next.</p><p>CARLSON: Congolese immigrant Therese Okoumou shut down the Statue of Liberty on July 4. You'd think she would be regarded as a villain. She's now regarded as a hero on the left.</p><p>Yesterday, she pleaded guilty to federal - not guilty, rather, to federal trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. She walked out of the courthouse wearing a \"White Supremacy is Terrorism\" T-shirt and then said this to a crowd of supporters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESE OKOUMOU, CONGOLESE IMMIGRANT: Michelle Obama, our beloved first lady that I care so much about, said when they go low, we go high and I went as high as I could.</p><p>Trump has led this country apart. It is depressing. It is outrageous. I can say a lot of things about this monster. Only a stupid, unintelligent coward and insecure, I would add, a maniac will rip a tender age child from its mother.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Imagine you're coming from Congo, which is one of the worst countries in the world, probably not a lot of nice people there, but a bad country, comes to the United States, you get this new home given to you by the people of the United States and you show up and you are not grateful at all. And instead, you were denouncing the country and its leader as racist, white supremacist, monsters. That's heroism on the left apparently.</p><p>Well, the American economy has been steadily improving this year, but recent headlines are warning of catastrophe. This from CNBC, \"The US labor shortages reaching a critical point,\" it says.</p><p>Here's \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"America's worker shortage.\"</p><p>Well, it's not hard to tell what these labor shortage pieces are trying to imply. An opinion piece in \"The Hill\" newspaper makes it obvious. \"Immigration is the Best Solution for Shortage of Workers in America.\"</p><p>That's a crock. Big businesses want to import more workers because it lets them keep wages low, labor costs down. Without immigration, there is only one solution to a so-called labor shortage, raise wages, do more training of Americans, take a chance on marginal workers, disabled workers, those with a criminal record, the exact ones the left is always telling you they care about.</p><p>It would be great if that happened. There are about 7 million American men in this country between 25 and 54, prime working age. They're unemployed or out of the labor force entirely. Many of them have stopped looking for work during the Great Recession. They are not counted in the unemployment numbers.</p><p>And yet, each one is a living disaster. The tight labor market is exactly what we could use to get all of these or many of them back to work. Hiring Americans, by the way, is the fastest way to reduce poverty, strengthen families, reverse the decline of men, cut crime, restore dignity to rural America and, in general, make this a better country.</p><p>Some businesses don't want to bother to do that. It's easier to import new workers. Tough.</p><p>Steven Camarota is director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies and he joins us tonight. How offensive is it to you as an American to read, with 7 million prime age men out of the workforce, we have a labor shortage, and so we need to import more low-wage labor?</p><p>STEVEN CAMAROTA, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH: Right. Now, that's just the high school dropouts.</p><p>If we look at people without a high school education, there are about 40 million people in the United States between 18 and 65 who have no education, who don't have a college education who are currently out of the workforce. They don't show up in statistics. And that's several million more than it was at the peak of the last economic expansion. There's just no evidence of a labor shortage in America.</p><p>CARLSON: So, it's just the opposite actually. There's a huge pool of people who are languishing without meaningful work. And businesses, rather than try and do something, or our leaders, rather than try to improve public schools, for example, just find it much easier to import a new serf class.</p><p>CAMAROTA: Look, absolutely. We can look at wages as another measure, right? If labor was really in tight supply, we would expect wages to be rising, but we can look at wages for high school dropouts, people with only a high school education or people with some college, over the last decade, their wages are either stagnant or actually declined once you adjust for inflation. Again, no evidence of a labor shortage there.</p><p>We always worry about the working poor, we worry about income inequality, we worry about work not paying, people just dropping out and living on welfare, and yet now we have an opportunity to see wages rise, and yet the business community and allies in both parties are clamoring to short- circuit all that and bring in as many immigrant workers as they can.</p><p>CARLSON: See, you wonder why socialism, which is a disaster, is suddenly so popular with young people. It's because wages are low and they can't afford to buy a house or get married.</p><p>You would think the left would notice this. They were always historically on the side of workers and higher wages. They don't care.</p><p>CAMAROTA: Yes. At this point, the idea is that they don't want to look at this question. They say, well, look, we'll increase minimum wage, we'll have unions, we'll have income transfers, more welfare, things like that.</p><p>Whatever you think of the merits of those policies, why isn't a tight labor market one of the best things we can do for the working poor, one of the best anti-poverty programs we can do?</p><p>Plus, there's all the self-esteem that comes from working.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>CAMAROTA: And so, it seems like in terms of making people's lives better, making wages better, drawing all these people out of the labor force back in, tight labor market is the best thing we can do. But immigration is likely going to short-circuit that if these people have their way.</p><p>CARLSON: Ten seconds. Do you think if the majority of immigrants coming into this country voted Republican that Democrats might renew their interest in a tight labor market?</p><p>CAMAROTA: Yes. About 2 to 1, immigrants and their kids are voting Democratic and maybe that does have an impact. I hope you're wrong.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, maybe.</p><p>CAMAROTA: But it does seem to play some role.</p><p>CARLSON: Not to be cynical. I've done too many segments on this. Steven Camarota, thank you. Really interesting.</p><p>CAMAROTA: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: San Francisco, probably the most beautiful city in the continental United States is now coated in human waste and discarded syringes. Is the city finally paying the price for becoming a left-wing dystopia? We'll explore that question next.</p><p>CARLSON: If you've been there recently, you might consider this impossible, but San Francisco's problem with filth is actually getting worse.</p><p>Of course, for years it has been covered with needles and human waste, but this week residents have been complaining about the stench of a staggering 20 pound bag of feces - human feces, I hate even to say it, but it's real - left on a sidewalk.</p><p>Finally, the city is paying the price for this chaos. A major medical convention is moving to a different city. They're citing health risks to attendees.</p><p>Kimberlin Brown Pelzer is a longtime actress and she's now a Republican candidate for California 36th congressional district and she joins tonight. Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p>KIMBERLIN BROWN PELZER, REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Well, thank you for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, it's just sad as someone who loves California. I know that you do too, having been there an awfully long time.</p><p>It's takes a lot to destroy a city like San Francisco. How did this happen?</p><p>PELZER: You know what, Tucker? I'm third-generation California born and raised. And this is not the California I came from or you for that matter. I know you're from Southern California, boy!</p><p>But, Prop 47, once that passed, and you could actually steal anything, $950 below, the homeless have been flocking to the State of California.</p><p>CARLSON: For our viewers who don't follow, that was proposition that made low-level crimes not crimes basically.</p><p>PELZER: Exactly. Exactly. And I can tell you on a personal level, I have people coming into my stores on a regular basis stealing items that my employees are later finding on Craigslist and the police can't do anything about it.</p><p>They say they won't show up because where do you send a ticket for someone who's homeless. They simply don't show up any longer. And they've made crime OK in the State of California.</p><p>And in San Francisco, where you're talking about, I mean, that's Pelosi's backyard.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PELZER: And she is part of that liberal agenda that is driving California down the path that it's going. And Raul Ruiz, who I'm running against, is doing the exact same thing. They don't understand what's happening in California because they want to turn the other way.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, and they're totally in their bubbles. I mean, what's interesting is that San Francisco is one of richest places not just in the world, but in all of human history, and yet it has the most filth on the sidewalk and the most people living outside.</p><p>I mean, I find it totally bizarre. Do they not notice, do you think?</p><p>PELZER: Well, I just don't think that they care. They're trying to attract people to California to keep their voter base popular. And I can tell you this is not the California we want any longer. We need change here desperately.</p><p>My employees, every single morning, have to go out and clean the feces, the needles. They have to try to get people who are homeless to move. People are afraid to come to businesses any longer in the State of California.</p><p>And just like you said, as far as conventions coming to California, that's a big industry here. And that's changing as well. They're not paying attention. They're not listening. And they're going to have to here very soon or we're going to continue down this road.</p><p>CARLSON: It took centuries to build that state and they've wrecked it so fast. Kimberlin, thank you. And good luck in your place. I'm suddenly rooting for you. That was great. Good to talk to you.</p><p>PELZER: Well, good to see you, Tucker. You take care.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Lawmakers in New York just failed to pass a bill banning revenge porn. Advocates say Google is to blame. Huh! Interesting story. We've got details. Coming up.</p><p>CARLSON: Lawmakers in the State of New York recently took up a bill that would have banned so-called revenge porn. That is the posting of naked images online without the consent of the naked.</p><p>The bill failed to pass, though, and some say Google is to blame for that. After not saying anything about the law for years, supporters say Google demanded numerous changes on the day of the vote. Lawmakers balked and the bill was not even voted on.</p><p>Beverly Hallberg is the president of District Media Group and she joins us tonight. Beverly, do you think Google was behind killing the bill?</p><p>BEVERLY HALLBERG, DISTRICT MEDIA GROUP PRESIDENT: I think Google took way too long to voice their concerns. This is a bill that's been in the works for about five years. We also have 40 states including Washington D.C. that have passed similar legislation.</p><p>The question is why so late in the game. I think it's suspect. I think it has something to do with them not wanting to have to be involved.</p><p>But I do think there's some validity, and that's not asking platforms like Google, like Facebook to have to be the arbitrators of what should be on their platform and what shouldn't.</p><p>Of course, there are community guidelines that they need to follow, public decency laws, but do we really want Facebook and Google and others to be the arbitrator of what's consensual, what's not consensual because we - should we really put our free speech rights in their hands.</p><p>CARLSON: We've already given them our free speech rights. That's the portal through which all human information flows and they clamp down on ideas they don't like. I mean, they censor ideas that they don't agree with and they are liberal.</p><p>But I think you raise a valid point actually. The question for me is, to what extent does Google have control over the legislative process. Their lobbying efforts seem so vast, but no one ever reports on it.</p><p>HALLBERG: Unfortunately too much. I think it's like, as I said, extremely suspect. I'm not sure exactly, with these legislators in New York City or in New York State, what is the pull, why so late in the game, but I think there's some cronyism going on. Are they giving funds to these legislators for their campaigns? What is behind it?</p><p>But, again, when it comes to big tech, they are to blame for a lot of things. Even recently, I thought the most surprising story about big tech this week was that they said that Facebook, and one of the Facebook outlets, they said that posting of the amendments from the Constitution was actually hate speech.</p><p>And there was a Texas publication that leading up to July 4 said we want to post an amendment every day, show people what's in the Bill of Rights, and one of the amendments, they said, was actually hate speech. They now have unblocked it and put it back on.</p><p>But once again, why is big tech determining what is hate speech and what is not, and I think that's concerning. And why are they in the pockets, it seems to be, at times with so many elected officials?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that is the question. So, you have a company that has more power than any company has ever had in human history over not just what we know, but how we think. And it has a demonstrated history of censorship, political censorship. And our Congress has done nothing about it.</p><p>I mean, doesn't that by itself almost suggest that they control the Congress to a greater degree than a company should?</p><p>HALLBERG: And very concerning, I think the other side of this too is that, when it comes to these platforms, I think government doesn't know how they work.</p><p>Even when you look at cybersecurity, what happens with the Russians, with Russian bots and Facebook, there's a lot of questions of government and our elected officials and the different branches of government, these agencies, do they even understand how this works, do they even know the type of regulation.</p><p>So, I think, in many ways, when you look at our tech innovation, and it's outpacing what our lawmakers are actually able to keep up with.</p><p>And so, what is the answer to it when government officials don't understand it. I do like that we have legislation on state level dealing with some of these laws. What we have to get away with are unelected bureaucrats making regulations.</p><p>But we need more people, I think, involved in figuring out how to protect our privacy that actually understand the technology because, sadly, just doesn't - they aren't up to speech as they should.</p><p>CARLSON: At least elected officials ought to be writing the laws and not people we've never heard of.</p><p>Beverly Hallberg, thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>HALLBERG: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: China rolling out new trade restrictions today. They seem intended to have an effect on our next election. Huh! A foreign power intervening in our democracy. I'm sure they're on this on the other channels. If not, we are. So, we'll be right back with that.</p><p>CARLSON: I want to close tonight with a short quote from \"The New York Times\". This is describing China's retaliatory tariffs against United States.</p><p>\"Beijing said on Friday\" - today - \"that its levies had kicked in immediately after the Trump administration's tariffs went into effect just past midnight in Washington. The 545 goods targeted by China for tariffs, which include beef, seafood, dairy and other farm goods, in addition to cars, were chosen to hit President Trump's supporters in the agricultural and industrial parts of the Midwest.\"</p><p>Huh! China is hitting Trump supporters in the Midwest. That sounds like election meddling to us. It sounds like China may be hacking our democracy in a way far more significant than buying a few Facebook ads.</p><p>And if for some reason, \"The New York Times\", which has spent a year decrying democracy hacking, is not demanding an investigation. In fact, they didn't even notice it didn't seem like. Why is that? We'll leave you the weekend to think about it.</p><p>That's about it for us tonight. Tune in every night at 8:00 to the show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Have a great weekend!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018070601cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SRH-NS61-JB20-G2HM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7130\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 6, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Justice</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trade</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDRGNTk0NDIyNTkwNDFGNzhFNUY0QUZFMjA3OEE0NTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEJBMUU3RjlGRDM0NDFCNUI2MzNEQjQ5OERGMjE3RDU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDYwRTgwODJBOTNGNDk1MkI4NjAxMzNDRjE3RjA3NkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MENFM0VEODU5QjAxNDMwNzg5QTUzODI3NTU2RUREQjI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

The app is increasingly a target of U.S. security concerns over its Chinese ownership.</p><p><br/>After the initial news, reports bubbled up that Microsoft is in talks to buy the Chinese social network, which has a massive footprint in the U.S. and beyond. TikTok itself is not available in China and Chinese users instead use Douyin, a similar ByteDance-owned app specific to the country.<br/>While little is known about what such a sale could mean or if the president would really play any role, the event would send huge waves through the tech world. TikTok is one of the only meaningful outside competitors for U.S.-based social networks like YouTube and Facebook.<br/>It's also not clear if the sale would somehow spin out the company's U.S. business or if TikTok's broad international operations would remain intact.<br/>TikTok knows it's in trouble in the U.S. At a time when even American tech companies are under fire from regulators, the company desperately needs to alleviate government concerns about its Chinese ownership. TikTok made a big strategic move in that direction this May, hiring Disney executive Kevin Mayer on as CEO of TikTok and COO of ByteDance.<br/>\u00a0<br/>It would certainly be strange timing were an American tech giant to purchase TikTok: On Wednesday, a Congressional committee held a high-profile hearing scrutinizing tech's biggest mergers and acquisitions. The White House declined to comment on the report when contacted by TechCrunch.<br/>Although its big tech peers Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon were subject to four-plus hours of Congressional scrutiny Wednesday, Microsoft was not asked to attend. Unlike those companies, Microsoft has grappled with antitrust action by the U.S. government before. Microsoft's primary focus on enterprise rather than consumer business likely also steered regulators away, though the TikTok deal could invite new attention unless it has some kind of special blessing from the federal government.<br/>TikTok has come under increased government scrutiny recently, with the president expressing interest in banning the app outright in the U.S. This month, Joe Biden's campaign asked its staffers to delete the app from both work and personal devices.<br/>Some U.S. companies have also banned their employees from using the app over concerns about its Chinese ownership.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M1324734</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JV-WCR1-DYDW-74PB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"412\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 11, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

That follows an FBI raid on a member of the Trump inner circle, his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.  It was based on information from Mueller's team.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We will have a full report after the news summary.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the head of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, says his company is working with the special counsel's probe of the Russian election meddling.  That was one of a range of issues raised as Zuckerberg faced off with 44 members of the United States Senate today.  </p><p>Our Lisa Desjardins begins our coverage.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  For the social media maverick who's often behind the scenes, a very public lesson in scrutiny, as lawmakers grilled Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg with questions.  </p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R), South Dakota:  Why should we trust Facebook?  </p><p>SEN. MARIA CANTWELL (D), Washington:  I believe you have all the talent.  My question is whether you have all the will.  </p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON (D), Florida:  How can American consumers trust folks like your company to be caretakers of their most personal and identifiable information?</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  The CEO of one of the Internet's most dominant companies began with an apology.  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake.  And it was my mistake, and I'm sorry.  I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  This one week after Facebook revealed up to 87 million users' personal information was improperly accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm hired by the Trump campaign in 2016.  </p><p>Cambridge Analytica then used that data to direct Trump campaign content toward individual users.  Facebook admits it knew about that kind of data harvesting for at least two years, but only addressed it last month.  </p><p>Today's rare joint hearing by the Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees was just one sign of the fury over the revelations.  </p><p>Zuckerberg's message?  His company is changing.  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  We need to take a more proactive role and a broader view of our responsibility.  It's not enough to just build tools.  We need to make sure that they're used for good.  At the end of the day, this is going to be something where people will measure us by our results.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  But that didn't satisfy senators.  Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, pressed Zuckerberg about why Facebook waited years to tell users about the Cambridge Analytica breach.  </p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON:  You apologized for it, but you didn't notify them.  And do you think that you have an ethical obligation to notify 87 million Facebook users?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  We considered it a closed case.  In retrospect, that was clearly a mistake.  </p><p>We shouldn't have taken their word for it.  And we have updated our policies in how we're going to operate the company to make sure that we don't make that mistake again.  </p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON:  Did anybody notify the FTC?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  No, Senator.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Some also honed in on repeated mistakes and apologies by Facebook over the years.  </p><p>Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune:  </p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE:  After more than a decade of promises to do better, how is today's apology different?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  So we have made a lot of mistakes running the company.  </p><p>I think it's pretty much impossible, I believe, to start a company in your dorm room and then grow it to be at the scale that we're at now without making some mistakes.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Other senators, like Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar, pushed for specific fixes.  </p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), Minnesota:  Would you support a rule that would require you to notify users of a breach within 72 hours?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, that makes sense to me.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  This as Klobuchar and others push something called the Honest Ads Act, one of a long line of bills now focused on digital platforms like Facebook.  </p><p>It requires those companies to make sure no foreign interests can post campaign ads, and that the public be able to see who is behind every election ad.  Facebook says it is doing that now, and more, launching easier ways for users to block access to their information, and promising to restrict how much data any outside company can access.  </p><p>But as Facebook tried to look forward, senators pointed back.  </p><p>Connecticut's Richard Blumenthal asked about Facebook's deal with Alexander Aleksandr Kogan, whose app gave Cambridge Analytica its access.  </p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D), Connecticut:  I want to show you the terms of service that Aleksandr Kogan provided to Facebook, and note for you that, in fact, Facebook was on notice that he could sell that user information.  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  I have not.  </p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL:  Who in Facebook was responsible for seeing those terms of service that put you on notice that that information could be sold?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, our app review team would be responsible for that.  </p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL:  Has anyone been fired on that app review team?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, not because of this.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Illinois Senator Dick Durbin asked about Zuckerberg's privacy.  </p><p>SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL), Minority Whip:  Would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  No.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SEN. RICHARD DURBIN:  If you have messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the names of the people you have messaged?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, no, I wouldn't choose to do that publicly here.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Zuckerberg was twice pressed on whether Facebook tracks users across devices and after they leave the platform.  He hesitated to answer.  </p><p>SEN. ROGER WICKER (R), Mississippi:  There has been reports that Facebook can track a user's Internet browsing activity even after that user has logged off the Facebook platform.  Can you confirm whether this is true?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, I want to make sure I get this accurate.  So, it would probably be better to have my team follow up.  </p><p>SEN. ROGER WICKER:  You don't know?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  I know that people use cookies on the Internet, and that you can probably correlate activity between sessions.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Zuckerberg gave more specifics on a different topic, the threat from Russia.  Facebook has said that Russians sent fake campaign ads to more than 100 million Facebook users in 2016.  </p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D), California:  What is Facebook doing to prevent foreign actors from interfering in U.S. elections?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  This is one of my top priorities in 2018 is to get this right.  I -- one of my greatest regrets in running the company is that we were slow in identifying the Russian information operations in 2016.  </p><p>We expected them to do a number of more traditional cyber-attacks, which we did identify and notify the companies that they were trying to hack into them, but we were slow in identifying the type of new information operations.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Zuckerberg was also pressed on if his company feeds global crisis.  The U.N. and human rights groups accuse Facebook of allowing hateful anti-Muslim videos and other posts that facilitated violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  What's happening in Myanmar is a terrible tragedy and we need to do more.  </p><p>SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D), Vermont:  We all agree with that.  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  OK.  </p><p>SEN. PATRICK LEAHY:  But U.N. investigators have blamed you, blamed Facebook for playing a role in that genocide.  We all agree it's terrible.</p><p>How can you dedicate and will you dedicate resources to make sure such hate speech is taken down within 24 hours?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:  One is, we're hiring dozens of more Burmese-language content reviewers, because hate speech is very language-specific.  It's hard to do it without people who speak the local language.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  As the hearing ran into the evening, one theme was constant: Facebook's power and how it handles that power.  Zuckerberg will be in Washington at least one more night.  He testifies before a House committee tomorrow.  </p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Lisa Desjardins.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And now our correspondent Amna Nawaz looks further at some of what we learned today and some questions that remain.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ:  And for that, I'm joined by Franklin Foer, a staff writer for \"The Atlantic,\" and author of \"World Without Mind:  The Existential Threat of Big Tech.\"  </p><p>Thanks for being here.  </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER, \"The Atlantic\":  Pleasure.  </p><p>AMNA NAWAZ:  You watched the testimony today.  It's fair to say Mark Zuckerberg went in a bit on the back foot.  How do you think he did?  </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:  Well, I think if you look six months ago at Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg was discussed as a potential presidential candidate, Facebook disavowed that it was a publisher, that it was the world's biggest gatekeeper.  </p><p>Facebook pushed back against the prospect of government regulating it.  And if you look at today's performance, while he was technically I think very proficient in swatting away some of the concerns of senators, their role in the world has fundamentally changed.  </p><p>He was conceding that Facebook is going to be regulated by government, and that regulation might ultimately be good for Facebook and Facebook's users.  He conceded that Facebook is a publisher, that it has responsibilities for the content that it publishes.</p><p>And so the Zeitgeist has shifted dramatically.  His game, I think, is trying to preserve Facebook's dominant position, its monopoly.  He would rather have this discussion be about the prospect of the regulation, rather than the prospect of having a discussion about antitrust and about breaking up the company.  </p><p>AMNA NAWAZ:  You mentioned him swatting away some of those questions.  What did he not say or not answer today that you thought he would or should have?  </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:  Yes.  </p><p>Well, look, he was trying to -- he was disavowing Facebook's role in collecting people's data.  He portrayed Facebook as being a system where people were making all sorts of conscious choices to have their data collected by Facebook.  </p><p>And so I think that he was being fairly disingenuous.  There was a question that you just showed where he was saying that Facebook -- he doesn't know whether Facebook tracks you across all their devices.  </p><p>Well, of course he knows that.  And one of the issues that I think is really important that he didn't discuss is the role of manipulation in Facebook's system.  It came up very narrowly in the case of Cambridge Analytica, but Facebook is a system that is a feedback loop that is designed to keep users as engaged as long as possible, which means keeping them addicted.  </p><p>And so content on Facebook is arrayed in such fashion as to keep people addicted.  So he's not feeding people information based on what they share.  He's not feeding it based on what's good for them or good for democracy.  He's feeding it based on what will keep them addicted.  </p><p>AMNA NAWAZ:  He's also feeding it based on some of the data that they do track.  </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:  Exactly.  </p><p>AMNA NAWAZ:  He was asked specifically about that.  We saw one of those moments in Lisa's report just now, basically how and when and where his platform collects data from their users.  </p><p>What did you make of how he handled those specific questions?  </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:  I thought he was pretty effective in dealing with the senators.  </p><p>And I think we were at a moment where senators, a lot of the senators are -- if we're frank, they're older.  They're not necessarily Facebook's core demographic, or they're senators who are busy who are not necessarily Facebook power users, so they didn't understand the system.  </p><p>And so when it came to pressing Zuckerberg on a lot of the questions about the collection of data, I think Zuckerberg was reasonably effective in pushing them away, but I think in ways that were ultimately a bit disingenuous.  </p><p>AMNA NAWAZ:  There's another specific question, which a few of the senators zeroed in there, what they knew and when and how they shared it.  They knew back in 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had improperly shared data.  </p><p>They banned them.  They deleted -- or ask them to delete the data.  But they didn't tell their users and they didn't report it to the FTC.</p><p>Should they have?  How do you think Zuckerberg handled those questions today?  </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:  I think that they should have.  </p><p>And I think that part of the issue is when we step become and you look at these questions, the Cambridge Analytica questions, the questions of giving access of data to third-party developers, and the questions about Facebook being careless in their handling of this precious cargo, really these are systematic problems that Facebook has.  </p><p>And so this was one glaring example of Facebook screwing up.  Zuckerberg admitted failure.  But really it's part of a systematic failure.  </p><p>AMNA NAWAZ:  Along those same lines, there is an inherent business model tension.  Right? </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:  Exactly.  Yes.  </p><p>AMNA NAWAZ:  They're pledging to protect the data.  At the same time, their business model is built on profiting from it.  Can people trust them on that moving forward?  </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:  Right.  Exactly.  </p><p>Their business model is always about hijacking, commandeering as much of the attention of their users as possible.  And so they're always going to be collecting as much data as possible in order to keep people's attention for as long as possible, and then to also allow advertisers to target that attention as much as possible.  </p><p>And so I don't see how they are ever going to escape this kind of arms race that they're in, where they are going to have to keep pushing the boundaries of surveillance on their users.  </p><p>AMNA NAWAZ:  Franklin Foer, thanks for being here.  </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-577871</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2W-FWK1-JBSW-753D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2361\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Federal News Service, Inc.

Project Maven, for those unfamiliar, is a Pentagon program to build an AI-powered surveillance platform for unmanned aerial vehicles. Basically, the job is to build a system for the US military to deploy and monitor autonomous drones. This system would, supposedly, give the government real-time battlefield command and control and the ability to track, tag, and spy on targets without human involvement. </p><p>The limited, unclassified information available makes it appear as though the project stops just short of functioning as an AI weapons system capable of firing on self-designated targets as they become available in the battle space. Google previously held the contract but, allegedly due to employee push back, the Mountain View company chose not to renew when it expired in March. At least a dozen employees walked out[2] in 2018 after Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene announced the company would renew the contract. Subsequent internal pressure lead to Google ultimately declining to bid for the contract again. The Pentagon didn't have to look very far to find a company willing to pick up where Google's ethics left off. Palantir, the company that powersICE and CBP's surveillance networks[3] and builds software for police that circumvents the warrant process, is reportedly chugging away on Project Maven. Business Insider broke the news[4] today, reporter Becky Peterson writes that a person familiar with the project said: Palantir is working with the Defense Department to build artificial intelligence that can analyze video feeds from aerial drones Internally at Palantir, where names of clients are kept close to the vest, the project is referred to as 'Tron,' after the 1982 Steven Lisberger film. Previously, Peter Thiel, the founder of Palantir and long time Donald Trump associate, had referred to Google's withdrawal from the project as tantamount to treason. In June of 2018, speaking at the National Conservatism Conference in Washington, Thiel referenced Google's decision to push forward with Project Dragonfly (a controversial Google program to build Search out for China) while abandoning the Pentagon's Project Maven. He said[5]the CIA should investigate Google: Is it because they consider themselves to be so thoroughly infiltrated that they have engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military because they are making the sort of bad, short-term rationalistic [decision] that if the technology doesn't go out the front door, it gets stolen out the backdoor anyway? It's worth pointing out that Google was allegedly working with the Chinese government,not necessarily the Chinesemilitary (which would have no reason to develop a censored search engine with Google). Thiel's supposition, one echoed by[6] Palantir's CEO Alex Karp, is that it's big tech's patriotic duty to do whatever the US government tells it. Of course, Thiel hasn't always felt this way[7]. He's invested in Chinese startups, bid for contracts, and worked with Chinese agencies before. However, what Thiel fails to mention, time and time again when he spouts his patriotism rhetoric[8], is that the US government doesn't have an official policy on the ethical use of AI nor any publicly available guidance on how the military is authorized to use AI. We stand on the cusp of AI-powered warfare and there's no Geneva Convention[9] for keeping countries like Russia, the US, and China from deploying legions of autonomous killing machines designed to seek and destroy civilian populations. While, as Thiel often puts it, it is important to maintain an edge on our nation's potential enemies, it's also important to ensure we're acting with the bare minimum of ethics[10]. There are plenty of technologies we don't use for warfare because they're unethical. We don't use mustard gas or white phosphorous anymore, for example, because they're inhumane. Autonomous killing machines should fall into the same category. And, though the Pentagon claims Project Maven is just about taking pictures, any developer can tell you that training a drone to shoot something works about the same whether it's carrying a camera or a weapon. There's probably more to Project Maven[11] than meets the eye. Until the US government and its allies come up with firm regulations for the military use of AI, it seems unethical for anyone to build dual-use AI for it.

Basically, the job is to build a system for the US military to deploy and monitor autonomous drones.</p><p><br/>\u00a0This system would, supposedly, give the government real-time battlefield command and control and the ability to track, tag, and spy on targets without human involvement. The limited, unclassified information available makes it appear as though the project stops just short of functioning as an AI weapons system capable of firing on self-designated targets as they become available in the battle space.<br/>Google previously held the contract but, allegedly due to employee push back, the Mountain View company chose not to renew when it expired in March. At least a dozen employees walked out in 2018 after Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene announced the company would renew the contract. Subsequent internal pressure lead to Google ultimately declining to bid for the contract again.<br/>The Pentagon didn't have to look very far to find a company willing to pick up where Google's ethics left off. Palantir, the company that powers\u00a0ICE and CBP's surveillance networks and builds software for police that circumvents the warrant process, is reportedly chugging away on Project Maven.<br/>Business Insider broke the news today, reporter Becky Peterson writes that a person familiar with the project said:<br/>Palantir is working with the Defense Department to build artificial intelligence that can analyze video feeds from aerial drones ... Internally at Palantir, where names of clients are kept close to the vest, the project is referred to as \"Tron,\" after the 1982 Steven Lisberger film.<br/>Previously, Peter Thiel, the founder of Palantir and long time Donald Trump associate, had referred to Google's withdrawal from the project as tantamount to treason. In June of 2018, speaking at the National Conservatism Conference in Washington, Thiel referenced Google's decision to push forward with Project Dragonfly (a controversial Google program to build Search out for China) while abandoning the Pentagon's Project Maven. He said\u00a0the CIA should investigate Google:<br/>Is it because they consider themselves to be so thoroughly infiltrated that they have engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military... because they are making the sort of bad, short-term rationalistic [decision] that if the technology doesn't go out the front door, it gets stolen out the backdoor anyway?<br/>It's worth pointing out that Google was allegedly working with the Chinese government,\u00a0not necessarily the Chinese\u00a0military (which would have no reason to develop a censored search engine with Google).<br/>Thiel's supposition, one echoed by Palantir's CEO Alex Karp, is that it's big tech's patriotic duty to do whatever the US government tells it. Of course, Thiel hasn't always felt this way. He's invested in Chinese startups, bid for contracts, and worked with Chinese agencies before.<br/>However, what Thiel fails to mention, time and time again when he spouts his patriotism rhetoric, is that the US government doesn't have an official policy on the ethical use of AI nor any publicly available guidance on how the military is authorized to use AI.<br/>We stand on the cusp of AI-powered warfare and there's no Geneva Convention for keeping countries like Russia, the US, and China from deploying legions of autonomous killing machines designed to seek and destroy civilian populations. While, as Thiel often puts it, it is important to maintain an edge on our nation's potential enemies, it's also important to ensure we're acting with the bare minimum of ethics.<br/>There are plenty of technologies we don't use for warfare because they're unethical. We don't use mustard gas or white phosphorous anymore, for example, because they're inhumane. Autonomous killing machines should fall into the same category. And, though the Pentagon claims Project Maven is just about taking pictures, any developer can tell you that training a drone to shoot something works about the same whether it's carrying a camera or a weapon. There's probably more to Project Maven than meets the eye.<br/>Until the US government and its allies come up with firm regulations for the military use of AI, it seems unethical for anyone to build dual-use AI for it.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-398759</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR2-7041-DYDW-73ND-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"762\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 12, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

India is an example of how various policy reforms related to digital finance, such as transformation of the traditional banking system with the regulator [RBI] playing a pivotal role can solve challenges of financial development and inclusion that once seemed out of reach, it said.</p><p>\"In addition to bringing the population into the formal financial system and keeping them there, the Indian authorities have also developed an architecture that allows individuals to access and share their personal data to overcome information asymmetries without compromising their privacy,\" it said.</p><p>It said a large population in the developing countries was unbanked despite progress on financial inclusion as about 1.7 billion individuals remain unbanked in India and China.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Lucknow.

The state-controlled lender fell to an operating loss of \u00a38m in the third quarter compared to an operating profit of \u00a3961m a year ago. The latest switching figures, which are also out today, showed that RBS lost a net 10,440 current account customers in the third quarter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome to your new job Alison Rose. And good luck!\u00a0</p><p>Part of McKinsey's thesis was that too many banks are failing to produce a return on tangible equity above their cost of capital. What this means in plain English is that lenders are effectively taking their shareholders' money and slowly but methodically flushing it down the drain.</p><p>RBS has aspirations to achieve a return on equity of 12pc by 2020; in the third quarter it managed minus 3.8pc. Gulp.\u00a0</p><p>It's not alone. McKinsey reckons that nearly 60pc of banks are not generating returns on equity. The world's banks are clearly beset with problems.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/10/24/ppi-payments-drag-rbs-loss/\">Markets Hub - Royal Bank of Scotland Group</url></p><p>The biggest of these is the persistent and, who knows, maybe even permanent low interest rate environment. Banks make a big proportion of their profits from the difference between the interest rate they pay to customers and the income they can generate on those deposits. This is called the net interest margin and it gets fatter as interest rates go up.\u00a0</p><p>Right now, it is pancake flat and that makes running a bank a bit like running the 100 metres in a deep sea diving suit. Meanwhile, lenders are shelling out money hand over fist for past misdemeanours and desperately trying to patch up legacy IT systems <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/10/24/ppi-payments-drag-rbs-loss/\">while young upstarts</url> - unencumbered by these issues - snap at their heels. You can understand why the likes of McKinsey are predicting many will trip up.\u00a0</p><p>And yet, it's hard to shake off the impression that we've heard similarly dire prognoses before. For all that the banks are blundering around looking rubbish, they're still around.\u00a0</p><p>Let's take a closer look at those RBS figures. The main reason the bank has swung to a loss is that it's had to cough up another \u00a3900m in provisions <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/10/24/ppi-payments-drag-rbs-loss/\">to pay for PPI claims</url> . RBS has now stumped up \u00a36.2bn for this particular past stupidity. NatWest Markets, the group's rump investment bank, also proved a drag with profit down from \u00a3419m to \u00a3150m. But neither of these issues is close to being terminal. The PPI saga is coming to an end and no one is under the impression that investment banking will be RBS's salvation.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/10/24/ppi-payments-drag-rbs-loss/\">UK banking's PPI roll of dishonour</url></p><p>Those switching figures also provide a mixed picture. Yes, RBS has lost a net 10,000-odd customers while Barclays and Lloyds Bank waved adieu to nearly 11,000 and 9,000 respectively. And, true, challenger upstarts such as Monzo and Starling together gained more than 20,000.</p><p>But, hang on a minute, what's this? HSBC was up nearly 16,000, Nationwide gained more than 26,000\u00a0and NatWest - just another brand under the RBS umbrella - added close to 16,000 (more than offsetting its Scottish sibling's losses). You certainly can't paint a picture of the incumbent banks hemorrhaging customers to the new kids on the block from these numbers.\u00a0</p><p>Many of those challengers are struggling to turn a profit too and the big banks are fighting back by launching their own whizzy apps. It's a similar story in other business lines. Investment banks are losing some fees to boutique advisory firms but it's really just a rounding error. Large companies are sticking with the big boys for business banking.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/10/24/ppi-payments-drag-rbs-loss/\">City Intelligence newsletter (SUBSCRIBER) Article</url></p><p>New peer-to-peer lenders appear to be going bust with alarming regularity\u00a0- with FundingSecure <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/10/24/ppi-payments-drag-rbs-loss/\">becoming the latest this week</url> . And the threat from the big tech firms is always failing to materialise. Facebook's difficulties with getting Libra, its digital currency, off the ground is a salutary reminder that providing financial services can be harder than it looks.\u00a0</p><p>Then there is the manner in which McKinsey thinks banks will meet their demise: \"To survive a downturn, merging with similar banks or selling to a stronger buyer with a complementary footprint may be the only options if reinvention is not feasible.\" M&amp;A? Really? You think that's going to fly with regulators?\u00a0</p><p>Let's be clear: the last financial crisis - which precipitated the worst economic downturn in a generation - only managed to kill off a handful of banks. How bad does McKinsey think the next recession will be that it does away with a third of the world's lenders?\u00a0</p><p>It might be a touch hypocritical for a journalist to take issue with a management consultancy for hyperbolic pessimism, but hey ho. Reports about the imminent death of big banks have been, it would appear, greatly exaggerated.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-57265770</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBM-2FS1-F021-64H6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"815\"/><timeReceived>5:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 24, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

But it will also likely saddle the company with additional restrictions and another lengthy stretch of strict scrutiny.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets reported Friday that the FTC has voted to fine Facebook for privacy violations and mishandling user data. Most of them cited an unnamed person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Facebook and the FTC declined to comment. The 3-2 vote broke along party lines, with Republicans in support and Democrats in opposition to the settlement, according to the reports.</p><p>The case now moves to the Justice Department's civil division for review. It's unclear how long the process would take, though it is likely to be approved. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the Facebook matter.</p><p>For many companies, a $5 billion fine would be crippling. But Facebook is not most companies. It had nearly $56 billion in revenue last year. This year, analysts expect around $69 billion, according to Zacks. As a one-time expense, the company will also be able to exclude the amount from its adjusted earnings results -the profit figure that investors and financial analysts pay attention to.</p><p>\"This closes a dark chapter and puts it in the rearview mirror with Cambridge Analytica,\" said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. \"Investors still had lingering worries that the fine might not be approved. Now, the Street can breathe a little easier.\"</p><p>Facebook has earmarked $3 billion for a potential fine and said in April it was anticipating having to pay up to $5 billion.</p><p>But while Wall Street - and likely Facebook executives - may be breathing a little easier, the fine alone has not appeased Facebook critics, including privacy advocates and lawmakers.</p><p>\"The reported $5 billion penalty is barely a tap on the wrist, not even a slap,\" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut. \"Such a financial punishment for a purposeful, blatant illegality is chump change for a company that makes tens of billions of dollars every year.\"</p><p>He and others questioned whether the FTC will force Facebook to make any meaningful changes to how it handles user data. This might include limits on what information it collects on people and how it targets ads to them. It's currently unclear what measures the settlement includes beyond the fine.</p><p>Privacy advocates have been calling on the FTC to come down on Facebook for a decade, but over that time the company's money, power and Washington influence has only increased.</p><p>\"Privacy regulation in the U.S. is broken. While large after-the-fact fines matter, what is much more important is strong, clear rules to protect consumers,\" said Nuala O'Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology. The CDT is pushing for federal online privacy legislation.</p><p>Some have called on the FTC to hold Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally liable for the privacy violations in some way, but based on the party line vote breakdown, experts said this is not likely.</p><p>Marc Rotenberg, president of the nonprofit online privacy advocacy group Electronic Privacy Information Center, said he was \"confused\" as to why the Democratic commissioners didn't support the settlement and said he suspects, without having seen the actual settlement, that this was due to the Zuckerberg liability question.</p><p>\"But I thought that was misguided,\" he said, adding that EPIC instead supports more wholesale limits on how Facebook handles user privacy.</p><p>Since the Cambridge Analytica debacle erupted more than a year ago and prompted the FTC investigation, Facebook has vowed to do a better job corralling its users' data. That scandal revealed that a data mining firm affiliated with President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign improperly accessed private information from as many as 87 million Facebook users through a quiz app. At issue was whether Facebook violated a 2011 settlement with the FTC over user privacy.</p><p>Other leaky controls have also since come to light. Facebook acknowledged giving big tech companies like Amazon and Yahoo extensive access to users' personal data , in effect exempting them from its usual privacy rules. And it collected call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system in 2015.</p><p>Wall Street appeared unfazed at the prospect of the fine. Facebook's shares closed at $204.87 on Friday and added 24 cents after hours. The stock is up more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year. In fact, Facebook's market value has increased by $64 billion since its April earnings report when it announced how much it was expecting to be fined.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said in a statement that the fine gives Facebook \"a Christmas present five months early. It's very disappointing that such an enormously powerful company that engaged in such serious misconduct is getting a slap on the wrist. This fine is a fraction of Facebook's annual revenue.\"</p><p>Cicilline leads the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, which is pursuing a bipartisan investigation of the big tech companies' market dominance.</p><p>The fine, however, doesn't spell the end of Facebook's troubles. The company faces a slew of other investigations, both in the U.S. and overseas, that could carry their own fines and, more importantly possible limits to its data collection. This includes nearly a dozen by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, which oversees privacy regulation in the European Union.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-87def64d3c5441d187d6ef91839d3796</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJS-P851-JC65-52MC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"952\"/><timeReceived>11:33 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 13, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But it will also likely saddle the company with additional restrictions and another lengthy stretch of strict scrutiny.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets reported Friday that the FTC has voted to fine Facebook for privacy violations and mishandling user data. Most of them cited an unnamed person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Facebook and the FTC declined to comment. The 3-2 vote broke along party lines, with Republicans in support and Democrats in opposition to the settlement, according to the reports.</p><p>The case now moves to the Justice Department's civil division for review. It's unclear how long the process would take, though it is likely to be approved. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the Facebook matter.</p><p>For many companies, a $5 billion fine would be crippling. But Facebook is not most companies. It had nearly $56 billion in revenue last year. This year, analysts expect around $69 billion, according to Zacks. As a one-time expense, the company will also be able to exclude the amount from its adjusted earnings results -the profit figure that investors and financial analysts pay attention to.</p><p>\"This closes a dark chapter and puts it in the rearview mirror with Cambridge Analytica,\" said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. \"Investors still had lingering worries that the fine might not be approved. Now, the Street can breathe a little easier.\"</p><p>Facebook has earmarked $3 billion for a potential fine and said in April it was anticipating having to pay up to $5 billion.</p><p>But while Wall Street - and likely Facebook executives - may be breathing a little easier, the fine alone has not appeased Facebook critics, including privacy advocates and lawmakers.</p><p>\"The reported $5 billion penalty is barely a tap on the wrist, not even a slap,\" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut. \"Such a financial punishment for a purposeful, blatant illegality is chump change for a company that makes tens of billions of dollars every year.\"</p><p>He and others questioned whether the FTC will force Facebook to make any meaningful changes to how it handles user data. This might include limits on what information it collects on people and how it targets ads to them. It's currently unclear what measures the settlement includes beyond the fine.</p><p>Privacy advocates have been calling on the FTC to come down on Facebook for a decade, but over that time the company's money, power and Washington influence has only increased.</p><p>\"Privacy regulation in the U.S. is broken. While large after-the-fact fines matter, what is much more important is strong, clear rules to protect consumers,\" said Nuala O'Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology. The CDT is pushing for federal online privacy legislation.</p><p>Some have called on the FTC to hold Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally liable for the privacy violations in some way, but based on the party line vote breakdown, experts said this is not likely.</p><p>Marc Rotenberg, president of the nonprofit online privacy advocacy group Electronic Privacy Information Center, said he was \"confused\" as to why the Democratic commissioners didn't support the settlement and said he suspects, without having seen the actual settlement, that this was due to the Zuckerberg liability question.</p><p>\"But I thought that was misguided,\" he said, adding that EPIC instead supports more wholesale limits on how Facebook handles user privacy.</p><p>Since the Cambridge Analytica debacle erupted more than a year ago and prompted the FTC investigation, Facebook has vowed to do a better job corralling its users' data. That scandal revealed that a data mining firm affiliated with President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign improperly accessed private information from as many as 87 million Facebook users through a quiz app. At issue was whether Facebook violated a 2011 settlement with the FTC over user privacy.</p><p>Other leaky controls have also since come to light. Facebook acknowledged giving big tech companies like Amazon and Yahoo extensive access to users' personal data , in effect exempting them from its usual privacy rules. And it collected call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system in 2015.</p><p>Wall Street appeared unfazed at the prospect of the fine. Facebook's shares closed at $204.87 on Friday and added 24 cents after hours. The stock is up more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year. In fact, Facebook's market value has increased by $64 billion since its April earnings report when it announced how much it was expecting to be fined.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said in a statement that the fine gives Facebook \"a Christmas present five months early. It's very disappointing that such an enormously powerful company that engaged in such serious misconduct is getting a slap on the wrist. This fine is a fraction of Facebook's annual revenue.\"</p><p>Cicilline leads the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, which is pursuing a bipartisan investigation of the big tech companies' market dominance.</p><p>The fine, however, doesn't spell the end of Facebook's troubles. The company faces a slew of other investigations, both in the U.S. and overseas, that could carry their own fines and, more importantly possible limits to its data collection. This includes nearly a dozen by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, which oversees privacy regulation in the European Union.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-87def64d3c5441d187d6ef91839d3796</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJS-PC41-DYN6-W00B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"952\"/><timeReceived>11:33 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 13, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But it will also likely saddle the company with additional restrictions and another lengthy stretch of strict scrutiny.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets reported Friday that the FTC has voted to fine Facebook for privacy violations and mishandling user data. Most of them cited an unnamed person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Facebook and the FTC declined to comment. The 3-2 vote broke along party lines, with Republicans in support and Democrats in opposition to the settlement, according to the reports.</p><p>The case now moves to the Justice Department's civil division for review. It's unclear how long the process would take, though it is likely to be approved. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the Facebook matter.</p><p>For many companies, a $5 billion fine would be crippling. But Facebook is not most companies. It had nearly $56 billion in revenue last year. This year, analysts expect around $69 billion, according to Zacks. As a one-time expense, the company will also be able to exclude the amount from its adjusted earnings results -the profit figure that investors and financial analysts pay attention to.</p><p>\"This closes a dark chapter and puts it in the rearview mirror with Cambridge Analytica,\" said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. \"Investors still had lingering worries that the fine might not be approved. Now, the Street can breathe a little easier.\"</p><p>Facebook has earmarked $3 billion for a potential fine and said in April it was anticipating having to pay up to $5 billion.</p><p>But while Wall Street - and likely Facebook executives - may be breathing a little easier, the fine alone has not appeased Facebook critics, including privacy advocates and lawmakers.</p><p>\"The reported $5 billion penalty is barely a tap on the wrist, not even a slap,\" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut. \"Such a financial punishment for a purposeful, blatant illegality is chump change for a company that makes tens of billions of dollars every year.\"</p><p>He and others questioned whether the FTC will force Facebook to make any meaningful changes to how it handles user data. This might include limits on what information it collects on people and how it targets ads to them. It's currently unclear what measures the settlement includes beyond the fine.</p><p>Privacy advocates have been calling on the FTC to come down on Facebook for a decade, but over that time the company's money, power and Washington influence has only increased.</p><p>\"Privacy regulation in the U.S. is broken. While large after-the-fact fines matter, what is much more important is strong, clear rules to protect consumers,\" said Nuala O'Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology. The CDT is pushing for federal online privacy legislation.</p><p>Some have called on the FTC to hold Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally liable for the privacy violations in some way, but based on the party line vote breakdown, experts said this is not likely.</p><p>Marc Rotenberg, president of the nonprofit online privacy advocacy group Electronic Privacy Information Center, said he was \"confused\" as to why the Democratic commissioners didn't support the settlement and said he suspects, without having seen the actual settlement, that this was due to the Zuckerberg liability question.</p><p>\"But I thought that was misguided,\" he said, adding that EPIC instead supports more wholesale limits on how Facebook handles user privacy.</p><p>Since the Cambridge Analytica debacle erupted more than a year ago and prompted the FTC investigation, Facebook has vowed to do a better job corralling its users' data. That scandal revealed that a data mining firm affiliated with President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign improperly accessed private information from as many as 87 million Facebook users through a quiz app. At issue was whether Facebook violated a 2011 settlement with the FTC over user privacy.</p><p>Other leaky controls have also since come to light. Facebook acknowledged giving big tech companies like Amazon and Yahoo extensive access to users' personal data , in effect exempting them from its usual privacy rules. And it collected call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system in 2015.</p><p>Wall Street appeared unfazed at the prospect of the fine. Facebook's shares closed at $204.87 on Friday and added 24 cents after hours. The stock is up more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year. In fact, Facebook's market value has increased by $64 billion since its April earnings report when it announced how much it was expecting to be fined.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said in a statement that the fine gives Facebook \"a Christmas present five months early. It's very disappointing that such an enormously powerful company that engaged in such serious misconduct is getting a slap on the wrist. This fine is a fraction of Facebook's annual revenue.\"</p><p>Cicilline leads the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, which is pursuing a bipartisan investigation of the big tech companies' market dominance.</p><p>The fine, however, doesn't spell the end of Facebook's troubles. The company faces a slew of other investigations, both in the U.S. and overseas, that could carry their own fines and, more importantly possible limits to its data collection. This includes nearly a dozen by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, which oversees privacy regulation in the European Union.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-87def64d3c5441d187d6ef91839d3796</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJS-P871-DYN6-W4SJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"952\"/><timeReceived>11:33 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 13, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But it will also likely saddle the company with additional restrictions and another lengthy stretch of strict scrutiny.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets reported Friday that the FTC has voted to fine Facebook for privacy violations and mishandling user data. Most of them cited an unnamed person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Facebook and the FTC declined to comment. The 3-2 vote broke along party lines, with Republicans in support and Democrats in opposition to the settlement, according to the reports.</p><p>The case now moves to the Justice Department's civil division for review. It's unclear how long the process would take, though it is likely to be approved. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the Facebook matter.</p><p>For many companies, a $5 billion fine would be crippling. But Facebook is not most companies. It had nearly $56 billion in revenue last year. This year, analysts expect around $69 billion, according to Zacks. As a one-time expense, the company will also be able to exclude the amount from its adjusted earnings results -the profit figure that investors and financial analysts pay attention to.</p><p>\"This closes a dark chapter and puts it in the rearview mirror with Cambridge Analytica,\" said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. \"Investors still had lingering worries that the fine might not be approved. Now, the Street can breathe a little easier.\"</p><p>Facebook has earmarked $3 billion for a potential fine and said in April it was anticipating having to pay up to $5 billion.</p><p>But while Wall Street - and likely Facebook executives - may be breathing a little easier, the fine alone has not appeased Facebook critics, including privacy advocates and lawmakers.</p><p>\"The reported $5 billion penalty is barely a tap on the wrist, not even a slap,\" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut. \"Such a financial punishment for a purposeful, blatant illegality is chump change for a company that makes tens of billions of dollars every year.\"</p><p>He and others questioned whether the FTC will force Facebook to make any meaningful changes to how it handles user data. This might include limits on what information it collects on people and how it targets ads to them. It's currently unclear what measures the settlement includes beyond the fine.</p><p>Privacy advocates have been calling on the FTC to come down on Facebook for a decade, but over that time the company's money, power and Washington influence has only increased.</p><p>\"Privacy regulation in the U.S. is broken. While large after-the-fact fines matter, what is much more important is strong, clear rules to protect consumers,\" said Nuala O'Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology. The CDT is pushing for federal online privacy legislation.</p><p>Some have called on the FTC to hold Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally liable for the privacy violations in some way, but based on the party line vote breakdown, experts said this is not likely.</p><p>Marc Rotenberg, president of the non-profit online privacy advocacy group Electronic Privacy Information Center, said he was \"confused\" as to why the Democratic commissioners didn't support the settlement and said he suspects, without having seen the actual settlement, that this was due to the Zuckerberg liability question.</p><p>\"But I thought that was misguided,\" he said, adding that EPIC instead supports more wholesale limits on how Facebook handles user privacy.</p><p>Since the Cambridge Analytica debacle erupted more than a year ago and prompted the FTC investigation, Facebook has vowed to do a better job corralling its users' data. That scandal revealed that a data mining firm affiliated with President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign improperly accessed private information from as many as 87 million Facebook users through a quiz app. At issue was whether Facebook violated a 2011 settlement with the FTC over user privacy.</p><p>Other leaky controls have also since come to light. Facebook acknowledged giving big tech companies like Amazon and Yahoo extensive access to users' personal data , in effect exempting them from its usual privacy rules. And it collected call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system in 2015.</p><p>Wall Street appeared unfazed at the prospect of the fine. Facebook's shares closed at $204.87 on Friday and added 24 cents after hours. The stock is up more than 50 per cent since the beginning of the year. In fact, Facebook's market value has increased by $64 billion since its April earnings report when it announced how much it was expecting to be fined.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said in a statement that the fine gives Facebook \"a Christmas present five months early. It's very disappointing that such an enormously powerful company that engaged in such serious misconduct is getting a slap on the wrist. This fine is a fraction of Facebook's annual revenue.\"</p><p>Cicilline leads the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, which is pursuing a bipartisan investigation of the big tech companies' market dominance.</p><p>The fine, however, doesn't spell the end of Facebook's troubles. The company faces a slew of other investigations, both in the U.S. and overseas, that could carry their own fines and, more importantly possible limits to its data collection. This includes nearly a dozen by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, which oversees privacy regulation in the European Union.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-87def64d3c5441d187d6ef91839d3796</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJM-4TJ1-DY9S-T30K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"952\"/><timeReceived>07:34 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 13, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The state-owned lender fell to an operating loss of \u00a38m in the third quarter compared to an operating profit of \u00a3961m a year ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The latest switching figures, which were also out yesterday, showed that RBS lost a net 10,440 current account customers in the third quarter.</p><p>Welcome to your new job, Alison Rose. And good luck!</p><p>With the bank now far more focused on its home market, and the UK facing some pretty stormy economic weather, the scale of the new chief executive's task is not to be overestimated.</p><p>Part of McKinsey's thesis was that too many banks are failing to produce a return on tangible equity above their cost of capital. What this means in plain English is that lenders are effectively taking their shareholders' money and slowly but methodically flushing it down the drain.</p><p>RBS has aspirations to achieve a return on equity of 12pc by 2020; in the third quarter it managed minus 3.8pc. Gulp.</p><p>It's not alone; McKinsey reckons that nearly 60pc of banks are not generating returns on equity. The world's banks are clearly beset with problems. The biggest of these is the persistent and - who knows? - maybe even permanent low-interest-rate environment. Banks make a big proportion of their profits from the difference between the interest rate they pay to customers and the income they can generate on those deposits. This is called the net interest margin and it gets fatter as interest rates go up.</p><p>Right now, it is pancake flat - and that makes running a bank a bit like running the 100metres in a deep-sea diving suit. Meanwhile, lenders are shelling out money hand over fist for past misdemeanours and desperately trying to patch up legacy IT systems, while young upstarts - unencumbered by these issues - snap at their heels. You can understand why the likes of McKinsey are predicting many will trip up.</p><p>'Many of the challengers to established banks are struggling to turn a profit, too' And yet, it's hard to shake off the impression that we've heard similarly dire prognoses before. For all that the banks are blundering around looking rubbish, they are still around.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at those RBS figures. The main reason the bank has swung to a loss is that it's had to cough up another \u00a3900m in provisions to pay for a last-minute influx of complaints about payment protection insurance. RBS has now stumped up \u00a36.2bn for this particular past mis-selling stupidity. NatWest Markets, the group's rump investment bank, also proved a drag with income down from \u00a3419m to \u00a3150m. But neither of these issues is close to being terminal. The PPI saga is coming to an end thanks to an August deadline for claims and no one is under the impression that investment banking will be RBS's salvation.</p><p>Those switching figures also provide a mixed picture. Yes, RBS has lost a net 10,000-odd customers, while Barclays and Lloyds Bank waved adieu to nearly 11,000 and 9,000 respectively. And, true, challenger upstarts like Monzo and Starling together gained over 20,000.</p><p>But hang on a minute, what's this? HSBC was up nearly 16,000; Nationwide gained more than 26,000; and NatWest - just another brand under the RBS umbrella - added close to 16,000 (more than offsetting its Scottish sibling's losses). You certainly can't paint a picture of the incumbent banks haemorrhaging customers to the new kids on the block from these numbers.</p><p>Many of those challengers are struggling to turn a profit, too - and the big banks are fighting back by launching their own whizzy apps.</p><p>It's a similar story in other business lines. Investment banks are losing some fees to boutique advisory firms, but it's really just a rounding error. Large companies are sticking with the big boys for business banking. New peer-to-peer lenders appear to be going bust with alarming regularity - with FundingSecure becoming the latest this week. And the threat from the big tech firms is always failing to materialise. Facebook's difficulties with getting Libra, its digital currency, off the ground is a salutary reminder that providing financial services can be harder than it looks.</p><p>Then there is the manner in which McKinsey thinks banks will meet their demise: \"To survive a downturn, merging with similar banks or selling to a stronger buyer with a complementary footprint may be the only options if reinvention is not feasible.\" M&amp;A? Really? You think that's going to fly with regulators? Let's be clear, the last financial crisis - which precipitated the worst economic downturn in a generation - only managed to kill off a handful of banks. How bad does McKinsey think the next recession will be that it does away with a third of the world's lenders? It might be a touch hypocritical for a journalist to take issue with a management consultancy for hyperbolic pessimism, but hey ho.

This is FIRST MOVE. And here's your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tariff tweets. Reports say White House may reduce levies on Chinese goods in order to get a trade deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Zero stars: Uber stocks decline following their Q3 earnings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Home Device Hacker. The study that says Alexa and Siri can be hacked with lasers.</p><p>It's Tuesday. Let's make it move.</p><p>A warm welcome once again to FIRST MOVE from a pretty chilly New York, I can tell you where the market bears though seem ready for hibernation. All three U.S. stock markets hitting fresh record highs yesterday and look at futures right now, set to add to that in this session. Why? Well, I've already mentioned it -- trade headlines.</p><p>There are reports that the White House is considering reversing tariffs on some Chinese goods in order to seal a trade deal with Beijing. December's tariffs could also be taken off the table to be fair. This is something China has been demanding all along and if the U.S. agrees to it, the big question then becomes, what does the U.S. then use perhaps as leverage to ensure the Chinese follow through on their promises? That's been the conundrum all the way along. Perhaps.</p><p>Slowing growth, however, is enough incentive for both nations at this moment. Fresh data today shows China's services sector, still in expansion mode, but growing at the weakest level in eight months. And as if cue, the Chinese Central Bank adding fresh stimulus today, this time in the form of lower rates.</p><p>They cut rates on one of their loan rates for the first time, in fact, since 2016, making it cheaper to borrow money, but it's not just China, the head of the Japanese Central Bank, also saying overnight that they could provide fresh support soon, too. The effect, of all the stimulus talk stimulation for global markets. And we're green right now across the board.</p><p>Let's get to the drivers because Christina Romans joins us on this. Interesting, Christine, to see perhaps the White House here recognizing that they've got to incentivize the Chinese here by perhaps removing the threat of further tariffs in December, perhaps even going a bit further hereto, something that the Chinese have been asking for all along.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CHIEF BUSINESS: Yes, since day one, they've been saying we don't think that tariffs are the right way to have this conversation, and the President has called himself tariff man and has put on round after round of tariffs. It will be fascinating to see if the President reverses course on that strategy and starts to take them off.</p><p>Of course, December 15th is the big, big date. That is the time when a bunch of consumer goods are going to be taxed in the U.S. Something that Mark Zandi said will be like a big tax increase for Americans next year to the tune of $100 billion. But that December deadline, the feeling is on both sides that if you can get some kind of a mini deal here, then the December deadline, those tariffs go away.</p><p>They were already October 15, a bunch of tariffs that were cancelled. So this was a sign of goodwill to try to get this mini deal started. And there are these tariffs that went into effect September 1st, and what I'm hearing this morning is the Chinese would like the Americans to take those off right away, to reverse those tariffs as well.</p><p>So that would be the President really stepping back from that tariff man moniker to get this mini deal in the hopes that there's a bigger deal for thornier issues sometime next year.</p><p>But I'll tell you what the feeling is in the trade world right now, it is that both sides are feeling the effects of the trade war. Both sides want a mini deal and right now, they are just haggling over what kind of tariffs to take off and what kind of intellectual property protections to put in.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Oh, so many good points there, Christine, to the point you and I have discussed so many times here, it is U.S. companies that pay these tariffs.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So as much as it hurts demand over on the Chinese side, it is U.S. companies that would arguably benefit from not having to deal with this heading into the Christmas season, but you do keep calling it a mini deal. And the thorny issues remain untackled at this stage as far as we know. Intellectual property -- all the critical elements ultimately do need tackling, and we agree on that point.</p><p>ROMANS: There's still this tech Cold War as well. Right? I mean, the President has also used some of these concerns about National Security in tech land as another kind of tool in this process. We'll have to see if any of that is incorporated into any of this.</p><p>But I do think it is fascinating here that the President who has used tariffs so consistently that the White House is at least thinking about the tariff regime and whether to take something off.</p><p>There's also a feeling that maybe aides on both sides have decided that it's time to pause this thing and pull some of these tariffs off, but the President ultimately decides not to or he does and he tries to rebrand this mini deal as something bigger than it really is.</p><p>At any rate, Wall Street and companies would like to see those tariffs reverse for sure.</p><p>[09:05:19]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: No. He'd never do something like that, Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: He is a masterful brander. He is.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Christine Romans, thank you so much for that. Next driver, another profit pothole for ride hailing app Uber.</p><p>Uber shares are set to drop some seven percent in early trading this morning after the firm reported a more than $1 billion worth of losses for their Q3 earnings report.</p><p>Uber says it's finally on the road to profitability though, Clare Sebastian has been treading that road and looking through these numbers, 2021, I'll tell you what? A lot can happen in 18 months for this company, Clare, you've got to get under the bonnet here and look at the numbers. It's not so sparkly.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: It's a little giddy, Julia and I certainly think you can see that doubt translated in the premarket movement in the stock there. And I wonder exactly what the CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi said about that path to profitability.</p><p>He actually said, \"Our current target with a ton of hard work from all of our teams is to get the total company EBITDA profitability for the full year 2021.\" So it's hardly definitive.</p><p>But there was some good news from this report, even though they made a loss of $1.16 billion. Revenue growth did accelerate 30 percent, and if you look at the segments, Julia, the rides businesses, that revenue growth increased at 19 percent.</p><p>But where we really see faster growth in Eats and in the freight business as well. Having said that though, those businesses are the ones that are proving a drag on earnings. Rides, which is 75 percent of revenue for the company that actually showed a bit more strength in this quarter. They even crossed a billion dollars in gross weekly bookings, but Uber Eats saw it loss widen to more than 300 million. Uber Freight made a loss of $81 million on an adjusted basis.</p><p>So these are the parts of the business that are now in investment phase and are really kind of dragging down those earnings. But if you talk to analysts, they do say they see that that 2021 target could be credible. So some people are pretty bullish on that stock.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's interesting. It's interesting to hear Dara talking about capital discipline, spending discipline on the call when some of the early investors are saying he lacks the visionary sense, actually, that Uber needs at this moment. So I see a bit of a dichotomy there.</p><p>But even in the short term, Clare, one of the challenges that investors have to overcome is the fact that multiple more shares are going to be coming available and will be on the market tomorrow as the lockup period ends. And what does that mean, do we think for the share price here?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: This could mean some serious volatility, Julia. They were asked about this on the call and the CFO Nelson Chai, he said, we don't actually know what's going to happen. They have apparently been talking to some of the biggest shareholders about this, but they still couldn't provide any clarity on what that could mean.</p><p>Of course, we've seen a bit of trouble for the stock since the IPO. It is still down about 30 percent even before it opens today on that potential seven percent last beyond that, it could be a record low.</p><p>But in terms of the fundamentals, there are some positive signs from this earnings report, so perhaps that will play in to a little bit more stability in the stock.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it might be a good buying opportunity. Who knows? Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that.</p><p>Next driver, OPEC says don't count oil out just yet despite broad calls for more renewable energy; burning oil, it seems is here to stay. That's according to the World Oil Outlook just released by the organization of oil exporting nations.</p><p>John Defterios is at the OPEC headquarters in Vienna. John, that was the longer term. In the shorter term, there are some pretty big challenges. U.S. shale output continues to surprise them. They recognize they need to cut capacity here that's uncomfortable at a time when they're already trying to restrict output to keep prices up. Ouchies.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Yeah, I think it's good to have a healthy debate between the two of us that's not about the oil price today or whether OPEC cuts at the December meeting right, Julia? It's nice to take a zoom out and look at the issue.</p><p>You are a hundred percent correct between now and 2025, the shale patch continues to expand if you will, U.S. overall production 12 million barrels a day, number one. Of that 12, eight is with the shale patch.</p><p>Get this number for 2025 according to OPEC, there is going to be 20 million barrels a day of production for the United States. But they think there's going to be a fade after that because of the high cost of production vis-a- vis the fittest producers within OPEC themselves -- Saudi Arabia with Saudi Aramco, the UAE with ADNOC, Kuwait Petroleum in Kuwait, of course. They're the low cost producers at $2.00 to $4.00 a barrel.</p><p>The other thing that stood out for me in this report is that the market share for oil and gas doesn't collapse during the energy transition. They're saying by 2040, it'll hold steady around 53 percent and I couldn't leave out the topic of the IPO of Saudi Aramco and how it influences this organization, OPEC in the future and the OPEC Plus Agreement. Here's the Secretary General of OPEC.</p><p>[09:10:14]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MOHAMMED BARKINDO, SECRETARY GENERAL, OPEC: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has reiterated times without number its continued commitment, not only to OPEC, but in providing the leadership to this organization. And we have also heard from the highest levels of government in the Kingdom that the IPO will not in any way impact on their membership or the leadership role that they provide within OPEC.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: The World Oil Outlook that you put out here still shows market share for oil and gas by 2040 at 53 percent, just dropping one percent. What makes you believe in an energy transition you can hold on to that level of market share?</p><p>BARKINDO: These are the facts. These are the hard data that go into these projections. And we are not alone in these projections. If you look at the IAEA in Paris or the EIA in Washington, and other reputable institutions, oil and gas will continue to dominate the energy mix to 2040.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: In this scenario, at the end of the day, you're suggesting, though that OPEC goes total liquids with crude production from 36 million barrels a day now to 44 million barrels a day by 2040.</p><p>It's not the shale producers that went out, but the OPEC producers who have a lower base?</p><p>BARKINDO: OPEC will continue to serve as the base load for global energy requirements. The shale producers, and particularly in the United States have done extremely well in the last several years to revolutionize this industry, and we are beginning to see a deceleration as we go into the medium term.</p><p>I think it's a growing consensus that going beyond the medium term, the world will revert back to the conventional oil. The producers mainly in OPEC who account for over 80 percent of global proven reserves.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: The fittest survive, Julia. That's the detail here of the OPEC oil outlook report with market share for OPEC going to 44 million barrels a day by 2040.</p><p>As you said, they've been cutting the crude alone, below 30 to accommodate for shale, so this could turn in the next 10 years.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, absolutely. And in the short term, they've got the December meeting to worry about, too. So keeping busy. John Defterios from OPEC in Vienna there. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right. Let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories making headlines around the world. We've reached the public phase of the Impeachment Inquiry with transcripts now being released from the closed- door interviews with former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and State Department adviser, Michael McKinley.</p><p>Phil Mattingly is in D.C. and joins us now. Phil, great to have you with us. The other one that I'm watching for here is the transcript from Gordon Sondland, of course, the U.S. Ambassador to the E.U.</p><p>For our international audience here, what do we have to watch for in these transcripts? What's going to move the dial here?</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN U.S. CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia, I think what's interesting, so you can kind of separate yesterday's transcription from the ones were expecting today.</p><p>Yesterday's transcripts were kind of an intimate inside look on kind of a shadow Ukraine policy. The almost surreal word for word account of watching a U.S. Ambassador to the Ukraine have her legs cut out from underneath her because entities aligned with the current President didn't like how she was operating in Ukraine.</p><p>Today is going to be different. Today is less about how that occurred, and more about the allegations at the center of the impeachment probe, these quote-unquote \"quid pro quo\" whether or not the administration deliberately withheld nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine in order to try and get political favors and why these two depositions matter.</p><p>Kurt Volker, the former Special Representative to Ukraine, Gordon Sondland, the Ambassador to the E.U. -- it was these two individuals who were intimately involved in these discussions both on the irregular channel as Bill Taylor, the Ambassador called it and on the official channel as well.</p><p>You mentioned Gordon Sondland. Here is why he is so important and why this deposition, the hours' long deposition, and the transcripts that's going to come out is of such interest to really both parties.</p><p>Sondland was in the middle of everything. He was texting with people -- Kurt Volker, Bill Taylor -- about the idea of withholding aid. He was talking directly to the President about this idea as well. What he -- how he recounts what occurred is going to be very interesting as people try and piece together everything we've heard in bits and pieces out of these close-door depositions in the last couple of weeks.</p><p>Here is also why it matters. Both Republicans and Democrats have said since they've come out of the room in those closed door depositions that they believe Sondland either wasn't entirely truthful in his testimony or had a series of misstatements. That based on witnesses that came and testified after the fact, after Sondland testified where they were very clear contradictions, where they were very clear areas where Sondland either didn't remember something or remembered it very different than multiple people who testified in the wake of that.</p><p>[09:15:15]</p><p>MATTINGLY: Why that matters is this. Due to Sondland's kind of central role in everything that we've seen over the last couple of weeks and the idea that perhaps he misspoke, or perhaps he didn't -- he wasn't entirely truthful about his recollections, there's a very real chance Democrats try and call him back and not just call him back in a closed door deposition, but call him back in a public forum.</p><p>So that's why everybody is going to be reading this very closely. I also think it matters because, Julia, there's been a lot of back and forth between Republicans and Democrats about the process. Frustrations from Republicans that this has been closed door. It's now firmly moving into the open phase.</p><p>When you get these transcripts, you can read the questions and the strategies Republicans have for these witnesses. You get insight into how they're attempting to defend the President, why they think there are problems with specific things. All that is stuff we have not gotten because this has been closed door, now we're getting a view into that. I think that's going to be a great entree into what we're going to see in those public hearings when they occur in the weeks ahead.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, that is such a great point. The approach here, the defense effectively from the Republican side. Great point there. Phil Mattingly, great to have you with us. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>Let's move on. Turkey has captured the sister of Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi, a senior Turkish official has told CNN. She was detained with her husband, daughter-in-law and five children in the northern Syrian City of Azaz. Turkey called the arrest and intelligence gold mine.</p><p>Authorities in India are trying to protect one of the wonders of the world from hazardous smog.

I speak to the company's cofounder about the changing world of work.</p><p>And dazzling Alexa, the hack attack that uses lasers to hijack your smart speakers. All the details coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:20:21]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE live from the New York Stock Exchange this Tuesday morning. U.S. stocks on track to rise to fresh records in early trading this morning.</p><p>New trade headlines fueling gains across global markets as you could see, a sea of green there. European stocks hitting 21-month highs in fact.</p><p>Reports say the United States make cut tariffs, removing tariffs perhaps to seal a deal, a Phase 1 trade deal with China. China also joining the rate cutting party, too, as we mentioned earlier on the show, trimming one of its lending rates for the first time in three years in fact.</p><p>Let's just take a look at the S&amp;P up-to-date, year-to-date. We're up some 22 percent on track, in fact, for its best performance since 2013. That should keep your eyes closed as far as December was concerned of last year, if you remember, because that was incredibly painful, but we're still trailing many global markets year-to-date.</p><p>Let's explore this. Lisa Shalett joins me now. She is Chief Investment Officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Great to have you on the show, and we're color coordinated. We like that today.</p><p>LISA SHALETT, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, MORGAN STANLEY WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Hi, Julia. Good morning.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Markets clearly feeling happier about phase one trade deal what we're seeing right now, you're saying, hang on a second, guys. Let's look at earnings and earnings expectations as we push out, and then we come to a bit of a sticky stopping point. Talk us through it.</p><p>SHALETT: Yes, sure. So, you know, I think one of the first things that we try to remind everybody about, there's been a lot of enthusiasm about beat rates and the numbers --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: As always.</p><p>SHALETT: The numbers in the third quarter and the earnings that were reported are so much better. But what we remind people about is that coming into the third quarter, profit estimates were really cut pretty severely. And in fact, we're going to be down -- forecast would be down about six or seven percent versus a year ago.</p><p>Where we've ended up is probably down about two or three percent, and that's the big expectation.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Good management expectations.</p><p>SHALETT: Yes, exactly. So that's the big surprise, but we're focusing on reminding people, those earnings are still negative.</p><p>Now, the implication of that is in a world where the stock markets are roaring to all-time new highs, what it really means is that price earnings ratio or the valuation, right, how much price we're putting on that earnings, price is really driving all of the gains that we've seen because earnings themselves are flat.</p><p>And so that suggests to us that markets are starting to get pricey. The price earnings ratio right now is about 18.7 times forward expectations are what we're expecting for 2020. That's really at the high end of the range of what is normal, which is closer to 15 to 16 times.</p><p>So we think that this is a market right now that's running a little bit on enthusiasm and sentiment, and maybe getting ahead of the actual profits.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, others could look at this and say, but some of that's driven by -- we've got 60 percent now of the world stimulating to some degree, that's fueling a degree of enthusiasm. And I guess the other pushback would be look, in a battle of the uglies, the United States still wins. Your point is hang on a second, you need to look a bit broader than just the United States.</p><p>SHALETT: Exactly. So really, the U.S. has meaningfully outperformed almost all other regional markets for 10 years. And so if the wager that people want to make is in fact that all central banks have engineered a global soft landing, and we're going to enter a new phase of the cycle, our view has been okay, then invest in those markets that are, you know, much cheaper, that have much more leverage to this pickup.</p><p>And so we've said that's going to include rest of world markets, like emerging markets, like Europe, like Japan. You know, other sectors within that small caps, financials, industrials, have been kind of left behind and they really have leverage to a true pickup and growth.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: To what extent do we need to see a China trade deal, even if it's just Phase 1 or even a stabilization in some of the Chinese data? Because there's real cautiousness around that, particularly when you're talking about perhaps investing in emerging markets and particularly Asian markets I'm talking about now, admittedly, they've been pretty beaten up.</p><p>SHALETT: They have been in and I think that's an area where we would absolutely agree with you. China has become central to the global trade story. They are the world's largest trading partner with virtually every country and so stabilization in China and the rate cuts that they're doing, the fiscal stimulus that they've been doing for the past year are really important factors that should -- you know, we believe lead to a rebound and global growth.</p><p>[09:25:13]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But as far as you're concerned, and I was asking this on the show yesterday, a Santa Claus rally here in the United States, your message is, guys, you've kind of had it, the stockings full. Take some chips off the table.</p><p>SHALETT: We are definitely in that camp because we think, again, so much optimism is now priced in. We think that the market is pricing not only, you know, that the Fed remains accommodative. And we're like, look, we think they're on pause.</p><p>And all of this is, you know, all the low rates have been discounted, and we're not really sure the Fed is going to be able to do a lot more and they've kind of signaled that and it's very important, I believe, for their independence, that they're going to -- it's going to take a very high bar for them to act in an election year. That's something to consider.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How interesting to look politically independent, they are going to have to sit on their hands here.</p><p>SHALETT: I think so.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And actually that gets more likely if we see a Phase 1 trade deal because of the need for further stimulus is lessened.</p><p>SHALETT: That's exactly right. Yes. Exactly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. It's going to be interesting to watch.</p><p>SHALETT: It will be.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Look outside the United States.</p><p>SHALETT: Absolutely.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That's the bottom line message, there is opportunity.</p><p>SHALETT: Absolutely.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Lisa Shalett, great to have you on the show. Thank you so much.</p><p>SHALETT: Thank you, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Chief Investment Officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Well, I'll give you a quick look because we had stores the market open this morning. We are seeing green across the board right now. Fresh record highs. You heard it here, guys. You've had the juice and the excitement this year. You've got to look somewhere else. Plenty more to come on the show. Stay with us. You're watching FIRST MOVE.</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE live from the New York Stock Exchange and the opening bell this morning. What can I tell you? Well, the bulls are on the loose here once again on Wall Street and a duck, I think some college basketball mascots there. All the major averages hitting fresh record highs out of the starting gate this morning after rising to record levels on Monday, too. Just two tenths of a percent. So we'll see how this session shapes up, but we have got trade optimism that's driving broader sentiment.</p><p>Reports suggest we may see lower tariffs or at least the threat of December tariffs removed in order for the U.S. and China to strike a Phase 1 trade deal here.</p><p>Bond yields also on the rise globally, as sentiment improves hereto. We've got the U.S. 10-year yield currently above 1.8 percent. The German 10-year yield actually, at four-month highs. French 10-year are also closing -- close to clawing their way out of negative territory. We might be able to show you that in just a moment. But it fits with the conversation we were just having with Lisa Shalett there, seeing improving sentiment for stocks and seeing bond yields higher over in Europe in particular.</p><p>All right, let's take a look at our Global Movers this morning. Uber is under some pressure after reporting their Q3 earnings, right now down some seven percent. The ride-hailing app posting a smaller loss than expected, but it was still more than a billion dollars. Uber says it has a roadmap to profitability in 2021. The problem is that road could be full of potholes.</p><p>Shake Shack also under pressure this morning down over 17 percent. The burger chain saying that stores sales growth disappointed. Also bear in mind, shares are up 89 percent year-to-date, so you can see a bit of steam losing without losing that monster gains this year.</p><p>Tapestry is higher by some 1.7 percent. The owner of Kate Spade and Coach brands reported earnings that big estimates but we did see a week of performance at Kate Spade, which dented overall sales, right now higher by some 1.7 percent.</p><p>All right back in 2013, the former N.S.A. contractor Edward Snowden unveiled a global U.S. surveillance program. Well now, he is warning that Google, Facebook and Amazon are complicit in government spying. He accused big tech of a Faustian bargain to exploit and pass on personal data. He was speaking at the Lisbon Web Summit.</p><p>Hadas Gold is there. That's an interesting guest, Hadas, to open up the Lisbon Web Summit and a warning here once again, to us as users of social media that our data is up for grabs here and we're not protecting it well enough.</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, Julia. It is definitely a different -- interesting way to launch what is the largest tech conference in Europe with Edward Snowden. He appeared via video link from somewhere in Russia and he warned that despite people -- despite the fact that people are catching on to what he warned about in those leaks from 2013, that people are getting mad at the right people, but for the wrong reasons.</p><p>He actually also criticized some of the efforts here in Europe, like GDPR and says it's not about data protection, it is actually about how data is collected. Take a listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDWARD SNOWDEN, FORMER N.S.A. CONTRACTOR: ... stake that it makes is actually in the name, the General Data Protection Regulation misplaces the problem. The problem isn't data protection, the problem is data collection.</p><p>Regulating the protection of data presumes that the collection of data in the first place was proper, that it was appropriate, that it doesn't represent a threat or a danger, that it's okay to spy on everybody all the time, whether they're your customers or whether they're your citizens, so long as it never leaks, so long as only you are in control of what it is that you've sort of stolen from everybody. And I would say --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOLD: And Julia, what's really interesting is that he said, he pretty much -- he feels as though you cannot trust anybody in the system, and that we have to redesign the entire area of connectivity.</p><p>Of course, the way we regulate tech, the way we hold these internet companies accountable is a big theme here at Web Summit. And it's an interesting conference that it brings together both people from the tech side and from the regulator side, and I will actually be posing a lot of those questions tomorrow on the stage behind me with former Prime Minister Tony Blair, and Congressman Ro Khanna as we approach some really important elections coming up where tech is, of course, playing a big part -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, my favorite quote from him, \"The most powerful institutions of society have become the least accountable to society.\" And you and I, Hadas have discussed enough. It's not about regulation. It's about us protecting our own data and being more conscious of what we're giving up. Hadas Gold, thank you so much for that. We look forward to more from the Web Summit.</p><p>[09:40:14]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, let's move on. Networking site, LinkedIn has a new product. It's called Open for Business and it aims to connect freelancers and small businesses with clients, and it launched Monday over in Dubai.</p><p>Allen Blue, co-founder and VP of Product Strategy at LinkedIn joins us from there. Allen, fantastic to have you with us. Just start by explaining what Open for Business aims to do.</p><p>ALLEN BLUE, CO-FOUNDER AND VP OF PRODUCT STRATEGY, LINKEDIN: Open for Business provides a few key features for small businesses and for freelancers, allowing them to represent their small businesses on LinkedIn and do what is most important for small business and that's find new clients, grow their clients.</p><p>It also helps individuals who are using LinkedIn to find those people more easily.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, because most businesses, like small and medium sized enterprises, it's word of mouth that helps drive their business ultimately. So any way that you can facilitate that or digitize that helps them.</p><p>Why Dubai? I just spent a couple of weeks there talking to startups and small businesses and talking about the opportunities there. Why did you choose to launch in Dubai?</p><p>BLUE: Well, we did the same thing as a matter of fact. So last year, we came to Dubai, it was one of the places in the world that we chose to come talk to entrepreneurs and freelancers about what they needed, and how to make word of mouth work for them on LinkedIn.</p><p>So when it came time to do our worldwide launch, Dubai was one of the places we looked at and decided we wanted to do it here because the entire region is so supportive and focused on the growth of small and medium enterprises. It just seemed like the right fit.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You mean, from a government perspective?</p><p>BLUE: I mean, from a government perspective, and I also mean from -- look, I guess, I would just say that the entire region is growing and changing very quickly. Some of that is driven by very large companies, but a lot of it is driven by small and medium sized businesses.</p><p>I've had an opportunity while I've been here to speak to young entrepreneurs and youth are really driving the future of the MENA region, and many of them want to set off on their own, create their own businesses and set up the next future.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I discovered the same. It's a fascinating time to be there. One of the beauties of LinkedIn is how much data you collect. You have an economic graph of what some 600 million users plus which gives you a sense of what's going on, what shifts, what patterns are taking place around the world.</p><p>And one of the things that I like talking about on this show is the skills gap and the evolution of the skills gap. What is your data telling you at this moment?</p><p>BLUE: Well, it's telling us a few things for sure. So the first is that there's actually more than one skills gap. Skill gaps are regional, and they're very specific to the local economies.</p><p>So we know for instance, that in some places, the skill gaps are abroad and technology skills are the most in demand. But if we look at a lot of other places, we actually are looking at soft skills, the things which make it possible for people to do all kinds of work.</p><p>The second thing is we see brand new roles emerging around the world to take the place of roles which are in decline. So whether it's blockchain or whether it's new frontiers of artificial intelligence and machine learning, there are brands and new roles which didn't even exist three or four years ago, which are now some of the fastest growing jobs in the world.</p><p>And I guess, in this case of artificial intelligence, we also know that artificial intelligence is such a new field, but it's one where we really need to think about the diversity of the people who work in that field.</p><p>I mean, artificial intelligence is all around us. But the people who do artificial intelligence are largely, for instance, men. So one of the things when we were measuring gender gaps in our data, we were looking for ways to bring a broader and more diverse group of engineers to come work on these products which have become part of our daily lives.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You see, this is fascinating. As far as artificial intelligence is concerned, it's one of the big fears that actually exacerbate the gaps like gender gaps. I've got another question and it ties to what you were just saying there about, actually given the speed at which innovation is taking place and technological changes taking place. It is soft skills that people need, it is leadership, it is flexibility and oral communication.</p><p>[09:40:10]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is that the case particularly when we look at areas where technology is moving quickest, actually, the risk here is if we don't adopt these kinds of skills, the skills gap will accelerate.</p><p>BLUE: So, the skills gap absolutely is typified by gaps around what we normally call soft skills. So as you say, oral communication and the ability to work with other people to collaborate, to make analytic decisions. These things are important for almost every kind of business.</p><p>And we find that if you have a good grounding in soft skills, one of the things you can do is you can take on new technical skills very easily.</p><p>So in many ways, if you can keep a way to future proof your career, then thinking about soft skills and thinking about curiosity and the ability to learn new things is going to serve you very well in the coming years.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's such a great point. Soft skills facilitate technical skill adoption. Allen Blue, cofounder of LinkedIn, great to have you with us and we look forward to chatting again.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break here on the FIRST MOVE, but coming up, finding people in crowded places or remote locations is never all that easy.</p><p>After the break that company that's mapping the world three-words at a time. Stay with FIRST MOVE.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to the show. We're all used to typing in addresses to find locations, but they're not a foolproof way of getting anywhere. Here's the problem, street addresses often aren't unique. They can be useless at large locations, too.</p><p>Let's say you're trying to find the good entrance turns to a sports stadium for example, and while the zip code or postcode format varies around the world, much of the planet is actually without an address.</p><p>[09:45:10]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What3Words has covered the globe with a grid of small squares? Each square is they're named with three random words so it's easy to remember the GPS coordinates for example. So to give you an example, the Empire State Building is heaves, wipes, clay; and the Statue of Liberty, well, that's planet, inches, most. Get the idea?</p><p>The CEO of What3Words, Chris Sheldrick says it's all about keeping things simple.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRIS SHELDRICK, CEO, WHAT3WORDS: So we definitely want What3Words to be a global standard. So wherever you are in the world, you see the three-words and you just know exactly where you can use them and what to do.</p><p>In fact, the first country we got to adopt it was Mongolia. I went there, they've got a huge problem, huge country, not many addresses. And so the Mongolian Postal Service was the first government department in the world to actually accept it.</p><p>You can write a letter to Mongolia, you can just put the three-words and it will get to where you want it to go. And since then, as you say, \"Lonely Planet\" have now put it throughout to have their guidebooks where they really struggle to tell people where the things are. You just have the three-words written down in the guidebook.</p><p>Even Mercedes Benz have now adopted it. So you get into any new Mercedes, you just speak the three-words, and it's going to navigate you with the in- car nav to that three meter square, which is totally awesome.</p><p>I think we're now seeing like e-commerce sites on the checkout page, you can just add your three-words if you're one of those people who lives in the middle of nowhere, like I do, the delivery drivers get lost, well, now you can start to add your three-words.</p><p>So just so many ways around the world and just places that don't have very good address systems outside of the kind of towns and cities in the West. Actually, most of the world has a really bad experience with addresses.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What3Words is finding a home in places like emerging markets, which struggle with old fashioned street addresses, in particular India and China, where growth is also being driven right now by the needs of the gig economy. Chris Sheldrick says profitability will then come from big companies using the system and adopting it in those regions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHELDRICK: So for consumers, the app is totally free. You can just download What3Words. You can find out what the three-words that we've named the front door of your house are, your front door has got three- words, your back door has got three-words, totally fixed, and you can't change them.</p><p>When we work with businesses, then we charge them to use the service just like they pay for addresses today. So if you're using a ride hailing app, and you put in a street address that ride-hailing app will pay for that service to understand where that location is. Similarly, they pay us.</p><p>So Mercedes Benz now pay us a license fee to have What3Words in their cars and that's exactly how we do it. But for consumers, it is totally free to use the What3Words through app or the website anywhere in the world.</p><p>Beyond Mercedes Benz, we've actually just signed Tata Motors, which is India's biggest car company. All of them are trying to have a navigation system and a voice interaction system that just works.</p><p>So many people are just annoyed with their cars voice system and just say it doesn't work. So they stick their smartphone on the windscreen.</p><p>So all of the car companies in the world are now trying to change that. So we've actually got about three or four more announcements coming up very soon about other cars where you'll be able to put the three-words in, and then it just sort of escalates into what you just expect that your car will support What3Words.</p><p>We want to expect that your e-commerce checkout page will have a box there, to put in your three-words. We want more guidebooks, more governments like Mongolia, even the U.N. have put it into one of their disaster recovery apps because in so many places when you've got an international disaster, addresses just sort of disappear if you've got floods and all sorts of things.</p><p>So I think that's it. It's just really powerful if we can get everybody to become What3Words enabled if you like.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: They are also raising money. The company tells me Sony, Intel, Daimler and Deutsche Bahn are all board as global brands investing in three-word addresses.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHELDRICK: All of these companies believe in our vision, but this is not a small feature that we're adding. We are saying the What3Words and three- word addresses will become a global standard, and all of these companies we talked to about that vision, and they work out how they can help us.</p><p>So for example, Sony just launched a taxi service in Japan called S.Ride. They put What3Words straight into that, so it's the first Japanese taxi company to support three-word addresses.</p><p>All of them are trying to help us get there. But they know that this doesn't happen overnight. They know that we're going to be a couple of years away from getting this ubiquitous. They want to help us transition so we can be in all of the voice assistance.</p><p>We can be part of drone software, and all of these trends which are kind of just about coming and getting there. They're going to support us through that.</p><p>[09:50:00]</p><p>SHELDRICK: So we're really lucky with the investors that we have.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Talk to me about profitability. Are you profitable as a company?</p><p>SHELDRICK: So we're still growing. So, profitability will come very soon. We are active in about 10 countries at the moment. So, lots to do, and the licenses are starting to come. So all of the car companies coming shortly, the e-commerce vendors who are now paying and signing up, I think we're going on a pretty good trajectory to really build a very sustainable solid business very shortly.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Also some Emergency Services are using it as well to help locate distressed people and it's free to consumers as well, an interesting one to watch. What3Words.</p><p>All right coming up after the break. Home assistants are back in the spotlight, we shine a light on how to hack, Alexa, literally. Stay with us. We're back in two.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to the show with a look at today's \"Boardroom Brief.\" Shares in Rakuten closed higher despite the fact that the fact that the Japanese e-commerce firm says it expected to take a loss of almost $915 million dollars on its investment in the American rideshare company, Lyft this quarter.</p><p>Rakuten is Lyft's biggest shareholder in fact and Lyft shares are down 40 percent since its March IPO.</p><p>Adidas is partnering with the International Space Station to test products in space. The company has delivered footballs to the ISS to test how they behave in microgravity conditions. Conditions in which people or objects appear to be weightless. Adidas says the results could help it develop new products.</p><p>Austin Powers' nemesis, Dr. Evil would be proud of this one. Researchers have hacked Amazon's Alexa Google's home and Siri's voice assistance by laser. Dr. Evil explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. EVIL, FICTIONAL CHARACTER, AUSTIN POWERS MOVIE: In essence a sophisticated heat beam which we call a laser.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Makes perfect sense to me. It seems the laser can be flashed into the device in order to take control, I couldn't help myself. Anna Stewart, explain because I have to say I'm still a little bit confused here. How does it work?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Dr. Evil doesn't explain it all, does he? Well, here the research suggests that if you point a laser beam at a the microphone or have a voice activated smart gadget in someone's home, this is up to 110 meters away, by the way, it can be fooled into thinking it's a voice command at the specific frequencies.</p><p>It moves the diaphragm, find the microphone and that sends all the electrical signals to the device. And this is fun if you're thinking about neighborhood pranks, you could mess with someone's music in their home. You could change their thermostat.</p><p>More worrying if you think about the potential though for malicious hacks given voice activated gadgets can open up a garage. They can unlock a car, you can go shopping on Amazon.</p><p>So we have been reaching out to all the big tech giants, yet another problem for them. Google says they're reviewing the research. No comment yet from Apple or Amazon -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I'm sure they've seriously tried to work out what exactly is going on here and ultimately what the fix is, but I guess in the interim, the moral of the story is keep your home devices away from windows because I mean the laser have to actually get into them and be in the right position in order to be able to get to the little microphones. Agree?</p><p>[09:55:21]</p><p>STEWART: Yes, it's not the easiest way. I mean, this is not an easy security issue for people to get around really. First, you need direct line of sight as you said, a smart gadget through a window. Yes, you need to be able to see it, so just put it out the way.</p><p>Also, you've got to think about the fact that some gadgets do require extra authentication for instance, your iPhone, you need to put in a code, a touch ID, facial ID. You need a gadget that doesn't require all of that.</p><p>And thirdly, you know what? The equipment that would be required to do this would set you back about $400.00, a laser pointer, a laser driver, and a sound amplifier. Simple option. Just keep it out of sight. You can prevent Dr. Evil from hacking you, very simply.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you've got to really want to open some of this garage or something in order to get involved in this.

According to that report, China's ByteDance is said to have possibly agreed in some way to divest in TikTok's U.S. operations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As Axios points out, Microsoft was not one of the Big Tech companies that testified earlier in this week before Congress regarding antitrust. This could give the company more of acquisition ability over others in Big Tech, like Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple, the CEOs of which testified Wednesday before the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p> TikTok General Manager Vanessa Pappas said in a video shared Saturday on Twitter that the company would be bringing 10,000 jobs to the U.S. over the next three years. In the video she says, \"we're not planning on going anywhere.\"</p><p> According to her LinkedIn page, Pappas previously held a position as Strategic Advisor for ByteDance.</p><p> A message to the TikTok community. pic.twitter.com/UD3TR2HfEf</p><p> \u2014 TikTok (@tiktok_us) August 1, 2020</p><p> TikTok has said it has tens of millions of U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally.</p><p> But, its Chinese ownership has raised concerns about censorship of videos and the potential for sharing user data with the Chinese government.</p><p>Microsoft is in advanced talks to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok, according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke to AP only on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity to the negotiations.</p><p> The potential deal would be a victory for both companies, making Microsoft Corp. a major player in the social media arena and providing relief to TikTok and its parent company, Bytedance Ltd., a target of the president.</p><p> Trump said Friday that he would take action as soon as Saturday to ban TikTok in the United States. Trump's comments on Friday aboard Air Force One came after published reports that the administration is planning to order China's ByteDance to sell TikTok.</p><p> \"As far as TikTok is concerned, we're banning them from the United States,\" Trump told reporters Friday on Air Force One as he returned from Florida.</p><p> Trump said he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order to enforce the action, insisting, \"I have that authority.\" He added, \"It's going to be signed tomorrow.\"</p><p>Microsoft declined to comment.</p><p> Reports by Bloomberg News and The Wall Street Journal citing anonymous sources said the administration could soon announce a decision ordering ByteDance to divest its ownership in TikTok.</p><p> There have been reports of U.S. tech giants and financial firms being interested in buying or investing in TikTok as the Trump administration sets its sights on the app. The New York Times and Fox Business, citing an unidentified source, first reported Friday that Microsoft is in talks to buy TikTok.</p><p> TikTok issued a statement Friday saying that, \"While we do not comment on rumors or speculation, we are confident in the long-term success of TikTok.\"</p><p>ByteDance launched TikTok in 2017, then bought Musical.ly, a video service popular with teens in the U.S. and Europe, and combined the two. A twin service, Douyin, is available for Chinese users.</p><p> TikTok's fun, goofy videos and ease of use has made it immensely popular, and U.S. tech giants like Facebook and Snapchat see it as a competitive threat.</p><p> TikTok maintains it doesn't censor videos based on topics sensitive to China and it would not give the Chinese government access to U.S. user data even if asked. The company has hired a U.S. CEO, a former top Disney executive, in an attempt to distance itself from its Chinese ownership.</p><p> U.S. national-security officials have been reviewing the Musical.ly acquisition in recent months, while U.S. armed forces have banned their employees from installing TikTok on government-issued phones. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this month that the U.S. was considering banning TikTok.</p><p> These national-security worries parallel a broader U.S. security crackdown on Chinese companies, including telecom providers Huawei and ZTE. The Trump administration has ordered that the U.S. stop funding equipment from those providers in U.S. networks. It has also tried to steer allies away from Huawei because of worries about the Chinese government's access to data, which the company has denied it has.</p><p> The Trump administration has stepped in before to block or dissolve deals on national-security concerns, including stopping Singapore's Broadcom from its $117 billion bid for U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm in 2018 in an effort to help retain U.S. leadership in the telecom space. It also told China's Beijing Kunlun Tech Co. to sell off its 2016 purchase of gay dating app Grindr.</p><p> Other countries are also taking action against TikTok. India this month banned dozens of Chinese apps, including TikTok, citing privacy concerns, amid tensions between the countries.</p><p> The U.S. government's poor track record in bolstering Americans' data privacy more broadly lessens its credibility in taking on Chinese-owned companies, according to Susan Ariel Aaronson, a professor at George Washington University and a data governance and national-security expert. The federal government has not passed broad privacy or data-security legislation despite efforts to do so last year, and the Justice Department has tried to undermine encryption - which makes sure only a sender and receiver can see content they exchange - for law-enforcement reasons. Tech companies have pushed back against that.</p><p> \"I continue to be wary of forcing a sale of TikTok without data protection laws they could try to follow,\" Alex Stamos, the former chief security officer at Facebook who now studies internet security at Stanford University, tweeted on Friday. He added that Microsoft \"has one of the best child safety teams, which is a larger risk on TikTok right now.\"</p><p>Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, is the No. 4 digital ad company in the U.S., after Google, Facebook and Amazon. Still, buying TikTok would be a significant change of direction from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's focus on workplace software that makes people more productive, said technology industry analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights &amp; Strategy.</p><p> Unlike Google or Facebook, which dominate the digital advertising industry, Microsoft hasn't been under the intense scrutiny of U.S. politicians and antitrust regulators lately over its market power. Moorhead said that might make it easier to swoop in and acquire TikTok, which poses a competitive threat to social networks like Facebook, Instagram, Google's YouTube and Snapchat. It's an interesting irony that it was Microsoft at the center of the landmark antitrust case 20 years ago.</p><p> If the deal goes through, \"it would definitely make Microsoft a much more competitive advertising system in years to come,\" said eMarketer analyst Ross Benes.</p><p> ___</p><p>AP writers Tali Arbel and Anne D'innocenzio in New York, and Kevin Freking aboard Air Force One and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.</p><p> This is a developing news story that will continue to be updated.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Credit: AP A man opens social media app 'Tik Tok' on his cell phone, in Islamabad, Pakistan, Tuesday, July 21, 2020.

I'm Julia Chatterley. This is FIRST MOVE and here is your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Market is spooked. Report suggests China have doubts about a longer term trade deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twitter's Trick or Treat: CEO Jack Dorsey says it will no longer accept political ads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And a candy Apple. Sweet earnings from the smartphone maker.</p><p>It is Thursday, it's also Halloween. Let's make a move.</p><p>Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE. Great to be back here in New York. Happy Halloween, as I mentioned and I can tell you my cauldron is literally overflowing with news during the show today, so I'll get started including some spine tingling earnings.</p><p>Take a look at what we're seeing right now though for U.S. futures. I mentioned it a touch spooked by reports that China doubts that a wider long term trade deal with the United States is possible. If you've been watching FIRST MOVE, I'm not sure you or I expected anyone anyway at least a long term one.</p><p>Also keep an eye on autos today. Peugeot-FiatChrysler officially announcing terms of that whopping $48 billion merger deal. But the big story overnight, of course, was the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell did not petrify. The Fed Chair said he's ready for a rate cut pause, say he won't raise rates until the Fed's preferred measure of inflation looks -- let's call it scary -- once again. We'll call this message a mix therefore of tricks and treats.</p><p>Pounds' potion though tasted good to investors. The S&amp;P 500 finishing at record highs yesterday. Interesting that Deutsche Bank still thinks the Fed could cut once again in December due to trade related weakness and a softening jobs market, too. So glowing eyes on the Federal Reserve and the non-farm payroll report in Friday's session.</p><p>So tomorrow cast those glowing eyes on the Asia session as well. New numbers out today showing Chinese factory activity falling for its sixth months in a row and Hong Kong, too, now formally in recession. No tricks there for sure.</p><p>Let's get to the treat though, and Apple to be precise and some sweet earnings numbers. Clare Sebastian joins me now. Clare, sweet earnings numbers maybe or also some sweet guidance and expectation management here coming into these numbers. Talk us through the details and then we'll dig around into them a bit more.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia, so this is being seen as a stellar quarter from Apple. As you mentioned, not only in the numbers themselves, but also the guidance going into the crucial holiday season.</p><p>The iPhone is where we should start because this was actually the fourth consecutive quarter of declining iPhone sales. That was down nine percent. If we can pull up some of the segments here -- but offset by some other areas, crucially services, things like Apple Pay, iCloud, Apple Music.</p><p>The company particularly focusing on Apple Pay as a bright spot, as they say revenues more than doubled year-on-year in September. Apparently, Apple Pay had more transactions than PayPal; and wearables, another crucial element, Julia. The revenues in wearables were up 54 percent year-on-year. That's things like the Apple Watch and the new Air Pods including the older Air Pods, as well.</p><p>Of course we've seen lines outside some stores when the new app was launched this week. And wearables as well, really interesting here because this is not about replacement like it is with iPhones there.</p><p>Tim Cook said that about 75 percent of Apple Watch buyers were new ones. So this is still in a growth phase for the company and I think that is what investors are looking at today.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, there was so much in that call as well. Their services business now, a $50 billion business. It's like a Fortune 100 company all on its own here.</p><p>And Tim Cook's point as well about three quarters of the people buying watches here are buying them for the first time. They're fresh buyers. So that was an interesting one for me.</p><p>What about China here though, Clare? Because when we're talking about the risks of ability to reach a broader term trade deal here, Apple is the bellwether, I feel for tensions between the two nations.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right, and very optimistic by the sounds of it, Julia. They said that Tim Cook said on the call that he feels that the tone has shifted. He thinks that there is now momentum towards the deal.</p><p>He has apparently factored that into his guidance going into the holiday quarter. In terms of tariffs, Apple are already paying, some that came in in September on some of their accessories. Of course, the big shoe yet to drop is those December 15th tariffs that would include the iPhone, which is of course more than 50 percent of Apple's revenues. They seem to think that that maybe avoided, factoring that into their guidance.</p><p>But of course, we don't know what's going to happen in the trade war and I think possibly the macro environment and the worries about that that trade deal today could be one of the reasons the stock isn't up more. So it's still a factor. But the company says they are able to navigate it.</p><p>[09:05:14]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it still would have a dampening effect on the stock for all the gains that we've seen over the last three months. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for joining us on that.</p><p>Now forget Twitter and Facebook earnings last night, it was all about political ads. Let me walk you through this.</p><p>The Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey says no to political ads on his platform. He tweeted, \"We believe political message reach should be earned and not bought.\" Then on the other side, Facebook on their earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained why he thinks that would be a bad idea. He said quote, \"In a democracy, I don't think it is right for private companies to senor politicians or the news.\"</p><p>Hadas Gold joins us on this story. It's interesting, Hadas, because I listened to that, and I thought maybe the messenger is wrong right now given the focus, but he has a fair point. What's the response been to the decisions from both of these companies?</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Well, Julia, it was pretty cheeky of Twitter to announce this right as Facebook was about to start its earnings call. And it's clear sort of a message being sent between these two social media rivals.</p><p>But Twitter's move was clearly a shot. It got them some good PR, but political advertisements, I have to say are not a huge part of Twitter's revenue. It's in the single digit millions, the amount of money that they actually make for it.</p><p>And also, if you look at the reach in terms of Twitter versus Facebook, and the impact it would have, Twitter's daily active users are about 145 million. When you compare that to Facebook, they have 1.62 billion active users, just to get you a sense of where people are.</p><p>The average person despite the fact that all of us journalists seem to spend all of our days on Twitter, the average person is spending more time on Facebook, but Twitter's move was welcomed by a lot of people, especially Democrats in the U.S., people like Joe Biden, Mark Warner, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were praising Twitter for this move.</p><p>Other conservatives like Donald Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said that it would just silence people. But when you're looking again at the ad buys on Twitter, for example, in the U.K. 2017 election, Twitter spend for ads was 55,000 pounds and on Facebook, it was three million pounds.</p><p>Now Jack Dorsey in part of his tweet, did make a point that a lot of people are making about Facebook. He said, and I'll pull this up in part of this long thread that he had yesterday announcing this was. \"For instance, it would not be credible for us to say: We're working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading information. But if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad, well, they can say whatever they want.\"</p><p>And this is the issue for Facebook right now. They have this very specific policy where if you are a politician, they will not remove an ad if it's deemed false, it would still be allowed to air. But for everybody else, those rules would apply. And I'm not sure how tenable that is for Facebook, especially they're facing some important test.</p><p>Here in the United Kingdom, in just a few weeks, we will have a general election, this will be the first time I think that this policy will be tested in a major English speaking election. It'll be fascinating to see how long and whether they will hold on to this policy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's such a great point, Hadas, because the lines are so blurred here. There needs to be some kind of benchmark of what a political ad is, to what degree do they fact check. And also, what you're talking about here is Facebook, basically saying we want to be treated like a broadcaster, and not be required to make any changes, but at the same time not be regulated like a broadcaster.</p><p>So that's my big argument here. What do we think? Because to your point, Facebook earnings look pretty great.</p><p>GOLD: Yes, I mean, listen, as much as the political fire might be being aimed at Facebook right now, it is clear that in a business sense, they're still doing very, very well. They beat expectations on the earnings. They're getting increase of daily active users, as much as we hear this fury around them. It's obviously not affecting them business-wise.</p><p>But it clearly is something that they're worrying about when it comes to politics because they see the regulation coming down the line. They see the political fury and it's never a good thing to have this sort of PR around you, but Facebook is digging in. This is now week three or four that we have this controversy. Mark Zuckerberg on the call directly addressed it.</p><p>And it's clear that they don't plan to change and they see themselves like the broadcasters in the United States where according to the broadcaster rules in the U.S., by law that this only applies to stations like ABC, CBS, NBC, by law, they're not allowed to touch those political ads. They cannot change the content of them. That's clearly the way that Facebook sees themselves as well.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I was digging around to the 1934 Communications Act last night as well. Wow. Hadas Gold. Great job. Thank you for that. Every time we talk about the problems, I convince myself to buy Facebook.</p><p>Moving on to our next driver, Hong Kong in a recession. We've also can show you live pictures right now of protesters gathering for a further Halloween protest, and that ties directly to the economic impact that we're now talking about here.</p><p>[09:05:12]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: GDP growth falling 3.2 percent in the third quarter versus the second, significantly worse than expected. Sherisse Pham is in Hong Kong for us. So Sherisse, and these pictures, these live pictures just illustrating the problems that the economy is faced with, reduced tourism, with reduce spending, too, and it's playing out in the numbers.</p><p>SHERISSE PHAM, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: The protesters that we're seeing on the streets right, now they have been out in force for five months straight, and they have really contributed to what we are seeing which is the worst economic decline since the 2009 global financial crisis and this is going to the heart of Hong Kong's status as a financial hub.</p><p>The period of July through September, those three months, let's not forget that was a time where we saw riot police, constant violent clashes between protesters and police. That was also a time when protests spread throughout the city and hit major tourist destinations, major shopping destinations. And also that was the period when protesters managed to shut down the airport for a couple days.</p><p>And all of that played out in the numbers that we heard from the government today. Now, these are preliminary GDP figures, but they don't move around too much between preliminary and revised figures, which will come out in a couple weeks here.</p><p>And you know, yes, Hong Kong was already being hurt by the U.S.-China trade war and the slowing global economy. But one economist I talked to today said that it was this political crisis and these protests that we're seeing on your screen right now that was what tipped the city into a recession.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Sherisse Pham, great to have you with us on that. Thank you so much.</p><p>All right, let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that we are following around the world.</p><p>In the next hour, the U.S. House of Representatives is expected to vote on a resolution to formalize the Impeachment Inquiry. Suzanne Malveaux reports on what's promising to be a pretty busy day for lawmakers in D.C.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Another key witness testifies on Capitol Hill and the House will vote on the rules for the Impeachment Inquiry.</p><p>Tim Morrison, the top Russia and Europe adviser on President Trump's National Security Council, will be the second White House official who listened in on Trump's phone call with Ukraine's leader to testify.</p><p>Sources tell CNN that he is also expected to corroborate key elements of top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, Bill Taylor's testimony last week, including President Trump repeatedly pressuring Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son and using military aid as leverage.</p><p>Trump has denied that the two were explicitly linked.</p><p>On the eve of the hearing, Morrison has told colleagues that he is planning to leave the Trump administration soon. House Democrats have now summoned former National Security adviser, John Bolton to a closed-door session.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL): I'm hoping that he really wants to testify, to show the courage that the others have so far.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALVEAUX (voice over): But Bolton's attorney says he won't appear without a subpoena.</p><p>Multiple administration officials have testified Bolton was concerned about Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, pushing Ukraine for political favors, including Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, who according to two sources at his deposition Tuesday, said Bolton told him to prepare a memo to the President by August 15th, saying military aid needed to be released to Ukraine as soon as possible.</p><p>But Vindman testified the President refused to give up the money, even after meeting with Bolton and other Cabinet officials.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): We're going to continue to learn more about what Mister -- Colonel Vindman said, for instance, from Mr. Morrison. Everything I've seen has been consistent with the whistleblower's allegations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALVEAUX (voice over): Today's impeachment vote will formalize the next steps, including permission for public impeachment hearings and the release of deposition transcripts. Democrats also giving Republicans the ability to subpoena witnesses, only if the Democratic Chairman agrees, or a majority of the committee approves.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM MCGOVERN (D-MA): No one runs for Congress to impeach a President. But we are here today, because the facts compel us to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALVEAUX (voice over): House Republicans are still not satisfied.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): It is shameful. And they will be punished for this by Americans in the next election.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): We will continue to fight every step of the way.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Suzanne Malveaux reporting there. Right now, you're looking at live pictures of the U.S. House of Representatives over in Washington. They will hold the first vote related to the Impeachment Inquiry into President Trump at around 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time this morning. We will have special coverage on that. So stay with CNN.</p><p>[09:15:07]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: In the meantime, South Korea says its military is on alert after North Korea launched two projectiles into the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.</p><p>The U.S. Defense Department says it appears to be a missile launch. If confirmed, this would be North Korea's 12th missile tests since May.</p><p>To California now, firefighters are racing to contain multiple major wildfires fueled by hurricane force winds and dry conditions. Some of the flames are nine meters high.</p><p>Official say at least 20 different wildfires broke out in Southern California on Wednesday alone. Tens of thousands of people have had to flee their homes.</p><p>All right. We're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but still to come, sealing the deal. Sealing the deal. Fiat-Chrysler and Peugeot announcing details of their mega merger. All that to come stay with us. You're with CNN.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE, live from the New York Stock Exchange where we're looking like a modestly lower open for stocks this morning. The S&amp;P 500 falling from record highs hit during the session yesterday. A report on yes, you guessed it, U.S.-China trade giving the markets a little bit of a fright this Halloween, it says, China doubts that it can sign a comprehensive long term trade deal with the Trump administration.</p><p>That said talks on a limited Phase 1 deal do still appear to be on track. We're a touch higher actually for futures earlier after the Fed cut rates for the third time this year. Fed Chair Jay Powell says the Central Bank won't hike rates until inflation perks up.</p><p>Joining me now is that Kevin O'Leary better known as Mr. Wonderful from the U.S. hit show \"Shark Tank.\" He is also chairman of O'Shares ETFs. Great to have you with us.</p><p>KEVIN O'LEARY, CHAIRMAN, O'SHARES ETF: Thank you, Julia. Great to be here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You were saying back in September that you didn't think that the Fed needed to cut, they cut, and now they've cut again.</p><p>O'LEARY: I think the Fed is now saying it's not business as usual, that they're concerned about slowdowns as a result of uncertainty of the trade war as you just detailed. And there's evidence of the slowdown coming with the reduction in CapEx with most U.S. corporations waiting to see how this plays out.</p><p>[09:20:12]</p><p>O'LEARY: During that period, though, China printed growth less than six percent. So they also are feeling the pain, incentivizing them, I think, to get a deal done.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How closely are you watching the back and forth? We reported every single day on whether a deal is on or off or on, you know, how much focus are you giving that? Because there is a huge difference between a Phase 1 deal and a more comprehensive deal that includes intellectual property theft, patent protection and I don't think anyone really believes that's possible right now.</p><p>O'LEARY: Probably not a really comprehensive one during this early stage, but Phase 1 is helpful. It was signed on the 17th. But the way you can really determine what the market is thinking is just watch how most stocks are near their all-time highs right now because the potential of resolving trade issues with China has so much positive impact of S&amp;P earnings over the long run that the market is discounting ultimately something will be resolved.</p><p>And the two things that have to happen, because I'm living this with my companies is I need IP rights in China so I can litigate when my IP is stolen just like they can when theirs is stolen in the United States, and access to their growing middle class market, which is getting to be the size of the U.S. domestic consumer in terms of growth.</p><p>So I'm interested in both. This is the first administration that has been driving that direction this way, and that's why the market is so excited, you know, we talk about the concern, the back and forth and the rhetoric, the market is telling me, Julia that the upside is so big.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What is the upside for China? Because right now, they've been so protectionist about their market because they want to promote the growth of their own companies. What's the incentive for them to open up other than the threat of further tariffs or pain?</p><p>O'LEARY: If China were today wave a magic wand and have a normalized agreement as U.S. has with let's say, Canada or Mexico in the new trade agreement, which should be right ratified in the next few months, I would immediately as an investor, deploy more capital into China, because I want access to that market and everybody else would, too, and the Chinese know that also.</p><p>I've got pent up demand to deploy capital into China just waiting. So at some point, they've got to grow up and say, look, we want those billions of dollars. I'm just one of millions of investors that want to deploy capital there. The upside is huge for them to.</p><p>This will get resolved, and probably in the second administration, in the next three years.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Interesting. Speaking of politics, because I know you're a holder of the Facebook stock right now.</p><p>O'LEARY: Yes, yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What do you make of the decision by Twitter overnight to ban political ads, and Facebook's decision not to?</p><p>O'LEARY: Twitter is not that big a platform actually compared to all the other digital platforms, so they're making a statement, but does it matter? No.</p><p>Political ad deployment will just move on to all the other platforms that are available to it. The concern that I have about Facebook, frankly, is that when you listen to this political rhetoric, people have forgotten, and I'm going to explain why this is so important.</p><p>I've got investments in 52 private companies. Their number one spend is on Facebook, whether it be Instagram or whether it's on the core platform --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Advertising.</p><p>O'LEARY: They have created thousands of jobs. The engine of growth of entrepreneurship in America is the Facebook platform. It is the digital platforms.</p><p>I don't need a politician telling Facebook how to design its feature sets. I don't want that. I want the market to do that. The reason that Facebook is relevant today is because it's done a great job in becoming a useful tool for me to acquire customers. I don't need a politician doing that for me. They don't know how to do that. So they should stay away from the platforms.</p><p>I'm one of the investors out there now saying, I'd like to push back. I don't want politicians getting their hands dirty and breaking up technology companies.</p><p>The reason I don't use French book is there isn't one. There's nothing in Europe because they regulated themselves out of business there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, but these are two separate things. The idea that they're supporting job creation, I couldn't agree more with you. But it's also being used as a weapon for the proliferation of social media. There's concerns about interference in democracy. They can't have it all ways. What about this splitting up of perhaps some of these tools to allow Facebook to regulate themselves if you don't want a government to do it better?</p><p>O'LEARY: They don't even have to do it. The market will regulate Facebook. Let me give you an example which we can, you know, look at. Go back to the mid-80s. IBM largest market cap company. The number one technology company. The rhetoric against IBM at the time is identical to what you're hearing in Congress today.</p><p>Just go back a few decades. Where's IBM today? Nowhere. It's a company that the market destroyed because they didn't stay competitive. The market is very, very shrewd.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Microsoft?</p><p>O'LEARY: Microsoft was also, you know, in a situation just a decade ago where it was a dinosaur. Today, it is a leader because it adapted itself competitively in the market.</p><p>What I'm trying to point out is you don't have to regulate tech companies. The market does it for you if you let it do its work. The minute Facebook makes a mistake, the market punishes it. You don't have to do it with a politician. If they're not relevant -- each quarter, I look at my span across all my companies.</p><p>[09:25:14]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But you're expecting the market to regulate privacy concerns as far as Facebook is concerned?</p><p>O'LEARY: Absolutely.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And democracy and elections?</p><p>O'LEARY: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Really?</p><p>O'LEARY: Yes, if you didn't want or you were concerned that you, Julia were being some --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That's different.</p><p>O'LEARY: No, it isn't.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: People aren't concerned enough about their own privacy.</p><p>O'LEARY: And that's why the market is being the market. I don't know a lot of people that say themselves, oh, my goodness, I'm worried the Russian elections or the U.S. elections are going to be rigged by Russians. I'm not going to advertise on Facebook. That's ludicrous. It doesn't.</p><p>People make their decisions every single day by the millisecond. If you were really concerned about privacy, you wouldn't be on Facebook. You are on Facebook.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I am. I don't use it, but I am.</p><p>O'LEARY: You don't want privacy, you want your brand to be spread everywhere.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The utility.</p><p>O'LEARY: So my point is, I really am tired of listening to the rhetoric of an individual politician trying to make noise about, oh my goodness, my constituents are concerned about all these issues, we have to break up Facebook. That's total BS.</p><p>The market is making the decision every single day about Facebook and if it doesn't like what it sees, it goes to another platform, as I do. I look at how much it costs me to acquire customer with Facebook each quarter. If they they're doing that job, I move on.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Every time I talk about this, I convince myself to buy. We have about 30 seconds.</p><p>O'LEARY: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: If a Democrat wins the next election, do we see the breakup of big tech?</p><p>O'LEARY: It is the rhetoric they are espousing.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>O'LEARY: I think -- here's the thing you should have to know. Go back in the history of modern times. When any President of either party has had unemployment under four percent, they've never lost their mandate.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>O'LEARY: So I'm not really worried about that. I'm not a supporter of any politician or party.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But do you think Trump wins?</p><p>O'LEARY: I'm a history buff. I think Trump gets another mandate because of -- the economy is on fire. We're in the epicenter right here. We've got all-time highs in the stock market. Nobody is going to be trying to change that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Kevin O'Leary, Mr. Wonderful there. You heard it. FIRST MOVE is back after this with the market open.</p><p>[09:30:08]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. That was the opening bell here at the stock exchange. Thursday's morning session and we are losing a bit of ground as anticipated here for U.S. markets amid reports and we've talked about it throughout the show. China, not necessarily looking at a comprehensive trade deal here after Phase 1 is completed. That offsetting some of the optimism that we saw after the Fed cut rates for the third time this year.</p><p>The Fed is also providing some relatively market friendly forward guidance here. New numbers also out today supporting the economy showing consumers still helping to drive the expansion here with spending rising two-tenths of a percent in September in line with expectations.</p><p>Spending also revised higher in August. The mighty U.S. consumer, the GDP numbers out yesterday showed the U.S. economy growing at a quicker pace than expected. Once again, thanks to that consumer spending that we're seeing.</p><p>What about the Global Movers here in the show today? Well, shares of Starbucks are trading higher. The beverage chain reporting better than expected revenues. China sales rising a strong five percent despite increased competition from the Luckin chain over there.</p><p>What about Apple, too? The shares near record highs again after the earnings beat. The company posting record revenues for its fiscal fourth quarter. Its wearables offset weakness in iPhone sales. Apple says 60 percent of sales now come from outside the United States.</p><p>Shares of Peugeot falling some 13 percent. Shares of Fiat-Chrysler up eight percent in the European trading session after the two firms announced terms of their $48 billion merger, the deal creating the world's fourth largest automaker.</p><p>Anna Stewart joins us on this. She has been looking at the details. Interesting now that we've got the details of just what this tie up involves here, Anna. The share price of the two stocks, they're telling, I think the bigger picture in the story here.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Yes, a marriage of equals, a 50/50 share, but it does look, if you look at their share prices, like one party is going to be bringing much more to the marriage, at least short term.</p><p>Now, if you look at the devil in the detail, you see why you'd have to adjust for their market caps, their dividend payouts, but also you've got to consider this, Julia. The Fiat shareholders will be getting a $6 billion payout plus the proceeds of selling one of their robot making units.</p><p>Peugeot shareholders on the other hand do not get a cash payout. They will get proceeds from another divestment. But essentially, analysts at Jefferies see that Peugeot shareholders are effectively paying a 32 percent premium for Fiat here. So there is a difference in the price.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. Thirty two percent premium here. You know, it is interesting when I look at the two CEOs that are involved in putting this together, them being able to create a tie up here and making the fourth largest automaker in the world in a way that Carlos Ghosn of course, Sergio Marchionne didn't manage to do. What does this say perhaps about the characters involved here?</p><p>STEWART: Well, it suggests that really, A, it is becoming more of a necessity for them both to bulk up and consolidate and two, you're right, I think it's to do with the personalities.</p><p>There was always a fear that Carlos Ghosn wasn't entirely on board with a Fiat tie up, although post Carlos Ghosn after his arrest, we did of course, see the Renault-Fiat deal, it looked like it was getting through early this year, only in June to break up and Fiat said at the time that was due to the French government political conditions weren't right.</p><p>Now that is likely to be part of the story here. Will the French government be on board? They do own a 12 percent stake in Peugeot. Surely they want Peugeot to succeed. I think everyone would agree that consolidation is key here.</p><p>I think what we're going to see is the French government asking for protection of jobs, protection of plants, but this is going to be a French- Italian-American company. So you can only imagine that there will be demands from all sides here. I think we could see a lot of pre-marriage counseling before either side says I do at the altar -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it is complicated, I think is the word we're looking for here. But to your point, and it is a very important one where governments are involved and government stakes are involved. What I read was that there are going to be no plant closures. That's going to be quite a mean feat that for these two companies to pull together surely.</p><p>STEWART: So there's already rumors I'm hearing in the U.K. that some plants could be at risk. For instance, the Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port in the U.K.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>STEWART: So perhaps plants that are not within France, Italy, America, perhaps that's where the cuts will fall even if they are efficient factories, but this is going to be all part of this very complicated tie- up, it is how do you get those synergies because there has to be, you know, a profit and a point to all of this --Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's such a great point. All right. Anna Stewart, thank you very much for that. More to come from FIRST MOVE. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:38:11]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE and back to one of our top stories. The results from Apple overnight beating expectations on the top and the bottom line and a nice look at guidance as well, too. Gene Munster is a Managing Partner at Loup Ventures and joins us now. Great to have you with us, Gene. You say the road to recovery continues particularly excited by the wearables and the services performance in this quarter. Talk us through it.</p><p>GENE MUNSTER, MANAGING PARTNER, LOUP VENTURES: So Julia, before we get to that, I want to put some background high level here. It is that the iPhone was down nine percent in the most recent quarter. It was down 20 percent a few quarters ago. So it's improving. But the piece that's filling the gap, as you said is services and wearables.</p><p>Services is a segment that Apple reports that reached an all-time high as a percentage of revenue, that was 20 percent and grew at 18 percent of the quarter, which is a two percent acceleration. So that's impressive.</p><p>But the wearables piece is shrouded in this other category. Fortunately, we spent a lot of time analyzing that piece and we have a good sense about what's going on with wearables. That business is now eight percent of Apple's overall. This would be basically Air Pods and the Apple Watch.</p><p>So if you put that collectively with services, you have close to 30 percent of their business, which grew at almost 30 percent. It was 29 percent last night.</p><p>So this is a much faster growth rate, versus the overall business at two percent, and the simple reason why this is so important relative to the Apple story is -- what we're seeing is that even though the iPhone can struggle at times, they have these other businesses that play off of the iPhone install base, almost a billion people now that can drive their overall revenue growth higher. So a very important quarter for Apple.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So a really important point here. Don't continue to fixate on slowing iPhone growth, talk about some of the other services and how fast they're growing here.</p><p>One of the interesting things that Tim Cook said yesterday was that around 75 percent of people that are buying iWatches now have never bought one before. So they are encouraging new customers to look at this as an option here. Talk to me about penetration of smart watches and to what extent and what growth you think we could see here, given what? We've got more than 900 million people using iPhone products around the world right now?</p><p>MUNSTER: So I'll start with what we know -- what Apple reports is that the wearables category grew at 55 percent versus 50 percent the previous two quarters, so that's a slight step up. The actual units that they've sold since the Apple Watch came out, they don't disclose that, but we can back into that.</p><p>And there are effectively 65 -- six five -- million Apple Watches -- active Apple Watches and that compares to about 915 active iPhones in the world. And what that means is essentially we have a seven or eight percent penetration. That really is the addressable market -- it is the iPhones out there. Of course, you need an iPhone to have an Apple Watch.</p><p>And so I think that when you look at those growth rates of wearables in the most recent quarter, and that acceleration, sometimes it's hard to imagine that that can continue at those rates. But when you step back and look at the addressable market and the install base, it's still a small business, Apple Watch. And I think that this could continue to grow for many years to come.</p><p>Tim Cook reiterated that Apple's greatest contribution is going to be around health and wellness. Now, that could be saving one person's life, you could argue that they've made that contribution. But if you think about that as a central theme, the watch and wearables are going to be foundational to that future. So you're going to hear a lot more about Apple Watch in the years to come.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I've spoken to a number of people now about the heart rate monitor in the latest watches and just the security blanket that that provides. It is going to be fascinating to see.</p><p>I want to move on and talk about China hereto. Stable on what we saw last quarter despite all the concerns and the rhetoric. It does feel like Apple is a bellwether for trade deal prospects here. Are you comforted by what you've seen from Apple in China specifically hereto?</p><p>MUNSTER: It was another positive point from last night's results. Overall, China accounted for 17 percent of revenue that was unchanged from the previous quarter.</p><p>And of course, there's been a lot of navigation related to tariffs, especially around Apple's brand. This is something that we monitor. When you look at the social media and online kind of consciousness of China that is, of course curated by the government and that tends to be neutral to slightly positive to Apple, which I think bodes for these results. That is to me representative of the masterful job that the company has done to stay in good standing with the Chinese government.</p><p>And I suspect that, you know, it's going to take longer than we think to get to a trade deal even despite Tim Cook's comments last night on the call thinking that we're getting close. I think it's going to take a lot of time, but it's encouraging for Apple investors to know that even with a trade dispute that is ongoing that they can still be successful in China.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, no surprise that Tim Cook is the eternal optimist on this one. I'm just looking at the share price performance. It's up like 15 to 16 percent in the last few months. Why aren't investors more excited or buying into the sort of ecosystem story here at this moment?</p><p>I feel like we've gone through a period where we've said, look, what's the next big growth engine? You're kind of saying look at what they're doing elsewhere and the quiet growth that we're seeing in all of these businesses. What does it take here for investors to go, okay, we really believe the broader story here.</p><p>MUNSTER: So there's going to be two camps, the majority of Apple investors are in this camp. That this is a hardware company and you have cycles. And the next cycle of course is going to be 5G, which starts in the fall of next year and that may go for a couple years.</p><p>So that is probably what is central to moving the stock higher more recently as investors' optimism even though it's a year away from now, that this could have a profound, probably the biggest upgrade that Apple have in five years. So that's camp one.</p><p>I think that camp of the product cycle Apple investor is going to diminish over time. There'll be a new view of Apple investing. And that's going to be more as this Apple as a consumer staple company. Think of Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola, these stocks trade at a much higher multiple, 30 times plus versus Apples multiple at 20 times.</p><p>If you believe that the world is ready for a consumer staple company that can really bring together all of tech, I think that that ultimately will be the prevailing view.</p><p>I see this stock being $350.00 or greater over the year plus a much, much more optimistic view that most analysts have because I do believe that this view will take hold that ultimately this is a consumer staples type of a company.</p><p>[09:45:10]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. $350.00 over the next 12 months. We shall watch that closely. Gene, great to have you with us. Gene Munster of Loup Ventures.</p><p>MUNSTER: Thank you, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you so much. Great to have you with us. All right, let's change topics now to the European Central Bank because its bidding bon voyage to President Mario Draghi. Former IMF boss, Christine Lagarde formally takes the reins today. Well, here to help us dig into his legacy and his successor is Jean-Claude Trichet who preceded Draghi at the European Central Bank.</p><p>Great to have you with us, Sir Jean-Claude, thank you so much for joining us on the show. I do want to talk about policy. But first, I wanted to ask you, what this day feels like when the job is not over, you've been in this role and recognize that more still needs to be done, but you have to hand over to someone else. What does it feel like? Is it frustrating?</p><p>JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET, FORMER EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT: Well, it is a very moving moment because you have to quit a job, which is incredibly exciting, if I may, very high level of responsibility. And it's over. It's over overnight, but it's normal.</p><p>I mean, it's a long mandate, a term of eight years to guarantee absolute stability, and also independence. So you feel very moved. But you don't think about anything at the beginning. You reflect and you know that you will do something totally different.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and there have been many challenges, and we continue to reflect. You've written an op-ed defending both the provisions of stimulus that you provided, but also Mario Draghi. And I think your primary point was, imagine if we hadn't done it, and where the Eurozone economy would be at this point. Do you think we're at the stage now, where the benefits of negative rates, of stimulus are being outweighed by the costs particularly to savers?</p><p>TRICHET: Well, of course, you have positives and negatives associated with any decision that any Central Bank would take. And this is true for all the non-conventional measures that have been taken, not only the negative rates, but also QE. Also the forward guidance which plays also an important role now and other measures that are also of importance.</p><p>I would say, at the present moment, it seems to me that there is an economists' consensus according to which the negatives are not over and above the positives. But that being said, of course, the Central Banks and the ECB in particular is obliged to take decisions that are rather extraordinary because in my opinion, the other elements of the policy mix, the fiscal policy and the structural reforms and also the domestic demand in many countries is not contributing as it should.</p><p>So the burden is very much on the shoulder of the ECB. That is true also, by the way, for the other Central Banks of the advanced economies in the world, so they cannot be the only game in town. It is about time for the other partners to step in, I would say, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It is interesting. You lost two members of the ECB when you were presiding over the Central Bank, two Germans, in fact. Mario Draghi also losing a German here. Do you think Christine Lagarde might surprise us? She is expected to be a dove, but yesterday she deliberately pointed at Germany. She deliberately pointed at the Netherlands and said guys, you need to do more in terms of fiscal stimulus. Do you think she can get them to provide more where perhaps you and Mario Draghi couldn't?</p><p>TRICHET: Well, we will see, in any case, I would say continuity is very important within the Central Bank, and there has been a lot of continuity since the very beginning. Otherwise we would not produce the result that we have. And let me only mention that we delivered price stability and it was the mandate of the treaty.</p><p>We resisted a terrible crisis and resilience has proved quite remarkable. And also, of course, we are backed, I mean, the ECB and the Euro are backed by the people of Europe, with a 76 percent popular backing.</p><p>So all this comes out, in my opinion of continuity. I expect, of course Christine to continue the course of action that had been the course of action of the ECB and of the Governing Council, but also being pragmatic, very pragmatic, and take all decisions with her colleagues that are overdue taking into account data and circumstances, including of course, global economy and global trade.</p><p>[09:50:10]</p><p>TRICHET: Because don't forget, the European economy is highly depending on global trade much more than the US economy itself.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Jean-Claude Trichet, sir, thank you so much for joining us on the show today. The former President of the European Central Bank there. Great to have you with us, sir.</p><p>TRICHET: Great pleasure, Julia. Great pleasure.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you. All right. We're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but up next, new issues with Boeing 737 emerge just a day after its CEO was challenged on Capitol Hill for taking compensation worth millions of dollars. Stay with us for details, next.</p><p>[09:52:48]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE with a look at today's \"Boardroom Brief.\" Nintendo reported operating profit that more than doubled bolstered by strong demand for its switch console. This includes the handheld switch light version launched by Nintendo to widen its appeal beyond dedicated gamers.</p><p>Halloween is a huge hit in the U.S., but Americans are actually spending less this year on costumes, candy and pumpkins, not me clearly. This spooky season is predicted to be worth about $8.8 billion. That's down slightly from last year according to the National Retail Federation. It's another sign that spending slowdown could drive the economy into a dead zone, much like this lot you might catch tonight at the annual New York Halloween parade. Wow.</p><p>And finally on this Halloween, we want to bring you some of the stocks that have given us both tricks and treats this month. There's lots of interesting treats including music streaming service, Spotify, nothing scary on Spotify's playlist. Shares are up 22 percent this month.</p><p>Get out the Elon Musk Iron Man costumes, too because Tesla shares are up some 31 percent. Ouch for the bears and the Crocs come back continues. Shares have soared 31 percent this month, too.</p><p>Now there have been some tricks as well. McDonald's rough 2019 continues with shares down some eight percent. Investors were worried about increased competition. Ghoulish results, meanwhile sunk Tupperware shares. They are down 35 percent.</p><p>And there were goblins at Grubhub, too. Shares are down almost 40 percent on some scary results this month, too. Wow. There you go.</p><p>Let me give you a look at what we're seeing at our markets this morning. Under a bit of pressure this morning, but we did hit fresh record highs for the S&amp;P 500 in the session yesterday; under a bit of pressure, but not much. Plenty and a busy session to go so watch this space.</p><p>For now though. That's it for the show. I'm Julia Chatterley. You can listen to our podcast at cnn.com/podcast. You've been watching a FIRST MOVE. Time to go make yours.</p><p>[09:55:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Happy Halloween from us and our special coverage of the impeachment vote continues right after this.

French President Emmanuel Macron pushed[4] a digital tax in July, which prompted[5] U.S. President Donald Trump to threaten a separate tax on French wine imports. France's 3% tax is discriminatory against Google, Amazon and other companies, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a press statement at the time. </p><p>French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow etched out a deal[6] compelling France to repay companies the difference between the tax and a planned mechanism drawn up by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).(Article Continues Below Advertisement) 'Trump's adviser is OK with the proposal,' a source familiar with the negotiations told reporters, referring to the deal that depends on the OECD's mechanism. 'That would be the mechanism at this stage. That's the joint proposal.'The agreement will be submitted to Trump and Macron Monday at a G7 leaders summit in Biarritz, France. The country's 3% levy applies to revenue from digital companies with more than $27 million in French revenue and $830 million worldwide. Macron has been searching for ways to fill revenue pitfalls after France's gas tax collapsed in January. Trump's initial reach to the tax came as a surprise given his administration's overall opposition[7] to big tech companies like Google and Facebook, both of which the president believes discriminate against conservatives.

The goal, said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, is \u201cto send a message to these companies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe message is, it\u2019s not enough to use your tech as an ATM machine and not have a sense of social responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that legislation is not an effective way to do this. Naming and shaming seems to be effective.\u201d</p><p>This year, the organization gave Facebook a B-plus grade and handed a B to Instagram and a B-minus to Twitter. Google and YouTube both got a C-plus and VK.com, the Russian social media site, got a D-plus.</p><p>Big tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter have recently gotten more heavy-handed when it comes to shutting down accounts that promote racism, anti-Semitism and extremism.

The site received a D grade.</p><p>Cooper said the center grades companies based on whether they have rules about regulating hate and extremism on their sites and how well those rules are enforced.</p><p>\u201cFor example, YouTube has all the right rules, but they haven\u2019t been able to remove hate content quickly and consistently,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>Twitter, on the other hand, has gotten much better when it comes to paying attention to hate hashtags, he said.</p><p>Cooper said he has been surprised by \u201cthe variety and viciousness of anti-black social media posts.\u201d \u201cThis is because of a broader effort by white nationalists who have been able to recreate and rebrand themselves,\u201d he said.</p><p>And ISIS is still a danger when it comes to recruiting young people, he said, \u201cbecause while they are being defeated on the ground, their online activism hasn\u2019t waned.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OCREG-66C6956D42CD586CE0530100007F8ACB</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OCREG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RTG-3K31-JBK9-9329-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"457\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Orange County Register All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Orange County Register (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 7, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIMON WIESENTHAL CENTER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Officials from the Justice Department's Antitrust Division and Federal Trade Commission, which both enforce antitrust law, met in recent weeks to give Justice jurisdiction over Google, said the sources, who sought anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record. </p><p>The potential investigation represents the latest attack on a tech company by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused social media companies and Google of suppressing conservative voices on their platforms online. One source said the potential investigation, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, focused on accusations that Google gave preference to its own businesses in searches. A spokesman for the Justice Department said he could not confirm or deny that an investigation was being considered. Google declined comment.  FTC investigation Early in 2013, the FTC closed a long-running investigation of Google, giving it a slap on the wrist. Under FTC pressure, Google agreed to end the practice of 'scraping' reviews and other data from rivals' websites for its own products, and to let advertisers export data to independently assess campaigns. Google's search, YouTube, reviews, maps and other businesses, which are largely free to consumers but financed through advertising, have catapulted it from a startup to one of the world's richest companies in just two decades. Along the way, it has made enemies in both the tech world, who have complained to law enforcers about its market dominance, and in Washington, where lawmakers have complained about issues from its alleged political bias to its plans for China. Some welcome news TripAdvisor chief executive and co-founder Stephen Kaufer welcomed news that Google could face Justice Department antitrust scrutiny. 'TripAdvisor remains concerned about Google's practices in the United States, the EU and throughout the world,' Kaufer said in a statement. 'For the good of consumers and competition on the internet, we welcome any renewed interest by U.S. regulators into Google's anticompetitive behavior.' Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has pushed for action to break up Google, as well as other big tech companies. Senator Kamala Harris, who is also running for president on the Democratic ticket, has agreed. 'This is very big news, and overdue,' Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican Google critic, said Twitter, regarding the investigation. Google has faced a plethora of overseas probes. Europe's competition authority, for one, hit Google with a 2.4-billion-euro ($2.7-billion) EU fine two years ago for unfairly promoting its own comparison shopping service. Google has since offered to allow competitors to bid for advertising space at the top of a search page, giving them the chance to compete on equal terms. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS1309121559380029505251764900055</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W7N-85M1-JB5Y-N1N4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><timeReceived>9:07 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 1, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Lawmakers from both parties, including Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas who oversees a subcommittee on the Constitution, and Representative David N. Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island who leads a subcommittee on antitrust law, took aim at the businesses. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The executives acknowledged that technology had changed, and sometimes hurt, companies in industries like retailing, advertising, music and movies. But their companies, they said, have opened new opportunities to millions of entrepreneurs and small businesses. They insisted they faced competitors at every turn -- entrenched big companies, ascendant start-ups and each other.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  And consumers, they said, are big winners, benefiting from convenience, lower prices and new products and services.</p><p>  But their celebration of the virtues of Big Tech did not carry the day. Some lawmakers were sympathetic, but this was not their stage. Most were decidedly unconvinced, even disdainful.</p><p>  ''Facebook has said, 'Just trust us,''' Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said at a hearing focused on the social media company's cryptocurrency efforts. ''And every time Americans trust you, they seem to get burned.''</p><p>  The hearing performances were a telling moment, showing the rising force of the backlash against the tech giants. Not long ago revered as treasures of American capitalism, they are now targets of political attacks from both parties, growing public criticism and regulatory scrutiny. President Trump has also turned up the volume of his critique of tech companies in recent weeks.</p><p>  The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission recently decided to divide responsibility for potential antitrust investigations. The Justice Department is taking Google and Apple, while the F.T.C. has Facebook and Amazon. Last week, the F.T.C. voted to fine Facebook about $5 billion for mishandling users' personal information, by far the agency's largest fine against a tech company.</p><p>  The House Judiciary Committee has opened a bipartisan inquiry into the power and practices of major technology companies. The subcommittee announced the investigation last month and planned to request documents from the companies and hear testimony from confidential witnesses, who may fear retribution from the tech giants.</p><p>  It has also started holding hearings, including one on Tuesday afternoon that was focused on how Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google altered innovation and entrepreneurial activity. The practices under scrutiny included acquiring upstart competitors and favoring their own offerings on the digital marketplaces they operate.</p><p>  Lawmakers appeared to be zeroing in on the areas that concern them the most. In one exchange, Mr. Cicilline addressed whether the tech companies' marketplaces -- for goods, software apps and online ads -- gave them an unfair advantage over rivals who rely on those marketplaces to distribute their own products or services. He pointed to Amazon's many lines of private label products, which compete for sales on the company's site with similar products from other brands.</p><p>  ''Doesn't that create a conflict of interest?'' Mr. Cicilline asked Nate Sutton, Amazon's associate general counsel.</p><p>  ''I respectfully disagree,'' replied Mr. Sutton, who said that many big brick-and-mortar retailers offer private label brands.</p><p>Amazon's control of products on its site, Mr. Cicilline said, is different and stronger than that of a traditional retailer that offers some private-label merchandise.</p><p>  At one point, Mr. Cicilline pointedly told Mr. Sutton, ''I may remind you, sir. You are under oath.''</p><p>  Isn't it the case, Mr. Cicilline pressed, that the best sale for Amazon is the sale of an Amazon-branded product, and that Amazon uses the vast amount of data it collects to favor its own offerings?</p><p>  ''No, that is not true,'' Mr. Sutton replied.</p><p>  Representative Joe Neguse, a Colorado Democrat, focused on Facebook.</p><p>  He pointed out that not only is Facebook the world's largest social network, but that those ranked third, fourth and sixth -- WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram -- are Facebook properties.</p><p>  Owning the four of the top six players in a market, Mr. Neguse said, spoke for itself. ''We have a word for that,'' he said. ''It is called monopoly.''</p><p>  Earlier in the day, in the hearing about Facebook's cryptocurrency project, Libra, lawmakers grilled David Marcus, a top executive.</p><p>  The company has a bold goal with the project: to offer an alternative financial system that makes it possible to send money around the world with few fees. But the company has run into bipartisan resistance from Washington, including the White House.</p><p>  The initiative is far from the first effort of its kind. The best-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is in wide circulation, and it introduced the idea of digital currencies that are free from government control.</p><p>  But the Libra effort has put a spotlight on cryptocurrencies and amplified the voices of critics who say the technology has little value beyond speculative investing and illegal transactions, like online drug sales. Last week, the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, said Libra raised ''serious concerns'' around ''money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability.'' Mr. Trump and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, have also criticized Libra and other cryptocurrencies in the past week.</p><p>  That concern was obvious on Tuesday when members of the committee questioned Mr. Marcus, who leads the company's cryptocurrency initiative, for more than two hours. Mr. Marcus was asked about a range of Facebook controversies, from lax protection of the private information of its users to Russian disinformation on Facebook's platforms to claims that it tries to muzzle conservative viewpoints.</p><p>  Senator Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona, said, ''I don't trust you guys.''</p><p>  Mr. Marcus, a former PayPal executive, was handpicked by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, to lead the Libra effort.</p><p>  Mr. Marcus, adopting a conciliatory tone, said the company would do its best to fight fraud and earn back the trust of the more than two billion people who use Facebook's services regularly.</p><p>  ''We've made mistakes in the past,'' Mr. Marcus said. ''We have been working, and are working hard to get better.''</p><p>Google was at the center of the day's third hearing, about censorship in search, held by a Senate subcommittee.</p><p>  Republican lawmakers used the hearing to air often-repeated but largely unproven claims that Google tilts search results to bias against conservative viewpoints. Democrats called the hearing a charade and raised concerns about Google's inability to effectively police the content on YouTube.</p><p>  The Republicans took turns battering Karan Bhatia, Google's vice president for government affairs and public policy. Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, delivered the most pointed attacks. He said it was hard to believe Google's executives when they say that censoring search results would go against the company's mission and ideology, considering that the search giant had been working on plans to re-enter China with a censored search engine.</p><p>  ''Clearly, our trust and patience in your company and your monopoly has run out,'' said Mr. Hawley, who has been a vocal critic of Google.</p><p>  Mr. Bhatia responded by saying that Google had abandoned plans to restart its search engine in China.</p><p>  Mr. Cruz, the chairman of the subcommittee, said Congress needed to rethink the legal immunity for internet companies, established in 1996, that protects them from liability for content posted by users. The law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has allowed platforms like Google's YouTube, Facebook and Twitter to grow rapidly without concern of being held liable for content on those services.</p><p>  Even before the hearing that focused on Google, the president applied his own brand of pressure with an early morning tweet. He said that his administration ''will investigate'' remarks from the billionaire investor Peter Thiel, who said that Google had been infiltrated by the Chinese intelligence. Mr. Thiel also accused the technology giant of treason for refusing to work with the Pentagon on a future artificial intelligence project while agreeing to work with the Chinese military. He provided no evidence for his allegations.</p><p>  A Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company had not worked with the Chinese military and that it had cooperated with the American government in many areas such as cybersecurity, recruiting and health care.</p><p>  When asked whether Chinese intelligence had infiltrated the company's management, software or private data during the hearing, Mr. Bhatia said: ''Absolutely not.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Lawmakers questioned David Marcus, a Facebook executive, about the company's cryptocurrency project, Libra.

This hearing of the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet will come to order.  I now recognize myself for an opening statement.  </p><p>      Today, we are holding a hearing to examine the public policy issues raised by new technologies in the mobile and online spaces.  It is clear that some of the central policy issues for both consumers and companies are the issues of privacy and data collection.  </p><p>      Privacy continues to take on greater importance as more Americans not only use the Internet and mobile devices, but also share their personal information with companies on the web.  Privacy policies and the technological safeguards that companies implement will help guide consumers on what they should expect from those who handle their personal information and set expectations for companies that use personal data.  </p><p>      As Congress continues to look at privacy issues online, it is important to have a firm understanding of what the industry practices are.  Today's hearing will explore what mechanisms of private sector is currently employing to protect Internet and mobile users.  It will also highlight the technological innovation and development that has occurred in this space.  </p><p>      There have been astonishing advancements in the delivery of products and services online.  And as a result, there are privacy implications for a variety of new technologies, some of which were not even in existence a few years ago.  </p><p>      Many of the private -- many in the private sector already have policies and procedures in place to police themselves to ensure they are following best practices.  Groups like TRUSTe, the Association for Competitive Technology, the Application Developers Alliance, the advertising industry through its AdChoices program and others already help to provide best practices, independent analyses of privacy policies and recommendations for enhancements.  We will learn more about some of these groups' work in the field today.  </p><p>      As Congress begins to look into these issues, we need to realize that the technologies that we are discussing did not even exist a few years ago, and some have only come to the forefront in the past few months.  And with any new technology, it is important that as we think about how best to protect the interest of consumers and the Internet user community, we continue to encourage and not stifle innovation.  </p><p>      One of the most important things private sector companies can do to self-regulate and innovate when it comes to privacy is to make their notices and privacy policies easy to understand.  If the consumer understands that trade-off, he makes when he accepts an app program or service, then the consumer will make an informed decision. The easier it is for consumers to understand all privacy notices and policies, the easier it is for companies to compete on the basis of their privacy policies and the easier it is for consumers to vote with their wallets.  </p><p>      I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses on the efforts that they have taken to help build in privacy protections as they develop their products to safeguard consumer information about what more can be done to increase transparency and ensure that, as American companies seek to operate abroad in markets like Europe and Asia, innovation is not impeded by undue regulatory burdens or barriers to market access.  </p><p>      And with that, it's my pleasure to recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt.  </p><p>      WATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate you holding this hearing.  </p><p>      I believe that privacy is one of the most fundamental values of the American tradition.  Yet today, even a majority of the justices of the Supreme Court (inaudible) that, as a society, we are faced with novel challenges in determining the, quote, \"new normal,\" close quote, for privacy expectations in the digital age.  </p><p>      There's little doubt that the digital environment has created opportunities that society -- for society that often come at little or no financial cost to the user.  But I believe it is inappropriate to classify these opportunities and services as free.  </p><p>      Information is currency, and users are, without exception, required to surrender incredible amounts of personal information in exchange for the services they enjoy.  </p><p>      While Internet users have some responsibility to self-censor and restrict the intimate information they share on various platforms. The reality is that many online users have a false sense of privacy because they don't understand the lengthy and complex privacy policies they are compelled to agree to in order to use the service.  </p><p>      As a result online users often share lots of personal information unknowingly and to unintended audiences.  Their personal information has been marshaled, analyzed, and monetized in ways consumers have come to resent.  </p><p>      A March 2012 study by the Pew Research Center found that two- thirds of Internet users have negative views about search engines collecting information about them to produce personalized search results.  Two-thirds of Internet users also report that they, quote, \"are not OK with targeted advertising because they do not like having their own line behavior tracked and analyzed.\"</p><p>      I am further concerned that this type of consumer profiling may limit rather than enhance the experience and the horizons of distinct groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, and other factors that we are probably not even aware of yet.  If users are constantly fed products and facts in the areas in which they or someone like them have already expressed an interest, their intellectual curiosity and development may be stunted.  </p><p>      Earlier this year, both the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission completed reports following stakeholder participation to address mounting concern about consumer privacy.  </p><p>      The White House green paper enumerated seven broad principles that it urges be enacted into law as flexible baseline standards governing consumer privacy.  The green paper recommends that industry leaders develop specific codes of conduct to implement the consumer privacy principles.  </p><p>      The FTC's report takes the additional step of identifying best practices that could and, I believe, should serve as a guide for industry in developing the codes of conduct.        The administration has determined that the first round of stakeholder meetings will center on mobile applications, which raise serious questions about the security of data concerning children and geolocation information concerning all users.  Parents must be able to feel secured that the apps they download to educate or entertain their children aren't secretly collecting or sharing private data or location information from the host device.  </p><p>      Although some industry actors have been giving lip service to, and others have been really working to establish privacy standards and to provide users with better understanding of the ways in which the information is used, it seems clear to me that consumers remain in a vulnerable position in which they are required to place an enormous amount of blind trust in online companies and app developers.  </p><p>      Just last year -- just last week, the FTC announced an $800,000 settlement with Spokeo, a data broker that compiles vast amounts of information on consumers from both online and offline sources.  </p><p>      In the first FTC case to address the sale of data from the Internet and social media sites in the employment context, the FTC charged that Spokeo violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by marketing consumer profiles to recruiters and human resource professionals without regard to the accuracy of information and without advising the users how their information would be used.  The FTC was empowered to act because of the protections contained in the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  </p><p>      The FTC settlement was announced just as President Obama signed an executive order to lift the morass of federal policies and practices that impede broadband deployment on federal lands.  The executive order will not only lower the cost of broadband Internet access, it will also speed the delivery of connectivity to communities, businesses, and schools.  </p><p>      President Obama said in a statement, quote, \"By connecting every corner of our country to the digital age, we can help our businesses become more competitive and our students become more informed and our citizens become more engaged,\" close quote.  </p><p>      With greater access comes the responsibility to ensure that our citizens enjoy an online experience that is safe, reliable, and respectful of personal information.  So I support the direction the administration is taking us and continue to believe that Congress should enact baseline progressive legislation that will provide certainty to both consumers and companies, and promote a healthy online economy.  </p><p>      Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote years ago that, quote, \"Privacy is not a discrete commodity, possessed absolutely or not at all,\" close quote.  The devil is always in the details, but I hope that the witnesses will be able to address some of the best practices recommended by the FTC.  </p><p>      Finally, I am also concerned that without a baseline set of principles with the force of law, privacy policies may be used by larger players in an anticompetitive manner to drive smaller players and startups from the market to the detriment of online consumers.  </p><p>      I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and how -- about how we can embrace new technologies without discarding or abandoning the right to privacy.  And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  The chair thanks the gentleman and is pleased to recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Smith.  </p><p>      SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>America's economic success has been built on innovation.  Ten years ago, there was no such thing as Facebook or Twitter.  Just five years ago, there was no such thing as an iPhone or an app store. Today, mobile apps number in the hundreds of thousands and are largely developed by individual innovators and small businesses.  </p><p>      As new technologies have emerged like mobile apps, social media, online advertising, and data analytics, the cost for new business entry have come down, but as new websites and apps are developed, companies must work to ensure that they maintain the trust of their customers.  Trust is the essential element for consumers to adopt new apps or technologies.  </p><p>      When we hear about privacy breaches like what happened when Google collected large amounts of private data over Wi-Fi networks, we have to be concerned.  With every overcollection of privacy data, the first excuse is that the engineers or programmers went beyond what they were told to do.  That excuse may fly once, but ultimately it's neither the engineer's fault nor the programmer's fault, it's the company's.  </p><p>      In the Internet economy, online services are generally provided to consumers at little or no cost.  And behind these online services are hundreds or thousands of employees and millions of dollars in hardware and equipment.  </p><p>      The Internet economy runs on data.  There is an implicit bargain between an Internet service and a consumer that includes an exchange of information or data instead of cash.  When a consumer receives a free email account or a cloud storage space or uses a search engine, social media website or app, there is a collection of data that allows a company to construct their service and provide targeted advertising or related data analytic services to the consumer.  </p><p>      As Internet companies have developed new technologies, their privacy policies have had to evolve.  Many companies now institute privacy by design where privacy protections are built directly into their software and hardware products from the beginning. Incorporation of the best practices for privacy is essential as new products are developed online.  </p><p>      For example, I have read that Google and Apple are building even more detailed maps that rival defense satellite imagery.  Though this ensures that we will never get lost if we drive or walk through a new city, we also need to ensure that when images are taken in residential areas on people's backyards that their privacy is protected.  This is another place where privacy concern should not have to be raised by Congress or the media.  They should be addressed before the products are even announced.  </p><p>      The growth in smartphone use and mobile apps has created an entirely new business sector from Instagram to new mobile apps for established online websites and companies.  This new business sector is composed mostly of small businesses and individual programmers.  </p><p>      As we will here from our witnesses today, many of these small businesses are just a couple of software programmers, not two programmers and a lawyer.  And so they often need assistance from more established players as they work to incorporate privacy protections into their software.  </p><p>      The mobile and Internet playing field is broad, and specific technological protections may be unique to particular technologies. But as companies incorporate privacy protections into their services, it is important for them to provide privacy policies that are understandable and reasonable.  This way, it's clear to the consumer what the bargain is that they enter into when they use a website or mobile app.  </p><p>      I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses today, and I hope their testimony allows the subcommittee to learn how the technology industry works to incorporate balanced privacy protections that will inform and protect consumers.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      I'm now pleased to recognize the gentleman from Michigan, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers.  </p><p>      CONYERS:  Thank you.  Thank you, Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Watt.  </p><p>      This is a very important hearing.  And there are new services being offered online and through smartphones and other devices that largely depend on the continued gathering and use of personal information, which is ultimately turned into a product for sale.  </p><p>      And this hearing is -- is going to devolve, I think, into an issue of whether we get the self-regulation very advanced, we'll all be good and trust this committee or whether we're going to go along and develop the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights.  And -- and that's where we're going to end up because there is an explosion of the collection, dissemination of personal information.  And -- and therefore, these organizations have an incentive to collect as much data as possible about Internet users.  </p><p>      And what I think should come out of this hearing is the notion that consumers deserve to know how their data and privacy are being impacted by mobile and online platforms.  Today, we don't know that. And that's why this hearing by this subcommittee is extremely important.  </p><p>      The size and power of online companies allow them to obtain and aggregate many types of personal information.  Otherwise, why would Facebook be valued at a worth of $100 billion while the answer, in large part, is because of the treasured throw of personal information that they collect much of which like others -- other companies we don't know much about.  </p><p>      Now we -- we've been dealing with the size and power of online companies that allows them to obtain and aggregate all this personal information about users.  Google recently has had to change its privacy policies and there is concern about its ability to obtain information through an individual's use of various products the company offers.  There's so many different ways to get this information out there that it's -- that is when -- when they get it together, they have a far more information that is generally recognized.  </p><p>      And so I, for one, am interested in learning how we can increase the authority and the power of the Federal Trade Commission to take action against privacy violations.  The FTC, in my view, needs direct enforcement authority so that it may take action against those who violate consumer privacy even if a company doesn't violate its own published private policy.  </p><p>      And while companies should develop online guidelines, we must remember that enforcement is critical to consumer protection.  The FTC has the responsibility to ensure that competitors are not allowed to play by different rules.  </p><p>      And so, Mr. Chairman, thank you for allowing me to add my comment before the witnesses begin.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  I thank the gentleman for his comments.  Without objection, other members' opening statements will be made a part of the record.  </p><p>      We have a very distinguished panel of witnesses today.  Each of the witnesses' written statements will be entered into the record in its entirety.  And I ask that each witness summarize his testimony in five minutes or less.  </p><p>      To help you stay within that time, there is a timing light on your table.  When the light switches from green to yellow, you have one minute to conclude your testimony.  And when the light turn to red, well, that's it, it signals the witness' time has expired.  </p><p>      Before I introduce our witnesses, I'd like to understand and be sworn as is the custom of this committee.  Do you and each of you swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?  </p><p>      Thank you very much, and please be seated.  </p><p>      Our first witness is from the district of the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Lofgren.  And so it's my pleasure to yield to her for the purposes of introducing, Mr. Shipman.  </p><p>      LOFGREN:  Well, I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your courtesy in allowing me to introduce the associate general counsel of eBay that is, in fact, located in the 16th Congressional District.  </p><p>      Scott Shipman has been with eBay from the beginning.  In fact, he started at eBay in -- when he was a law student, and the one lawyer there was absolutely overwhelmed, and so he was there are the beginning to deal with the privacy policies of eBay.  And he is here to tell us about those successful policies.  </p><p>      He has -- as he said at our collective law school, he had done the right things without even knowing it back as a law student.  He now has first-hand experience with the privacy compliance and risk assessments at eBay, the cross-border data transfers including the E.U., the personal information transfers to corporate mergers and acquisitions and all the other privacy-related issues that this major corporation faces.  </p><p>      He teaches International Data Protection at Santa Clara University School of Law as a lecturer.  And he serves, along with me, on the High Tech Law Advisory Board at our mutual alma mater, Santa Clara Law School.  He coordinates the Legal High Technology Internship Program at eBay in connection with Santa Clara Law School, and he is a board member of the Consumer Privacy Law Forum.  </p><p>      He is a member of the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a member of the Chief Privacy Officers Council on Conference Board, as well as, of course, being admitted to the California State Bar.  </p><p>      I'm so glad he is here to share his expertise with us, and it's good to welcome you here, Scott, from the valley into D.C.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to introduce Scott.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Well, thank you, Ms. Lofgren.  And I've had the pleasure of speaking at the State of the Net West Conference, which has been hosted at Santa Clara University School of Law on a number of occasions.  </p><p>      So, Mr. Shipman, welcome.  </p><p>      Our second witness is Mr. Morgan Reed, executive director of the Association for Competitive Technology.  Mr. Reed specializes in technology issues and has been working closely with mobile app developers and companies on privacy issues for years.  </p><p>      Mr. Reed previously worked for a Taiwan-based trading company, handling North American sales operations.  He received his B.A. in political science from Arizona State University and did graduate research in Chinese at the University of Utah and the Shi Ta University in Taiwan.  I hope I have that pronounced correctly.  </p><p>      Our third witness, Mr. Chris Babel, is the CEO of TRUSTe, a leading company and authority on Internet trust and privacy. Previously, Mr. Babel served as senior vice-president and general manager of VeriSign's worldwide authentication services business, where he was responsible for strategy, sales, marketing product, and support.  He also manage VeriSign's SSL and manage Security Services business.  </p><p>      Earlier in his career, he worked at Morgan Stanley in their M&amp;A and corporate finance group.  Mr. Babel received his B.A. in mathematical methods in the social sciences and economics from Northwestern University.  </p><p>      And our fourth witness is Mr. James Grimmelman, professor of law at New York Law School.  Professor Grimmelmann studies technology issues relating to I.P., virtual worlds, search engines, online privacy and other topics.  </p><p>      Prior to law school, he worked as a programmer for Microsoft.  He received his J.D. from Yale Law School and his A.B. in Computer Science from Harvard College.  </p><p>      Welcome to you all, and we'll begin with Mr. Shipman.  </p><p>      Turn on that microphone and pull it close.  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  Excuse me.  Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Watt, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify about eBay Inc. and what we are doing to enable commerce and engender trust through the use of innovative consumer privacy protections.  </p><p>      My name is Scott Shipman and I am the associate general counsel and global privacy leader for eBay Inc.</p><p>eBay empowers and connects millions of buyers and sellers across the globe through eBay marketplaces, PayPal, GSI, and other -- and other mobile technology-based businesses.  Therefore, many people associate eBay and PayPal with enabling ecommerce.  </p><p>      However, it is important to note that eBay is not just about ecommerce, we are about commerce.  The traditional boundaries of offline and online retail are blurring.  We recognize that retailers and sellers of all sizes need a partner who will help them succeed in this rapidly changing consumer-driven environment.  We want them to succeed, and we are that partner.  </p><p>      Over the years we have learned one of the keys to success is engendering consumer trust and confidence.  A critical component of that trust is privacy.  It's hard to build consumer trust when you are not respectful of their personal information.  </p><p>      To foster that trust, we've had to meet customer privacy expectations with every product we offer.  </p><p>      I would like to take the next few minutes to highlight some of the successful privacy-related programs and products that have led to eBay being rated one of the most trusted companies for consumer privacy.        Since eBay's inception, our core privacy commitment is eBay will not sell the personal information of our customers to third parties for marketing purposes.  However, we also recognized consumers need more meaningful choices on how their data was used for behavioral- targeted advertising.  Therefore, eBay developed and implemented a program called AdChoice.  </p><p>      The AdChoice program works as follows -- third party advertisements on and off eBay have an AdChoice link.  When eBay users click on the link, they see a pop-up window that gives them the ability to specify their advertising preferences.  eBay users can also opt-out of receiving third party behaviorally-targeted ads, and read our privacy policy through that link.  eBay's AdChoice program offers a server-based mechanism, not their traditional cookie-based mechanism.  This means choices and preferences are permanently stored and not erased when a user clears their cookies.  </p><p>      PayPal and its shop without sharing design is another perfect example of innovative technology that encourages consumer privacy and consumer control.  The beauty of PayPal is it allows consumers to pay for a good or service without ever having to expose their credit card or bank account information to merchants.  Not only does this privacy- enhancing technology allow consumers to fully enjoy the convenience of online and mobile commerce, but it also allows merchants to receive payments without the cost and potential liability associated with processing and securing financial information.  It's a win-win for both consumers and merchants.  </p><p>      Looking now at the exciting mobile space, mobile applications and technology continue to grow in popularity and importance.  Through the launch of several new and exciting mobile applications eBay has experienced rapid growth in the mobile arena.  </p><p>      However, being a leader in mobile and geolocation technology is more than just offering cool new services.  It is also about balancing the needs and wants of the consumer against the creep factor that is sometimes associated with the collection and use of geolocation and mobile data.  </p><p>eBay is building mobile applications that offer the same transparency, choice, and level of privacy protection as our traditional Internet services.  eBay has made it a policy that all consumers must opt-in to turn on geo-location for all eBay Inc. mobile applications.  And we give consumers the ability to decide what communications and notifications they want to receive and how.  </p><p>      A perfect example of an eBay mobile application that encapsulates the privacy by design philosophy is WHERE.  WHERE provides personalized, hyper-local recommendations, offers, and deals to millions of mobile consumers.  WHERE does not associate personally identifiable information with location data without explicit consent. Finally, WHERE does not collect, maintain, or track consumer's location history.  </p><p>      I've talked a lot about technology, but my last example focuses on best practices and compliance.  In addition to eBay's privacy principles and the practices described in our privacy policies, eBay has established a set of corporate rules approved by the Luxembourg National Data Commission.  These corporate rules are a commitment to eBay to protect our users' personal information regardless of where the date resides.  Our corporate rules do not just protect the personally identifiable information of our European users, but of all eBay Inc. customers and employees globally.  eBay was actually the first ecommerce company to receive this approval and the first company to receive approval for employee and customer rules.  </p><p>      To conclude, we recognize that privacy is a key component of our customers' experience and the trust they place with us.  As technology changes, as the world changes, expectations will continue to change. eBay's role is not to guarantee absolute privacy in a vacuum, but to build a relationship based on trust.  It is our hope that in the years to come, the trust within that relationship will only grow stronger, and our customers will know and trust that we'll get it done right.  </p><p>      I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to testify before the committee today, and I look forward to your questions.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Thank you, Mr. Shipman.  </p><p>      Mr. Reed, welcome.  </p><p>      REED:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Watt, members of the committee, my name is Morgan Reed, and I want to thank you for having today's hearing on new technologies and innovations in the mobile and online space, and the implications for public policy.  </p><p>      My organization, the Association for Competitive Technology is an international trade association representing more than 5,000 app developers.  We make the cool apps that run on your smartphone and your iPads, and hopefully the new Microsoft tablet and the next device after that.  </p><p>      I am a licensed developer too, having worked on network protocols and debugging games so I have actually dug into the nitty-gritty of how you build software programs.  Here's the great news.  </p><p>      Our industry is showing amazing growth.  We have hit more than $20 billion today on an expected path to $100 billion by 2015.  </p><p>      Apps are expanding into new markets, including enterprise and mobile health which will help make Americans more efficient at work and healthier at home.  And while Americans own more than $350 million mobile devices, developers are seeing real potential in foreign markets.  </p><p>      China's largest telecommunications has more than 800 million subscribers; the number two, 200 million; the number three, 100 million.  With adequate intellectual property protection, those subscribers could become customers for our American developers.  </p><p>      Now I understand this committee would like to spend some time today talking about consumer data privacy and how we make it work in this new more mobile world.  </p><p>      What we have learned in working through several multi-stakeholder efforts is that we need to address privacy in a comprehensive way, not one that creates siloed solutions for each technology especially since those silos are disappearing every day.  </p><p>      The biggest revolution in our industry is happening right now and it's called responsive design.  Technology is giving us the tools to make one app that will look good on a mobile device and will also look good on a television.  And we'll do so seamlessly.  </p><p>      Everyone in the technology industry has to take part and be responsible for improving the state of privacy security and transparency across all of these industries and devices.  Our app developers are no different, and we're committed to working this out with government, industry, civil society, and most importantly, our customers.  </p><p>      During the past year, ACT has reached out to our membership and other developer organizations throughout America to discuss the importance of data privacy.  We've gone coast to coast and have reached hundreds of thousands of developers.  Our message has been simple -- know what data you're collecting, know who you are sharing that data with, and be transparent with your customers.  </p><p>      We have also been participating in multi-stakeholder efforts, including the California AG's work on mobile platforms and the White House NTIA multi-stakeholder effort.  </p><p>      But throughout all these talk about stakeholders.  I realize that this can easily be seen to imply large faceless corporations.  I wanted you to remember today that the incredible innovation happening is being driven by thousands of small businesses working to build applications that educate, motivate, and enrich people's lives.  </p><p>      Therefore, I thought it would take a minute to introduce you to some of the stakeholders whose voices we are working to have heard throughout these efforts.  </p><p>      Chairman Goodlatte, in your district, Vision Studios produced TextGauge.  It's an app for parents to prevent teens from texting while driving.  </p><p>      Congressman Watt, in your district, we've got Monster Physics. It's a great app that makes app -- that makes Physics fun and is available for -- for adults as well as kids.  </p><p>      Congressman Conyers, in your district, JackApps is building the app for the Detroit International Jazz Festival.  It's an -- it's an amazing application.  </p><p>      Congressman Smith, in your district, m-Patient Solutions (sic) helps patients navigate the health care system by giving them tools to better understand diagnosis and treatment options.  </p><p>      Congressman Marino, we have Social Meetup app done by MeetMe in your district.  </p><p>      Congressman Quayle, in your district, we have a brand new entrant, ABN, just won the contract for the 2012 PGA Phoenix Open. And that will have location-based technology to allow you to go on the ground navigation with the spectators.  </p><p>      Congressman Deutch, in your district, one of our members, Dave Norter (ph), built an app for Big Brothers and Big Sisters that allows bigs to know activities that they should be looking at doing with their littles.  </p><p>      Congressman Griffin has Order Pad.  It allows medical personnel to display in-patient and observation data to help streamline patient care and it's aimed at rural districts.  </p><p>      Congresswoman Chu, in your district, Awesome app does -- it's for electricians and engineers that helps them do their job more efficiently and importantly more safely.  </p><p>      Congressman Chaffets, you've got one of the biggest -- biggest dogs in the fight.  Infinity Blade II is built in your district -- millions of downloads.  And it's built by a very small company right in your district.  </p><p>      Congresswoman Lofgren, we've got a great app in Pinger.  It allows people to send free text messages all across the world without having to necessarily have a specific text plan.  </p><p>      Congressman Poe has got iTaxable that provides answers to your tax filing questions and an extensive database of information.  </p><p>      Congressman Jordan, you've got Ranch Rush.  It's a game that puts a farm in your pocket, allowing users to harvest fresh produce, gather eggs from ostriches, collect honey from bees and whip up ketchup from tomatoes.  </p><p>      Congressman Nadler has got one that helps you sign your signature on your iPad instead of having to find a fax machine.  </p><p>      So I think as we think about today's questions about stakeholders, we need to remember that in every single one of your districts and in every district here in Congress, there's a small business stakeholder whose voices we need to have heard as part of this privacy discussion.  </p><p>      Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Thank you, Mr. Reed.  </p><p>      Mr. Babel, welcome.  </p><p>      BABEL:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Watt, and distinguished members of the subcommittee, my name is Chris Babel, and I am the chief executive officer of TRUSTe, a leading provider of privacy technology and certification solutions to online companies.  </p><p>      Based in San Francisco, TRUSTe offers a suite of privacy solutions to help businesses increase customer trust and engagement across all their websites, mobile applications, online advertising and cloud-based services.  Over 5,000 companies such as Apple, AT&amp;T, Disney, eBay, and Yelp rely on TRUSTe to ensure compliance with evolving and complex privacy requirements and to build trust with consumers.  </p><p>      I would like to highlight three topics in my remarks before the subcommittee today -- first, the consumer privacy perspective; second, new privacy challenges and technologies TRUSTe and others offer to address them; third, why we think that self-regulation has been successful in protecting consumers online.  </p><p>      First, through consumer research we submitted in the written testimony, we know that consumers are concerned about privacy online and both their P.C. and mobile devices.  Take mobile, for example, where 74 percent of consumers believe it is very or extremely important to understand what personal information a mobile application collects.  </p><p>      Eighty-five percent want to be able to opt-in or opt-out of targeted mobile ads.  These concerns are causing the consumer to become more engaged in their privacy decisions and more likely to take control of when and how their data is collected and used.  </p><p>      Research also highlighted that 59 percent of consumers generally trust that websites are protecting their privacy online, showing that businesses can build trust and alleviate privacy concerns through investments in privacy best practice and privacy technologies.  </p><p>      Second, there is explosive growth in privacy services offered to consumers.  In TRUSTe's first 12 years in existence through 2009, we grew it from offering one to four services focused on website privacy only.  In the past 2-1/2 years, we have launched over 10 new services spanning websites, mobile applications, online advertising, and cloud services.  </p><p>      Taking mobile as an example since all of you carry mobile devices, the challenges are that less than one-third of mobile applications have a privacy policy today.  And when they do, they're difficult to read and need to handle sensitive topics like location information.  </p><p>TRUSTe offers application providers a free mobile privacy policy generator, as well as paid services to certify that mobile applications have strong privacy as well as notice and choice mechanisms for consumers regarding mobile ad targeting.  </p><p>      There have also been entirely new industry efforts like the Digital Advertising Alliance that have been formed to provide consumers notice and choice around online targeted advertising. TRUSTe is the largest independent provider of services for the DAA. We have also partnered with the Application Developers Alliance to educate mobile developers on important privacy issues as part of a countrywide educational road show.  </p><p>      Technology is evolving more rapidly than ever, and solutions for consumer privacy protection are keeping pace.  </p><p>      Third, self-regulation is a critical component to online privacy and TRUSTe has helped thousands of companies self-regulate their online privacy for 15 years.  Self-regulation is valuable and that it helps companies facilitate global best practices, which simplifies the management and cost of these programs while increasing accountability. </p><p>      Self-regulation can also evolve with technology changes to meet the ongoing needs of consumers.  </p><p>      And finally, through safe harbors and due process, self- regulation can provide strong incentives for compliance.  </p><p>      Looking forward, it's clear the consumers are becoming ever more aware of how their personal data is collected and used online, which is important as technology changes like the decreased cost of bandwidth, computer processing and storage allow for the analysis and use of vast databases of information.  </p><p>      Self-regulation provides a flexible privacy protection framework that can quickly adapt to these rapidly changing technologies.  To date, industry has made great progress in self-regulating their privacy practices.  I know there is much work to be done.  We are confident that the goal of protecting consumers while continuing to innovate will be achieved.  </p><p>      Thank you for the opportunity to testify today.  I look forward to your questions.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Thank you, Mr. Babel.  </p><p>      And Professor Grimmelmann, you get the last words.  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  I would like to thank Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Watt, and all of the members of the subcommittee for inviting me to testify today.  My name is James Grimmelmann, and I am a professor at New York Law School.  Although I am happy to respond to any of the subcommittee's questions on any of its topics, my testimony today will focus on privacy.  </p><p>      The central goal for privacy policy online and on mobile devices must be empowered consumer choice.  Good privacy technologies and good privacy laws enable people to choose whether, when, and how open they want to be about their lives.  I would like to endorse three essential principles for making real consumer choice a reality.  </p><p>      The first is usability.  A choice that consumers do not know about, cannot find, or cannot understand is no choice at all.  </p><p>      The second is reliability. A consumer who has expressed a choice is entitled to expect that it will be respected.  </p><p>      And the third is innovation for privacy.  Users benefit from good tools to help them manage their privacy.  </p><p>      A good example of these principles in action is social networks. Their value depends on controlled access.  Everything from a private email from a mother with advice to her daughter in college to a confidential discussion group for recovering alcoholics requires sharing with some people, but not with others.  </p><p>      The proliferation of social networks with different technical models of sharing represents innovation for privacy in action, but that privacy must also be usable and reliable.  People have lost jobs, been stalked, and then splashed across the tabloids because privacy settings on social networks were too confusing for them to understand. </p><p>      I am particularly concerned about what I have called privacy lurches -- sudden and unexpected shifts in a social network information sharing practices.  For example, Google mishandled the launch of its Buzz social network in 2010.  Without clear warning, Google exposed the names of users' email contacts to the world.  This made Google Buzz, in one reporter's words, a danger zone for reporters, psychiatrists, lawyers, and everyone else for whom confidentiality is essential to their job.  </p><p>      The Buzz rollout violated the principle of reliability.  It changed Gmail's privacy practices in a way that users could not have anticipated and that was capable of causing significant harm to them. A Federal Trade Commission investigation resulted in a settlement designed to prevent similar mistakes from happening again.  And I also suggested that privacy lurches may expose companies to legal liability for distributing an unreasonably dangerous product.  </p><p>      Another example of the principles is online behavioral advertising -- the use of unique identifiers known as cookies to track users and to customize the ads they see.  Some users appreciate receiving relevant advertising.  Others find the tracking creepy.  </p><p>      Industry participants recognize there's difference in opinions and offer users a choice of whether to be tracked.  One of the best ways to ensure that these choices are usable and reliable is through innovation for privacy -- promoting the developmentive (ph) tools that users can use to manage their tracking preferences and express them clearly to websites and advertisers.  </p><p>      The best innovation here has come from web browsers, antivirus software, and plug-ins that help users block and delete unwanted cookies.  In the current consensus process, to develop a Do Not Track standard is another encouraging step.  All of these innovations can succeed only if they are respected by websites and advertisers.  </p><p>      The Federal Trade Commission has taken important action against companies that circumvent user privacy protecting technologies, and the FTC and Congress should ensure that websites are not permitted the second-guess users' expressed privacy preferences.  </p><p>      Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today, and I look forward to your questions.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Thank you, Professor Grimmelmann.  We'll now begin the questioning of the witnesses.  </p><p>      I believe that consumers have the relevant information about if they have the relevant information about privacy policies, they'll make informed decisions about how to allow their information be used, and will choose what services to use in part based on their comfort level with those privacy policies.  So I'd like to ask each of you what your organization is doing specifically to make privacy policies more transparent and easier for consumers to understand.  </p><p>      And we'll start with you, Mr. Shipman.  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  Sure.  Thank you.  </p><p>      The -- the expectations in managing privacy with consumers is a never-ending battle.  It's not something that you can simply come out with a particular policy and say, OK, we've written this as clearly as possible, and we can rest on our laurels.  So this is something that continues to evolve.  </p><p>      From the inception of eBay's privacy program, we've actually created, in 1998, a chart.  And at the time, it was fairly simple because you could have a chart with three or four classifications or groups of entities that you share information...</p><p>      GOODLATTE:  I'm going to have to get you to get to the point because I've got several questions and several witnesses to answer.  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  The...</p><p>      GOODLATTE:  So tell us what you're doing right now and prospectively.  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  Absolutely.  The focus right now is around bringing icons, bringing specific logos or vignettes whether it would be a video or other types of embracing new technology to be able to answer questions that customers have. AdChoices is a perfect example where we have links that are embedded into advertising and other types of things like that.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Excellent.  </p><p>      Mr. Reed?  </p><p>      REED:  So we have -- we have an interesting situation is that we represent the developers, and so we've been trying to give developers tools.  </p><p>      We have run a series of privacy boot camps where we spend the entire day focusing on getting a developer from walking in the door, saying, OK, I need this privacy policy so when they walk out the door not only having privacy, but understanding the tools they need to have to have a narrative with their customers.  </p><p>      And very specifically, one of the ones I'd like to highlight is our work with Moms With Apps where we've created set of icons that have been adopted by some of the privacy policy generators, including PrivacyChoice and we've been in talks with TRUSTe as well, so the developer can select the icons immediately when they build their privacy policy.  So when it shows up for the user -- bam -- they can see it.  It doesn't collect information.  It doesn't link to the web or it does.  </p><p>      So, one, we have to empower developers.  And two, we're working on building tools to inform our customers what those privacy policies mean.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Mr. Babel?  </p><p>      BABEL:  Sure.  So, TRUSTe helps websites, through a privacy policy generator, generate their first privacy policy.  Big companies might have attorneys to do that.  Small companies start up three people in their garage need help.  </p><p>      Particularly around mobile applications, we find that it's critical, as I mentioned in the testimony, about a third of mobile application even have a privacy policy today.  So we're really trying to help people start by having a privacy policy.  </p><p>      The second thing we do is once people have privacy policies, we help make certain that they're good, of high quality, clear, transparent, easy to read, easy to understand.  And that's where we help a company have a certified privacy policy where we say it meets a good high bar, and that the company is following and actually doing what their privacy policy states.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Mr. Reed, many Internet services are free and are monetized through targeted adds and data collection.  How much would app prices go up or what would it cost to use a search engine or a social media website if companies were restricted from the data that they could collect?  </p><p>      REED:  Well, I think we have to look at two sets of numbers. One, what does it change in the way that we develop apps?  And two, when it comes to the actual impact on the industry, if you remove all ads all together, I think you'd see some enormous impacts.  If you remove strictly ads that use information and you just do context-based ads, the estimate run about 20 percent -- a loss of about 20 percent of income for those that are ads-supported.  </p><p>      The reality is that the model right now, we're looking at trying to figure out how to -- how to make sure that we get apps that we get paid directly and -- and supplement through advertising.  So this probably would cost us about 20 percent of revenue.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Mr. Babel?  </p><p>      BABEL:  I think one of the key unique factors in mobile versus websites just to point out quickly is that mobile actually has a monetization mechanism where you can go back to the extent that someone were to opt-out of ad targeting and go back and say, I am limiting the features of this mobile and pushing you to a charge version.  </p><p>      In the website version of the world -- in that ecosystem, you know, 15 years ago, we started giving out free content online and it would be very hard to go back to that paywall.  </p><p>      As we've read industry research although haven't ended ourselves, we've seen similar numbers to those that Morgan has proposed in terms of the drop-off in advertising, but it's not something that we track and have estimated direct.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Let me ask the three of you what your greatest concerns are about the European Union's recent efforts to impose regulatory regime in Europe.  </p><p>      Mr. Shipman?  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  I think the -- the challenge within the E.U. is certainly that we're looking for standards that create international operability.  And so any change in one particular region for a global company destabilizes that operability.  And while we certainly have received approval through the binding corporate rules for operations in Europe and use that as our global standard, changes in that and more restrictions in that certainly make that much more difficult for us.  </p><p>      REED:  We're short on time, so I'm going to echo Chairman Smith when he said the problem we have with it is just the same.  We are not two developers in -- in a garage -- we're two developers in a garage, not two developers and a lawyer.  The difference between us and Europe will create a lot of difficulties for our developers.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Mr. Babel?  </p><p>      BABEL:  Yes, our clients whether they'd be domestic clients or international clients are challenged by the fact that there are just different requirements by country.  And you are a big company and trying to manage your portfolio of websites across users from each different region, it is challenging to implement technologies to address that.  </p><p>      It's a lot of hard work -- it's a lot of hard work upfront.  And to be honest with you, most companies have not met the deadline for the U.K. Cookie Audit Compliance that was May 25th.  In fact, most government agencies in the U.K. have not met that deadline as well. So it gives you a sense for the challenges that are involved with this policy implementation (inaudible).  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Mr. Grimmelman?  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  Well, as the others have mentioned, the lack of harmony across many countries is a significant problem, and it leads to situations in which especially the small players have difficulty even finding out all the laws they need to comply with.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Thank you.  </p><p>      The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt, is recognized.  </p><p>      WATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      The ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Conyers, raised a difficult issue that I want to ask some questions in here relating to legislation versus self-regulation.  The administration's blueprint contemplates baseline legislation complemented by self-regulatory model to implement the Consumers Bill of Rights.  So let me ask a couple of questions in this area.  </p><p>      Do we, in fact, need a federal Consumer Bill of Rights or something maybe not called at, but some federal baseline in this area to deal with privacy.  And if not, two questions arise.  Wouldn't that leave it open in this Internet thing which clearly is across state borders or state by state by state to enact legislation?  And wouldn't that leave it open for self-regulation which is OK if people behave, but is not all that enforceable?  And if people do not behave, I guess, is -- is the question.  </p><p>      So, Mr. Shipman, Mr. Reed, Mr. Babel, and Professor, if you can address those couple of questions in there, I'd be appreciative to you.  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  Absolutely and thank you for the question.  </p><p>      I think the challenges, as you highlight, is with self-regulation it leaves consumers with uncertainty.  With -- eBay has long supported a federal omnibus privacy bill.  And the -- the key reasons for that are largely to provide the small and -- and -- and large businesses that we do business with to provide that level of certainty.  </p><p>      WATT:  So -- so you think there should be a federal -- federal standard of some kind?  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  Yes, we do.  </p><p>      WATT:  Yeah.  OK.  Go ahead.  </p><p>      REED:  Yes, we have been active supporters of the NTIA effort. And I do think, as we get through this, we should talk about ways that the government can enforce bad behavior.  I definitely think that's something where, from a small -- from a particular small business, it's very important to see the government step in and bring harsh actions against companies that do violate people's privacy because nothing gets the message clearer to our members.  </p><p>      WATT:  Of course, the first step is to have a clear...</p><p>      REED:  Yeah.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      WATT:  ...set of rules about what -- what the standards are.  </p><p>      REED:  Exactly.  And so...</p><p>      WATT:  OK.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      REED:  ...yes on that, good on enforcement.  </p><p>      WATT:  OK.  </p><p>      BABEL:  I think we've seen, at TRUSTe, self-regulation work and work effectively.  And in particular, over the last few years with the beginnings of the DAA effort around AdChoices, you've seen self- regulation accelerate quite rapidly in the last few years to take out -- reach out and touch consumers and give them...</p><p>      WATT:  So what happens in self-regulation if -- if you -- if you got self-regulation and you don't -- you or your members or your customers or clients don't live up to what they agreed?  What are the -- what remedies do I have to enforce that or who enforces those standards?  </p><p>      BABEL:  Sure.  So in TRUSTe's case where we certify companies for good privacy, the first thing we do if there is an issue at one of those clients is help them get back into alignment with our guidelines for...</p><p>      WATT:  Got that, but my -- my data is already out there at that point.  So how do -- how do I get a remedy?  </p><p>      BABEL:  The second thing we do is eliminate them from the program and, in fact, last year we eliminated...</p><p>      WATT:  That still don't give any remedy.  </p><p>      BABEL:  The third remedy that we put in place to the extent that there is egregious behavior is we haven't factored for people to the FTC, and the FTC has taken action.  </p><p>      WATT:  So there's got to be a -- got to be a federal standard.  </p><p>      BABEL:  There has -- yes, we have...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      WATT:  OK.  All right.  OK.  I'm going to refer to it.  We're back there.  All right.  </p><p>      Go ahead, Professor.  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  A federal baseline would first bring important clarity to the area.  And in addition, all of the processes of consumer choice and bargaining with websites offer bargains to users and explain the tradeoffs only work if the consumers have an entitlement to their privacy to begin with.  </p><p>      If we don't have a baseline, then they don't need to respect it.        WATT:  All right.  Has anybody out there in the industry that is advocating for no federal baseline?  Are there any voices out there or do you all represent pretty much the standard belief?  If so, it seems to me, we can quit vexing about whether we need a baseline and start vexing about what we put in the baseline.  Is that right?  </p><p>      Anybody out there got a different opinion about this, I mean, I guess is the question.  </p><p>      REED:  I guess, the only nuance that I would add is that the good part about what NTIA is doing and it will be a lot of work is that it's being built bottom up as a multi-stakeholder effort where we're going through long intense meetings talking about the meanings of words and the definitions.  So it's actually working from the standpoint of what technology is capable of doing and gives us the option to change it as we become capable of doing new things.  </p><p>      So I think it's important that it not be a government-imposed top-down pressure, but it'd be developed by technologists as a way to handle when we change our stuff.  </p><p>      WATT:  In the meantime, the laws that are already out there, I assume the gaps of the laws that are already out there that provides some -- some kind of protection.  </p><p>      REED:  I would say it's more than some.  I think...</p><p>      WATT:  Yeah.  </p><p>      REED:  ...the Federal Trade Commission has already shown that it has some teeth.  We have -- we obviously have regulation on HIPAA.  We have regulation on (inaudible).  So depending on what kind of data you have, there are more than a fair number of regulation.  </p><p>      Beyond that, this committee knows we also have antitrust laws to deal with companies that are large players that clearly disregard people's privacy time and time again.  So if you can't curb the behavior through FTC, you can always go and look at antitrust as well. </p><p>      WATT:  Mr. Chairman, my time has expired, but as I told the chairman, I will have to leave to go over and hear Jamie Dimon testify in my other committee.  So let me make a unanimous consent request before I leave, Mr. Chairman, to offer into the record the February 2012 White House green paper commercial data privacy and Innovation in the Internet Economy:  A Dynamic Policy Framework.  Number two, a March 2012 FTC proposal -- whatever -- protected report, protecting consumer privacy in an era of rapid change recommendations for businesses and policymakers.  And a March 2012 report Search Engine Use 2012 a project of the Pew Research Center.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Without objection, those will be entered into the record.  And I'll turn the chair over to the chairman of the committee.  </p><p>      SMITH:  Mr. Babel, let me address my first question to you after you've already answered my initial question as -- in response to a question by Mr. Watt, but I wanted to follow up on the idea of how enforcement worked when it came to individual online businesses that might violate the best practices.  And you responded to Mr. Watt and said, ultimately, if there was a clear violation and there wasn't any response, you'd refer the online businesses to the Federal Trade Commission, I think.  Have you ever had occasion to do that?  </p><p>      BABEL:  Yes, we have.  </p><p>      SMITH:  And how many instances?  </p><p>      BABEL:  There's been one instance that is in my knowledge -- one instance in 2008 of a company called Classic Closeouts which...</p><p>      SMITH:  And what do the FTC do?  </p><p>      BABEL:  They took action.  It was settled, I think, late last year with a $2 million plus fine.  </p><p>      SMITH:  OK.  And how many online businesses, in your judgment, have violated the best practices that you have endorsed?  </p><p>      BABEL:  So last year, in our written testimony, we provided something called the transparency report, where we walk through a number of customers in, number of certification.  </p><p>      SMITH:  Right.  </p><p>      BABEL:  In each year, I think there's two important data points, one is the number of companies that come to us for certification in an effort to get certified because they don't pass the standards to begin with.  And that is about eight to ten percent of all the clients that are approaching us for certification -- never meet the bar.  </p><p>      The second thing is that, in last year, 11 companies violated kind of what we think are best practices.  </p><p>      SMITH:  OK.  And of those 11 you referred went to the FTC?  </p><p>      BABEL:  Not last year.  The referral to the FTC was in a prior year.  </p><p>      SMITH:  Right, OK.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Babel.  </p><p>      Mr. Shipman, let me address a question to you and perhaps to Professor Grimmelmann as well.  And it is this, we've heard, I think, from all witnesses today about the need for online businesses to protect consumer data.  My question goes a little bit farther -- should consumers be able to find out what personal data has been gathered about them.  </p><p>      BABEL:  Absolutely.  </p><p>      SMITH:  OK.  </p><p>      BABEL:  And, in fact, within our corporate standards that we've had approved through Luxembourg, that is a requirement that we meet.  </p><p>      SMITH:  OK.  Do any of the witnesses today feel that consumers should not or do not have a right to know what personal information has been gathered about them?  </p><p>      OK.  The next question is, should consumers be able to opt-out of the process that gathers that personal information about them?  </p><p>      Mr. Shipman, what do you think?  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  Let me give you a multi-part answer on that one.  </p><p>      SMITH:  OK.  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  There are certain components of collection that are required.  eBay certainly has financially-related institutions.  We process financial transactions as well as all kinds of ecommerce transactions and commerce.  </p><p>      The data that is essential for the safety, the security, antifraud in that area, we cannot allow consumers to opt-out. Certainly for marketing purposes and other types of secondary uses, we can allow...</p><p>      SMITH:  You would allow them to opt-out.  OK.  Thank you.  </p><p>      Professor Grimmelmann, do you have an opinion on that?  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  In the context of first party collection where the consumer is dealing with a website...</p><p>      SMITH:  Yes.  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  ...their shipment expresses a very clear and correct view.  </p><p>      SMITH:  You agree with him?  OK.  </p><p>      That concludes my questions.  The gentleman from Michigan, the ranking member of the full committee is recognized for his questions.  </p><p>      CONYERS:  Thank you, Chairman.  </p><p>      CONYERS:  Mr. Reed, we've heard a lot about self-regulation here too much as far as I'm concerned.  I don't know what you think this committee -- what some -- some others -- not you -- think that we make rules, we make laws, we have court decisions.  And now we come up with let's go for self-regulation.  </p><p>      We've been hauling -- all of the big tech companies have been in and out of court repeatedly.  And so, can you give me a little more confidence about this whole notion of self-regulating?  </p><p>      REED:  Well, I think the -- the first thing we have to look at is does the FTC have enough resources.  We start with that.  But I think you also have to look at continued behavior.        There's carrot and stick, right?  Industry self-reg is a carrot. Do this and you won't get the stick.  I think that, for small companies, we all usually dependent on platforms and we are incredibly responsive to our customers.  Why?  Because we're scared of losing them.  </p><p>      I think one of the things that -- that concerns us very much that's been happening in the privacy space is that some of the violations have been actually done by big companies and one, in particular, you know, the chairman brought up WhySpy.  That trickles down into the sentiment of the regular citizenry.  So, yes, I think it's critical that the resources are at the FTC and that the DOJ is willing to step up and go after those who don't respond to carrot and don't respond to stick.  </p><p>      CONYERS:  Yeah.  But -- but, Mr. Reed, a lot -- a lot of this privacy, we don't even know what's being collected, and -- and we don't have any way of getting at it.  I mean, I -- I see a huge problem...</p><p>      REED:  Well, I think...</p><p>      CONYERS:  ...still out here, don't you?  </p><p>      REED:  Well, I think the question of what's being collected, I think we can actually figure -- figure out what's being collected. The larger question is, what happens to it after it's collected?  What is it combined with?  Does that create problems in our people selling it in a way that's -- that's damaging or causes harm to people -- to people's privacy?  Does it make it hard for them to get a job?  Does it make it hard for them to buy a house?  That's really the question.  </p><p>      It's not what's collected, it's what's done with the collection of that information after, how it's assembled.  And those are areas where I think that there can be questions, and -- and we should find good answers.  </p><p>      CONYERS:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>      Well, we know what's being collected -- everything.  Is there anything that they -- I mean, that's -- that's the nature of the problem.  I...</p><p>      REED:  But -- but I think it's worth noting that the Sears Catalog had information on people in the 1900's.  They knew what we were buying, and it's really about what's done to harm people afterwards.  That's really the kicker because, you know, we all had the Sears Catalog.  There's a kid in our house and he would read it.  </p><p>      Sears knew what you bought.  They kept a record of what you bought -- that was a good thing -- to know what they did with that information, prevented you from buying a house or prevented you from getting a job, or prevented you from getting insurance.  </p><p>      CONYERS:  Or hurting your credit.  </p><p>      REED:  Exactly.  </p><p>      CONYERS:  Let me turn to Professor Grimmelmann for a continuation of this discussion.  I mean, this is a very nice conversation we're having here with four experts.  But I mean, there is a certain element here of let's all trust everybody to do the right thing.  </p><p>      The FTC is underfunded.  Leibowitz -- Jon Leibowitz, the chair, comes before us every year and makes the case that they need more resources.  How -- how do you see this discussion of a -- of a giving benefit to the doubt to these huge companies that are collecting what we don't even -- well, from my point of view is everything.  </p><p>      We go -- we go back to Sears in 1900.  Guess what they're doing now if you think that was something.  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  I would like to say that some huge companies can play an important role in building tools that stop other huge companies from gathering lots of data.  </p><p>      So, for example, Apple puts significant restrictions in the iPhone that limit the data that apps can collect.  So the apps can't gather location data without the users' expressed permission.  And Microsoft is bumbling in its most recent version of the Internet Explorer will be turning on the Do Not Track header by default to tell websites they should not collect data about users.  </p><p>      We can find ways to exploit the competitive process in the industry, to have companies recognize privacy as an advantage, and help consumers keep personally from other companies.  </p><p>      CONYERS:  But there are some that are disregarding the tracking instructions of their consumers.  You know that.  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  So, the advantage of that is that the company disregard the tracking request has now done something that's explicitly deceiving the consumer and failing to respond to the request rather than just taking advantage of their ignorance, which gives the FTC a surer basis for action.  </p><p>      CONYERS:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Thank you, Mr. Conyers.  </p><p>      The gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Marino, is recognized for his questions.  </p><p>      MARINO:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      I'm going to start with Mr. Shipman, and let's back the bus up here a little bit if you would please.  And if anyone has anything to add to it, just chime in.  </p><p>      Let's start back with the scenario.  A parent is having a personal conversation with their son or daughter who is off to college, or a corporate -- one corporation is having a confidential exchange of information with another corporation concerning, let's say, a merger.  </p><p>      Once this information -- once I hit that Send button, let's educate the people of where does that go and how many people or how many entities have access to that even when I hit the Delete and the other side hits the Delete.  Do you understand my question?  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  Yeah, sure.  Basically, the -- your question just to quickly summarize is when you hit Send on an email, how many different entities could have possibly end up with?  </p><p>      MARINO:  Even after I delete it.  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  Sure, sure.  To me, the biggest challenge here -- I mean, there are many challenges.  eBay is not an ISP.  We actually don't provide email, but I'm knowledgeable enough to be able to provide a few comments.  </p><p>      One of the toughest components here is access where you have other governmental agencies or law enforcement or other requests where the consumer may have no knowledge of that information being requested.  Beyond the technology components it is then deleted within the systems, within service providers, within a custodial relationship.  </p><p>      MARINO:  OK.  I understand the law enforcement aspect of it. I've been part of it for 19 years.  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  OK.  </p><p>      MARINO:  So, just give me -- give me your best estimate on how many entities would have that information?  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  Go ahead.  </p><p>      REED:  I think -- I think let's break it in (inaudible).  Is your service a cloud-based or you're just going from -- from my company to your company?  If you're going company to company, not too many -- not too many entities in between will hold on to it, but he raises a key point, which is part of actual reform of these questions is that law enforcement has stepped in to place -- to place collection points in the process.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      MARINO:  OK.  Let's exclude law enforcement for a moment.  </p><p>      REED:  If you include law enforcement company to company, not much.  If it's company to cloud provider and back, then the cloud provider does have access to that information at a certain level. Most...</p><p>      MARINO:  OK.  Now, so there are several entities even if it's company to company.  How long is that individual or that entity have that information?  Until they just delete it?  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  Sure.  So, once an email or any -- any other piece of data is received, it's within that -- if it's a responsible company, they have a data classification and data retention policies.  </p><p>      MARINO:  OK.  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  So depending on the classification of that data, it may be seven days, it may be seven years.  </p><p>      MARINO:  All right.  I'll be jumping to the next one.  Who -- who best can answer this?  What would prevent an employee from obtaining that information and sharing it?  </p><p>      REED:  It depends on -- it depends on their status in the corporation.  Somebody who's got the key to the kingdom, so to speak, then the network nerd in the closet, he's going to have all of it.  </p><p>      MARINO:  So my point is...</p><p>      REED:  Right.  </p><p>      MARINO:  ...people have access to it and can use nefariously, correct?  </p><p>      REED:  Yes.  That's -- yes.  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  There is an important consideration here, which is there are tools that certain companies, certainly eBay want to deploy which do monitor and track access to information within the organization.  So not only are employees based on permission have access or don't have access to information, but also if there is anomalous activity, it's detected, reported, and prevented.  </p><p>      MARINO:  Mr. Babel and then Professor, maybe you can give me a quick answer on the -- on this?  </p><p>      I'm an individual that questions do we want the federal government involved.  The fact I think the position that the federal government spends too much time in our lives to begin with.  So, give me, Mr. Babel, if you can please, give me your opinion based on the fact that can the industry police itself.  I have a little problem with the Fox (ph) setting rules and regulations for the (inaudible). But give me a scenario, if you would contrast them, policing itself and meeting federal regulations.  </p><p>      So if you both can answer that please, Mr. Babel?  </p><p>      BABEL:  Sure.  So I think that it's, you know, as TRUSTe has self-regulatory programs, the key asset that we have is our band of consumers.  So if we aren't living up to the standard of making certain that people who no longer follow the standard are out, like for us, it's the whole company we're betting.  </p><p>      MARINO:  OK.  </p><p>      BABEL:  Our credibility is the key, meaning the program and its credibility is the key.  </p><p>      I think when it comes to legislation, one of the things that I am concerned about is just, you know, do we -- what are the unintended consequences of legislation.  If you look at something like CAN-SPAM, even now there's a law that was well written, well adopted.  But at the end of the day, 90 percent of spam or -- of email is still spam. It's not the law that eliminated the spam in your mailbox...</p><p>      MARINO:  OK.  I'm running out of time here.  </p><p>      BABEL:  ...technology.  </p><p>      MARINO:  Professor?  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  I think that the companies who are most going to want federal intervention for are the ones who are TRUSTe members who are engaged in shady gray area marketing that can seal their track, click fraud, then all kinds of shady deals that are kind of consumers (inaudible).  </p><p>      MARINO:  OK.  Thank you.  I yield back.  Thank you.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  I thank the gentleman.  </p><p>      The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Deutch, is recognized for five minutes.  </p><p>      DEUTCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      Mr. Babel, you said that 59 percent of people believe that their information is protected.  You touted that number.  Four in ten people are concerned that their information is not protected, I presume is the balance of that analyze -- the balance of that polling.  </p><p>      I just want to talk about the self-regulation piece of this, which a number of have talked about.  You have a program -- a privacy program, which if I understand what you're saying correctly, if a company adopts it then they receive your certification.  Is that right?  </p><p>      BABEL:  Correct.  </p><p>      DEUTCH:  And -- and does that privacy -- that -- has certification been given to the largest companies?  And what Mr. Shipman described sounds like a really terrific privacy policy, which I'll ask about in a minute.  But today, have your certification in their privacy policy?  </p><p>      BABEL:  They're our client, yes.  </p><p>      DEUTCH:  And -- and -- and do all of the -- I mean, do the biggest -- just thinking about those companies with market dominance and does -- does Google have a certification, does Facebook have a certification from you for their privacy policies?  </p><p>      BABEL:  One of the things we look at at the top 100 websites listed by a company called Alexa that's based on consumer traffic, and we have about 50 percent of those top 100 clients.  So we have good penetration, but certainly not all.        DEUTCH:  Right.  So -- so just again thinking about the ones that we use most often, does Google has a certification and does Facebook has its -- for their privacy policy?  </p><p>      BABEL:  Sure.  Google is not a certified client of TRUSTe and neither is Facebook.  We do work with them in some different areas, but they are not certified clients of our program.  </p><p>      DEUTCH:  And -- and when you -- Mr. Reed, when you talked about the information to be collected, you should -- so we should know what data is being collected, who we're showing it with and being transparent with customers.  </p><p>      Is that -- Mr. Babel, is that a part of your certification?  Do you look at each of those?  </p><p>      BABEL:  Yeah.  If we were to think of the highest three levels...</p><p>      DEUTCH:  Yeah.  </p><p>      BABEL:  ...of the certification, the business needs to first be transparent, meaning tell people what data they're collecting.  You know, if they're sharing it, how long they're holding on to it.  They need to give choice.  Would you like to not have that data be collected and they need to be accountable to that choice.  So, yes, the tenets of what Morgan...</p><p>      DEUTCH:  And I'm sorry, I don't -- unfortunately, I just -- I don't know -- I'm learning a lot today, but I don't know well enough how the relationship between TRUSTe and some of the other companies. What is it -- I mean, have you -- when you say you work with some of these other companies, but they don't have the certification, do you suggest to them what's missing?  Or when it comes to those three items that we just discussed, when you look at company with real market dominance like -- like Google, for example, or like Facebook, is there one of those three that they might be missing?  Are there certain things that -- that we ought to be considering?  </p><p>      BABEL:  So, I think of it as it's a totally different effort we're working on with them.  Here -- I'll give you the example.  With Google, they have a business to business app marketplace where a business owner using Gmail can download an application.  We certify those applications, but it's in a partnership with Google so it's not related to kind of the three core tenets.  </p><p>      We don't work with them in our core certification business.  It's kind of a separate adjacent thing.  </p><p>      DEUTCH:  So, I guess, what I'm really getting at is when you talk about self-regulation and the success of self-regulation, in -- for a company -- any company that has real market dominance, is that -- is that sufficient to rely on to do the 40 percent of consumers who are concerned their information is not kept private?  Should they -- should they be satisfied with the -- the privacy policies established in a self-regulatory environment?  If -- if not, every company regulates themselves the same way.        Mr. Reed, you look like you want to jump in.  </p><p>      REED:  Well, it you have to look at -- at behavior.  You know, eBay is sitting here.  They have a pretty good track record so far on -- on privacy.  A lot of our developers use their PayPal system to enable -- enable app purchases.  It's worked out pretty well.  We haven't had those.  </p><p>      So I think your question about the size of the company is not the first -- the first test.  The first test is, what are they doing?  And if a company with dominance has the power to take it and kind of thumb their noses at consumers, well, then yes.  I think that's the kind of time where you have to start taking a look and -- and you start to have asking harder questions.  So it's not the size as much as it is the behavior that really triggers it.  </p><p>      DEUTCH:  Well, Mr. Reed, are there -- you are more familiar with the industry than I am.  Are there -- are there any companies that you think are thumbing their nose with these privacy issues?  </p><p>      REED:  Well, I think -- I mean, I think we've -- we've heard the names several times, everybody has been talking about it.  I think Google has -- Google's privacy violations to date have certainly raised a lot of concern.  I think it's ironic, you know, it got so bad that the Jon Stewart Show -- the Daily Show actually made fun of it on Wi-Fi.  So...</p><p>      DEUTCH:  Well, Mr. Reed...</p><p>      REED:  ...that harms all of us.  </p><p>      DEUTCH:  Mr. Reed, I'm almost out of time.  Of the -- the three things that -- that you point out -- know the data being collected, who is being shared with and being transparent with customers, which of those three do you think is -- is most often being ignored by any company that might be somebody who knows these privacy issues?  </p><p>      REED:  I think in the case -- in the case of -- of -- of Google, I think the problem is that they have them in transparency with what they were doing.  I think I was very clear on WhySpy.  It was clear on the Buzz settlement.  They haven't been transparent.  And I think that's an area that they need to improve or -- or regulators need to step in.  </p><p>      DEUTCH:  Right.  Thank you.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  I thank the gentleman.  </p><p>      The gentleman from Utah, Mr. Chaffetz, is recognized for five minutes.  </p><p>      CHAFFETZ:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for being here.  I appreciate it.        I -- I wanted to highlight the idea that the Internet -- the tech sector is actually something in our company that's working.  You're looking at growth -- growth and jobs, and expansion of our economy, this is one sector that is thriving.  </p><p>      One -- one of my concerns is while we have these deep-seated needs to make sure that privacy is protected, that we're protecting consumers, I think, Mr. Chairman, we also need to be ultra careful in making sure that we don't convolute the process to a point where young entrepreneurs, new startups aren't able to start because there is such a mass of regulation and uncertainty.  </p><p>      I do question the notion that the FTC is the right organization. I wonder -- we talk a lot about the teeth of the FTC, but we can probably count on one hand where they've actually taken -- taken action.  And so I think that begs the question of, should this be done in part by statute so that we can use Article III court as opposed to the FTC, which would be much more readily available to a -- to a consumer or an individual?  </p><p>      It's just something, Mr. Chairman, that I think we need to continue to explore because I'm not convinced that the FTC is the end all, be all.  I'm also concerned that we have multiple jurisdictions here.  The Consumer Financial Protection Board, for instance, you're going to end up much like in the financial sector or you have conflicting rules and regulations.  </p><p>      I think it's also important that the Congress stand up for itself and not allow an administration -- I don't care which party it's involved with -- allow just simple rulemaking to push through the process and not allow the back and forth in the discussion that would happen in Congress.  So I think we've been failing on that front in general.  </p><p>      There are couple of other areas that I'd like you to address and our time is so short here but, Mr. Chairman, I think one of the things we have to further explore if we're going to truly look at privacy is how do we deal with minors -- minors.  You know, my 11-year-old arguably knows more about using the apps in the Internet than -- than most people three, four, five times her age.  </p><p>      We're going to also have to deal with the national versus the international aspect in scope, which was obviously -- or the need in the genesis of SOPA.  That issue has not gone away.  We are still losing billions of dollars overseas, and we're going to have to deal with that.  </p><p>      The other area that I'm -- I'm really trying to focus on and I'd like you to address, I didn't come to just give a big speech.  I'd like you to actually address is I think Americans have a reasonable expectation of privacy, but how do we define that.  </p><p>      One of the things that I think we have to look at is airspace. It's reasonable that somebody walk down your front yard, they could look at your front yard and see your mailbox, and your shrubs, and what-not.        As we expand out and start to use drones and satellites and other types of who knows what kind of technology, what is the reasonable expectations to privacy, say, in your backyard or on your private property?  And along with that is geolocation.  </p><p>      I've sponsored a bill on this.  I think it's going to continue to go on.  Would anybody care to address what is the proper balance of airspace?  You know, law enforcement use helicopters, right?  We've allowed that for a long time.  We think that's a good thing.  But fuel is expensive, it's hard to get a helicopter.  They can -- law enforcement can only keep it up for so long.  </p><p>      But if you have a -- a drone that's up 24/7 or somebody that's going to -- where is that balance, where is that line?  Anybody care to take a stab at that one?  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  I can -- I can say a little bit about that.  One of the encouraging things about the Supreme Court's decision in the United States versus Jones is that the court endorsed two different kinds of rationales to protecting privacy.  One of them based in the majority is rooted in historic law of trespass.  And there, that might signal a reinvigoration of the idea that the airspace, closely above your home, is actually yours and not to be invaded.  </p><p>      We have long accepted that commercial airlines can fly far overhead, but this might signal an attitude we should protect your sovereignty over your own space close to the ground.  </p><p>      And the second coming from the concurrences is the so-called mosaic theory that continuous observation over a long period of time can ultimately build such a complete portrait that it does invade mosaic expectation of privacy.  </p><p>      CHAFFETZ:  And -- and I guess, that's one of the challenges that Jones generally face because he's right in the -- in the Jones case which is, in large part, what our legislation is -- is modeled after is this idea that there's a toggling between an individual's movements on private property and out in the public space.  </p><p>      Look, technology can be great.  It can be so useful and make people's lives better.  But how do we actually craft something without ruining the industry.  That is the fundamental question.  I don't know if the other three care to jump in here.  </p><p>      REED:  We have a -- we have a phrase in the office.  We say nobody wants technology at the speed of government.  And -- and that is the problem that -- that this -- the question that you point out raises.  </p><p>      You know, I speak as mean not as act.  I would be totally creeped out having a drone fly above my house all the time 24/7, watching my backyard.  That's me.  I'm not speaking on behalf of our members.  </p><p>      But by the same token, a plane flying overhead isn't the problem. So we have to look at the behavior question really.  The plane flying overhead has an intent -- it's going from point A to point B.  It doesn't intend to be looking in my backyard.  </p><p>      The drone positioned over my house, watching everything that happens, and whether or not I mowed the lawn on Sunday, has the intent of watching what I'm doing.  So I think that's part of what -- part of how we need to look at what technology empowers us, what is the intent of the person who's putting that technology in place?  What do they want out of it?  </p><p>      And that helps -- that helps us guide the question of what is appropriate airspace in certain aspects?  That allows for wireless transmission to happen without -- without -- without impeding with a lot of government regulation.  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  Yeah.  I'd like to just add, I think, you know, the work that -- that eBay and a number of other organizations have done in really framing what should federal omnibus privacy law look like, really focuses -- and Mr. Reed used the word intent -- its use -- its use-based obligations.  </p><p>      With data, there is an intended use and there's an obligation that needs to come with that intended use.  And you can look at each type of use -- is it fulfillment?  Is it providing a service?  Is it flying from point A to point B?  And with that, data collection and use comes obligation.  </p><p>      CHAFFETZ:  Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, my time has well past gone.  I -- I would appreciate the industry continuing to look at this because I think it's an incomplete answer.  There are -- it is -- it is not sufficient enough to say that is the -- the intent because what does a celebrity, for instance, in Southern California do?  You can see TMZ putting drones up flying to follow celebrities in their 10-mile zone.  That's what TMZ stands for, right?  24/7.  </p><p>      So, intent is -- is not sufficient enough.  I think the industry has also got to catch up in how to help us to find that because Congress says the ability to ruin people's lives and rather not see that happen.  I yield back.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  I thank the gentleman.  </p><p>      The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Lofgren, is recognized for five minutes.  </p><p>      LOFGREN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And as Mr. Chaffetz has indicated, I -- I have some reluctance to see Congress weighed in on these issues in a heavy regulatory manner because we don't work at Internet speed, we work at a different speed.  And, you know, that's a good thing.  I mean, we can't make mistakes quickly, but certainly the technology will move much faster than we can.  And so I have been interested in how industry might establish standards that prevent a heavy regulatory load.  </p><p>      And along those lines, I'm wondering how this process is working relative to the recent decision on Internet Explorer to do -- make the default Do Not Track.  I understand that they're -- and certainly, Microsoft has the -- has the right to do that.  Has that had an impact on the industry-wide effort to reach consensus on Do Not Track or not? </p><p>      Professor, could you answer that question?  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  So, the decision has been discussed within the working group that is building the standard.  Some of the participants in that group of -- including representatives from Google, Yahoo, and Adobe have taken the position that Internet Explorer should be defined to be noncompliant such that websites could say, I think you're using Internet Explorer, therefore I'm not going to honor your Do Not Track request.  And I think this is simply an attempt to sabotage the standard.  It won't work if websites can second-guess the user statement, \"I don't want to be tracked.\"</p><p>      LOFGREN:  Well, the -- the question, I guess, is for me, what's the default?  What kind of transparency is available to the user?  And also, what kind of accountability is -- is there if the users' choice is, in fact, not honored by the person representing the choice?  </p><p>      And -- and, I guess, the question is, who owns this data?  Maybe that's something that -- that the -- does need to be established in law, that the individual has an opportunity to enforce their own choices.  Do you think that is an approach that would be helpful for Congress to take?  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  The default right now is that websites collect but offer users an opportunity to opt-out.  I think users should have the opportunity to choose tools to protect their privacy by saying do not collect.  And if websites disagree with that choice, they can communicate with the user and say, here are the benefits...</p><p>      LOFGREN:  Right.  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  ...we could offer you if you turn tracking on.  </p><p>      LOFGREN:  That's -- for example, I -- I use Firefox as -- I don't know why, but I've always used it, and I've got Do Not Track turned on in my Firefox because that's the choice I want to make.  But it means that there's something I can't do on Firefox, which is a decision I have made.  Isn't it just -- wouldn't it solve our problem in the Internet world if we were just transparent to users and gave them enforceable choices?  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  Yes.  </p><p>      LOFGREN:  Now, let me ask about the, you know, Mr. Chaffetz -- great minds think alike.  I was also thinking about the drone issue. And I think I'm -- I'm told that in August, the FAA is actually going to make do some rulemaking on what drones can collect, which is kind of an odd regulatory rule.  </p><p>      Recently, the  FTC had a workshop on the use of facial recognition technology because this isn't just an online phenomenon, I mean, you go into every store in America practically, and there's a camera that's taking pictures of the shoppers.  And with facial recognition technology, you can now aggregate data about individuals -- who they are.  And I mean, that's an immense amount of data that we, I don't think, have any rules about.  What are your thoughts on that?  </p><p>      REED:  Well, the good news is that technology industries have actually been thinking on that.  There are actually trade association efforts to develop best practices.  And probably, the best example I've seen to date on this is, strangely enough, Connect by Microsoft. They put together an incredibly comprehensive program prior to putting the Connect in your house.  And you'd say, why would that matter?  </p><p>      But you realize, they're essentially facing a camera from the television at you, and so they did an entire privacy by design prior to launching Connect strictly on the question of facial recognition. So the good news is smart people are starting the day saying how do we deal with it.  </p><p>      LOFGREN:  But the issue is then we have plenty of Fourth Amendment rules for the government, and that's important, I mean, obviously.  But what we're talking about here is not the government, but the private sector, which we celebrate.  I mean, the private sector is the job creator of -- of our country - the engine of economic growth.  And yet, the capacity to know everything about individuals because of the technology that has been deployed, and yet individuals may not even be aware that their -- their picture is being taken with facial recognition technology.  </p><p>      They may have absolutely no privacy, and I don't think we have any standards that are set for that use of big data.  I mean, correct me if I'm -- if I'm wrong.  </p><p>      BABEL:  No, actually, I think in that regard, the online and mobile spaces are arguably doing a better job...</p><p>      LOFGREN:  Yes.  </p><p>      BABEL:  ...communicating what information is collected and how it is used.  And I think that as we these technologies move into retail that certainly companies like eBay that work with retail partners can -- can form that partnership and can educate and help them with -- with their use and their need to know their customer and how to balance that appropriately.  </p><p>      LOFGREN:  I know my time is up, but I would just say that, you know, we need to have rules -- individuals have -- have the ability to enforce their understanding either through the FTC or through private rights of action.  But we have not really looked at all to the non- online issues that may be even more severe than what people are paying attention because everybody who goes online knows it's an issue. Nobody knows that the drone is -- is in the sky or that the corner grocery is -- is collecting their data.  </p><p>      BABEL:  No, you're exactly right and we all saw in the retail space that Target knew a young lady was pregnant before she had been able to tell her family.  And that was not the online data collection at all that was strictly from the retail store.  So you're exactly right.  </p><p>      LOFGREN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My time is up.        GOODLATTE:  I thank the gentlewoman.  </p><p>      The gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Jackson-Lee, is recognized for five minutes.  </p><p>      JACKSON-LEE:  I thank the chairman very much.  I thank all the witnesses for their testimony, and I follow my colleague from California with the same quizzical concern about the extensiveness -- the vastness of the issues dealing with Internet use and the concerns that we now have facing the American public or the world public.  And so I want to raise some questions on that issue.  </p><p>      But before I do that, Mr. Reed, do you know the apps that are from Houston?  </p><p>      REED:  (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>      JACKSON-LEE:  And you're well informed.  Do you have some others that you can either refer and do a printout for us?  </p><p>      REED:  (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>      JACKSON-LEE:  It is remarkable and probably gives shockwaves to future employers.  But I -- I appreciate that.  </p><p>      Let me stay on the line of reasoning of my questions about privacy and use two examples.  First, on the front page of the website, CNET, there's a moving story of a paralyzed man who use his eyes to tweet.  This story demonstrates the enormous potential of the Internet.  How can this man be secure in knowing that when he use the web browser like an Internet Explorer and choose Do Not Track that his instructions will be followed and not ignored?  Who wants to take that question?  </p><p>      Professor?  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  The important part there is that once Do Not Track is standardized.  I hope that Congress in the FTC will see fit to treat that as an enforceable practice either under the principles of contract law or as a deceptive trade practice, consumers' request not to be tracked should be honored.  </p><p>      JACKSON-LEE:  And how long or what should we do to move that standardization forward in terms of the industry to move forward on the standardized practice.  </p><p>      Fortunately, working group that is discussing it has an active and aggressive schedule as long as they're aware that Washington is watching and hoping for them to succeed and waiting for the results, I think that is the most important thing you can do now.  </p><p>      JACKSON-LEE:  So you would say contract law and what will be the other enforcement?  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  The FTC's ability to prohibit unfair and deceptive trade practices.        JACKSON-LEE:  And my concern would be what are we doing now, but I appreciate what you're saying is that we're on the right track.  </p><p>      Let me also add this question.  (Inaudible) this morning discussing another topic, which is immigration reform on C-SPAN, but a question was raised before I came on to -- in a Google official report by Dr. Dorothy Chu (ph) on the alarming number of request for government censorship.  The United States was number one.  </p><p>      But the question is the government has a special role and responsibility.  What should Congress role be in monitoring and -- in monitoring, permitting, or opposing censorship by the government?  </p><p>      I'll go to professor, but I'd like some others to chip in.  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  So, the law enforcement request come from a wide variety of sources -- government both in the United States and abroad. And so the law of Congress there is, in part, to monitor the request coming from United States entities and, in part, also to just work with you as companies over the pressure they are receiving from foreign governments to censor and help give them the protection and reassurance in United States government that we support free expression around the world.  </p><p>      JACKSON-LEE:  But are you saying we -- we make statements because it's -- we're asking to protect what we are transmitting.  So the point is -- is that the government is making these points that they need to, in essence, protect what they have.  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  There was a conversation that has been going on for a number of years over a global Internet freedom principals.  And part of that has been a discussion about possibly legislating responsibilities to United States companies to be transparent about their degree of compliance or resistance to fine censorship accounts.  </p><p>      Google is transparent about the request it receives is actually helpful in understanding the pressure that governments put on our companies to do their dirty work.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  I think that is a very sensitive question and that is appropriate for congressional review.  Let me go to Mr. Babel to talk of the challenges of privacy as he established your company.  </p><p>      BABEL:  Sure. The challenges are really in helping companies and consumers kind of meet that best practice of where there's trust by consumers that the companies are doing the right thing.  So our kind of sole role for existence is helping clients -- customers understand what best practices around privacy really are and helping them prove to consumers that they're doing the right thing with their, you know, personal information.  So that's what TRUSTe is really there in helping the ecosystem know and understand, and balance that trust relationship between businesses and (inaudible).  </p><p>      JACKSON-LEE:  Are your customers bankers or banks?  </p><p>      BABEL:  There are few banks, but it's -- it's really more focused on more online companies and technology companies (inaudible) necessarily banks with the other regulations that they have.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Thank you.  The time of the gentlewoman has expired.  </p><p>      JACKSON-LEE:  I yield back.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for five minutes, Mr. Johnson.  </p><p>      JOHNSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      And I must admit that I was just a little disturbed, Mr. Reed, when you left me out of the equation.  I'm sitting here right in front of you, closest to you.  We could almost breathe on each other and you didn't mention any app from the floor</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      REED:  (Inaudible) your app is good.  It's -- I'll give it to you right now.  It's a great app that allows you to pay for your parking spot with your mobile phone.  It's a -- it's actually one that a lot of us already uses, called Parkmobile.  It's a great app.  It lets you pay for parking with your mobile phone.    There you go.  </p><p>      JOHNSON:  I have to tell you -- thank you.  I also found one from Decatur, which is where I represent.  </p><p>      REED:  Yeah.  </p><p>      JOHNSON:  Ping, a subsidiary of Ping Media Group incorporated is a provider of mobile coupons and promotions, which enable retailers and vendors to communicate directly with their customers via mobile phones.  And then I got another one.  </p><p>      A young man, 17 years old, his name is Albert Renshaw out of Gwinett County, which I also represent.  He's developed Apps4Life, A- P-P-S-4, the number, LIFE, which offers Wi-Fi texting without a wireless connection.  And I thought that was pretty good.  </p><p>      But I will now get into the meat of my concern.  A breach into security protocol by a company such as eBay that exposes private customer information to the public could result in death or grievous body injury to a customer whose private information was divulged wrongfully.  The consumer certainly has a right to recover damages for his or her injury or their next of kin for their death.  I'm sure you all would not disagree with that.  And they have a right to seek a recovery in a court of law.  </p><p>      But one of the -- and that's one of a consumer's basic rights, but that right is being chipped away at with this -- with these mandatory pre-dispute arbitration, mandatory arbitration clauses in these consumer agreements, which prohibit the individual -- the aggrieved party from being able to sue in court.  And instead, they are forced into mandatory arbitration where the arbitrator is selected by the company.  </p><p>      The arbitrator may or may not be a lawyer.  The arbitrator does not operate in a public court room, but it's a private secret proceeding may be held miles away -- hundreds and thousands of miles away from where the aggrieved party actually lives.  There's no rules of federal procedure, rules of civil procedure, rules of evidence, and no jury trial.  </p><p>      You know, the arbitrator decides the issue.  And then once the arbitrator does there's no right to an appeal.  This is a private system of adjudicating disputes, which consumers sign up for in a consumer agreement with -- without any knowledge of the gravity of what they are giving up.  </p><p>      Mr. Shipman, what do you think about that?  Does -- does your company have to sue sometimes the competitors for various things in a court of law and do you think that it's important that consumers have the right to take their matter to court as well?  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  So, certainly the scenario you paint is -- is an awful and terrible scenario for that family and one that I would hope that we -- we never encounter.  </p><p>      I think there's two important points here.  The first is, what are the terms that the company has with a customer?  And...</p><p>      JOHNSON:  What that does.  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  ...what are the terms?  Is there an arbitration provision or...</p><p>      JOHNSON:  Yeah.  Do you know whether or not you have that in eBay?  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  In the case of eBay, we actually have a number of choices for our customers depending on the size of the claim.  If it's a financial-related claim, it may be available to small claims action. If it's -- excuse me -- if it's a larger claim and certainly you can bring that case.  We don't -- we don't have that arbitration provision that would prevent someone from being able to be heard and may have their day in court.  </p><p>      The -- the second theme that you talk about is information security and the protection of information.  And certainly, you, you know, a responsible company has thousands of people devoted to making sure that the information that is entrusted with us is taken care of appropriately because the last thing we want certainly is that scenario that you paint because that's awful for not only our business, but also for our customers.  </p><p>      JOHNSON:  Well, certainly, and -- and it's not that the company would intend for any harm to come to one of its customers because of the breach.  It could happen though pretty easily given the fact that the -- this marketplace is in its earliest stage of development, growth, and mistakes can be made along the way with various applications.  Something may have a bug that needs to be worked out.  </p><p>      And it's definitely possible for someone's -- let's say a -- a woman who -- whose husband or boyfriend, you know, wants to do some damage to them, and due to a breach of information is able to follow through with that either, you know, character-wise or reputation-wise, or even come into the house and -- and -- and cutting up into a million pieces.  You know, it could happen.  </p><p>      And if it does happen, then if -- if eBay decides that, OK, this claim is not worth that much, then it would go through a certain procedure.  And if it's -- if it's deemed by eBay to be larger than that, then it goes into -- then the person has a right to -- to go to court.  Is that what we're talking about?  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  Well, you know, again, I mean, very awful scenario that you're painting.  But...</p><p>      JOHNSON:  (Inaudible) is true...</p><p>      SHIPMAN:  Nonetheless.  </p><p>      JOHNSON:  ...anything might happen.  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  And certainly, we can follow up with you afterwards. We love to work with you.  </p><p>      The -- you know, our clause allows consumers to decide what the -- you know, what avenue they have available to them.  We don't limit all claims to arbitration.  So I think that's the, you know, the salient piece.  </p><p>      JOHNSON:  OK.  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  The second thing is on -- on this issue of a security breach, what we've seen to date, I can't summarize if you don't want me to summarize all of the legislation in the case law.  What we've seen today is where there is a harm, and in the cases that you're providing there are clear harms, then it is likely, I believe, that you would see damages be appropriate.  Where we have seen no harm, no financial identify theft, no physical harm, the cases that we've seen generally tend to say that there is not liability in that regard.  </p><p>      JOHNSON:  I understand.  </p><p>      Professor Grimmelmann, your response, sir, or insight?  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  I agree with him that where there is physical harm to the individual who has been hurt as a result of the breach, then yes, the courts are available, and they have been willing to hear those suits.  </p><p>      I am concerned somewhat that the breaches do not result in immediate provable harm, but nonetheless reduce the information security for all of us by leaking financial information on many consumers that can lead to act of identity theft.  It can't specifically trace back to that one individual breach, have resulted in harm is not provable in a court of law, and so therefore there's no redress against it.  This is why data breach notification laws and other efforts to shine a light on this and enforce basic information security practices against industry participants are important.        JOHNSON:  Class action litigation could play a part in deterring willful misconduct that could ensue...</p><p>      GOODLATTE:  The time of the gentleman has expired.  </p><p>      JOHNSON:  I noticed that red button has been on ever since I started talking, so I don't know how long I've gone, Mr. Chairman, but it doesn't seem like five minutes though.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for one additional minute to sum up his ideas.  </p><p>      JOHNSON:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Class action litigation where a number of people have suffered just a small amount of harm, but the class action litigation which can result in a verdict of some importance in terms of the amount could act as a deterrent, and -- and it's good for public policy, in my opinion.  </p><p>      What would be your response to that, Professor Grimmelmann, because I don't want to -- I don't want to personalize this with eBay? eBay is no different than all of the other entities out there that are very popular with consumers, so I'll ask you, Professor.  </p><p>      Well, I'll ask Mr. -- Mr. Reed.  What do you think?  </p><p>      REED:  This is an area in which...</p><p>      JOHNSON:  Go ahead -- go ahead.  </p><p>      REED:  This is an area in which you are concerned about arbitration...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      JOHNSON:  (Inaudible).  </p><p>      REED:  ...important.  And this is also an area in which class action litigation has been important for privacy.  Facebook has recently settled a lawsuit over its marketing commercial product using individual's pictures to say, \"James just watched Wally.  Don't you want to watch it too?\" to their friends.  And a class action lawsuit was altered in a $10 million settlement.  </p><p>      JOHNSON:  Thank you.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  The time of the gentleman has expired again, and having allotted him 10-1/2 minutes on his five minutes of time, I'm going to take the privilege of asking a clarifying question for the witnesses.  </p><p>      To me, self-regulation means companies published their policies. And then if they engage in deceptive practices by not following those policies and under existing law, the Federal Trade Commission would have the authority to take action for false advertising or whatever the case might be.  </p><p>      What I want to know for sure here is does anyone here believe that the federal government should impose a one-size-fits-all regulatory approach or that the federal government should prescribe specific privacy policies to specific companies or in general.  </p><p>      Mr. Shipman?  </p><p>      SHIPMAN:  No, I don't think the -- the government should draft specific privacy policies.  I think we should leave that to industry and those that are innovating the services and technologies.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Mr. Reed?  </p><p>      REED:  Exactly the same.  I agree completely.  That's not the position the government should be in.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Mr. Babel?  </p><p>      BABEL:  (Inaudible) to agree and also agree with your view that self-regulation with -- and have a proper backdrop with the FTC is a good program to continue.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Mr. Grimmelmann?  </p><p>      GRIMMELMANN:  I agree that government should not regulate specific privacy policies.  It should make sure that consumers have effective notice of what those policies are and/or have enforcement when those promises are broken.  </p><p>      GOODLATTE:  Thank you very much.  It's definitely clarifying information from all of you.  </p><p>      I'd like to thank all of our witnesses for their testimony today. This has been a very informative hearing.  And without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit to the chair additional written questions for the witnesses, which we will forward and ask the witnesses to respond as promptly as they can so that their answers may be made part of the record.  </p><p>      Without objection, all members will have legislative days to submit any additional materials for inclusion in the record.  And with that, I again thank all of our distinguished witnesses.  And the hearing is adjourned.  </p><p>      END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-1021809786</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KR6-6GJ1-JBHT-D2R7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-01-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"18864\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2012 Roll Call, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>June 20, 2012 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Undefined</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002E8X</classCode><className>EBAY INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EBAY (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>New York Law School</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Association for Competitive Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Federal Trade Commission</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Microsoft Corp</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>MSFT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 611310</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 813910</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 926150</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 334611</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 511210</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

This hearing of the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet will come to order.  I now recognize myself for an opening statement.    </p><p>      Today, we are holding a hearing to examine the public policy issues raised by new technologies in the mobile and online spaces.  It is clear that some of the central policy issues for both consumers and companies are the issues of privacy and data collection.    </p><p>      Privacy continues to take on greater importance as more Americans not only use the Internet and mobile devices, but also share their personal information with companies on the web.  Privacy policies and the technological safeguards that companies implement will help guide consumers on what they should expect from those who handle their personal information and set expectations for companies that use personal data.    </p><p>      As Congress continues to look at privacy issues online, it is important to have a firm understanding of what the industry practices are.  Today's hearing will explore what mechanisms of private sector is currently employing to protect Internet and mobile users.  It will also highlight the technological innovation and development that has occurred in this space.    </p><p>      There have been astonishing advancements in the delivery of products and services online.  And as a result, there are privacy implications for a variety of new technologies, some of which were not even in existence a few years ago.    </p><p>      Many of the private -- many in the private sector already have policies and procedures in place to police themselves to ensure they are following best practices.  Groups like TRUSTe, the Association for Competitive Technology, the Application Developers Alliance, the advertising industry through its AdChoices program and others already help to provide best practices, independent analyses of privacy policies and recommendations for enhancements.  We will learn more about some of these groups' work in the field today.    </p><p>      As Congress begins to look into these issues, we need to realize that the technologies that we are discussing did not even exist a few years ago, and some have only come to the forefront in the past few months.  And with any new technology, it is important that as we think about how best to protect the interest of consumers and the Internet user community, we continue to encourage and not stifle innovation.    </p><p>      One of the most important things private sector companies can do to self-regulate and innovate when it comes to privacy is to make their notices and privacy policies easy to understand.  If the consumer understands that trade-off, he makes when he accepts an app program or service, then the consumer will make an informed decision. The easier it is for consumers to understand all privacy notices and policies, the easier it is for companies to compete on the basis of their privacy policies and the easier it is for consumers to vote with their wallets.    </p><p>      I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses on the efforts that they have taken to help build in privacy protections as they develop their products to safeguard consumer information about what more can be done to increase transparency and ensure that, as American companies seek to operate abroad in markets like Europe and Asia, innovation is not impeded by undue regulatory burdens or barriers to market access.    </p><p>      And with that, it's my pleasure to recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate you holding this hearing.    </p><p>      I believe that privacy is one of the most fundamental values of the American tradition.  Yet today, even a majority of the justices of the Supreme Court (inaudible) that, as a society, we are faced with novel challenges in determining the, quote, \"new normal,\" close quote, for privacy expectations in the digital age.    </p><p>      There's little doubt that the digital environment has created opportunities that society -- for society that often come at little or no financial cost to the user.  But I believe it is inappropriate to classify these opportunities and services as free.    </p><p>      Information is currency, and users are, without exception, required to surrender incredible amounts of personal information in exchange for the services they enjoy.    </p><p>      While Internet users have some responsibility to self-censor and restrict the intimate information they share on various platforms. The reality is that many online users have a false sense of privacy because they don't understand the lengthy and complex privacy policies they are compelled to agree to in order to use the service.    </p><p>      As a result online users often share lots of personal information unknowingly and to unintended audiences.  Their personal information has been marshaled, analyzed, and monetized in ways consumers have come to resent.    </p><p>      A March 2012 study by the Pew Research Center found that two- thirds of Internet users have negative views about search engines collecting information about them to produce personalized search results.  Two-thirds of Internet users also report that they, quote, \"are not OK with targeted advertising because they do not like having their own line behavior tracked and analyzed.\"  </p><p>      I am further concerned that this type of consumer profiling may limit rather than enhance the experience and the horizons of distinct groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, and other factors that we are probably not even aware of yet.  If users are constantly fed products and facts in the areas in which they or someone like them have already expressed an interest, their intellectual curiosity and development may be stunted.    </p><p>      Earlier this year, both the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission completed reports following stakeholder participation to address mounting concern about consumer privacy.    </p><p>      The White House green paper enumerated seven broad principles that it urges be enacted into law as flexible baseline standards governing consumer privacy.  The green paper recommends that industry leaders develop specific codes of conduct to implement the consumer privacy principles.    </p><p>      The FTC's report takes the additional step of identifying best practices that could and, I believe, should serve as a guide for industry in developing the codes of conduct.   </p><p>The administration has determined that the first round of stakeholder meetings will center on mobile applications, which raise serious questions about the security of data concerning children and geolocation information concerning all users.  Parents must be able to feel secured that the apps they download to educate or entertain their children aren't secretly collecting or sharing private data or location information from the host device.    </p><p>      Although some industry actors have been giving lip service to, and others have been really working to establish privacy standards and to provide users with better understanding of the ways in which the information is used, it seems clear to me that consumers remain in a vulnerable position in which they are required to place an enormous amount of blind trust in online companies and app developers.    </p><p>      Just last year -- just last week, the FTC announced an $800,000 settlement with Spokeo, a data broker that compiles vast amounts of information on consumers from both online and offline sources.    </p><p>      In the first FTC case to address the sale of data from the Internet and social media sites in the employment context, the FTC charged that Spokeo violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by marketing consumer profiles to recruiters and human resource professionals without regard to the accuracy of information and without advising the users how their information would be used.  The FTC was empowered to act because of the protections contained in the Fair Credit Reporting Act.    </p><p>      The FTC settlement was announced just as President Obama signed an executive order to lift the morass of federal policies and practices that impede broadband deployment on federal lands.  The executive order will not only lower the cost of broadband Internet access, it will also speed the delivery of connectivity to communities, businesses, and schools.    </p><p>      President Obama said in a statement, quote, \"By connecting every corner of our country to the digital age, we can help our businesses become more competitive and our students become more informed and our citizens become more engaged,\" close quote.    </p><p>      With greater access comes the responsibility to ensure that our citizens enjoy an online experience that is safe, reliable, and respectful of personal information.  So I support the direction the administration is taking us and continue to believe that Congress should enact baseline progressive legislation that will provide certainty to both consumers and companies, and promote a healthy online economy.    </p><p>      Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote years ago that, quote, \"Privacy is not a discrete commodity, possessed absolutely or not at all,\" close quote.  The devil is always in the details, but I hope that the witnesses will be able to address some of the best practices recommended by the FTC.    </p><p>      Finally, I am also concerned that without a baseline set of principles with the force of law, privacy policies may be used by larger players in an anticompetitive manner to drive smaller players and startups from the market to the detriment of online consumers.    </p><p>      I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and how -- about how we can embrace new technologies without discarding or abandoning the right to privacy.  And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  The chair thanks the gentleman and is pleased to recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Smith.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    </p><p>America's economic success has been built on innovation.  Ten years ago, there was no such thing as Facebook or Twitter.  Just five years ago, there was no such thing as an iPhone or an app store. Today, mobile apps number in the hundreds of thousands and are largely developed by individual innovators and small businesses.    </p><p>      As new technologies have emerged like mobile apps, social media, online advertising, and data analytics, the cost for new business entry have come down, but as new websites and apps are developed, companies must work to ensure that they maintain the trust of their customers.  Trust is the essential element for consumers to adopt new apps or technologies.    </p><p>      When we hear about privacy breaches like what happened when Google collected large amounts of private data over Wi-Fi networks, we have to be concerned.  With every overcollection of privacy data, the first excuse is that the engineers or programmers went beyond what they were told to do.  That excuse may fly once, but ultimately it's neither the engineer's fault nor the programmer's fault, it's the company's.    </p><p>      In the Internet economy, online services are generally provided to consumers at little or no cost.  And behind these online services are hundreds or thousands of employees and millions of dollars in hardware and equipment.    </p><p>      The Internet economy runs on data.  There is an implicit bargain between an Internet service and a consumer that includes an exchange of information or data instead of cash.  When a consumer receives a free email account or a cloud storage space or uses a search engine, social media website or app, there is a collection of data that allows a company to construct their service and provide targeted advertising or related data analytic services to the consumer.    </p><p>      As Internet companies have developed new technologies, their privacy policies have had to evolve.  Many companies now institute privacy by design where privacy protections are built directly into their software and hardware products from the beginning. Incorporation of the best practices for privacy is essential as new products are developed online.    </p><p>      For example, I have read that Google and Apple are building even more detailed maps that rival defense satellite imagery.  Though this ensures that we will never get lost if we drive or walk through a new city, we also need to ensure that when images are taken in residential areas on people's backyards that their privacy is protected.  This is another place where privacy concern should not have to be raised by Congress or the media.  They should be addressed before the products are even announced.    </p><p>      The growth in smartphone use and mobile apps has created an entirely new business sector from Instagram to new mobile apps for established online websites and companies.  This new business sector is composed mostly of small businesses and individual programmers.    </p><p>      As we will here from our witnesses today, many of these small businesses are just a couple of software programmers, not two programmers and a lawyer.  And so they often need assistance from more established players as they work to incorporate privacy protections into their software.    </p><p>      The mobile and Internet playing field is broad, and specific technological protections may be unique to particular technologies. But as companies incorporate privacy protections into their services, it is important for them to provide privacy policies that are understandable and reasonable.  This way, it's clear to the consumer what the bargain is that they enter into when they use a website or mobile app.    </p><p>      I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses today, and I hope their testimony allows the subcommittee to learn how the technology industry works to incorporate balanced privacy protections that will inform and protect consumers.    </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    </p><p>      I'm now pleased to recognize the gentleman from Michigan, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONYERS</emphasis>:  Thank you.  Thank you, Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Watt.    </p><p>      This is a very important hearing.  And there are new services being offered online and through smartphones and other devices that largely depend on the continued gathering and use of personal information, which is ultimately turned into a product for sale.    </p><p>      And this hearing is -- is going to devolve, I think, into an issue of whether we get the self-regulation very advanced, we'll all be good and trust this committee or whether we're going to go along and develop the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights.  And -- and that's where we're going to end up because there is an explosion of the collection, dissemination of personal information.  And -- and therefore, these organizations have an incentive to collect as much data as possible about Internet users.    </p><p>      And what I think should come out of this hearing is the notion that consumers deserve to know how their data and privacy are being impacted by mobile and online platforms.  Today, we don't know that. And that's why this hearing by this subcommittee is extremely important.    </p><p>      The size and power of online companies allow them to obtain and aggregate many types of personal information.  Otherwise, why would Facebook be valued at a worth of $100 billion while the answer, in large part, is because of the treasured throw of personal information that they collect much of which like others -- other companies we don't know much about.    </p><p>      Now we -- we've been dealing with the size and power of online companies that allows them to obtain and aggregate all this personal information about users.  Google recently has had to change its privacy policies and there is concern about its ability to obtain information through an individual's use of various products the company offers.  There's so many different ways to get this information out there that it's -- that is when -- when they get it together, they have a far more information that is generally recognized.    </p><p>      And so I, for one, am interested in learning how we can increase the authority and the power of the Federal Trade Commission to take action against privacy violations.  The FTC, in my view, needs direct enforcement authority so that it may take action against those who violate consumer privacy even if a company doesn't violate its own published private policy.    </p><p>      And while companies should develop online guidelines, we must remember that enforcement is critical to consumer protection.  The FTC has the responsibility to ensure that competitors are not allowed to play by different rules.    </p><p>      And so, Mr. Chairman, thank you for allowing me to add my comment before the witnesses begin.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman for his comments.  Without objection, other members' opening statements will be made a part of the record.    </p><p>      We have a very distinguished panel of witnesses today.  Each of the witnesses' written statements will be entered into the record in its entirety.  And I ask that each witness summarize his testimony in five minutes or less.    </p><p>      To help you stay within that time, there is a timing light on your table.  When the light switches from green to yellow, you have one minute to conclude your testimony.  And when the light turn to red, well, that's it, it signals the witness' time has expired.    </p><p>      Before I introduce our witnesses, I'd like to understand and be sworn as is the custom of this committee.  Do you and each of you swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?    </p><p>      Thank you very much, and please be seated.    </p><p>      Our first witness is from the district of the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Lofgren.  And so it's my pleasure to yield to her for the purposes of introducing, Mr. Shipman.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  Well, I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your courtesy in allowing me to introduce the associate general counsel of eBay that is, in fact, located in the 16th Congressional District.    </p><p>      Scott Shipman has been with eBay from the beginning.  In fact, he started at eBay in -- when he was a law student, and the one lawyer there was absolutely overwhelmed, and so he was there are the beginning to deal with the privacy policies of eBay.  And he is here to tell us about those successful policies.    </p><p>      He has -- as he said at our collective law school, he had done the right things without even knowing it back as a law student.  He now has first-hand experience with the privacy compliance and risk assessments at eBay, the cross-border data transfers including the E.U., the personal information transfers to corporate mergers and acquisitions and all the other privacy-related issues that this major corporation faces.    </p><p>      He teaches International Data Protection at Santa Clara University School of Law as a lecturer.  And he serves, along with me, on the High Tech Law Advisory Board at our mutual alma mater, Santa Clara Law School.  He coordinates the Legal High Technology Internship Program at eBay in connection with Santa Clara Law School, and he is a board member of the Consumer Privacy Law Forum.    </p><p>      He is a member of the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a member of the Chief Privacy Officers Council on Conference Board, as well as, of course, being admitted to the California State Bar.    </p><p>      I'm so glad he is here to share his expertise with us, and it's good to welcome you here, Scott, from the valley into D.C.    </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to introduce Scott.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Well, thank you, Ms. Lofgren.  And I've had the pleasure of speaking at the State of the Net West Conference, which has been hosted at Santa Clara University School of Law on a number of occasions.    </p><p>      So, Mr. Shipman, welcome.    </p><p>      Our second witness is Mr. Morgan Reed, executive director of the Association for Competitive Technology.  Mr. Reed specializes in technology issues and has been working closely with mobile app developers and companies on privacy issues for years.    </p><p>      Mr. Reed previously worked for a Taiwan-based trading company, handling North American sales operations.  He received his B.A. in political science from Arizona State University and did graduate research in Chinese at the University of Utah and the Shi Ta University in Taiwan.  I hope I have that pronounced correctly.    </p><p>      Our third witness, Mr. Chris Babel, is the CEO of TRUSTe, a leading company and authority on Internet trust and privacy. Previously, Mr. Babel served as senior vice-president and general manager of VeriSign's worldwide authentication services business, where he was responsible for strategy, sales, marketing product, and support.  He also manage VeriSign's SSL and manage Security Services business.    </p><p>      Earlier in his career, he worked at Morgan Stanley in their M&amp;A and corporate finance group.  Mr. Babel received his B.A. in mathematical methods in the social sciences and economics from Northwestern University.    </p><p>      And our fourth witness is Mr. James Grimmelman, professor of law at New York Law School.  Professor Grimmelmann studies technology issues relating to I.P., virtual worlds, search engines, online privacy and other topics.    </p><p>      Prior to law school, he worked as a programmer for Microsoft.  He received his J.D. from Yale Law School and his A.B. in Computer Science from Harvard College.    </p><p>      Welcome to you all, and we'll begin with Mr. Shipman.    </p><p>      Turn on that microphone and pull it close.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  Excuse me.  Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Watt, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify about eBay Inc. and what we are doing to enable commerce and engender trust through the use of innovative consumer privacy protections.    </p><p>      My name is Scott Shipman and I am the associate general counsel and global privacy leader for eBay Inc.</p><p>eBay empowers and connects millions of buyers and sellers across the globe through eBay marketplaces, PayPal, GSI, and other -- and other mobile technology-based businesses.  Therefore, many people associate eBay and PayPal with enabling ecommerce.    </p><p>      However, it is important to note that eBay is not just about ecommerce, we are about commerce.  The traditional boundaries of offline and online retail are blurring.  We recognize that retailers and sellers of all sizes need a partner who will help them succeed in this rapidly changing consumer-driven environment.  We want them to succeed, and we are that partner.    </p><p>      Over the years we have learned one of the keys to success is engendering consumer trust and confidence.  A critical component of that trust is privacy.  It's hard to build consumer trust when you are not respectful of their personal information.    </p><p>      To foster that trust, we've had to meet customer privacy expectations with every product we offer.    </p><p>      I would like to take the next few minutes to highlight some of the successful privacy-related programs and products that have led to eBay being rated one of the most trusted companies for consumer privacy.   </p><p>      Since eBay's inception, our core privacy commitment is eBay will not sell the personal information of our customers to third parties for marketing purposes.  However, we also recognized consumers need more meaningful choices on how their data was used for behavioral- targeted advertising.  Therefore, eBay developed and implemented a program called AdChoice.    </p><p>      The AdChoice program works as follows -- third party advertisements on and off eBay have an AdChoice link.  When eBay users click on the link, they see a pop-up window that gives them the ability to specify their advertising preferences.  eBay users can also opt-out of receiving third party behaviorally-targeted ads, and read our privacy policy through that link.  eBay's AdChoice program offers a server-based mechanism, not their traditional cookie-based mechanism.  This means choices and preferences are permanently stored and not erased when a user clears their cookies.    </p><p>      PayPal and its shop without sharing design is another perfect example of innovative technology that encourages consumer privacy and consumer control.  The beauty of PayPal is it allows consumers to pay for a good or service without ever having to expose their credit card or bank account information to merchants.  Not only does this privacy- enhancing technology allow consumers to fully enjoy the convenience of online and mobile commerce, but it also allows merchants to receive payments without the cost and potential liability associated with processing and securing financial information.  It's a win-win for both consumers and merchants.    </p><p>      Looking now at the exciting mobile space, mobile applications and technology continue to grow in popularity and importance.  Through the launch of several new and exciting mobile applications eBay has experienced rapid growth in the mobile arena.    </p><p>      However, being a leader in mobile and geolocation technology is more than just offering cool new services.  It is also about balancing the needs and wants of the consumer against the creep factor that is sometimes associated with the collection and use of geolocation and mobile data.    </p><p>eBay is building mobile applications that offer the same transparency, choice, and level of privacy protection as our traditional Internet services.  eBay has made it a policy that all consumers must opt-in to turn on geo-location for all eBay Inc. mobile applications.  And we give consumers the ability to decide what communications and notifications they want to receive and how.    </p><p>      A perfect example of an eBay mobile application that encapsulates the privacy by design philosophy is WHERE.  WHERE provides personalized, hyper-local recommendations, offers, and deals to millions of mobile consumers.  WHERE does not associate personally identifiable information with location data without explicit consent. Finally, WHERE does not collect, maintain, or track consumer's location history.    </p><p>      I've talked a lot about technology, but my last example focuses on best practices and compliance.  In addition to eBay's privacy principles and the practices described in our privacy policies, eBay has established a set of corporate rules approved by the Luxembourg National Data Commission.  These corporate rules are a commitment to eBay to protect our users' personal information regardless of where the date resides.  Our corporate rules do not just protect the personally identifiable information of our European users, but of all eBay Inc. customers and employees globally.  eBay was actually the first ecommerce company to receive this approval and the first company to receive approval for employee and customer rules.    </p><p>      To conclude, we recognize that privacy is a key component of our customers' experience and the trust they place with us.  As technology changes, as the world changes, expectations will continue to change. eBay's role is not to guarantee absolute privacy in a vacuum, but to build a relationship based on trust.  It is our hope that in the years to come, the trust within that relationship will only grow stronger, and our customers will know and trust that we'll get it done right.    </p><p>      I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to testify before the committee today, and I look forward to your questions.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Shipman.    </p><p>      Mr. Reed, welcome.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Thank you.    </p><p>      Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Watt, members of the committee, my name is Morgan Reed, and I want to thank you for having today's hearing on new technologies and innovations in the mobile and online space, and the implications for public policy.    </p><p>      My organization, the Association for Competitive Technology is an international trade association representing more than 5,000 app developers.  We make the cool apps that run on your smartphone and your iPads, and hopefully the new Microsoft tablet and the next device after that.    </p><p>      I am a licensed developer too, having worked on network protocols and debugging games so I have actually dug into the nitty-gritty of how you build software programs.  Here's the great news.    </p><p>      Our industry is showing amazing growth.  We have hit more than $20 billion today on an expected path to $100 billion by 2015.    </p><p>      Apps are expanding into new markets, including enterprise and mobile health which will help make Americans more efficient at work and healthier at home.  And while Americans own more than $350 million mobile devices, developers are seeing real potential in foreign markets.    </p><p>      China's largest telecommunications has more than 800 million subscribers; the number two, 200 million; the number three, 100 million.  With adequate intellectual property protection, those subscribers could become customers for our American developers.    </p><p>      Now I understand this committee would like to spend some time today talking about consumer data privacy and how we make it work in this new more mobile world.    </p><p>      What we have learned in working through several multi-stakeholder efforts is that we need to address privacy in a comprehensive way, not one that creates siloed solutions for each technology especially since those silos are disappearing every day.    </p><p>      The biggest revolution in our industry is happening right now and it's called responsive design.  Technology is giving us the tools to make one app that will look good on a mobile device and will also look good on a television.  And we'll do so seamlessly.    </p><p>      Everyone in the technology industry has to take part and be responsible for improving the state of privacy security and transparency across all of these industries and devices.  Our app developers are no different, and we're committed to working this out with government, industry, civil society, and most importantly, our customers.    </p><p>      During the past year, ACT has reached out to our membership and other developer organizations throughout America to discuss the importance of data privacy.  We've gone coast to coast and have reached hundreds of thousands of developers.  Our message has been simple -- know what data you're collecting, know who you are sharing that data with, and be transparent with your customers.    </p><p>      We have also been participating in multi-stakeholder efforts, including the California AG's work on mobile platforms and the White House NTIA multi-stakeholder effort.    </p><p>      But throughout all these talk about stakeholders.  I realize that this can easily be seen to imply large faceless corporations.  I wanted you to remember today that the incredible innovation happening is being driven by thousands of small businesses working to build applications that educate, motivate, and enrich people's lives.    </p><p>      Therefore, I thought it would take a minute to introduce you to some of the stakeholders whose voices we are working to have heard throughout these efforts.    </p><p>      Chairman Goodlatte, in your district, Vision Studios produced TextGauge.  It's an app for parents to prevent teens from texting while driving.    </p><p>      Congressman Watt, in your district, we've got Monster Physics. It's a great app that makes app -- that makes Physics fun and is available for -- for adults as well as kids.    </p><p>      Congressman Conyers, in your district, JackApps is building the app for the Detroit International Jazz Festival.  It's an -- it's an amazing application.    </p><p>      Congressman Smith, in your district, m-Patient Solutions (sic) helps patients navigate the health care system by giving them tools to better understand diagnosis and treatment options.    </p><p>      Congressman Marino, we have Social Meetup app done by MeetMe in your district.    </p><p>      Congressman Quayle, in your district, we have a brand new entrant, ABN, just won the contract for the 2012 PGA Phoenix Open. And that will have location-based technology to allow you to go on the ground navigation with the spectators.    </p><p>      Congressman Deutch, in your district, one of our members, Dave Norter (ph), built an app for Big Brothers and Big Sisters that allows bigs to know activities that they should be looking at doing with their littles.    </p><p>      Congressman Griffin has Order Pad.  It allows medical personnel to display in-patient and observation data to help streamline patient care and it's aimed at rural districts.    </p><p>      Congresswoman Chu, in your district, Awesome app does -- it's for electricians and engineers that helps them do their job more efficiently and importantly more safely.    </p><p>      Congressman Chaffets, you've got one of the biggest -- biggest dogs in the fight.  Infinity Blade II is built in your district -- millions of downloads.  And it's built by a very small company right in your district.    </p><p>      Congresswoman Lofgren, we've got a great app in Pinger.  It allows people to send free text messages all across the world without having to necessarily have a specific text plan.    </p><p>      Congressman Poe has got iTaxable that provides answers to your tax filing questions and an extensive database of information.    </p><p>      Congressman Jordan, you've got Ranch Rush.  It's a game that puts a farm in your pocket, allowing users to harvest fresh produce, gather eggs from ostriches, collect honey from bees and whip up ketchup from tomatoes.    </p><p>      Congressman Nadler has got one that helps you sign your signature on your iPad instead of having to find a fax machine.    </p><p>      So I think as we think about today's questions about stakeholders, we need to remember that in every single one of your districts and in every district here in Congress, there's a small business stakeholder whose voices we need to have heard as part of this privacy discussion.    </p><p>      Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Reed.    </p><p>      Mr. Babel, welcome.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  Thank you.    </p><p>      Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Watt, and distinguished members of the subcommittee, my name is Chris Babel, and I am the chief executive officer of TRUSTe, a leading provider of privacy technology and certification solutions to online companies.    </p><p>      Based in San Francisco, TRUSTe offers a suite of privacy solutions to help businesses increase customer trust and engagement across all their websites, mobile applications, online advertising and cloud-based services.  Over 5,000 companies such as Apple, AT&amp;T, Disney, eBay, and Yelp rely on TRUSTe to ensure compliance with evolving and complex privacy requirements and to build trust with consumers.    </p><p>      I would like to highlight three topics in my remarks before the subcommittee today -- first, the consumer privacy perspective; second, new privacy challenges and technologies TRUSTe and others offer to address them; third, why we think that self-regulation has been successful in protecting consumers online.    </p><p>      First, through consumer research we submitted in the written testimony, we know that consumers are concerned about privacy online and both their P.C. and mobile devices.  Take mobile, for example, where 74 percent of consumers believe it is very or extremely important to understand what personal information a mobile application collects.    </p><p>      Eighty-five percent want to be able to opt-in or opt-out of targeted mobile ads.  These concerns are causing the consumer to become more engaged in their privacy decisions and more likely to take control of when and how their data is collected and used.    </p><p>      Research also highlighted that 59 percent of consumers generally trust that websites are protecting their privacy online, showing that businesses can build trust and alleviate privacy concerns through investments in privacy best practice and privacy technologies.    </p><p>      Second, there is explosive growth in privacy services offered to consumers.  In TRUSTe's first 12 years in existence through 2009, we grew it from offering one to four services focused on website privacy only.  In the past 2-1/2 years, we have launched over 10 new services spanning websites, mobile applications, online advertising, and cloud services.    </p><p>      Taking mobile as an example since all of you carry mobile devices, the challenges are that less than one-third of mobile applications have a privacy policy today.  And when they do, they're difficult to read and need to handle sensitive topics like location information.    </p><p>TRUSTe offers application providers a free mobile privacy policy generator, as well as paid services to certify that mobile applications have strong privacy as well as notice and choice mechanisms for consumers regarding mobile ad targeting.    </p><p>      There have also been entirely new industry efforts like the Digital Advertising Alliance that have been formed to provide consumers notice and choice around online targeted advertising. TRUSTe is the largest independent provider of services for the DAA. We have also partnered with the Application Developers Alliance to educate mobile developers on important privacy issues as part of a countrywide educational road show.    </p><p>      Technology is evolving more rapidly than ever, and solutions for consumer privacy protection are keeping pace.    </p><p>      Third, self-regulation is a critical component to online privacy and TRUSTe has helped thousands of companies self-regulate their online privacy for 15 years.  Self-regulation is valuable and that it helps companies facilitate global best practices, which simplifies the management and cost of these programs while increasing accountability.   </p><p>      Self-regulation can also evolve with technology changes to meet the ongoing needs of consumers.    </p><p>      And finally, through safe harbors and due process, self- regulation can provide strong incentives for compliance.    </p><p>      Looking forward, it's clear the consumers are becoming ever more aware of how their personal data is collected and used online, which is important as technology changes like the decreased cost of bandwidth, computer processing and storage allow for the analysis and use of vast databases of information.    </p><p>      Self-regulation provides a flexible privacy protection framework that can quickly adapt to these rapidly changing technologies.  To date, industry has made great progress in self-regulating their privacy practices.  I know there is much work to be done.  We are confident that the goal of protecting consumers while continuing to innovate will be achieved.    </p><p>      Thank you for the opportunity to testify today.  I look forward to your questions.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Babel.    </p><p>      And Professor Grimmelmann, you get the last words.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  I would like to thank Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Watt, and all of the members of the subcommittee for inviting me to testify today.  My name is James Grimmelmann, and I am a professor at New York Law School.  Although I am happy to respond to any of the subcommittee's questions on any of its topics, my testimony today will focus on privacy.    </p><p>      The central goal for privacy policy online and on mobile devices must be empowered consumer choice.  Good privacy technologies and good privacy laws enable people to choose whether, when, and how open they want to be about their lives.  I would like to endorse three essential principles for making real consumer choice a reality.    </p><p>      The first is usability.  A choice that consumers do not know about, cannot find, or cannot understand is no choice at all.    </p><p>      The second is reliability. A consumer who has expressed a choice is entitled to expect that it will be respected.    </p><p>      And the third is innovation for privacy.  Users benefit from good tools to help them manage their privacy.    </p><p>      A good example of these principles in action is social networks. Their value depends on controlled access.  Everything from a private email from a mother with advice to her daughter in college to a confidential discussion group for recovering alcoholics requires sharing with some people, but not with others.    </p><p>      The proliferation of social networks with different technical models of sharing represents innovation for privacy in action, but that privacy must also be usable and reliable.  People have lost jobs, been stalked, and then splashed across the tabloids because privacy settings on social networks were too confusing for them to understand.   </p><p>      I am particularly concerned about what I have called privacy lurches -- sudden and unexpected shifts in a social network information sharing practices.  For example, Google mishandled the launch of its Buzz social network in 2010.  Without clear warning, Google exposed the names of users' email contacts to the world.  This made Google Buzz, in one reporter's words, a danger zone for reporters, psychiatrists, lawyers, and everyone else for whom confidentiality is essential to their job.    </p><p>      The Buzz rollout violated the principle of reliability.  It changed Gmail's privacy practices in a way that users could not have anticipated and that was capable of causing significant harm to them. A Federal Trade Commission investigation resulted in a settlement designed to prevent similar mistakes from happening again.  And I also suggested that privacy lurches may expose companies to legal liability for distributing an unreasonably dangerous product.    </p><p>      Another example of the principles is online behavioral advertising -- the use of unique identifiers known as cookies to track users and to customize the ads they see.  Some users appreciate receiving relevant advertising.  Others find the tracking creepy.    </p><p>      Industry participants recognize there's difference in opinions and offer users a choice of whether to be tracked.  One of the best ways to ensure that these choices are usable and reliable is through innovation for privacy -- promoting the developmentive (ph) tools that users can use to manage their tracking preferences and express them clearly to websites and advertisers.    </p><p>      The best innovation here has come from web browsers, antivirus software, and plug-ins that help users block and delete unwanted cookies.  In the current consensus process, to develop a Do Not Track standard is another encouraging step.  All of these innovations can succeed only if they are respected by websites and advertisers.    </p><p>      The Federal Trade Commission has taken important action against companies that circumvent user privacy protecting technologies, and the FTC and Congress should ensure that websites are not permitted the second-guess users' expressed privacy preferences.    </p><p>      Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today, and I look forward to your questions.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Professor Grimmelmann.  We'll now begin the questioning of the witnesses.    </p><p>      I believe that consumers have the relevant information about if they have the relevant information about privacy policies, they'll make informed decisions about how to allow their information be used, and will choose what services to use in part based on their comfort level with those privacy policies.  So I'd like to ask each of you what your organization is doing specifically to make privacy policies more transparent and easier for consumers to understand.    </p><p>      And we'll start with you, Mr. Shipman.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  Sure.  Thank you.    </p><p>      The -- the expectations in managing privacy with consumers is a never-ending battle.  It's not something that you can simply come out with a particular policy and say, OK, we've written this as clearly as possible, and we can rest on our laurels.  So this is something that continues to evolve.    </p><p>      From the inception of eBay's privacy program, we've actually created, in 1998, a chart.  And at the time, it was fairly simple because you could have a chart with three or four classifications or groups of entities that you share information...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  I'm going to have to get you to get to the point because I've got several questions and several witnesses to answer.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  The...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  So tell us what you're doing right now and prospectively.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  The focus right now is around bringing icons, bringing specific logos or vignettes whether it would be a video or other types of embracing new technology to be able to answer questions that customers have. AdChoices is a perfect example where we have links that are embedded into advertising and other types of things like that.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Excellent.    </p><p>      Mr. Reed?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  So we have -- we have an interesting situation is that we represent the developers, and so we've been trying to give developers tools.    </p><p>      We have run a series of privacy boot camps where we spend the entire day focusing on getting a developer from walking in the door, saying, OK, I need this privacy policy so when they walk out the door not only having privacy, but understanding the tools they need to have to have a narrative with their customers.    </p><p>      And very specifically, one of the ones I'd like to highlight is our work with Moms With Apps where we've created set of icons that have been adopted by some of the privacy policy generators, including PrivacyChoice and we've been in talks with TRUSTe as well, so the developer can select the icons immediately when they build their privacy policy.  So when it shows up for the user -- bam -- they can see it.  It doesn't collect information.  It doesn't link to the web or it does.    </p><p>      So, one, we have to empower developers.  And two, we're working on building tools to inform our customers what those privacy policies mean.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Thank you.    </p><p>      Mr. Babel?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  Sure.  So, TRUSTe helps websites, through a privacy policy generator, generate their first privacy policy.  Big companies might have attorneys to do that.  Small companies start up three people in their garage need help.    </p><p>      Particularly around mobile applications, we find that it's critical, as I mentioned in the testimony, about a third of mobile application even have a privacy policy today.  So we're really trying to help people start by having a privacy policy.    </p><p>      The second thing we do is once people have privacy policies, we help make certain that they're good, of high quality, clear, transparent, easy to read, easy to understand.  And that's where we help a company have a certified privacy policy where we say it meets a good high bar, and that the company is following and actually doing what their privacy policy states.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Thank you.    </p><p>      Mr. Reed, many Internet services are free and are monetized through targeted adds and data collection.  How much would app prices go up or what would it cost to use a search engine or a social media website if companies were restricted from the data that they could collect?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Well, I think we have to look at two sets of numbers. One, what does it change in the way that we develop apps?  And two, when it comes to the actual impact on the industry, if you remove all ads all together, I think you'd see some enormous impacts.  If you remove strictly ads that use information and you just do context-based ads, the estimate run about 20 percent -- a loss of about 20 percent of income for those that are ads-supported.    </p><p>      The reality is that the model right now, we're looking at trying to figure out how to -- how to make sure that we get apps that we get paid directly and -- and supplement through advertising.  So this probably would cost us about 20 percent of revenue.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Mr. Babel?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  I think one of the key unique factors in mobile versus websites just to point out quickly is that mobile actually has a monetization mechanism where you can go back to the extent that someone were to opt-out of ad targeting and go back and say, I am limiting the features of this mobile and pushing you to a charge version.    </p><p>      In the website version of the world -- in that ecosystem, you know, 15 years ago, we started giving out free content online and it would be very hard to go back to that paywall.    </p><p>      As we've read industry research although haven't ended ourselves, we've seen similar numbers to those that Morgan has proposed in terms of the drop-off in advertising, but it's not something that we track and have estimated direct.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Let me ask the three of you what your greatest concerns are about the European Union's recent efforts to impose regulatory regime in Europe.    </p><p>      Mr. Shipman?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  I think the -- the challenge within the E.U. is certainly that we're looking for standards that create international operability.  And so any change in one particular region for a global company destabilizes that operability.  And while we certainly have received approval through the binding corporate rules for operations in Europe and use that as our global standard, changes in that and more restrictions in that certainly make that much more difficult for us.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  We're short on time, so I'm going to echo Chairman Smith when he said the problem we have with it is just the same.  We are not two developers in -- in a garage -- we're two developers in a garage, not two developers and a lawyer.  The difference between us and Europe will create a lot of difficulties for our developers.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Mr. Babel?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  Yes, our clients whether they'd be domestic clients or international clients are challenged by the fact that there are just different requirements by country.  And you are a big company and trying to manage your portfolio of websites across users from each different region, it is challenging to implement technologies to address that.    </p><p>      It's a lot of hard work -- it's a lot of hard work upfront.  And to be honest with you, most companies have not met the deadline for the U.K. Cookie Audit Compliance that was May 25th.  In fact, most government agencies in the U.K. have not met that deadline as well. So it gives you a sense for the challenges that are involved with this policy implementation (inaudible).    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Mr. Grimmelman?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  Well, as the others have mentioned, the lack of harmony across many countries is a significant problem, and it leads to situations in which especially the small players have difficulty even finding out all the laws they need to comply with.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Thank you.    </p><p>      The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt, is recognized.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    </p><p>      The ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Conyers, raised a difficult issue that I want to ask some questions in here relating to legislation versus self-regulation.  The administration's blueprint contemplates baseline legislation complemented by self-regulatory model to implement the Consumers Bill of Rights.  So let me ask a couple of questions in this area.    </p><p>      Do we, in fact, need a federal Consumer Bill of Rights or something maybe not called at, but some federal baseline in this area to deal with privacy.  And if not, two questions arise.  Wouldn't that leave it open in this Internet thing which clearly is across state borders or state by state by state to enact legislation?  And wouldn't that leave it open for self-regulation which is OK if people behave, but is not all that enforceable?  And if people do not behave, I guess, is -- is the question.    </p><p>      So, Mr. Shipman, Mr. Reed, Mr. Babel, and Professor, if you can address those couple of questions in there, I'd be appreciative to you.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  Absolutely and thank you for the question.    </p><p>      I think the challenges, as you highlight, is with self-regulation it leaves consumers with uncertainty.  With -- eBay has long supported a federal omnibus privacy bill.  And the -- the key reasons for that are largely to provide the small and -- and -- and large businesses that we do business with to provide that level of certainty.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  So -- so you think there should be a federal -- federal standard of some kind?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  Yes, we do.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Yeah.  OK.  Go ahead.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Yes, we have been active supporters of the NTIA effort. And I do think, as we get through this, we should talk about ways that the government can enforce bad behavior.  I definitely think that's something where, from a small -- from a particular small business, it's very important to see the government step in and bring harsh actions against companies that do violate people's privacy because nothing gets the message clearer to our members.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Of course, the first step is to have a clear...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Yeah.    </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  ...set of rules about what -- what the standards are.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Exactly.  And so...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  OK.    </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  ...yes on that, good on enforcement.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  OK.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  I think we've seen, at TRUSTe, self-regulation work and work effectively.  And in particular, over the last few years with the beginnings of the DAA effort around AdChoices, you've seen self- regulation accelerate quite rapidly in the last few years to take out -- reach out and touch consumers and give them...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  So what happens in self-regulation if -- if you -- if you got self-regulation and you don't -- you or your members or your customers or clients don't live up to what they agreed?  What are the -- what remedies do I have to enforce that or who enforces those standards?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  Sure.  So in TRUSTe's case where we certify companies for good privacy, the first thing we do if there is an issue at one of those clients is help them get back into alignment with our guidelines for...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Got that, but my -- my data is already out there at that point.  So how do -- how do I get a remedy?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  The second thing we do is eliminate them from the program and, in fact, last year we eliminated...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  That still don't give any remedy.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  The third remedy that we put in place to the extent that there is egregious behavior is we haven't factored for people to the FTC, and the FTC has taken action.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  So there's got to be a -- got to be a federal standard.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  There has -- yes, we have...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  OK.  All right.  OK.  I'm going to refer to it.  We're back there.  All right.    </p><p>      Go ahead, Professor.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  A federal baseline would first bring important clarity to the area.  And in addition, all of the processes of consumer choice and bargaining with websites offer bargains to users and explain the tradeoffs only work if the consumers have an entitlement to their privacy to begin with.    </p><p>      If we don't have a baseline, then they don't need to respect it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  All right.  Has anybody out there in the industry that is advocating for no federal baseline?  Are there any voices out there or do you all represent pretty much the standard belief?  If so, it seems to me, we can quit vexing about whether we need a baseline and start vexing about what we put in the baseline.  Is that right?    </p><p>      Anybody out there got a different opinion about this, I mean, I guess is the question.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  I guess, the only nuance that I would add is that the good part about what NTIA is doing and it will be a lot of work is that it's being built bottom up as a multi-stakeholder effort where we're going through long intense meetings talking about the meanings of words and the definitions.  So it's actually working from the standpoint of what technology is capable of doing and gives us the option to change it as we become capable of doing new things.    </p><p>      So I think it's important that it not be a government-imposed top-down pressure, but it'd be developed by technologists as a way to handle when we change our stuff.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  In the meantime, the laws that are already out there, I assume the gaps of the laws that are already out there that provides some -- some kind of protection.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  I would say it's more than some.  I think...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Yeah.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  ...the Federal Trade Commission has already shown that it has some teeth.  We have -- we obviously have regulation on HIPAA.  We have regulation on (inaudible).  So depending on what kind of data you have, there are more than a fair number of regulation.    </p><p>      Beyond that, this committee knows we also have antitrust laws to deal with companies that are large players that clearly disregard people's privacy time and time again.  So if you can't curb the behavior through FTC, you can always go and look at antitrust as well.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATT</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, my time has expired, but as I told the chairman, I will have to leave to go over and hear Jamie Dimon testify in my other committee.  So let me make a unanimous consent request before I leave, Mr. Chairman, to offer into the record the February 2012 White House green paper commercial data privacy and Innovation in the Internet Economy:  A Dynamic Policy Framework.  Number two, a March 2012 FTC proposal -- whatever -- protected report, protecting consumer privacy in an era of rapid change recommendations for businesses and policymakers.  And a March 2012 report Search Engine Use 2012 a project of the Pew Research Center.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Without objection, those will be entered into the record.  And I'll turn the chair over to the chairman of the committee.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Mr. Babel, let me address my first question to you after you've already answered my initial question as -- in response to a question by Mr. Watt, but I wanted to follow up on the idea of how enforcement worked when it came to individual online businesses that might violate the best practices.  And you responded to Mr. Watt and said, ultimately, if there was a clear violation and there wasn't any response, you'd refer the online businesses to the Federal Trade Commission, I think.  Have you ever had occasion to do that?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  Yes, we have.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  And how many instances?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  There's been one instance that is in my knowledge -- one instance in 2008 of a company called Classic Closeouts which...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  And what do the FTC do?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  They took action.  It was settled, I think, late last year with a $2 million plus fine.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK.  And how many online businesses, in your judgment, have violated the best practices that you have endorsed?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  So last year, in our written testimony, we provided something called the transparency report, where we walk through a number of customers in, number of certification.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Right.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  In each year, I think there's two important data points, one is the number of companies that come to us for certification in an effort to get certified because they don't pass the standards to begin with.  And that is about eight to ten percent of all the clients that are approaching us for certification -- never meet the bar.    </p><p>      The second thing is that, in last year, 11 companies violated kind of what we think are best practices.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK.  And of those 11 you referred went to the FTC?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  Not last year.  The referral to the FTC was in a prior year.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Right, OK.    </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Babel.    </p><p>      Mr. Shipman, let me address a question to you and perhaps to Professor Grimmelmann as well.  And it is this, we've heard, I think, from all witnesses today about the need for online businesses to protect consumer data.  My question goes a little bit farther -- should consumers be able to find out what personal data has been gathered about them.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  Absolutely.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  And, in fact, within our corporate standards that we've had approved through Luxembourg, that is a requirement that we meet.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK.  Do any of the witnesses today feel that consumers should not or do not have a right to know what personal information has been gathered about them?    </p><p>      OK.  The next question is, should consumers be able to opt-out of the process that gathers that personal information about them?    </p><p>      Mr. Shipman, what do you think?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  Let me give you a multi-part answer on that one.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  OK.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  There are certain components of collection that are required.  eBay certainly has financially-related institutions.  We process financial transactions as well as all kinds of ecommerce transactions and commerce.    </p><p>      The data that is essential for the safety, the security, antifraud in that area, we cannot allow consumers to opt-out. Certainly for marketing purposes and other types of secondary uses, we can allow...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  You would allow them to opt-out.  OK.  Thank you.    </p><p>      Professor Grimmelmann, do you have an opinion on that?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  In the context of first party collection where the consumer is dealing with a website...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Yes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  ...their shipment expresses a very clear and correct view.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  You agree with him?  OK.    </p><p>      That concludes my questions.  The gentleman from Michigan, the ranking member of the full committee is recognized for his questions.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONYERS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Chairman.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONYERS</emphasis>:  Mr. Reed, we've heard a lot about self-regulation here too much as far as I'm concerned.  I don't know what you think this committee -- what some -- some others -- not you -- think that we make rules, we make laws, we have court decisions.  And now we come up with let's go for self-regulation.    </p><p>      We've been hauling -- all of the big tech companies have been in and out of court repeatedly.  And so, can you give me a little more confidence about this whole notion of self-regulating?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Well, I think the -- the first thing we have to look at is does the FTC have enough resources.  We start with that.  But I think you also have to look at continued behavior.   </p><p>      There's carrot and stick, right?  Industry self-reg is a carrot. Do this and you won't get the stick.  I think that, for small companies, we all usually dependent on platforms and we are incredibly responsive to our customers.  Why?  Because we're scared of losing them.    </p><p>      I think one of the things that -- that concerns us very much that's been happening in the privacy space is that some of the violations have been actually done by big companies and one, in particular, you know, the chairman brought up WhySpy.  That trickles down into the sentiment of the regular citizenry.  So, yes, I think it's critical that the resources are at the FTC and that the DOJ is willing to step up and go after those who don't respond to carrot and don't respond to stick.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONYERS</emphasis>:  Yeah.  But -- but, Mr. Reed, a lot -- a lot of this privacy, we don't even know what's being collected, and -- and we don't have any way of getting at it.  I mean, I -- I see a huge problem...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Well, I think...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONYERS</emphasis>:  ...still out here, don't you?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Well, I think the question of what's being collected, I think we can actually figure -- figure out what's being collected. The larger question is, what happens to it after it's collected?  What is it combined with?  Does that create problems in our people selling it in a way that's -- that's damaging or causes harm to people -- to people's privacy?  Does it make it hard for them to get a job?  Does it make it hard for them to buy a house?  That's really the question.    </p><p>      It's not what's collected, it's what's done with the collection of that information after, how it's assembled.  And those are areas where I think that there can be questions, and -- and we should find good answers.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONYERS</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.    </p><p>      Well, we know what's being collected -- everything.  Is there anything that they -- I mean, that's -- that's the nature of the problem.  I...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  But -- but I think it's worth noting that the Sears Catalog had information on people in the 1900's.  They knew what we were buying, and it's really about what's done to harm people afterwards.  That's really the kicker because, you know, we all had the Sears Catalog.  There's a kid in our house and he would read it.    </p><p>      Sears knew what you bought.  They kept a record of what you bought -- that was a good thing -- to know what they did with that information, prevented you from buying a house or prevented you from getting a job, or prevented you from getting insurance.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONYERS</emphasis>:  Or hurting your credit.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Exactly.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONYERS</emphasis>:  Let me turn to Professor Grimmelmann for a continuation of this discussion.  I mean, this is a very nice conversation we're having here with four experts.  But I mean, there is a certain element here of let's all trust everybody to do the right thing.    </p><p>      The FTC is underfunded.  Leibowitz -- Jon Leibowitz, the chair, comes before us every year and makes the case that they need more resources.  How -- how do you see this discussion of a -- of a giving benefit to the doubt to these huge companies that are collecting what we don't even -- well, from my point of view is everything.    </p><p>      We go -- we go back to Sears in 1900.  Guess what they're doing now if you think that was something.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  I would like to say that some huge companies can play an important role in building tools that stop other huge companies from gathering lots of data.    </p><p>      So, for example, Apple puts significant restrictions in the iPhone that limit the data that apps can collect.  So the apps can't gather location data without the users' expressed permission.  And Microsoft is bumbling in its most recent version of the Internet Explorer will be turning on the Do Not Track header by default to tell websites they should not collect data about users.    </p><p>      We can find ways to exploit the competitive process in the industry, to have companies recognize privacy as an advantage, and help consumers keep personally from other companies.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONYERS</emphasis>:  But there are some that are disregarding the tracking instructions of their consumers.  You know that.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  So, the advantage of that is that the company disregard the tracking request has now done something that's explicitly deceiving the consumer and failing to respond to the request rather than just taking advantage of their ignorance, which gives the FTC a surer basis for action.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONYERS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Conyers.    </p><p>      The gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Marino, is recognized for his questions.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    </p><p>      I'm going to start with Mr. Shipman, and let's back the bus up here a little bit if you would please.  And if anyone has anything to add to it, just chime in.    </p><p>      Let's start back with the scenario.  A parent is having a personal conversation with their son or daughter who is off to college, or a corporate -- one corporation is having a confidential exchange of information with another corporation concerning, let's say, a merger.    </p><p>      Once this information -- once I hit that Send button, let's educate the people of where does that go and how many people or how many entities have access to that even when I hit the Delete and the other side hits the Delete.  Do you understand my question?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  Yeah, sure.  Basically, the -- your question just to quickly summarize is when you hit Send on an email, how many different entities could have possibly end up with?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  Even after I delete it.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  Sure, sure.  To me, the biggest challenge here -- I mean, there are many challenges.  eBay is not an ISP.  We actually don't provide email, but I'm knowledgeable enough to be able to provide a few comments.    </p><p>      One of the toughest components here is access where you have other governmental agencies or law enforcement or other requests where the consumer may have no knowledge of that information being requested.  Beyond the technology components it is then deleted within the systems, within service providers, within a custodial relationship.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  OK.  I understand the law enforcement aspect of it. I've been part of it for 19 years.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  OK.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  So, just give me -- give me your best estimate on how many entities would have that information?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  Go ahead.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  I think -- I think let's break it in (inaudible).  Is your service a cloud-based or you're just going from -- from my company to your company?  If you're going company to company, not too many -- not too many entities in between will hold on to it, but he raises a key point, which is part of actual reform of these questions is that law enforcement has stepped in to place -- to place collection points in the process.    </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  OK.  Let's exclude law enforcement for a moment.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  If you include law enforcement company to company, not much.  If it's company to cloud provider and back, then the cloud provider does have access to that information at a certain level. Most...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  OK.  Now, so there are several entities even if it's company to company.  How long is that individual or that entity have that information?  Until they just delete it?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  Sure.  So, once an email or any -- any other piece of data is received, it's within that -- if it's a responsible company, they have a data classification and data retention policies.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  OK.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  So depending on the classification of that data, it may be seven days, it may be seven years.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  All right.  I'll be jumping to the next one.  Who -- who best can answer this?  What would prevent an employee from obtaining that information and sharing it?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  It depends on -- it depends on their status in the corporation.  Somebody who's got the key to the kingdom, so to speak, then the network nerd in the closet, he's going to have all of it.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  So my point is...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Right.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  ...people have access to it and can use nefariously, correct?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Yes.  That's -- yes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  There is an important consideration here, which is there are tools that certain companies, certainly eBay want to deploy which do monitor and track access to information within the organization.  So not only are employees based on permission have access or don't have access to information, but also if there is anomalous activity, it's detected, reported, and prevented.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  Mr. Babel and then Professor, maybe you can give me a quick answer on the -- on this?    </p><p>      I'm an individual that questions do we want the federal government involved.  The fact I think the position that the federal government spends too much time in our lives to begin with.  So, give me, Mr. Babel, if you can please, give me your opinion based on the fact that can the industry police itself.  I have a little problem with the Fox (ph) setting rules and regulations for the (inaudible). But give me a scenario, if you would contrast them, policing itself and meeting federal regulations.    </p><p>      So if you both can answer that please, Mr. Babel?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  Sure.  So I think that it's, you know, as TRUSTe has self-regulatory programs, the key asset that we have is our band of consumers.  So if we aren't living up to the standard of making certain that people who no longer follow the standard are out, like for us, it's the whole company we're betting.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  OK.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  Our credibility is the key, meaning the program and its credibility is the key.    </p><p>      I think when it comes to legislation, one of the things that I am concerned about is just, you know, do we -- what are the unintended consequences of legislation.  If you look at something like CAN-SPAM, even now there's a law that was well written, well adopted.  But at the end of the day, 90 percent of spam or -- of email is still spam. It's not the law that eliminated the spam in your mailbox...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  OK.  I'm running out of time here.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  ...technology.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  Professor?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  I think that the companies who are most going to want federal intervention for are the ones who are TRUSTe members who are engaged in shady gray area marketing that can seal their track, click fraud, then all kinds of shady deals that are kind of consumers (inaudible).    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINO</emphasis>:  OK.  Thank you.  I yield back.  Thank you.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman.    </p><p>      The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Deutch, is recognized for five minutes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    </p><p>      Mr. Babel, you said that 59 percent of people believe that their information is protected.  You touted that number.  Four in ten people are concerned that their information is not protected, I presume is the balance of that analyze -- the balance of that polling.    </p><p>      I just want to talk about the self-regulation piece of this, which a number of have talked about.  You have a program -- a privacy program, which if I understand what you're saying correctly, if a company adopts it then they receive your certification.  Is that right?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  Correct.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  And -- and does that privacy -- that -- has certification been given to the largest companies?  And what Mr. Shipman described sounds like a really terrific privacy policy, which I'll ask about in a minute.  But today, have your certification in their privacy policy?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  They're our client, yes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  And -- and -- and do all of the -- I mean, do the biggest -- just thinking about those companies with market dominance and does -- does Google have a certification, does Facebook have a certification from you for their privacy policies?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  One of the things we look at at the top 100 websites listed by a company called Alexa that's based on consumer traffic, and we have about 50 percent of those top 100 clients.  So we have good penetration, but certainly not all.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  Right.  So -- so just again thinking about the ones that we use most often, does Google has a certification and does Facebook has its -- for their privacy policy?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  Sure.  Google is not a certified client of TRUSTe and neither is Facebook.  We do work with them in some different areas, but they are not certified clients of our program.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  And -- and when you -- Mr. Reed, when you talked about the information to be collected, you should -- so we should know what data is being collected, who we're showing it with and being transparent with customers.    </p><p>      Is that -- Mr. Babel, is that a part of your certification?  Do you look at each of those?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  Yeah.  If we were to think of the highest three levels...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  Yeah.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  ...of the certification, the business needs to first be transparent, meaning tell people what data they're collecting.  You know, if they're sharing it, how long they're holding on to it.  They need to give choice.  Would you like to not have that data be collected and they need to be accountable to that choice.  So, yes, the tenets of what Morgan...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  And I'm sorry, I don't -- unfortunately, I just -- I don't know -- I'm learning a lot today, but I don't know well enough how the relationship between TRUSTe and some of the other companies. What is it -- I mean, have you -- when you say you work with some of these other companies, but they don't have the certification, do you suggest to them what's missing?  Or when it comes to those three items that we just discussed, when you look at company with real market dominance like -- like Google, for example, or like Facebook, is there one of those three that they might be missing?  Are there certain things that -- that we ought to be considering?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  So, I think of it as it's a totally different effort we're working on with them.  Here -- I'll give you the example.  With Google, they have a business to business app marketplace where a business owner using Gmail can download an application.  We certify those applications, but it's in a partnership with Google so it's not related to kind of the three core tenets.    </p><p>      We don't work with them in our core certification business.  It's kind of a separate adjacent thing.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  So, I guess, what I'm really getting at is when you talk about self-regulation and the success of self-regulation, in -- for a company -- any company that has real market dominance, is that -- is that sufficient to rely on to do the 40 percent of consumers who are concerned their information is not kept private?  Should they -- should they be satisfied with the -- the privacy policies established in a self-regulatory environment?  If -- if not, every company regulates themselves the same way.   </p><p>      Mr. Reed, you look like you want to jump in.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Well, it you have to look at -- at behavior.  You know, eBay is sitting here.  They have a pretty good track record so far on -- on privacy.  A lot of our developers use their PayPal system to enable -- enable app purchases.  It's worked out pretty well.  We haven't had those.    </p><p>      So I think your question about the size of the company is not the first -- the first test.  The first test is, what are they doing?  And if a company with dominance has the power to take it and kind of thumb their noses at consumers, well, then yes.  I think that's the kind of time where you have to start taking a look and -- and you start to have asking harder questions.  So it's not the size as much as it is the behavior that really triggers it.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  Well, Mr. Reed, are there -- you are more familiar with the industry than I am.  Are there -- are there any companies that you think are thumbing their nose with these privacy issues?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Well, I think -- I mean, I think we've -- we've heard the names several times, everybody has been talking about it.  I think Google has -- Google's privacy violations to date have certainly raised a lot of concern.  I think it's ironic, you know, it got so bad that the Jon Stewart Show -- the Daily Show actually made fun of it on Wi-Fi.  So...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  Well, Mr. Reed...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  ...that harms all of us.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  Mr. Reed, I'm almost out of time.  Of the -- the three things that -- that you point out -- know the data being collected, who is being shared with and being transparent with customers, which of those three do you think is -- is most often being ignored by any company that might be somebody who knows these privacy issues?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  I think in the case -- in the case of -- of -- of Google, I think the problem is that they have them in transparency with what they were doing.  I think I was very clear on WhySpy.  It was clear on the Buzz settlement.  They haven't been transparent.  And I think that's an area that they need to improve or -- or regulators need to step in.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEUTCH</emphasis>:  Right.  Thank you.    </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman.    </p><p>      The gentleman from Utah, Mr. Chaffetz, is recognized for five minutes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHAFFETZ</emphasis>:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for being here.  I appreciate it.   </p><p>      I -- I wanted to highlight the idea that the Internet -- the tech sector is actually something in our company that's working.  You're looking at growth -- growth and jobs, and expansion of our economy, this is one sector that is thriving.    </p><p>      One -- one of my concerns is while we have these deep-seated needs to make sure that privacy is protected, that we're protecting consumers, I think, Mr. Chairman, we also need to be ultra careful in making sure that we don't convolute the process to a point where young entrepreneurs, new startups aren't able to start because there is such a mass of regulation and uncertainty.    </p><p>      I do question the notion that the FTC is the right organization. I wonder -- we talk a lot about the teeth of the FTC, but we can probably count on one hand where they've actually taken -- taken action.  And so I think that begs the question of, should this be done in part by statute so that we can use Article III court as opposed to the FTC, which would be much more readily available to a -- to a consumer or an individual?    </p><p>      It's just something, Mr. Chairman, that I think we need to continue to explore because I'm not convinced that the FTC is the end all, be all.  I'm also concerned that we have multiple jurisdictions here.  The Consumer Financial Protection Board, for instance, you're going to end up much like in the financial sector or you have conflicting rules and regulations.    </p><p>      I think it's also important that the Congress stand up for itself and not allow an administration -- I don't care which party it's involved with -- allow just simple rulemaking to push through the process and not allow the back and forth in the discussion that would happen in Congress.  So I think we've been failing on that front in general.    </p><p>      There are couple of other areas that I'd like you to address and our time is so short here but, Mr. Chairman, I think one of the things we have to further explore if we're going to truly look at privacy is how do we deal with minors -- minors.  You know, my 11-year-old arguably knows more about using the apps in the Internet than -- than most people three, four, five times her age.    </p><p>      We're going to also have to deal with the national versus the international aspect in scope, which was obviously -- or the need in the genesis of SOPA.  That issue has not gone away.  We are still losing billions of dollars overseas, and we're going to have to deal with that.    </p><p>      The other area that I'm -- I'm really trying to focus on and I'd like you to address, I didn't come to just give a big speech.  I'd like you to actually address is I think Americans have a reasonable expectation of privacy, but how do we define that.    </p><p>      One of the things that I think we have to look at is airspace. It's reasonable that somebody walk down your front yard, they could look at your front yard and see your mailbox, and your shrubs, and what-not.   </p><p>      As we expand out and start to use drones and satellites and other types of who knows what kind of technology, what is the reasonable expectations to privacy, say, in your backyard or on your private property?  And along with that is geolocation.    </p><p>      I've sponsored a bill on this.  I think it's going to continue to go on.  Would anybody care to address what is the proper balance of airspace?  You know, law enforcement use helicopters, right?  We've allowed that for a long time.  We think that's a good thing.  But fuel is expensive, it's hard to get a helicopter.  They can -- law enforcement can only keep it up for so long.    </p><p>      But if you have a -- a drone that's up 24/7 or somebody that's going to -- where is that balance, where is that line?  Anybody care to take a stab at that one?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  I can -- I can say a little bit about that.  One of the encouraging things about the Supreme Court's decision in the United States versus Jones is that the court endorsed two different kinds of rationales to protecting privacy.  One of them based in the majority is rooted in historic law of trespass.  And there, that might signal a reinvigoration of the idea that the airspace, closely above your home, is actually yours and not to be invaded.    </p><p>      We have long accepted that commercial airlines can fly far overhead, but this might signal an attitude we should protect your sovereignty over your own space close to the ground.    </p><p>      And the second coming from the concurrences is the so-called mosaic theory that continuous observation over a long period of time can ultimately build such a complete portrait that it does invade mosaic expectation of privacy.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHAFFETZ</emphasis>:  And -- and I guess, that's one of the challenges that Jones generally face because he's right in the -- in the Jones case which is, in large part, what our legislation is -- is modeled after is this idea that there's a toggling between an individual's movements on private property and out in the public space.    </p><p>      Look, technology can be great.  It can be so useful and make people's lives better.  But how do we actually craft something without ruining the industry.  That is the fundamental question.  I don't know if the other three care to jump in here.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  We have a -- we have a phrase in the office.  We say nobody wants technology at the speed of government.  And -- and that is the problem that -- that this -- the question that you point out raises.    </p><p>      You know, I speak as mean not as act.  I would be totally creeped out having a drone fly above my house all the time 24/7, watching my backyard.  That's me.  I'm not speaking on behalf of our members.    </p><p>      But by the same token, a plane flying overhead isn't the problem. So we have to look at the behavior question really.  The plane flying overhead has an intent -- it's going from point A to point B.  It doesn't intend to be looking in my backyard.    </p><p>      The drone positioned over my house, watching everything that happens, and whether or not I mowed the lawn on Sunday, has the intent of watching what I'm doing.  So I think that's part of what -- part of how we need to look at what technology empowers us, what is the intent of the person who's putting that technology in place?  What do they want out of it?    </p><p>      And that helps -- that helps us guide the question of what is appropriate airspace in certain aspects?  That allows for wireless transmission to happen without -- without -- without impeding with a lot of government regulation.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  Yeah.  I'd like to just add, I think, you know, the work that -- that eBay and a number of other organizations have done in really framing what should federal omnibus privacy law look like, really focuses -- and Mr. Reed used the word intent -- its use -- its use-based obligations.    </p><p>      With data, there is an intended use and there's an obligation that needs to come with that intended use.  And you can look at each type of use -- is it fulfillment?  Is it providing a service?  Is it flying from point A to point B?  And with that, data collection and use comes obligation.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHAFFETZ</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, my time has well past gone.  I -- I would appreciate the industry continuing to look at this because I think it's an incomplete answer.  There are -- it is -- it is not sufficient enough to say that is the -- the intent because what does a celebrity, for instance, in Southern California do?  You can see TMZ putting drones up flying to follow celebrities in their 10-mile zone.  That's what TMZ stands for, right?  24/7.    </p><p>      So, intent is -- is not sufficient enough.  I think the industry has also got to catch up in how to help us to find that because Congress says the ability to ruin people's lives and rather not see that happen.  I yield back.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman.    </p><p>      The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Lofgren, is recognized for five minutes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And as Mr. Chaffetz has indicated, I -- I have some reluctance to see Congress weighed in on these issues in a heavy regulatory manner because we don't work at Internet speed, we work at a different speed.  And, you know, that's a good thing.  I mean, we can't make mistakes quickly, but certainly the technology will move much faster than we can.  And so I have been interested in how industry might establish standards that prevent a heavy regulatory load.    </p><p>      And along those lines, I'm wondering how this process is working relative to the recent decision on Internet Explorer to do -- make the default Do Not Track.  I understand that they're -- and certainly, Microsoft has the -- has the right to do that.  Has that had an impact on the industry-wide effort to reach consensus on Do Not Track or not?   </p><p>      Professor, could you answer that question?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  So, the decision has been discussed within the working group that is building the standard.  Some of the participants in that group of -- including representatives from Google, Yahoo, and Adobe have taken the position that Internet Explorer should be defined to be noncompliant such that websites could say, I think you're using Internet Explorer, therefore I'm not going to honor your Do Not Track request.  And I think this is simply an attempt to sabotage the standard.  It won't work if websites can second-guess the user statement, \"I don't want to be tracked.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  Well, the -- the question, I guess, is for me, what's the default?  What kind of transparency is available to the user?  And also, what kind of accountability is -- is there if the users' choice is, in fact, not honored by the person representing the choice?    </p><p>      And -- and, I guess, the question is, who owns this data?  Maybe that's something that -- that the -- does need to be established in law, that the individual has an opportunity to enforce their own choices.  Do you think that is an approach that would be helpful for Congress to take?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  The default right now is that websites collect but offer users an opportunity to opt-out.  I think users should have the opportunity to choose tools to protect their privacy by saying do not collect.  And if websites disagree with that choice, they can communicate with the user and say, here are the benefits...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  Right.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  ...we could offer you if you turn tracking on.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  That's -- for example, I -- I use Firefox as -- I don't know why, but I've always used it, and I've got Do Not Track turned on in my Firefox because that's the choice I want to make.  But it means that there's something I can't do on Firefox, which is a decision I have made.  Isn't it just -- wouldn't it solve our problem in the Internet world if we were just transparent to users and gave them enforceable choices?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  Yes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  Now, let me ask about the, you know, Mr. Chaffetz -- great minds think alike.  I was also thinking about the drone issue. And I think I'm -- I'm told that in August, the FAA is actually going to make do some rulemaking on what drones can collect, which is kind of an odd regulatory rule.    </p><p>      Recently, the  FTC had a workshop on the use of facial recognition technology because this isn't just an online phenomenon, I mean, you go into every store in America practically, and there's a camera that's taking pictures of the shoppers.  And with facial recognition technology, you can now aggregate data about individuals -- who they are.  And I mean, that's an immense amount of data that we, I don't think, have any rules about.  What are your thoughts on that?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Well, the good news is that technology industries have actually been thinking on that.  There are actually trade association efforts to develop best practices.  And probably, the best example I've seen to date on this is, strangely enough, Connect by Microsoft. They put together an incredibly comprehensive program prior to putting the Connect in your house.  And you'd say, why would that matter?    </p><p>      But you realize, they're essentially facing a camera from the television at you, and so they did an entire privacy by design prior to launching Connect strictly on the question of facial recognition. So the good news is smart people are starting the day saying how do we deal with it.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  But the issue is then we have plenty of Fourth Amendment rules for the government, and that's important, I mean, obviously.  But what we're talking about here is not the government, but the private sector, which we celebrate.  I mean, the private sector is the job creator of -- of our country - the engine of economic growth.  And yet, the capacity to know everything about individuals because of the technology that has been deployed, and yet individuals may not even be aware that their -- their picture is being taken with facial recognition technology.    </p><p>      They may have absolutely no privacy, and I don't think we have any standards that are set for that use of big data.  I mean, correct me if I'm -- if I'm wrong.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  No, actually, I think in that regard, the online and mobile spaces are arguably doing a better job...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  Yes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  ...communicating what information is collected and how it is used.  And I think that as we these technologies move into retail that certainly companies like eBay that work with retail partners can -- can form that partnership and can educate and help them with -- with their use and their need to know their customer and how to balance that appropriately.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  I know my time is up, but I would just say that, you know, we need to have rules -- individuals have -- have the ability to enforce their understanding either through the FTC or through private rights of action.  But we have not really looked at all to the non- online issues that may be even more severe than what people are paying attention because everybody who goes online knows it's an issue. Nobody knows that the drone is -- is in the sky or that the corner grocery is -- is collecting their data.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  No, you're exactly right and we all saw in the retail space that Target knew a young lady was pregnant before she had been able to tell her family.  And that was not the online data collection at all that was strictly from the retail store.  So you're exactly right.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOFGREN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My time is up.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlewoman.    </p><p>      The gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Jackson-Lee, is recognized for five minutes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON-LEE</emphasis>:  I thank the chairman very much.  I thank all the witnesses for their testimony, and I follow my colleague from California with the same quizzical concern about the extensiveness -- the vastness of the issues dealing with Internet use and the concerns that we now have facing the American public or the world public.  And so I want to raise some questions on that issue.    </p><p>      But before I do that, Mr. Reed, do you know the apps that are from Houston?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON-LEE</emphasis>:  And you're well informed.  Do you have some others that you can either refer and do a printout for us?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON-LEE</emphasis>:  It is remarkable and probably gives shockwaves to future employers.  But I -- I appreciate that.    </p><p>      Let me stay on the line of reasoning of my questions about privacy and use two examples.  First, on the front page of the website, CNET, there's a moving story of a paralyzed man who use his eyes to tweet.  This story demonstrates the enormous potential of the Internet.  How can this man be secure in knowing that when he use the web browser like an Internet Explorer and choose Do Not Track that his instructions will be followed and not ignored?  Who wants to take that question?    </p><p>      Professor?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  The important part there is that once Do Not Track is standardized.  I hope that Congress in the FTC will see fit to treat that as an enforceable practice either under the principles of contract law or as a deceptive trade practice, consumers' request not to be tracked should be honored.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON-LEE</emphasis>:  And how long or what should we do to move that standardization forward in terms of the industry to move forward on the standardized practice.    </p><p>      Fortunately, working group that is discussing it has an active and aggressive schedule as long as they're aware that Washington is watching and hoping for them to succeed and waiting for the results, I think that is the most important thing you can do now.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON-LEE</emphasis>:  So you would say contract law and what will be the other enforcement?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  The FTC's ability to prohibit unfair and deceptive trade practices.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON-LEE</emphasis>:  And my concern would be what are we doing now, but I appreciate what you're saying is that we're on the right track.    </p><p>      Let me also add this question.  (Inaudible) this morning discussing another topic, which is immigration reform on C-SPAN, but a question was raised before I came on to -- in a Google official report by Dr. Dorothy Chu (ph) on the alarming number of request for government censorship.  The United States was number one.    </p><p>      But the question is the government has a special role and responsibility.  What should Congress role be in monitoring and -- in monitoring, permitting, or opposing censorship by the government?    </p><p>      I'll go to professor, but I'd like some others to chip in.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  So, the law enforcement request come from a wide variety of sources -- government both in the United States and abroad. And so the law of Congress there is, in part, to monitor the request coming from United States entities and, in part, also to just work with you as companies over the pressure they are receiving from foreign governments to censor and help give them the protection and reassurance in United States government that we support free expression around the world.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON-LEE</emphasis>:  But are you saying we -- we make statements because it's -- we're asking to protect what we are transmitting.  So the point is -- is that the government is making these points that they need to, in essence, protect what they have.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  There was a conversation that has been going on for a number of years over a global Internet freedom principals.  And part of that has been a discussion about possibly legislating responsibilities to United States companies to be transparent about their degree of compliance or resistance to fine censorship accounts.    </p><p>      Google is transparent about the request it receives is actually helpful in understanding the pressure that governments put on our companies to do their dirty work.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  I think that is a very sensitive question and that is appropriate for congressional review.  Let me go to Mr. Babel to talk of the challenges of privacy as he established your company.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  Sure. The challenges are really in helping companies and consumers kind of meet that best practice of where there's trust by consumers that the companies are doing the right thing.  So our kind of sole role for existence is helping clients -- customers understand what best practices around privacy really are and helping them prove to consumers that they're doing the right thing with their, you know, personal information.  So that's what TRUSTe is really there in helping the ecosystem know and understand, and balance that trust relationship between businesses and (inaudible).    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON-LEE</emphasis>:  Are your customers bankers or banks?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  There are few banks, but it's -- it's really more focused on more online companies and technology companies (inaudible) necessarily banks with the other regulations that they have.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Thank you.  The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON-LEE</emphasis>:  I yield back.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for five minutes, Mr. Johnson.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    </p><p>      And I must admit that I was just a little disturbed, Mr. Reed, when you left me out of the equation.  I'm sitting here right in front of you, closest to you.  We could almost breathe on each other and you didn't mention any app from the floor  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  (Inaudible) your app is good.  It's -- I'll give it to you right now.  It's a great app that allows you to pay for your parking spot with your mobile phone.  It's a -- it's actually one that a lot of us already uses, called Parkmobile.  It's a great app.  It lets you pay for parking with your mobile phone.    There you go.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  I have to tell you -- thank you.  I also found one from Decatur, which is where I represent.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Yeah.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Ping, a subsidiary of Ping Media Group incorporated is a provider of mobile coupons and promotions, which enable retailers and vendors to communicate directly with their customers via mobile phones.  And then I got another one.    </p><p>      A young man, 17 years old, his name is Albert Renshaw out of Gwinett County, which I also represent.  He's developed Apps4Life, A- P-P-S-4, the number, LIFE, which offers Wi-Fi texting without a wireless connection.  And I thought that was pretty good.    </p><p>      But I will now get into the meat of my concern.  A breach into security protocol by a company such as eBay that exposes private customer information to the public could result in death or grievous body injury to a customer whose private information was divulged wrongfully.  The consumer certainly has a right to recover damages for his or her injury or their next of kin for their death.  I'm sure you all would not disagree with that.  And they have a right to seek a recovery in a court of law.    </p><p>      But one of the -- and that's one of a consumer's basic rights, but that right is being chipped away at with this -- with these mandatory pre-dispute arbitration, mandatory arbitration clauses in these consumer agreements, which prohibit the individual -- the aggrieved party from being able to sue in court.  And instead, they are forced into mandatory arbitration where the arbitrator is selected by the company.    </p><p>      The arbitrator may or may not be a lawyer.  The arbitrator does not operate in a public court room, but it's a private secret proceeding may be held miles away -- hundreds and thousands of miles away from where the aggrieved party actually lives.  There's no rules of federal procedure, rules of civil procedure, rules of evidence, and no jury trial.    </p><p>      You know, the arbitrator decides the issue.  And then once the arbitrator does there's no right to an appeal.  This is a private system of adjudicating disputes, which consumers sign up for in a consumer agreement with -- without any knowledge of the gravity of what they are giving up.    </p><p>      Mr. Shipman, what do you think about that?  Does -- does your company have to sue sometimes the competitors for various things in a court of law and do you think that it's important that consumers have the right to take their matter to court as well?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  So, certainly the scenario you paint is -- is an awful and terrible scenario for that family and one that I would hope that we -- we never encounter.    </p><p>      I think there's two important points here.  The first is, what are the terms that the company has with a customer?  And...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  What that does.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  ...what are the terms?  Is there an arbitration provision or...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yeah.  Do you know whether or not you have that in eBay?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  In the case of eBay, we actually have a number of choices for our customers depending on the size of the claim.  If it's a financial-related claim, it may be available to small claims action. If it's -- excuse me -- if it's a larger claim and certainly you can bring that case.  We don't -- we don't have that arbitration provision that would prevent someone from being able to be heard and may have their day in court.    </p><p>      The -- the second theme that you talk about is information security and the protection of information.  And certainly, you, you know, a responsible company has thousands of people devoted to making sure that the information that is entrusted with us is taken care of appropriately because the last thing we want certainly is that scenario that you paint because that's awful for not only our business, but also for our customers.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Well, certainly, and -- and it's not that the company would intend for any harm to come to one of its customers because of the breach.  It could happen though pretty easily given the fact that the -- this marketplace is in its earliest stage of development, growth, and mistakes can be made along the way with various applications.  Something may have a bug that needs to be worked out.    </p><p>      And it's definitely possible for someone's -- let's say a -- a woman who -- whose husband or boyfriend, you know, wants to do some damage to them, and due to a breach of information is able to follow through with that either, you know, character-wise or reputation-wise, or even come into the house and -- and -- and cutting up into a million pieces.  You know, it could happen.    </p><p>      And if it does happen, then if -- if eBay decides that, OK, this claim is not worth that much, then it would go through a certain procedure.  And if it's -- if it's deemed by eBay to be larger than that, then it goes into -- then the person has a right to -- to go to court.  Is that what we're talking about?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  Well, you know, again, I mean, very awful scenario that you're painting.  But...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  (Inaudible) is true...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  Nonetheless.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  ...anything might happen.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  And certainly, we can follow up with you afterwards. We love to work with you.    </p><p>      The -- you know, our clause allows consumers to decide what the -- you know, what avenue they have available to them.  We don't limit all claims to arbitration.  So I think that's the, you know, the salient piece.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  OK.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  The second thing is on -- on this issue of a security breach, what we've seen to date, I can't summarize if you don't want me to summarize all of the legislation in the case law.  What we've seen today is where there is a harm, and in the cases that you're providing there are clear harms, then it is likely, I believe, that you would see damages be appropriate.  Where we have seen no harm, no financial identify theft, no physical harm, the cases that we've seen generally tend to say that there is not liability in that regard.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  I understand.    </p><p>      Professor Grimmelmann, your response, sir, or insight?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  I agree with him that where there is physical harm to the individual who has been hurt as a result of the breach, then yes, the courts are available, and they have been willing to hear those suits.    </p><p>      I am concerned somewhat that the breaches do not result in immediate provable harm, but nonetheless reduce the information security for all of us by leaking financial information on many consumers that can lead to act of identity theft.  It can't specifically trace back to that one individual breach, have resulted in harm is not provable in a court of law, and so therefore there's no redress against it.  This is why data breach notification laws and other efforts to shine a light on this and enforce basic information security practices against industry participants are important.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Class action litigation could play a part in deterring willful misconduct that could ensue...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  The time of the gentleman has expired.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  I noticed that red button has been on ever since I started talking, so I don't know how long I've gone, Mr. Chairman, but it doesn't seem like five minutes though.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for one additional minute to sum up his ideas.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Thank you.    </p><p>      Class action litigation where a number of people have suffered just a small amount of harm, but the class action litigation which can result in a verdict of some importance in terms of the amount could act as a deterrent, and -- and it's good for public policy, in my opinion.    </p><p>      What would be your response to that, Professor Grimmelmann, because I don't want to -- I don't want to personalize this with eBay? eBay is no different than all of the other entities out there that are very popular with consumers, so I'll ask you, Professor.    </p><p>      Well, I'll ask Mr. -- Mr. Reed.  What do you think?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  This is an area in which...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Go ahead -- go ahead.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  This is an area in which you are concerned about arbitration...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  (Inaudible).    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  ...important.  And this is also an area in which class action litigation has been important for privacy.  Facebook has recently settled a lawsuit over its marketing commercial product using individual's pictures to say, \"James just watched Wally.  Don't you want to watch it too?\" to their friends.  And a class action lawsuit was altered in a $10 million settlement.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Thank you.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  The time of the gentleman has expired again, and having allotted him 10-1/2 minutes on his five minutes of time, I'm going to take the privilege of asking a clarifying question for the witnesses.    </p><p>      To me, self-regulation means companies published their policies. And then if they engage in deceptive practices by not following those policies and under existing law, the Federal Trade Commission would have the authority to take action for false advertising or whatever the case might be.    </p><p>      What I want to know for sure here is does anyone here believe that the federal government should impose a one-size-fits-all regulatory approach or that the federal government should prescribe specific privacy policies to specific companies or in general.    </p><p>      Mr. Shipman?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHIPMAN</emphasis>:  No, I don't think the -- the government should draft specific privacy policies.  I think we should leave that to industry and those that are innovating the services and technologies.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Thank you.    </p><p>      Mr. Reed?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Exactly the same.  I agree completely.  That's not the position the government should be in.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Mr. Babel?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BABEL</emphasis>:  (Inaudible) to agree and also agree with your view that self-regulation with -- and have a proper backdrop with the FTC is a good program to continue.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Mr. Grimmelmann?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIMMELMANN</emphasis>:  I agree that government should not regulate specific privacy policies.  It should make sure that consumers have effective notice of what those policies are and/or have enforcement when those promises are broken.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOODLATTE</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.  It's definitely clarifying information from all of you.    </p><p>      I'd like to thank all of our witnesses for their testimony today. This has been a very informative hearing.  And without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit to the chair additional written questions for the witnesses, which we will forward and ask the witnesses to respond as promptly as they can so that their answers may be made part of the record.    </p><p>      Without objection, all members will have legislative days to submit any additional materials for inclusion in the record.  And with that, I again thank all of our distinguished witnesses.  And the hearing is adjourned.    </p><p>      END    </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55YF-G0F1-F15W-H2T4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

This hearing of the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet will come to order. I now recognize myself for an opening statement.</p><p/><p>Today, we are holding a hearing to examine the public policy issues raised by new technologies in the mobile and online spaces. It is clear that some of the central policy issues for both consumers and companies are the issues of privacy and data collection.</p><p/><p>Privacy continues to take on greater importance as more Americans not only use the Internet and mobile devices, but also share their personal information with companies on the web. Privacy policies and the technological safeguards that companies implement will help guide consumers on what they should expect from those who handle their personal information and set expectations for companies that use personal data.</p><p/><p>As Congress continues to look at privacy issues online, it is important to have a firm understanding of what the industry practices are. Today's hearing will explore what mechanisms of private sector is currently employing to protect Internet and mobile users. It will also highlight the technological innovation and development that has occurred in this space.</p><p/><p>There have been astonishing advancements in the delivery of products and services online. And as a result, there are privacy implications for a variety of new technologies, some of which were not even in existence a few years ago.</p><p/><p>Many of the private -- many in the private sector already have policies and procedures in place to police themselves to ensure they are following best practices. Groups like TRUSTe, the Association for Competitive Technology, the Application Developers Alliance, the advertising industry through its AdChoices program and others already help to provide best practices, independent analyses of privacy policies and recommendations for enhancements. We will learn more about some of these groups' work in the field today.</p><p/><p>As Congress begins to look into these issues, we need to realize that the technologies that we are discussing did not even exist a few years ago, and some have only come to the forefront in the past few months. And with any new technology, it is important that as we think about how best to protect the interest of consumers and the Internet user community, we continue to encourage and not stifle innovation.</p><p/><p>One of the most important things private sector companies can do to self-regulate and innovate when it comes to privacy is to make their notices and privacy policies easy to understand. If the consumer understands that trade-off, he makes when he accepts an app program or service, then the consumer will make an informed decision. The easier it is for consumers to understand all privacy notices and policies, the easier it is for companies to compete on the basis of their privacy policies and the easier it is for consumers to vote with their wallets.</p><p/><p>I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses on the efforts that they have taken to help build in privacy protections as they develop their products to safeguard consumer information about what more can be done to increase transparency and ensure that, as American companies seek to operate abroad in markets like Europe and Asia, innovation is not impeded by undue regulatory burdens or barriers to market access.</p><p/><p>And with that, it's my pleasure to recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt.</p><p/><p>WATT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you holding this hearing.</p><p/><p>I believe that privacy is one of the most fundamental values of the American tradition. Yet today, even a majority of the justices of the Supreme Court (inaudible) that, as a society, we are faced with novel challenges in determining the, quote, \"new normal,\" close quote, for privacy expectations in the digital age.</p><p/><p>There's little doubt that the digital environment has created opportunities that society -- for society that often come at little or no financial cost to the user. But I believe it is inappropriate to classify these opportunities and services as free.</p><p/><p>Information is currency, and users are, without exception, required to surrender incredible amounts of personal information in exchange for the services they enjoy.</p><p/><p>While Internet users have some responsibility to self-censor and restrict the intimate information they share on various platforms. The reality is that many online users have a false sense of privacy because they don't understand the lengthy and complex privacy policies they are compelled to agree to in order to use the service.</p><p/><p>As a result online users often share lots of personal information unknowingly and to unintended audiences. Their personal information has been marshaled, analyzed, and monetized in ways consumers have come to resent.</p><p/><p>A March 2012 study by the Pew Research Center found that two- thirds of Internet users have negative views about search engines collecting information about them to produce personalized search results. Two-thirds of Internet users also report that they, quote, \"are not OK with targeted advertising because they do not like having their own line behavior tracked and analyzed.\"</p><p/><p>I am further concerned that this type of consumer profiling may limit rather than enhance the experience and the horizons of distinct groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, and other factors that we are probably not even aware of yet. If users are constantly fed products and facts in the areas in which they or someone like them have already expressed an interest, their intellectual curiosity and development may be stunted.</p><p/><p>Earlier this year, both the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission completed reports following stakeholder participation to address mounting concern about consumer privacy.</p><p/><p>The White House green paper enumerated seven broad principles that it urges be enacted into law as flexible baseline standards governing consumer privacy. The green paper recommends that industry leaders develop specific codes of conduct to implement the consumer privacy principles.</p><p/><p>The FTC's report takes the additional step of identifying best practices that could and, I believe, should serve as a guide for industry in developing the codes of conduct. The administration has determined that the first round of stakeholder meetings will center on mobile applications, which raise serious questions about the security of data concerning children and geolocation information concerning all users. Parents must be able to feel secured that the apps they download to educate or entertain their children aren't secretly collecting or sharing private data or location information from the host device.</p><p/><p>Although some industry actors have been giving lip service to, and others have been really working to establish privacy standards and to provide users with better understanding of the ways in which the information is used, it seems clear to me that consumers remain in a vulnerable position in which they are required to place an enormous amount of blind trust in online companies and app developers.</p><p/><p>Just last year -- just last week, the FTC announced an $800,000 settlement with Spokeo, a data broker that compiles vast amounts of information on consumers from both online and offline sources.</p><p/><p>In the first FTC case to address the sale of data from the Internet and social media sites in the employment context, the FTC charged that Spokeo violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by marketing consumer profiles to recruiters and human resource professionals without regard to the accuracy of information and without advising the users how their information would be used. The FTC was empowered to act because of the protections contained in the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</p><p/><p>The FTC settlement was announced just as President Obama signed an executive order to lift the morass of federal policies and practices that impede broadband deployment on federal lands. The executive order will not only lower the cost of broadband Internet access, it will also speed the delivery of connectivity to communities, businesses, and schools.</p><p/><p>President Obama said in a statement, quote, \"By connecting every corner of our country to the digital age, we can help our businesses become more competitive and our students become more informed and our citizens become more engaged,\" close quote.</p><p/><p>With greater access comes the responsibility to ensure that our citizens enjoy an online experience that is safe, reliable, and respectful of personal information. So I support the direction the administration is taking us and continue to believe that Congress should enact baseline progressive legislation that will provide certainty to both consumers and companies, and promote a healthy online economy.</p><p/><p>Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote years ago that, quote, \"Privacy is not a discrete commodity, possessed absolutely or not at all,\" close quote. The devil is always in the details, but I hope that the witnesses will be able to address some of the best practices recommended by the FTC.</p><p/><p>Finally, I am also concerned that without a baseline set of principles with the force of law, privacy policies may be used by larger players in an anticompetitive manner to drive smaller players and startups from the market to the detriment of online consumers.</p><p/><p>I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and how -- about how we can embrace new technologies without discarding or abandoning the right to privacy. And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: The chair thanks the gentleman and is pleased to recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Smith.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p/><p>America's economic success has been built on innovation. Ten years ago, there was no such thing as Facebook or Twitter. Just five years ago, there was no such thing as an iPhone or an app store. Today, mobile apps number in the hundreds of thousands and are largely developed by individual innovators and small businesses.</p><p/><p>As new technologies have emerged like mobile apps, social media, online advertising, and data analytics, the cost for new business entry have come down, but as new websites and apps are developed, companies must work to ensure that they maintain the trust of their customers. Trust is the essential element for consumers to adopt new apps or technologies.</p><p/><p>When we hear about privacy breaches like what happened when Google collected large amounts of private data over Wi-Fi networks, we have to be concerned. With every overcollection of privacy data, the first excuse is that the engineers or programmers went beyond what they were told to do. That excuse may fly once, but ultimately it's neither the engineer's fault nor the programmer's fault, it's the company's.</p><p/><p>In the Internet economy, online services are generally provided to consumers at little or no cost. And behind these online services are hundreds or thousands of employees and millions of dollars in hardware and equipment.</p><p/><p>The Internet economy runs on data. There is an implicit bargain between an Internet service and a consumer that includes an exchange of information or data instead of cash. When a consumer receives a free email account or a cloud storage space or uses a search engine, social media website or app, there is a collection of data that allows a company to construct their service and provide targeted advertising or related data analytic services to the consumer.</p><p/><p>As Internet companies have developed new technologies, their privacy policies have had to evolve. Many companies now institute privacy by design where privacy protections are built directly into their software and hardware products from the beginning. Incorporation of the best practices for privacy is essential as new products are developed online.</p><p/><p>For example, I have read that Google and Apple are building even more detailed maps that rival defense satellite imagery. Though this ensures that we will never get lost if we drive or walk through a new city, we also need to ensure that when images are taken in residential areas on people's backyards that their privacy is protected. This is another place where privacy concern should not have to be raised by Congress or the media. They should be addressed before the products are even announced.</p><p/><p>The growth in smartphone use and mobile apps has created an entirely new business sector from Instagram to new mobile apps for established online websites and companies. This new business sector is composed mostly of small businesses and individual programmers.</p><p/><p>As we will here from our witnesses today, many of these small businesses are just a couple of software programmers, not two programmers and a lawyer. And so they often need assistance from more established players as they work to incorporate privacy protections into their software.</p><p/><p>The mobile and Internet playing field is broad, and specific technological protections may be unique to particular technologies. But as companies incorporate privacy protections into their services, it is important for them to provide privacy policies that are understandable and reasonable. This way, it's clear to the consumer what the bargain is that they enter into when they use a website or mobile app.</p><p/><p>I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses today, and I hope their testimony allows the subcommittee to learn how the technology industry works to incorporate balanced privacy protections that will inform and protect consumers.</p><p/><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p/><p>I'm now pleased to recognize the gentleman from Michigan, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers.</p><p/><p>CONYERS: Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Watt.</p><p/><p>This is a very important hearing. And there are new services being offered online and through smartphones and other devices that largely depend on the continued gathering and use of personal information, which is ultimately turned into a product for sale.</p><p/><p>And this hearing is -- is going to devolve, I think, into an issue of whether we get the self-regulation very advanced, we'll all be good and trust this committee or whether we're going to go along and develop the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights. And -- and that's where we're going to end up because there is an explosion of the collection, dissemination of personal information. And -- and therefore, these organizations have an incentive to collect as much data as possible about Internet users.</p><p/><p>And what I think should come out of this hearing is the notion that consumers deserve to know how their data and privacy are being impacted by mobile and online platforms. Today, we don't know that. And that's why this hearing by this subcommittee is extremely important.</p><p/><p>The size and power of online companies allow them to obtain and aggregate many types of personal information. Otherwise, why would Facebook be valued at a worth of $100 billion while the answer, in large part, is because of the treasured throw of personal information that they collect much of which like others -- other companies we don't know much about.</p><p/><p>Now we -- we've been dealing with the size and power of online companies that allows them to obtain and aggregate all this personal information about users. Google recently has had to change its privacy policies and there is concern about its ability to obtain information through an individual's use of various products the company offers. There's so many different ways to get this information out there that it's -- that is when -- when they get it together, they have a far more information that is generally recognized.</p><p/><p>And so I, for one, am interested in learning how we can increase the authority and the power of the Federal Trade Commission to take action against privacy violations. The FTC, in my view, needs direct enforcement authority so that it may take action against those who violate consumer privacy even if a company doesn't violate its own published private policy.</p><p/><p>And while companies should develop online guidelines, we must remember that enforcement is critical to consumer protection. The FTC has the responsibility to ensure that competitors are not allowed to play by different rules.</p><p/><p>And so, Mr. Chairman, thank you for allowing me to add my comment before the witnesses begin.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: I thank the gentleman for his comments. Without objection, other members' opening statements will be made a part of the record.</p><p/><p>We have a very distinguished panel of witnesses today. Each of the witnesses' written statements will be entered into the record in its entirety. And I ask that each witness summarize his testimony in five minutes or less.</p><p/><p>To help you stay within that time, there is a timing light on your table. When the light switches from green to yellow, you have one minute to conclude your testimony. And when the light turn to red, well, that's it, it signals the witness' time has expired.</p><p/><p>Before I introduce our witnesses, I'd like to understand and be sworn as is the custom of this committee. Do you and each of you swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?</p><p/><p>Thank you very much, and please be seated.</p><p/><p>Our first witness is from the district of the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Lofgren. And so it's my pleasure to yield to her for the purposes of introducing, Mr. Shipman.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: Well, I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your courtesy in allowing me to introduce the associate general counsel of eBay that is, in fact, located in the 16th Congressional District.</p><p/><p>Scott Shipman has been with eBay from the beginning. In fact, he started at eBay in -- when he was a law student, and the one lawyer there was absolutely overwhelmed, and so he was there are the beginning to deal with the privacy policies of eBay. And he is here to tell us about those successful policies.</p><p/><p>He has -- as he said at our collective law school, he had done the right things without even knowing it back as a law student. He now has first-hand experience with the privacy compliance and risk assessments at eBay, the cross-border data transfers including the E.U., the personal information transfers to corporate mergers and acquisitions and all the other privacy-related issues that this major corporation faces.</p><p/><p>He teaches International Data Protection at Santa Clara University School of Law as a lecturer. And he serves, along with me, on the High Tech Law Advisory Board at our mutual alma mater, Santa Clara Law School. He coordinates the Legal High Technology Internship Program at eBay in connection with Santa Clara Law School, and he is a board member of the Consumer Privacy Law Forum.</p><p/><p>He is a member of the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a member of the Chief Privacy Officers Council on Conference Board, as well as, of course, being admitted to the California State Bar.</p><p/><p>I'm so glad he is here to share his expertise with us, and it's good to welcome you here, Scott, from the valley into D.C.</p><p/><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to introduce Scott.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Well, thank you, Ms. Lofgren. And I've had the pleasure of speaking at the State of the Net West Conference, which has been hosted at Santa Clara University School of Law on a number of occasions.</p><p/><p>So, Mr. Shipman, welcome.</p><p/><p>Our second witness is Mr. Morgan Reed, executive director of the Association for Competitive Technology. Mr. Reed specializes in technology issues and has been working closely with mobile app developers and companies on privacy issues for years.</p><p/><p>Mr. Reed previously worked for a Taiwan-based trading company, handling North American sales operations. He received his B.A. in political science from Arizona State University and did graduate research in Chinese at the University of Utah and the Shi Ta University in Taiwan. I hope I have that pronounced correctly.</p><p/><p>Our third witness, Mr. Chris Babel, is the CEO of TRUSTe, a leading company and authority on Internet trust and privacy. Previously, Mr. Babel served as senior vice-president and general manager of VeriSign's worldwide authentication services business, where he was responsible for strategy, sales, marketing product, and support. He also manage VeriSign's SSL and manage Security Services business.</p><p/><p>Earlier in his career, he worked at Morgan Stanley in their M&amp;A and corporate finance group. Mr. Babel received his B.A. in mathematical methods in the social sciences and economics from Northwestern University.</p><p/><p>And our fourth witness is Mr. James Grimmelman, professor of law at New York Law School. Professor Grimmelmann studies technology issues relating to I.P., virtual worlds, search engines, online privacy and other topics.</p><p/><p>Prior to law school, he worked as a programmer for Microsoft. He received his J.D. from Yale Law School and his A.B. in Computer Science from Harvard College.</p><p/><p>Welcome to you all, and we'll begin with Mr. Shipman.</p><p/><p>Turn on that microphone and pull it close.</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: Excuse me. Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Watt, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify about eBay Inc.and what we are doing to enable commerce and engender trust through the use of innovative consumer privacy protections.</p><p/><p>My name is Scott Shipman and I am the associate general counsel and global privacy leader for eBay Inc.</p><p/><p>eBay empowers and connects millions of buyers and sellers across the globe through eBay marketplaces, PayPal, GSI, and other -- and other mobile technology-based businesses. Therefore, many people associate eBay and PayPal with enabling ecommerce.</p><p/><p>However, it is important to note that eBay is not just about ecommerce, we are about commerce. The traditional boundaries of offline and online retail are blurring. We recognize that retailers and sellers of all sizes need a partner who will help them succeed in this rapidly changing consumer-driven environment. We want them to succeed, and we are that partner.</p><p/><p>Over the years we have learned one of the keys to success is engendering consumer trust and confidence. A critical component of that trust is privacy. It's hard to build consumer trust when you are not respectful of their personal information.</p><p/><p>To foster that trust, we've had to meet customer privacy expectations with every product we offer.</p><p/><p>I would like to take the next few minutes to highlight some of the successful privacy-related programs and products that have led to eBay being rated one of the most trusted companies for consumer privacy. Since eBay's inception, our core privacy commitment is eBay will not sell the personal information of our customers to third parties for marketing purposes. However, we also recognized consumers need more meaningful choices on how their data was used for behavioral- targeted advertising. Therefore, eBay developed and implemented a program called AdChoice.</p><p/><p>The AdChoice program works as follows -- third party advertisements on and off eBay have an AdChoice link. When eBay users click on the link, they see a pop-up window that gives them the ability to specify their advertising preferences. eBay users can also opt-out of receiving third party behaviorally-targeted ads, and read our privacy policy through that link. eBay's AdChoice program offers a server-based mechanism, not their traditional cookie-based mechanism. This means choices and preferences are permanently stored and not erased when a user clears their cookies.</p><p/><p>PayPal and its shop without sharing design is another perfect example of innovative technology that encourages consumer privacy and consumer control. The beauty of PayPal is it allows consumers to pay for a good or service without ever having to expose their credit card or bank account information to merchants. Not only does this privacy- enhancing technology allow consumers to fully enjoy the convenience of online and mobile commerce, but it also allows merchants to receive payments without the cost and potential liability associated with processing and securing financial information. It's a win-win for both consumers and merchants.</p><p/><p>Looking now at the exciting mobile space, mobile applications and technology continue to grow in popularity and importance. Through the launch of several new and exciting mobile applications eBay has experienced rapid growth in the mobile arena.</p><p/><p>However, being a leader in mobile and geolocation technology is more than just offering cool new services. It is also about balancing the needs and wants of the consumer against the creep factor that is sometimes associated with the collection and use of geolocation and mobile data.</p><p/><p>eBay is building mobile applications that offer the same transparency, choice, and level of privacy protection as our traditional Internet services. eBay has made it a policy that all consumers must opt-in to turn on geo-location for all eBay Inc.mobile applications. And we give consumers the ability to decide what communications and notifications they want to receive and how.</p><p/><p>A perfect example of an eBay mobile application that encapsulates the privacy by design philosophy is WHERE. WHERE provides personalized, hyper-local recommendations, offers, and deals to millions of mobile consumers. WHERE does not associate personally identifiable information with location data without explicit consent. Finally, WHERE does not collect, maintain, or track consumer's location history.</p><p/><p>I've talked a lot about technology, but my last example focuses on best practices and compliance. In addition to eBay's privacy principles and the practices described in our privacy policies, eBay has established a set of corporate rules approved by the Luxembourg National Data Commission. These corporate rules are a commitment to eBay to protect our users' personal information regardless of where the date resides. Our corporate rules do not just protect the personally identifiable information of our European users, but of all eBay Inc.customers and employees globally. eBay was actually the first ecommerce company to receive this approval and the first company to receive approval for employee and customer rules.</p><p/><p>To conclude, we recognize that privacy is a key component of our customers' experience and the trust they place with us. As technology changes, as the world changes, expectations will continue to change. eBay's role is not to guarantee absolute privacy in a vacuum, but to build a relationship based on trust. It is our hope that in the years to come, the trust within that relationship will only grow stronger, and our customers will know and trust that we'll get it done right.</p><p/><p>I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to testify before the committee today, and I look forward to your questions.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Thank you, Mr. Shipman.</p><p/><p>Mr. Reed, welcome.</p><p/><p>REED: Thank you.</p><p/><p>Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Watt, members of the committee, my name is Morgan Reed, and I want to thank you for having today's hearing on new technologies and innovations in the mobile and online space, and the implications for public policy.</p><p/><p>My organization, the Association for Competitive Technology is an international trade association representing more than 5,000 app developers. We make the cool apps that run on your smartphone and your iPads, and hopefully the new Microsoft tablet and the next device after that.</p><p/><p>I am a licensed developer too, having worked on network protocols and debugging games so I have actually dug into the nitty-gritty of how you build software programs. Here's the great news.</p><p/><p>Our industry is showing amazing growth. We have hit more than $20 billion today on an expected path to $100 billion by 2015.</p><p/><p>Apps are expanding into new markets, including enterprise and mobile health which will help make Americans more efficient at work and healthier at home. And while Americans own more than $350 million mobile devices, developers are seeing real potential in foreign markets.</p><p/><p>China's largest telecommunications has more than 800 million subscribers; the number two, 200 million; the number three, 100 million. With adequate intellectual property protection, those subscribers could become customers for our American developers.</p><p/><p>Now I understand this committee would like to spend some time today talking about consumer data privacy and how we make it work in this new more mobile world.</p><p/><p>What we have learned in working through several multi-stakeholder efforts is that we need to address privacy in a comprehensive way, not one that creates siloed solutions for each technology especially since those silos are disappearing every day.</p><p/><p>The biggest revolution in our industry is happening right now and it's called responsive design. Technology is giving us the tools to make one app that will look good on a mobile device and will also look good on a television. And we'll do so seamlessly.</p><p/><p>Everyone in the technology industry has to take part and be responsible for improving the state of privacy security and transparency across all of these industries and devices. Our app developers are no different, and we're committed to working this out with government, industry, civil society, and most importantly, our customers.</p><p/><p>During the past year, ACT has reached out to our membership and other developer organizations throughout America to discuss the importance of data privacy. We've gone coast to coast and have reached hundreds of thousands of developers. Our message has been simple -- know what data you're collecting, know who you are sharing that data with, and be transparent with your customers.</p><p/><p>We have also been participating in multi-stakeholder efforts, including the California AG's work on mobile platforms and the White House NTIA multi-stakeholder effort.</p><p/><p>But throughout all these talk about stakeholders. I realize that this can easily be seen to imply large faceless corporations. I wanted you to remember today that the incredible innovation happening is being driven by thousands of small businesses working to build applications that educate, motivate, and enrich people's lives.</p><p/><p>Therefore, I thought it would take a minute to introduce you to some of the stakeholders whose voices we are working to have heard throughout these efforts.</p><p/><p>Chairman Goodlatte, in your district, Vision Studios produced TextGauge. It's an app for parents to prevent teens from texting while driving.</p><p/><p>Congressman Watt, in your district, we've got Monster Physics. It's a great app that makes app -- that makes Physics fun and is available for -- for adults as well as kids.</p><p/><p>Congressman Conyers, in your district, JackApps is building the app for the Detroit International Jazz Festival. It's an -- it's an amazing application.</p><p/><p>Congressman Smith, in your district, m-Patient Solutions (sic) helps patients navigate the health care system by giving them tools to better understand diagnosis and treatment options.</p><p/><p>Congressman Marino, we have Social Meetup app done by MeetMe in your district.</p><p/><p>Congressman Quayle, in your district, we have a brand new entrant, ABN, just won the contract for the 2012 PGA Phoenix Open. And that will have location-based technology to allow you to go on the ground navigation with the spectators.</p><p/><p>Congressman Deutch, in your district, one of our members, Dave Norter (ph), built an app for Big Brothers and Big Sisters that allows bigs to know activities that they should be looking at doing with their littles.</p><p/><p>Congressman Griffin has Order Pad. It allows medical personnel to display in-patient and observation data to help streamline patient care and it's aimed at rural districts.</p><p/><p>Congresswoman Chu, in your district, Awesome app does -- it's for electricians and engineers that helps them do their job more efficiently and importantly more safely.</p><p/><p>Congressman Chaffets, you've got one of the biggest -- biggest dogs in the fight. Infinity Blade II is built in your district -- millions of downloads. And it's built by a very small company right in your district.</p><p/><p>Congresswoman Lofgren, we've got a great app in Pinger. It allows people to send free text messages all across the world without having to necessarily have a specific text plan.</p><p/><p>Congressman Poe has got iTaxable that provides answers to your tax filing questions and an extensive database of information.</p><p/><p>Congressman Jordan, you've got Ranch Rush. It's a game that puts a farm in your pocket, allowing users to harvest fresh produce, gather eggs from ostriches, collect honey from bees and whip up ketchup from tomatoes.</p><p/><p>Congressman Nadler has got one that helps you sign your signature on your iPad instead of having to find a fax machine.</p><p/><p>So I think as we think about today's questions about stakeholders, we need to remember that in every single one of your districts and in every district here in Congress, there's a small business stakeholder whose voices we need to have heard as part of this privacy discussion.</p><p/><p>Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Thank you, Mr. Reed.</p><p/><p>Mr. Babel, welcome.</p><p/><p>BABEL: Thank you.</p><p/><p>Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Watt, and distinguished members of the subcommittee, my name is Chris Babel, and I am the chief executive officer of TRUSTe, a leading provider of privacy technology and certification solutions to online companies.</p><p/><p>Based in San Francisco, TRUSTe offers a suite of privacy solutions to help businesses increase customer trust and engagement across all their websites, mobile applications, online advertising and cloud-based services. Over 5,000 companies such as Apple, AT&amp;T, Disney, eBay, and Yelp rely on TRUSTe to ensure compliance with evolving and complex privacy requirements and to build trust with consumers.</p><p/><p>I would like to highlight three topics in my remarks before the subcommittee today -- first, the consumer privacy perspective; second, new privacy challenges and technologies TRUSTe and others offer to address them; third, why we think that self-regulation has been successful in protecting consumers online.</p><p/><p>First, through consumer research we submitted in the written testimony, we know that consumers are concerned about privacy online and both their P.C. and mobile devices. Take mobile, for example, where 74 percent of consumers believe it is very or extremely important to understand what personal information a mobile application collects.</p><p/><p>Eighty-five percent want to be able to opt-in or opt-out of targeted mobile ads. These concerns are causing the consumer to become more engaged in their privacy decisions and more likely to take control of when and how their data is collected and used.</p><p/><p>Research also highlighted that 59 percent of consumers generally trust that websites are protecting their privacy online, showing that businesses can build trust and alleviate privacy concerns through investments in privacy best practice and privacy technologies.</p><p/><p>Second, there is explosive growth in privacy services offered to consumers. In TRUSTe's first 12 years in existence through 2009, we grew it from offering one to four services focused on website privacy only. In the past 2-1/2 years, we have launched over 10 new services spanning websites, mobile applications, online advertising, and cloud services.</p><p/><p>Taking mobile as an example since all of you carry mobile devices, the challenges are that less than one-third of mobile applications have a privacy policy today. And when they do, they're difficult to read and need to handle sensitive topics like location information.</p><p/><p>TRUSTe offers application providers a free mobile privacy policy generator, as well as paid services to certify that mobile applications have strong privacy as well as notice and choice mechanisms for consumers regarding mobile ad targeting.</p><p/><p>There have also been entirely new industry efforts like the Digital Advertising Alliance that have been formed to provide consumers notice and choice around online targeted advertising. TRUSTe is the largest independent provider of services for the DAA. We have also partnered with the Application Developers Alliance to educate mobile developers on important privacy issues as part of a countrywide educational road show.</p><p/><p>Technology is evolving more rapidly than ever, and solutions for consumer privacy protection are keeping pace.</p><p/><p>Third, self-regulation is a critical component to online privacy and TRUSTe has helped thousands of companies self-regulate their online privacy for 15 years. Self-regulation is valuable and that it helps companies facilitate global best practices, which simplifies the management and cost of these programs while increasing accountability.</p><p/><p>Self-regulation can also evolve with technology changes to meet the ongoing needs of consumers.</p><p/><p>And finally, through safe harbors and due process, self- regulation can provide strong incentives for compliance.</p><p/><p>Looking forward, it's clear the consumers are becoming ever more aware of how their personal data is collected and used online, which is important as technology changes like the decreased cost of bandwidth, computer processing and storage allow for the analysis and use of vast databases of information.</p><p/><p>Self-regulation provides a flexible privacy protection framework that can quickly adapt to these rapidly changing technologies. To date, industry has made great progress in self-regulating their privacy practices. I know there is much work to be done. We are confident that the goal of protecting consumers while continuing to innovate will be achieved.</p><p/><p>Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to your questions.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Thank you, Mr. Babel.</p><p/><p>And Professor Grimmelmann, you get the last words.</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: I would like to thank Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Watt, and all of the members of the subcommittee for inviting me to testify today. My name is James Grimmelmann, and I am a professor at New York Law School. Although I am happy to respond to any of the subcommittee's questions on any of its topics, my testimony today will focus on privacy.</p><p/><p>The central goal for privacy policy online and on mobile devices must be empowered consumer choice. Good privacy technologies and good privacy laws enable people to choose whether, when, and how open they want to be about their lives. I would like to endorse three essential principles for making real consumer choice a reality.</p><p/><p>The first is usability. A choice that consumers do not know about, cannot find, or cannot understand is no choice at all.</p><p/><p>The second is reliability. A consumer who has expressed a choice is entitled to expect that it will be respected.</p><p/><p>And the third is innovation for privacy. Users benefit from good tools to help them manage their privacy.</p><p/><p>A good example of these principles in action is social networks. Their value depends on controlled access. Everything from a private email from a mother with advice to her daughter in college to a confidential discussion group for recovering alcoholics requires sharing with some people, but not with others.</p><p/><p>The proliferation of social networks with different technical models of sharing represents innovation for privacy in action, but that privacy must also be usable and reliable. People have lost jobs, been stalked, and then splashed across the tabloids because privacy settings on social networks were too confusing for them to understand.</p><p/><p>I am particularly concerned about what I have called privacy lurches -- sudden and unexpected shifts in a social network information sharing practices. For example, Google mishandled the launch of its Buzz social network in 2010. Without clear warning, Google exposed the names of users' email contacts to the world. This made Google Buzz, in one reporter's words, a danger zone for reporters, psychiatrists, lawyers, and everyone else for whom confidentiality is essential to their job.</p><p/><p>The Buzz rollout violated the principle of reliability. It changed Gmail's privacy practices in a way that users could not have anticipated and that was capable of causing significant harm to them. A Federal Trade Commission investigation resulted in a settlement designed to prevent similar mistakes from happening again. And I also suggested that privacy lurches may expose companies to legal liability for distributing an unreasonably dangerous product.</p><p/><p>Another example of the principles is online behavioral advertising -- the use of unique identifiers known as cookies to track users and to customize the ads they see. Some users appreciate receiving relevant advertising. Others find the tracking creepy.</p><p/><p>Industry participants recognize there's difference in opinions and offer users a choice of whether to be tracked. One of the best ways to ensure that these choices are usable and reliable is through innovation for privacy -- promoting the developmentive (ph) tools that users can use to manage their tracking preferences and express them clearly to websites and advertisers.</p><p/><p>The best innovation here has come from web browsers, antivirus software, and plug-ins that help users block and delete unwanted cookies. In the current consensus process, to develop a Do Not Track standard is another encouraging step. All of these innovations can succeed only if they are respected by websites and advertisers.</p><p/><p>The Federal Trade Commission has taken important action against companies that circumvent user privacy protecting technologies, and the FTC and Congress should ensure that websites are not permitted the second-guess users' expressed privacy preferences.</p><p/><p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today, and I look forward to your questions.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Thank you, Professor Grimmelmann. We'll now begin the questioning of the witnesses.</p><p/><p>I believe that consumers have the relevant information about if they have the relevant information about privacy policies, they'll make informed decisions about how to allow their information be used, and will choose what services to use in part based on their comfort level with those privacy policies. So I'd like to ask each of you what your organization is doing specifically to make privacy policies more transparent and easier for consumers to understand.</p><p/><p>And we'll start with you, Mr. Shipman.</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: Sure. Thank you.</p><p/><p>The -- the expectations in managing privacy with consumers is a never-ending battle. It's not something that you can simply come out with a particular policy and say, OK, we've written this as clearly as possible, and we can rest on our laurels. So this is something that continues to evolve.</p><p/><p>From the inception of eBay's privacy program, we've actually created, in 1998, a chart. And at the time, it was fairly simple because you could have a chart with three or four classifications or groups of entities that you share information...</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: I'm going to have to get you to get to the point because I've got several questions and several witnesses to answer.</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: The...</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: So tell us what you're doing right now and prospectively.</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: Absolutely. The focus right now is around bringing icons, bringing specific logos or vignettes whether it would be a video or other types of embracing new technology to be able to answer questions that customers have. AdChoices is a perfect example where we have links that are embedded into advertising and other types of things like that.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Excellent.</p><p/><p>Mr. Reed?</p><p/><p>REED: So we have -- we have an interesting situation is that we represent the developers, and so we've been trying to give developers tools.</p><p/><p>We have run a series of privacy boot camps where we spend the entire day focusing on getting a developer from walking in the door, saying, OK, I need this privacy policy so when they walk out the door not only having privacy, but understanding the tools they need to have to have a narrative with their customers.</p><p/><p>And very specifically, one of the ones I'd like to highlight is our work with Moms With Apps where we've created set of icons that have been adopted by some of the privacy policy generators, including PrivacyChoice and we've been in talks with TRUSTe as well, so the developer can select the icons immediately when they build their privacy policy. So when it shows up for the user -- bam -- they can see it. It doesn't collect information. It doesn't link to the web or it does.</p><p/><p>So, one, we have to empower developers. And two, we're working on building tools to inform our customers what those privacy policies mean.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Thank you.</p><p/><p>Mr. Babel?</p><p/><p>BABEL: Sure. So, TRUSTe helps websites, through a privacy policy generator, generate their first privacy policy. Big companies might have attorneys to do that. Small companies start up three people in their garage need help.</p><p/><p>Particularly around mobile applications, we find that it's critical, as I mentioned in the testimony, about a third of mobile application even have a privacy policy today. So we're really trying to help people start by having a privacy policy.</p><p/><p>The second thing we do is once people have privacy policies, we help make certain that they're good, of high quality, clear, transparent, easy to read, easy to understand. And that's where we help a company have a certified privacy policy where we say it meets a good high bar, and that the company is following and actually doing what their privacy policy states.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Thank you.</p><p/><p>Mr. Reed, many Internet services are free and are monetized through targeted adds and data collection. How much would app prices go up or what would it cost to use a search engine or a social media website if companies were restricted from the data that they could collect?</p><p/><p>REED: Well, I think we have to look at two sets of numbers. One, what does it change in the way that we develop apps? And two, when it comes to the actual impact on the industry, if you remove all ads all together, I think you'd see some enormous impacts. If you remove strictly ads that use information and you just do context-based ads, the estimate run about 20 percent -- a loss of about 20 percent of income for those that are ads-supported.</p><p/><p>The reality is that the model right now, we're looking at trying to figure out how to -- how to make sure that we get apps that we get paid directly and -- and supplement through advertising. So this probably would cost us about 20 percent of revenue.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Mr. Babel?</p><p/><p>BABEL: I think one of the key unique factors in mobile versus websites just to point out quickly is that mobile actually has a monetization mechanism where you can go back to the extent that someone were to opt-out of ad targeting and go back and say, I am limiting the features of this mobile and pushing you to a charge version.</p><p/><p>In the website version of the world -- in that ecosystem, you know, 15 years ago, we started giving out free content online and it would be very hard to go back to that paywall.</p><p/><p>As we've read industry research although haven't ended ourselves, we've seen similar numbers to those that Morgan has proposed in terms of the drop-off in advertising, but it's not something that we track and have estimated direct.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Let me ask the three of you what your greatest concerns are about the European Union's recent efforts to impose regulatory regime in Europe.</p><p/><p>Mr. Shipman?</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: I think the -- the challenge within the E.U. is certainly that we're looking for standards that create international operability. And so any change in one particular region for a global company destabilizes that operability. And while we certainly have received approval through the binding corporate rules for operations in Europe and use that as our global standard, changes in that and more restrictions in that certainly make that much more difficult for us.</p><p/><p>REED: We're short on time, so I'm going to echo Chairman Smith when he said the problem we have with it is just the same. We are not two developers in -- in a garage -- we're two developers in a garage, not two developers and a lawyer. The difference between us and Europe will create a lot of difficulties for our developers.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Mr. Babel?</p><p/><p>BABEL: Yes, our clients whether they'd be domestic clients or international clients are challenged by the fact that there are just different requirements by country. And you are a big company and trying to manage your portfolio of websites across users from each different region, it is challenging to implement technologies to address that.</p><p/><p>It's a lot of hard work -- it's a lot of hard work upfront. And to be honest with you, most companies have not met the deadline for the U.K. Cookie Audit Compliance that was May 25th. In fact, most government agencies in the U.K. have not met that deadline as well. So it gives you a sense for the challenges that are involved with this policy implementation (inaudible).</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Mr. Grimmelman?</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: Well, as the others have mentioned, the lack of harmony across many countries is a significant problem, and it leads to situations in which especially the small players have difficulty even finding out all the laws they need to comply with.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Thank you.</p><p/><p>The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt, is recognized.</p><p/><p>WATT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p/><p>The ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Conyers, raised a difficult issue that I want to ask some questions in here relating to legislation versus self-regulation. The administration's blueprint contemplates baseline legislation complemented by self-regulatory model to implement the Consumers Bill of Rights. So let me ask a couple of questions in this area.</p><p/><p>Do we, in fact, need a federal Consumer Bill of Rights or something maybe not called at, but some federal baseline in this area to deal with privacy. And if not, two questions arise. Wouldn't that leave it open in this Internet thing which clearly is across state borders or state by state by state to enact legislation? And wouldn't that leave it open for self-regulation which is OK if people behave, but is not all that enforceable? And if people do not behave, I guess, is -- is the question.</p><p/><p>So, Mr. Shipman, Mr. Reed, Mr. Babel, and Professor, if you can address those couple of questions in there, I'd be appreciative to you.</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: Absolutely and thank you for the question.</p><p/><p>I think the challenges, as you highlight, is with self-regulation it leaves consumers with uncertainty. With -- eBay has long supported a federal omnibus privacy bill. And the -- the key reasons for that are largely to provide the small and -- and -- and large businesses that we do business with to provide that level of certainty.</p><p/><p>WATT: So -- so you think there should be a federal -- federal standard of some kind?</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: Yes, we do.</p><p/><p>WATT: Yeah. OK. Go ahead.</p><p/><p>REED: Yes, we have been active supporters of the NTIA effort. And I do think, as we get through this, we should talk about ways that the government can enforce bad behavior. I definitely think that's something where, from a small -- from a particular small business, it's very important to see the government step in and bring harsh actions against companies that do violate people's privacy because nothing gets the message clearer to our members.</p><p/><p>WATT: Of course, the first step is to have a clear...</p><p/><p>REED: Yeah.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: ...set of rules about what -- what the standards are.</p><p/><p>REED: Exactly. And so...</p><p/><p>WATT: OK.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>REED: ...yes on that, good on enforcement.</p><p/><p>WATT: OK.</p><p/><p>BABEL: I think we've seen, at TRUSTe, self-regulation work and work effectively. And in particular, over the last few years with the beginnings of the DAA effort around AdChoices, you've seen self- regulation accelerate quite rapidly in the last few years to take out -- reach out and touch consumers and give them...</p><p/><p>WATT: So what happens in self-regulation if -- if you -- if you got self-regulation and you don't -- you or your members or your customers or clients don't live up to what they agreed? What are the -- what remedies do I have to enforce that or who enforces those standards?</p><p/><p>BABEL: Sure. So in TRUSTe's case where we certify companies for good privacy, the first thing we do if there is an issue at one of those clients is help them get back into alignment with our guidelines for...</p><p/><p>WATT: Got that, but my -- my data is already out there at that point. So how do -- how do I get a remedy?</p><p/><p>BABEL: The second thing we do is eliminate them from the program and, in fact, last year we eliminated...</p><p/><p>WATT: That still don't give any remedy.</p><p/><p>BABEL: The third remedy that we put in place to the extent that there is egregious behavior is we haven't factored for people to the FTC, and the FTC has taken action.</p><p/><p>WATT: So there's got to be a -- got to be a federal standard.</p><p/><p>BABEL: There has -- yes, we have...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WATT: OK. All right. OK. I'm going to refer to it. We're back there. All right.</p><p/><p>Go ahead, Professor.</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: A federal baseline would first bring important clarity to the area. And in addition, all of the processes of consumer choice and bargaining with websites offer bargains to users and explain the tradeoffs only work if the consumers have an entitlement to their privacy to begin with.</p><p/><p>If we don't have a baseline, then they don't need to respect it. WATT: All right. Has anybody out there in the industry that is advocating for no federal baseline? Are there any voices out there or do you all represent pretty much the standard belief? If so, it seems to me, we can quit vexing about whether we need a baseline and start vexing about what we put in the baseline. Is that right?</p><p/><p>Anybody out there got a different opinion about this, I mean, I guess is the question.</p><p/><p>REED: I guess, the only nuance that I would add is that the good part about what NTIA is doing and it will be a lot of work is that it's being built bottom up as a multi-stakeholder effort where we're going through long intense meetings talking about the meanings of words and the definitions. So it's actually working from the standpoint of what technology is capable of doing and gives us the option to change it as we become capable of doing new things.</p><p/><p>So I think it's important that it not be a government-imposed top-down pressure, but it'd be developed by technologists as a way to handle when we change our stuff.</p><p/><p>WATT: In the meantime, the laws that are already out there, I assume the gaps of the laws that are already out there that provides some -- some kind of protection.</p><p/><p>REED: I would say it's more than some. I think...</p><p/><p>WATT: Yeah.</p><p/><p>REED: ...the Federal Trade Commission has already shown that it has some teeth. We have -- we obviously have regulation on HIPAA. We have regulation on (inaudible). So depending on what kind of data you have, there are more than a fair number of regulation.</p><p/><p>Beyond that, this committee knows we also have antitrust laws to deal with companies that are large players that clearly disregard people's privacy time and time again. So if you can't curb the behavior through FTC, you can always go and look at antitrust as well.</p><p/><p>WATT: Mr. Chairman, my time has expired, but as I told the chairman, I will have to leave to go over and hear Jamie Dimon testify in my other committee. So let me make a unanimous consent request before I leave, Mr. Chairman, to offer into the record the February 2012 White House green paper commercial data privacy and Innovation in the Internet Economy: A Dynamic Policy Framework. Number two, a March 2012 FTC proposal -- whatever -- protected report, protecting consumer privacy in an era of rapid change recommendations for businesses and policymakers. And a March 2012 report Search Engine Use 2012 a project of the Pew Research Center.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Without objection, those will be entered into the record. And I'll turn the chair over to the chairman of the committee.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Mr. Babel, let me address my first question to you after you've already answered my initial question as -- in response to a question by Mr. Watt, but I wanted to follow up on the idea of how enforcement worked when it came to individual online businesses that might violate the best practices. And you responded to Mr. Watt and said, ultimately, if there was a clear violation and there wasn't any response, you'd refer the online businesses to the Federal Trade Commission, I think. Have you ever had occasion to do that?</p><p/><p>BABEL: Yes, we have.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And how many instances?</p><p/><p>BABEL: There's been one instance that is in my knowledge -- one instance in 2008 of a company called Classic Closeouts which...</p><p/><p>SMITH: And what do the FTC do?</p><p/><p>BABEL: They took action. It was settled, I think, late last year with a $2 million plus fine.</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK. And how many online businesses, in your judgment, have violated the best practices that you have endorsed?</p><p/><p>BABEL: So last year, in our written testimony, we provided something called the transparency report, where we walk through a number of customers in, number of certification.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p/><p>BABEL: In each year, I think there's two important data points, one is the number of companies that come to us for certification in an effort to get certified because they don't pass the standards to begin with. And that is about eight to ten percent of all the clients that are approaching us for certification -- never meet the bar.</p><p/><p>The second thing is that, in last year, 11 companies violated kind of what we think are best practices.</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK. And of those 11 you referred went to the FTC?</p><p/><p>BABEL: Not last year. The referral to the FTC was in a prior year.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Right, OK.</p><p/><p>Thank you, Mr. Babel.</p><p/><p>Mr. Shipman, let me address a question to you and perhaps to Professor Grimmelmann as well. And it is this, we've heard, I think, from all witnesses today about the need for online businesses to protect consumer data. My question goes a little bit farther -- should consumers be able to find out what personal data has been gathered about them.</p><p/><p>BABEL: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK.</p><p/><p>BABEL: And, in fact, within our corporate standards that we've had approved through Luxembourg, that is a requirement that we meet.</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK. Do any of the witnesses today feel that consumers should not or do not have a right to know what personal information has been gathered about them?</p><p/><p>OK. The next question is, should consumers be able to opt-out of the process that gathers that personal information about them?</p><p/><p>Mr. Shipman, what do you think?</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: Let me give you a multi-part answer on that one.</p><p/><p>SMITH: OK.</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: There are certain components of collection that are required. eBay certainly has financially-related institutions. We process financial transactions as well as all kinds of ecommerce transactions and commerce.</p><p/><p>The data that is essential for the safety, the security, antifraud in that area, we cannot allow consumers to opt-out. Certainly for marketing purposes and other types of secondary uses, we can allow...</p><p/><p>SMITH: You would allow them to opt-out. OK. Thank you.</p><p/><p>Professor Grimmelmann, do you have an opinion on that?</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: In the context of first party collection where the consumer is dealing with a website...</p><p/><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: ...their shipment expresses a very clear and correct view.</p><p/><p>SMITH: You agree with him? OK.</p><p/><p>That concludes my questions. The gentleman from Michigan, the ranking member of the full committee is recognized for his questions.</p><p/><p>CONYERS: Thank you, Chairman.</p><p/><p>CONYERS: Mr. Reed, we've heard a lot about self-regulation here too much as far as I'm concerned. I don't know what you think this committee -- what some -- some others -- not you -- think that we make rules, we make laws, we have court decisions. And now we come up with let's go for self-regulation.</p><p/><p>We've been hauling -- all of the big tech companies have been in and out of court repeatedly. And so, can you give me a little more confidence about this whole notion of self-regulating?</p><p/><p>REED: Well, I think the -- the first thing we have to look at is does the FTC have enough resources. We start with that. But I think you also have to look at continued behavior. There's carrot and stick, right? Industry self-reg is a carrot. Do this and you won't get the stick. I think that, for small companies, we all usually dependent on platforms and we are incredibly responsive to our customers. Why? Because we're scared of losing them.</p><p/><p>I think one of the things that -- that concerns us very much that's been happening in the privacy space is that some of the violations have been actually done by big companies and one, in particular, you know, the chairman brought up WhySpy. That trickles down into the sentiment of the regular citizenry. So, yes, I think it's critical that the resources are at the FTC and that the DOJ is willing to step up and go after those who don't respond to carrot and don't respond to stick.</p><p/><p>CONYERS: Yeah. But -- but, Mr. Reed, a lot -- a lot of this privacy, we don't even know what's being collected, and -- and we don't have any way of getting at it. I mean, I -- I see a huge problem...</p><p/><p>REED: Well, I think...</p><p/><p>CONYERS: ...still out here, don't you?</p><p/><p>REED: Well, I think the question of what's being collected, I think we can actually figure -- figure out what's being collected. The larger question is, what happens to it after it's collected? What is it combined with? Does that create problems in our people selling it in a way that's -- that's damaging or causes harm to people -- to people's privacy? Does it make it hard for them to get a job? Does it make it hard for them to buy a house? That's really the question.</p><p/><p>It's not what's collected, it's what's done with the collection of that information after, how it's assembled. And those are areas where I think that there can be questions, and -- and we should find good answers.</p><p/><p>CONYERS: Thank you very much.</p><p/><p>Well, we know what's being collected -- everything. Is there anything that they -- I mean, that's -- that's the nature of the problem. I...</p><p/><p>REED: But -- but I think it's worth noting that the Sears Catalog had information on people in the 1900's. They knew what we were buying, and it's really about what's done to harm people afterwards. That's really the kicker because, you know, we all had the Sears Catalog. There's a kid in our house and he would read it.</p><p/><p>Sears knew what you bought. They kept a record of what you bought -- that was a good thing -- to know what they did with that information, prevented you from buying a house or prevented you from getting a job, or prevented you from getting insurance.</p><p/><p>CONYERS: Or hurting your credit.</p><p/><p>REED: Exactly.</p><p/><p>CONYERS: Let me turn to Professor Grimmelmann for a continuation of this discussion. I mean, this is a very nice conversation we're having here with four experts. But I mean, there is a certain element here of let's all trust everybody to do the right thing.</p><p/><p>The FTC is underfunded. Leibowitz -- Jon Leibowitz, the chair, comes before us every year and makes the case that they need more resources. How -- how do you see this discussion of a -- of a giving benefit to the doubt to these huge companies that are collecting what we don't even -- well, from my point of view is everything.</p><p/><p>We go -- we go back to Sears in 1900. Guess what they're doing now if you think that was something.</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: I would like to say that some huge companies can play an important role in building tools that stop other huge companies from gathering lots of data.</p><p/><p>So, for example, Apple puts significant restrictions in the iPhone that limit the data that apps can collect. So the apps can't gather location data without the users' expressed permission. And Microsoft is bumbling in its most recent version of the Internet Explorer will be turning on the Do Not Track header by default to tell websites they should not collect data about users.</p><p/><p>We can find ways to exploit the competitive process in the industry, to have companies recognize privacy as an advantage, and help consumers keep personally from other companies.</p><p/><p>CONYERS: But there are some that are disregarding the tracking instructions of their consumers. You know that.</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: So, the advantage of that is that the company disregard the tracking request has now done something that's explicitly deceiving the consumer and failing to respond to the request rather than just taking advantage of their ignorance, which gives the FTC a surer basis for action.</p><p/><p>CONYERS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Thank you, Mr. Conyers.</p><p/><p>The gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Marino, is recognized for his questions.</p><p/><p>MARINO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p/><p>I'm going to start with Mr. Shipman, and let's back the bus up here a little bit if you would please. And if anyone has anything to add to it, just chime in.</p><p/><p>Let's start back with the scenario. A parent is having a personal conversation with their son or daughter who is off to college, or a corporate -- one corporation is having a confidential exchange of information with another corporation concerning, let's say, a merger.</p><p/><p>Once this information -- once I hit that Send button, let's educate the people of where does that go and how many people or how many entities have access to that even when I hit the Delete and the other side hits the Delete. Do you understand my question?</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: Yeah, sure. Basically, the -- your question just to quickly summarize is when you hit Send on an email, how many different entities could have possibly end up with?</p><p/><p>MARINO: Even after I delete it.</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: Sure, sure. To me, the biggest challenge here -- I mean, there are many challenges. eBay is not an ISP. We actually don't provide email, but I'm knowledgeable enough to be able to provide a few comments.</p><p/><p>One of the toughest components here is access where you have other governmental agencies or law enforcement or other requests where the consumer may have no knowledge of that information being requested. Beyond the technology components it is then deleted within the systems, within service providers, within a custodial relationship.</p><p/><p>MARINO: OK. I understand the law enforcement aspect of it. I've been part of it for 19 years.</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: OK.</p><p/><p>MARINO: So, just give me -- give me your best estimate on how many entities would have that information?</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: Go ahead.</p><p/><p>REED: I think -- I think let's break it in (inaudible). Is your service a cloud-based or you're just going from -- from my company to your company? If you're going company to company, not too many -- not too many entities in between will hold on to it, but he raises a key point, which is part of actual reform of these questions is that law enforcement has stepped in to place -- to place collection points in the process.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>MARINO: OK. Let's exclude law enforcement for a moment.</p><p/><p>REED: If you include law enforcement company to company, not much. If it's company to cloud provider and back, then the cloud provider does have access to that information at a certain level. Most...</p><p/><p>MARINO: OK. Now, so there are several entities even if it's company to company. How long is that individual or that entity have that information? Until they just delete it?</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: Sure. So, once an email or any -- any other piece of data is received, it's within that -- if it's a responsible company, they have a data classification and data retention policies.</p><p/><p>MARINO: OK.</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: So depending on the classification of that data, it may be seven days, it may be seven years.</p><p/><p>MARINO: All right. I'll be jumping to the next one. Who -- who best can answer this? What would prevent an employee from obtaining that information and sharing it?</p><p/><p>REED: It depends on -- it depends on their status in the corporation. Somebody who's got the key to the kingdom, so to speak, then the network nerd in the closet, he's going to have all of it.</p><p/><p>MARINO: So my point is...</p><p/><p>REED: Right.</p><p/><p>MARINO: ...people have access to it and can use nefariously, correct?</p><p/><p>REED: Yes. That's -- yes.</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: There is an important consideration here, which is there are tools that certain companies, certainly eBay want to deploy which do monitor and track access to information within the organization. So not only are employees based on permission have access or don't have access to information, but also if there is anomalous activity, it's detected, reported, and prevented.</p><p/><p>MARINO: Mr. Babel and then Professor, maybe you can give me a quick answer on the -- on this?</p><p/><p>I'm an individual that questions do we want the federal government involved. The fact I think the position that the federal government spends too much time in our lives to begin with. So, give me, Mr. Babel, if you can please, give me your opinion based on the fact that can the industry police itself. I have a little problem with the Fox (ph) setting rules and regulations for the (inaudible). But give me a scenario, if you would contrast them, policing itself and meeting federal regulations.</p><p/><p>So if you both can answer that please, Mr. Babel?</p><p/><p>BABEL: Sure. So I think that it's, you know, as TRUSTe has self-regulatory programs, the key asset that we have is our band of consumers. So if we aren't living up to the standard of making certain that people who no longer follow the standard are out, like for us, it's the whole company we're betting.</p><p/><p>MARINO: OK.</p><p/><p>BABEL: Our credibility is the key, meaning the program and its credibility is the key.</p><p/><p>I think when it comes to legislation, one of the things that I am concerned about is just, you know, do we -- what are the unintended consequences of legislation. If you look at something like CAN-SPAM, even now there's a law that was well written, well adopted. But at the end of the day, 90 percent of spam or -- of email is still spam. It's not the law that eliminated the spam in your mailbox...</p><p/><p>MARINO: OK. I'm running out of time here.</p><p/><p>BABEL: ...technology.</p><p/><p>MARINO: Professor?</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: I think that the companies who are most going to want federal intervention for are the ones who are TRUSTe members who are engaged in shady gray area marketing that can seal their track, click fraud, then all kinds of shady deals that are kind of consumers (inaudible).</p><p/><p>MARINO: OK. Thank you. I yield back. Thank you.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: I thank the gentleman.</p><p/><p>The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Deutch, is recognized for five minutes.</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p/><p>Mr. Babel, you said that 59 percent of people believe that their information is protected. You touted that number. Four in ten people are concerned that their information is not protected, I presume is the balance of that analyze -- the balance of that polling.</p><p/><p>I just want to talk about the self-regulation piece of this, which a number of have talked about. You have a program -- a privacy program, which if I understand what you're saying correctly, if a company adopts it then they receive your certification. Is that right?</p><p/><p>BABEL: Correct.</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: And -- and does that privacy -- that -- has certification been given to the largest companies? And what Mr. Shipman described sounds like a really terrific privacy policy, which I'll ask about in a minute. But today, have your certification in their privacy policy?</p><p/><p>BABEL: They're our client, yes.</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: And -- and -- and do all of the -- I mean, do the biggest -- just thinking about those companies with market dominance and does -- does Google have a certification, does Facebook have a certification from you for their privacy policies?</p><p/><p>BABEL: One of the things we look at at the top 100 websites listed by a company called Alexa that's based on consumer traffic, and we have about 50 percent of those top 100 clients. So we have good penetration, but certainly not all. DEUTCH: Right. So -- so just again thinking about the ones that we use most often, does Google has a certification and does Facebook has its -- for their privacy policy?</p><p/><p>BABEL: Sure. Google is not a certified client of TRUSTe and neither is Facebook. We do work with them in some different areas, but they are not certified clients of our program.</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: And -- and when you -- Mr. Reed, when you talked about the information to be collected, you should -- so we should know what data is being collected, who we're showing it with and being transparent with customers.</p><p/><p>Is that -- Mr. Babel, is that a part of your certification? Do you look at each of those?</p><p/><p>BABEL: Yeah. If we were to think of the highest three levels...</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: Yeah.</p><p/><p>BABEL: ...of the certification, the business needs to first be transparent, meaning tell people what data they're collecting. You know, if they're sharing it, how long they're holding on to it. They need to give choice. Would you like to not have that data be collected and they need to be accountable to that choice. So, yes, the tenets of what Morgan...</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: And I'm sorry, I don't -- unfortunately, I just -- I don't know -- I'm learning a lot today, but I don't know well enough how the relationship between TRUSTe and some of the other companies. What is it -- I mean, have you -- when you say you work with some of these other companies, but they don't have the certification, do you suggest to them what's missing? Or when it comes to those three items that we just discussed, when you look at company with real market dominance like -- like Google, for example, or like Facebook, is there one of those three that they might be missing? Are there certain things that -- that we ought to be considering?</p><p/><p>BABEL: So, I think of it as it's a totally different effort we're working on with them. Here -- I'll give you the example. With Google, they have a business to business app marketplace where a business owner using Gmail can download an application. We certify those applications, but it's in a partnership with Google so it's not related to kind of the three core tenets.</p><p/><p>We don't work with them in our core certification business. It's kind of a separate adjacent thing.</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: So, I guess, what I'm really getting at is when you talk about self-regulation and the success of self-regulation, in -- for a company -- any company that has real market dominance, is that -- is that sufficient to rely on to do the 40 percent of consumers who are concerned their information is not kept private? Should they -- should they be satisfied with the -- the privacy policies established in a self-regulatory environment? If -- if not, every company regulates themselves the same way. Mr. Reed, you look like you want to jump in.</p><p/><p>REED: Well, it you have to look at -- at behavior. You know, eBay is sitting here. They have a pretty good track record so far on -- on privacy. A lot of our developers use their PayPal system to enable -- enable app purchases. It's worked out pretty well. We haven't had those.</p><p/><p>So I think your question about the size of the company is not the first -- the first test. The first test is, what are they doing? And if a company with dominance has the power to take it and kind of thumb their noses at consumers, well, then yes. I think that's the kind of time where you have to start taking a look and -- and you start to have asking harder questions. So it's not the size as much as it is the behavior that really triggers it.</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: Well, Mr. Reed, are there -- you are more familiar with the industry than I am. Are there -- are there any companies that you think are thumbing their nose with these privacy issues?</p><p/><p>REED: Well, I think -- I mean, I think we've -- we've heard the names several times, everybody has been talking about it. I think Google has -- Google's privacy violations to date have certainly raised a lot of concern. I think it's ironic, you know, it got so bad that the Jon Stewart Show -- the Daily Show actually made fun of it on Wi-Fi. So...</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: Well, Mr. Reed...</p><p/><p>REED: ...that harms all of us.</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: Mr. Reed, I'm almost out of time. Of the -- the three things that -- that you point out -- know the data being collected, who is being shared with and being transparent with customers, which of those three do you think is -- is most often being ignored by any company that might be somebody who knows these privacy issues?</p><p/><p>REED: I think in the case -- in the case of -- of -- of Google, I think the problem is that they have them in transparency with what they were doing. I think I was very clear on WhySpy. It was clear on the Buzz settlement. They haven't been transparent. And I think that's an area that they need to improve or -- or regulators need to step in.</p><p/><p>DEUTCH: Right. Thank you.</p><p/><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: I thank the gentleman.</p><p/><p>The gentleman from Utah, Mr. Chaffetz, is recognized for five minutes.</p><p/><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for being here. I appreciate it. I -- I wanted to highlight the idea that the Internet -- the tech sector is actually something in our company that's working. You're looking at growth -- growth and jobs, and expansion of our economy, this is one sector that is thriving.</p><p/><p>One -- one of my concerns is while we have these deep-seated needs to make sure that privacy is protected, that we're protecting consumers, I think, Mr. Chairman, we also need to be ultra careful in making sure that we don't convolute the process to a point where young entrepreneurs, new startups aren't able to start because there is such a mass of regulation and uncertainty.</p><p/><p>I do question the notion that the FTC is the right organization. I wonder -- we talk a lot about the teeth of the FTC, but we can probably count on one hand where they've actually taken -- taken action. And so I think that begs the question of, should this be done in part by statute so that we can use Article III court as opposed to the FTC, which would be much more readily available to a -- to a consumer or an individual?</p><p/><p>It's just something, Mr. Chairman, that I think we need to continue to explore because I'm not convinced that the FTC is the end all, be all. I'm also concerned that we have multiple jurisdictions here. The Consumer Financial Protection Board, for instance, you're going to end up much like in the financial sector or you have conflicting rules and regulations.</p><p/><p>I think it's also important that the Congress stand up for itself and not allow an administration -- I don't care which party it's involved with -- allow just simple rulemaking to push through the process and not allow the back and forth in the discussion that would happen in Congress. So I think we've been failing on that front in general.</p><p/><p>There are couple of other areas that I'd like you to address and our time is so short here but, Mr. Chairman, I think one of the things we have to further explore if we're going to truly look at privacy is how do we deal with minors -- minors. You know, my 11-year-old arguably knows more about using the apps in the Internet than -- than most people three, four, five times her age.</p><p/><p>We're going to also have to deal with the national versus the international aspect in scope, which was obviously -- or the need in the genesis of SOPA. That issue has not gone away. We are still losing billions of dollars overseas, and we're going to have to deal with that.</p><p/><p>The other area that I'm -- I'm really trying to focus on and I'd like you to address, I didn't come to just give a big speech. I'd like you to actually address is I think Americans have a reasonable expectation of privacy, but how do we define that.</p><p/><p>One of the things that I think we have to look at is airspace. It's reasonable that somebody walk down your front yard, they could look at your front yard and see your mailbox, and your shrubs, and what-not. As we expand out and start to use drones and satellites and other types of who knows what kind of technology, what is the reasonable expectations to privacy, say, in your backyard or on your private property? And along with that is geolocation.</p><p/><p>I've sponsored a bill on this. I think it's going to continue to go on. Would anybody care to address what is the proper balance of airspace? You know, law enforcement use helicopters, right? We've allowed that for a long time. We think that's a good thing. But fuel is expensive, it's hard to get a helicopter. They can -- law enforcement can only keep it up for so long.</p><p/><p>But if you have a -- a drone that's up 24/7 or somebody that's going to -- where is that balance, where is that line? Anybody care to take a stab at that one?</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: I can -- I can say a little bit about that. One of the encouraging things about the Supreme Court's decision in the United States versus Jones is that the court endorsed two different kinds of rationales to protecting privacy. One of them based in the majority is rooted in historic law of trespass. And there, that might signal a reinvigoration of the idea that the airspace, closely above your home, is actually yours and not to be invaded.</p><p/><p>We have long accepted that commercial airlines can fly far overhead, but this might signal an attitude we should protect your sovereignty over your own space close to the ground.</p><p/><p>And the second coming from the concurrences is the so-called mosaic theory that continuous observation over a long period of time can ultimately build such a complete portrait that it does invade mosaic expectation of privacy.</p><p/><p>CHAFFETZ: And -- and I guess, that's one of the challenges that Jones generally face because he's right in the -- in the Jones case which is, in large part, what our legislation is -- is modeled after is this idea that there's a toggling between an individual's movements on private property and out in the public space.</p><p/><p>Look, technology can be great. It can be so useful and make people's lives better. But how do we actually craft something without ruining the industry. That is the fundamental question. I don't know if the other three care to jump in here.</p><p/><p>REED: We have a -- we have a phrase in the office. We say nobody wants technology at the speed of government. And -- and that is the problem that -- that this -- the question that you point out raises.</p><p/><p>You know, I speak as mean not as act. I would be totally creeped out having a drone fly above my house all the time 24/7, watching my backyard. That's me. I'm not speaking on behalf of our members.</p><p/><p>But by the same token, a plane flying overhead isn't the problem. So we have to look at the behavior question really. The plane flying overhead has an intent -- it's going from point A to point B. It doesn't intend to be looking in my backyard.</p><p/><p>The drone positioned over my house, watching everything that happens, and whether or not I mowed the lawn on Sunday, has the intent of watching what I'm doing. So I think that's part of what -- part of how we need to look at what technology empowers us, what is the intent of the person who's putting that technology in place? What do they want out of it?</p><p/><p>And that helps -- that helps us guide the question of what is appropriate airspace in certain aspects? That allows for wireless transmission to happen without -- without -- without impeding with a lot of government regulation.</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: Yeah. I'd like to just add, I think, you know, the work that -- that eBay and a number of other organizations have done in really framing what should federal omnibus privacy law look like, really focuses -- and Mr. Reed used the word intent -- its use -- its use-based obligations.</p><p/><p>With data, there is an intended use and there's an obligation that needs to come with that intended use. And you can look at each type of use -- is it fulfillment? Is it providing a service? Is it flying from point A to point B? And with that, data collection and use comes obligation.</p><p/><p>CHAFFETZ: Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, my time has well past gone. I -- I would appreciate the industry continuing to look at this because I think it's an incomplete answer. There are -- it is -- it is not sufficient enough to say that is the -- the intent because what does a celebrity, for instance, in Southern California do? You can see TMZ putting drones up flying to follow celebrities in their 10-mile zone. That's what TMZ stands for, right? 24/7.</p><p/><p>So, intent is -- is not sufficient enough. I think the industry has also got to catch up in how to help us to find that because Congress says the ability to ruin people's lives and rather not see that happen. I yield back.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: I thank the gentleman.</p><p/><p>The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Lofgren, is recognized for five minutes.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And as Mr. Chaffetz has indicated, I -- I have some reluctance to see Congress weighed in on these issues in a heavy regulatory manner because we don't work at Internet speed, we work at a different speed. And, you know, that's a good thing. I mean, we can't make mistakes quickly, but certainly the technology will move much faster than we can. And so I have been interested in how industry might establish standards that prevent a heavy regulatory load.</p><p/><p>And along those lines, I'm wondering how this process is working relative to the recent decision on Internet Explorer to do -- make the default Do Not Track. I understand that they're -- and certainly, Microsoft has the -- has the right to do that. Has that had an impact on the industry-wide effort to reach consensus on Do Not Track or not?</p><p/><p>Professor, could you answer that question?</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: So, the decision has been discussed within the working group that is building the standard. Some of the participants in that group of -- including representatives from Google, Yahoo, and Adobe have taken the position that Internet Explorer should be defined to be noncompliant such that websites could say, I think you're using Internet Explorer, therefore I'm not going to honor your Do Not Track request. And I think this is simply an attempt to sabotage the standard. It won't work if websites can second-guess the user statement, \"I don't want to be tracked.\"</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: Well, the -- the question, I guess, is for me, what's the default? What kind of transparency is available to the user? And also, what kind of accountability is -- is there if the users' choice is, in fact, not honored by the person representing the choice?</p><p/><p>And -- and, I guess, the question is, who owns this data? Maybe that's something that -- that the -- does need to be established in law, that the individual has an opportunity to enforce their own choices. Do you think that is an approach that would be helpful for Congress to take?</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: The default right now is that websites collect but offer users an opportunity to opt-out. I think users should have the opportunity to choose tools to protect their privacy by saying do not collect. And if websites disagree with that choice, they can communicate with the user and say, here are the benefits...</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: Right.</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: ...we could offer you if you turn tracking on.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: That's -- for example, I -- I use Firefox as -- I don't know why, but I've always used it, and I've got Do Not Track turned on in my Firefox because that's the choice I want to make. But it means that there's something I can't do on Firefox, which is a decision I have made. Isn't it just -- wouldn't it solve our problem in the Internet world if we were just transparent to users and gave them enforceable choices?</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: Yes.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: Now, let me ask about the, you know, Mr. Chaffetz -- great minds think alike. I was also thinking about the drone issue. And I think I'm -- I'm told that in August, the FAA is actually going to make do some rulemaking on what drones can collect, which is kind of an odd regulatory rule.</p><p/><p>Recently, the FTC had a workshop on the use of facial recognition technology because this isn't just an online phenomenon, I mean, you go into every store in America practically, and there's a camera that's taking pictures of the shoppers. And with facial recognition technology, you can now aggregate data about individuals -- who they are. And I mean, that's an immense amount of data that we, I don't think, have any rules about. What are your thoughts on that?</p><p/><p>REED: Well, the good news is that technology industries have actually been thinking on that. There are actually trade association efforts to develop best practices. And probably, the best example I've seen to date on this is, strangely enough, Connect by Microsoft. They put together an incredibly comprehensive program prior to putting the Connect in your house. And you'd say, why would that matter?</p><p/><p>But you realize, they're essentially facing a camera from the television at you, and so they did an entire privacy by design prior to launching Connect strictly on the question of facial recognition. So the good news is smart people are starting the day saying how do we deal with it.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: But the issue is then we have plenty of Fourth Amendment rules for the government, and that's important, I mean, obviously. But what we're talking about here is not the government, but the private sector, which we celebrate. I mean, the private sector is the job creator of -- of our country - the engine of economic growth. And yet, the capacity to know everything about individuals because of the technology that has been deployed, and yet individuals may not even be aware that their -- their picture is being taken with facial recognition technology.</p><p/><p>They may have absolutely no privacy, and I don't think we have any standards that are set for that use of big data. I mean, correct me if I'm -- if I'm wrong.</p><p/><p>BABEL: No, actually, I think in that regard, the online and mobile spaces are arguably doing a better job...</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: Yes.</p><p/><p>BABEL: ...communicating what information is collected and how it is used. And I think that as we these technologies move into retail that certainly companies like eBay that work with retail partners can -- can form that partnership and can educate and help them with -- with their use and their need to know their customer and how to balance that appropriately.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: I know my time is up, but I would just say that, you know, we need to have rules -- individuals have -- have the ability to enforce their understanding either through the FTC or through private rights of action. But we have not really looked at all to the non- online issues that may be even more severe than what people are paying attention because everybody who goes online knows it's an issue. Nobody knows that the drone is -- is in the sky or that the corner grocery is -- is collecting their data.</p><p/><p>BABEL: No, you're exactly right and we all saw in the retail space that Target knew a young lady was pregnant before she had been able to tell her family. And that was not the online data collection at all that was strictly from the retail store. So you're exactly right.</p><p/><p>LOFGREN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time is up. GOODLATTE: I thank the gentlewoman.</p><p/><p>The gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Jackson-Lee, is recognized for five minutes.</p><p/><p>JACKSON-LEE: I thank the chairman very much. I thank all the witnesses for their testimony, and I follow my colleague from California with the same quizzical concern about the extensiveness -- the vastness of the issues dealing with Internet use and the concerns that we now have facing the American public or the world public. And so I want to raise some questions on that issue.</p><p/><p>But before I do that, Mr. Reed, do you know the apps that are from Houston?</p><p/><p>REED: (OFF-MIKE)</p><p/><p>JACKSON-LEE: And you're well informed. Do you have some others that you can either refer and do a printout for us?</p><p/><p>REED: (OFF-MIKE)</p><p/><p>JACKSON-LEE: It is remarkable and probably gives shockwaves to future employers. But I -- I appreciate that.</p><p/><p>Let me stay on the line of reasoning of my questions about privacy and use two examples. First, on the front page of the website, CNET, there's a moving story of a paralyzed man who use his eyes to tweet. This story demonstrates the enormous potential of the Internet. How can this man be secure in knowing that when he use the web browser like an Internet Explorer and choose Do Not Track that his instructions will be followed and not ignored? Who wants to take that question?</p><p/><p>Professor?</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: The important part there is that once Do Not Track is standardized. I hope that Congress in the FTC will see fit to treat that as an enforceable practice either under the principles of contract law or as a deceptive trade practice, consumers' request not to be tracked should be honored.</p><p/><p>JACKSON-LEE: And how long or what should we do to move that standardization forward in terms of the industry to move forward on the standardized practice.</p><p/><p>Fortunately, working group that is discussing it has an active and aggressive schedule as long as they're aware that Washington is watching and hoping for them to succeed and waiting for the results, I think that is the most important thing you can do now.</p><p/><p>JACKSON-LEE: So you would say contract law and what will be the other enforcement?</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: The FTC's ability to prohibit unfair and deceptive trade practices. JACKSON-LEE: And my concern would be what are we doing now, but I appreciate what you're saying is that we're on the right track.</p><p/><p>Let me also add this question. (Inaudible) this morning discussing another topic, which is immigration reform on C-SPAN, but a question was raised before I came on to -- in a Google official report by Dr. Dorothy Chu (ph) on the alarming number of request for government censorship. The United States was number one.</p><p/><p>But the question is the government has a special role and responsibility. What should Congress role be in monitoring and -- in monitoring, permitting, or opposing censorship by the government?</p><p/><p>I'll go to professor, but I'd like some others to chip in.</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: So, the law enforcement request come from a wide variety of sources -- government both in the United States and abroad. And so the law of Congress there is, in part, to monitor the request coming from United States entities and, in part, also to just work with you as companies over the pressure they are receiving from foreign governments to censor and help give them the protection and reassurance in United States government that we support free expression around the world.</p><p/><p>JACKSON-LEE: But are you saying we -- we make statements because it's -- we're asking to protect what we are transmitting. So the point is -- is that the government is making these points that they need to, in essence, protect what they have.</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: There was a conversation that has been going on for a number of years over a global Internet freedom principals. And part of that has been a discussion about possibly legislating responsibilities to United States companies to be transparent about their degree of compliance or resistance to fine censorship accounts.</p><p/><p>Google is transparent about the request it receives is actually helpful in understanding the pressure that governments put on our companies to do their dirty work.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: I think that is a very sensitive question and that is appropriate for congressional review. Let me go to Mr. Babel to talk of the challenges of privacy as he established your company.</p><p/><p>BABEL: Sure. The challenges are really in helping companies and consumers kind of meet that best practice of where there's trust by consumers that the companies are doing the right thing. So our kind of sole role for existence is helping clients -- customers understand what best practices around privacy really are and helping them prove to consumers that they're doing the right thing with their, you know, personal information. So that's what TRUSTe is really there in helping the ecosystem know and understand, and balance that trust relationship between businesses and (inaudible).</p><p/><p>JACKSON-LEE: Are your customers bankers or banks?</p><p/><p>BABEL: There are few banks, but it's -- it's really more focused on more online companies and technology companies (inaudible) necessarily banks with the other regulations that they have.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Thank you. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.</p><p/><p>JACKSON-LEE: I yield back.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for five minutes, Mr. Johnson.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p/><p>And I must admit that I was just a little disturbed, Mr. Reed, when you left me out of the equation. I'm sitting here right in front of you, closest to you. We could almost breathe on each other and you didn't mention any app from the floor</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>REED: (Inaudible) your app is good. It's -- I'll give it to you right now. It's a great app that allows you to pay for your parking spot with your mobile phone. It's a -- it's actually one that a lot of us already uses, called Parkmobile. It's a great app. It lets you pay for parking with your mobile phone. There you go.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: I have to tell you -- thank you. I also found one from Decatur, which is where I represent.</p><p/><p>REED: Yeah.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Ping, a subsidiary of Ping Media Group incorporated is a provider of mobile coupons and promotions, which enable retailers and vendors to communicate directly with their customers via mobile phones. And then I got another one.</p><p/><p>A young man, 17 years old, his name is Albert Renshaw out of Gwinett County, which I also represent. He's developed Apps4Life, A- P-P-S-4, the number, LIFE, which offers Wi-Fi texting without a wireless connection. And I thought that was pretty good.</p><p/><p>But I will now get into the meat of my concern. A breach into security protocol by a company such as eBay that exposes private customer information to the public could result in death or grievous body injury to a customer whose private information was divulged wrongfully. The consumer certainly has a right to recover damages for his or her injury or their next of kin for their death. I'm sure you all would not disagree with that. And they have a right to seek a recovery in a court of law.</p><p/><p>But one of the -- and that's one of a consumer's basic rights, but that right is being chipped away at with this -- with these mandatory pre-dispute arbitration, mandatory arbitration clauses in these consumer agreements, which prohibit the individual -- the aggrieved party from being able to sue in court. And instead, they are forced into mandatory arbitration where the arbitrator is selected by the company.</p><p/><p>The arbitrator may or may not be a lawyer. The arbitrator does not operate in a public court room, but it's a private secret proceeding may be held miles away -- hundreds and thousands of miles away from where the aggrieved party actually lives. There's no rules of federal procedure, rules of civil procedure, rules of evidence, and no jury trial.</p><p/><p>You know, the arbitrator decides the issue. And then once the arbitrator does there's no right to an appeal. This is a private system of adjudicating disputes, which consumers sign up for in a consumer agreement with -- without any knowledge of the gravity of what they are giving up.</p><p/><p>Mr. Shipman, what do you think about that? Does -- does your company have to sue sometimes the competitors for various things in a court of law and do you think that it's important that consumers have the right to take their matter to court as well?</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: So, certainly the scenario you paint is -- is an awful and terrible scenario for that family and one that I would hope that we -- we never encounter.</p><p/><p>I think there's two important points here. The first is, what are the terms that the company has with a customer? And...</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: What that does.</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: ...what are the terms? Is there an arbitration provision or...</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Yeah. Do you know whether or not you have that in eBay?</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: In the case of eBay, we actually have a number of choices for our customers depending on the size of the claim. If it's a financial-related claim, it may be available to small claims action. If it's -- excuse me -- if it's a larger claim and certainly you can bring that case. We don't -- we don't have that arbitration provision that would prevent someone from being able to be heard and may have their day in court.</p><p/><p>The -- the second theme that you talk about is information security and the protection of information. And certainly, you, you know, a responsible company has thousands of people devoted to making sure that the information that is entrusted with us is taken care of appropriately because the last thing we want certainly is that scenario that you paint because that's awful for not only our business, but also for our customers.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Well, certainly, and -- and it's not that the company would intend for any harm to come to one of its customers because of the breach. It could happen though pretty easily given the fact that the -- this marketplace is in its earliest stage of development, growth, and mistakes can be made along the way with various applications. Something may have a bug that needs to be worked out.</p><p/><p>And it's definitely possible for someone's -- let's say a -- a woman who -- whose husband or boyfriend, you know, wants to do some damage to them, and due to a breach of information is able to follow through with that either, you know, character-wise or reputation-wise, or even come into the house and -- and -- and cutting up into a million pieces. You know, it could happen.</p><p/><p>And if it does happen, then if -- if eBay decides that, OK, this claim is not worth that much, then it would go through a certain procedure. And if it's -- if it's deemed by eBay to be larger than that, then it goes into -- then the person has a right to -- to go to court. Is that what we're talking about?</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: Well, you know, again, I mean, very awful scenario that you're painting. But...</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: (Inaudible) is true...</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: Nonetheless.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: ...anything might happen.</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: And certainly, we can follow up with you afterwards. We love to work with you.</p><p/><p>The -- you know, our clause allows consumers to decide what the -- you know, what avenue they have available to them. We don't limit all claims to arbitration. So I think that's the, you know, the salient piece.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: OK.</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: The second thing is on -- on this issue of a security breach, what we've seen to date, I can't summarize if you don't want me to summarize all of the legislation in the case law. What we've seen today is where there is a harm, and in the cases that you're providing there are clear harms, then it is likely, I believe, that you would see damages be appropriate. Where we have seen no harm, no financial identify theft, no physical harm, the cases that we've seen generally tend to say that there is not liability in that regard.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: I understand.</p><p/><p>Professor Grimmelmann, your response, sir, or insight?</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: I agree with him that where there is physical harm to the individual who has been hurt as a result of the breach, then yes, the courts are available, and they have been willing to hear those suits.</p><p/><p>I am concerned somewhat that the breaches do not result in immediate provable harm, but nonetheless reduce the information security for all of us by leaking financial information on many consumers that can lead to act of identity theft. It can't specifically trace back to that one individual breach, have resulted in harm is not provable in a court of law, and so therefore there's no redress against it. This is why data breach notification laws and other efforts to shine a light on this and enforce basic information security practices against industry participants are important. JOHNSON: Class action litigation could play a part in deterring willful misconduct that could ensue...</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: The time of the gentleman has expired.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: I noticed that red button has been on ever since I started talking, so I don't know how long I've gone, Mr. Chairman, but it doesn't seem like five minutes though.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for one additional minute to sum up his ideas.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Thank you.</p><p/><p>Class action litigation where a number of people have suffered just a small amount of harm, but the class action litigation which can result in a verdict of some importance in terms of the amount could act as a deterrent, and -- and it's good for public policy, in my opinion.</p><p/><p>What would be your response to that, Professor Grimmelmann, because I don't want to -- I don't want to personalize this with eBay? eBay is no different than all of the other entities out there that are very popular with consumers, so I'll ask you, Professor.</p><p/><p>Well, I'll ask Mr. -- Mr. Reed. What do you think?</p><p/><p>REED: This is an area in which...</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Go ahead -- go ahead.</p><p/><p>REED: This is an area in which you are concerned about arbitration...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: (Inaudible).</p><p/><p>REED: ...important. And this is also an area in which class action litigation has been important for privacy. Facebook has recently settled a lawsuit over its marketing commercial product using individual's pictures to say, \"James just watched Wally. Don't you want to watch it too?\" to their friends. And a class action lawsuit was altered in a $10 million settlement.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Thank you.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: The time of the gentleman has expired again, and having allotted him 10-1/2 minutes on his five minutes of time, I'm going to take the privilege of asking a clarifying question for the witnesses.</p><p/><p>To me, self-regulation means companies published their policies. And then if they engage in deceptive practices by not following those policies and under existing law, the Federal Trade Commission would have the authority to take action for false advertising or whatever the case might be.</p><p/><p>What I want to know for sure here is does anyone here believe that the federal government should impose a one-size-fits-all regulatory approach or that the federal government should prescribe specific privacy policies to specific companies or in general.</p><p/><p>Mr. Shipman?</p><p/><p>SHIPMAN: No, I don't think the -- the government should draft specific privacy policies. I think we should leave that to industry and those that are innovating the services and technologies.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Thank you.</p><p/><p>Mr. Reed?</p><p/><p>REED: Exactly the same. I agree completely. That's not the position the government should be in.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Mr. Babel?</p><p/><p>BABEL: (Inaudible) to agree and also agree with your view that self-regulation with -- and have a proper backdrop with the FTC is a good program to continue.</p><p/><p>GOODLATTE: Mr. Grimmelmann?</p><p/><p>GRIMMELMANN: I agree that government should not regulate specific privacy policies.

This, on top of yesterday's big rally. The major indices finished up across the board, largely due to the U.S. and Chinese officials confirming a fresh round of face-to-face trade talks, are now set for early October. DowIndustrials were up 372 points, the NASDAQ, up 140 points, 1 and 3 quarters percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe this morning, markets look like this, we did get German industrial production out, this morning, for the month of July, and the Eurozone growth fell by 50 percent in the second quarter, the latest signs of slowing economic growth in the Eurozone. FT-100 down 3 points, CAC Quarante in Paris is up 7, and the DAX Index in Germany is up 75, about one half -- two-thirds of one percent, rather.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Asia overnight, take a look at the numbers, the Shanghai in China was up half a percent, China cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves that injected some stimulus liquidity into the economy there, which is slowing down.</p><p>This, as more protests are planned in Hong Kong this weekend, even after officials pulled the controversial extradition bill. Hong Kong democracy advocate Jimmy Lai, joined me last hour, here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY LAI, TYCOON, HONG KONG TECH: If the economy goes down and trigger, that emotion can explode. That will be a big problem for China.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: This morning, Fitch downgraded Hong Kong due to the continued unrest. We are looking at the Hong Kong situation, worsen, despite the extradition bill because they want autonomy. Now, they want to be able to vote for their own leadership, as they were promised, under microscope.</p><p>The state attorneys general formally launching antitrust probe into big tech companies, Facebook and Google, the concerns over user data, coming up. All those stories coming up this Friday morning, for a special jobs' day special coverage.</p><p>The host of \"MAKING MONEY\" on FOX Business is here, Charles Payne, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell and MacroMavens' president, Stephanie Pomboy, Moody's Capital Markets chief economist, John Lonski, great to see everybody, and welcome Stephanie and Charles, good to see you.</p><p>Numbers out in 30 minutes, going to have real ramifications with the Fed meeting right around the corner. Charles, what do you think?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: I think 175. I'm looking for more participation, last month -- the last report we had, participation was amazing, particularly black Americans, 300 --230,000 came back into the labor force, still want to see year-over-year wage growth and a 3 percent, maybe 3.3, 3.4 percent. That's -- those are the numbers I'm looking for.</p><p>Worried about manufacturing, of course, worried about construction in those goods-producing jobs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. I want to get everybody's take, coming up, but we want to also look at jobs in America from another standpoint, and the August jobs' report is due out in under 30 minutes, economists are expecting 158,000 jobs added to the economy.</p><p>So, Charles is expecting even higher than that. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.7 percent. My next guest hopes to see positive numbers. They are working to encourage technology companies to create jobs in rural America.</p><p>Joining me right now is California Congressman Ro Khanna, along with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds. It is good to have you both with us. Thank you so much for being here. And Congressman Khanna, let me kick it off with you, tell me what you want to do here, in terms of rural jobs, across the country, created by tech?</p><p>REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Well, I've been very pleased to partner with Governor Reynolds and the local stakeholders in Jefferson, Iowa. We have had a number of Silicon Valley companies offer scholarships with Des Moines Community College, and offer a pathway for folks to get trained in digital marketing, in software design and be able to get jobs.</p><p>And they are going to be able to stay in the communities they grew up in. I really believe that Jefferson, Iowa can be a model for the country, in showing how we can create a technology opportunity in rural America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you know, it's interesting because you've got technology taking us forward, certainly, making our live better in so many ways, but there's also that worry about privacy, right, Congressman? I mean, just today, we're talking all about facial recognition, for example, and you know, there are some colleagues on -- of yours, that are worried about things like ring.</p><p>The company that has that doorbell that you can see, you know, the camera. Amazon owns the doorbell camera company. It's facing questions from Senator Edward Markey, over its partnerships with police departments around the country and tracking citizens.</p><p>KHANNA: Well, Maria, there's no doubt that technology can be abused. I have put forward an internet bill of rights to be able to protect people's privacy and to make sure that technology isn't misused in engaging in profiling or discrimination.</p><p>But I think the challenge of our time is to maximize the positives of technology to allow people access to jobs that are going to have a technical component while minimizing the harm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Governor, where do you sit on this? Tell us the situation in Iowa and how technology companies could create opportunities there?</p><p>GOV. KIM REYNOLDS (R-IA): Well, I'm really excited about the forge in this dynamic project and the opportunities that it provides for Iowans, especially in rural Iowa. I appreciate Congressman Ro Khanna and his involvement in really helping bring jobs to rural America. I want to give a shout out to Accenture for going beyond our urban centers and taking this model into rural Iowa.</p><p>We have a diverse in growing economy. We have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. And so, this is an opportunity not only to make sure that we are seeing that the success that Iowa is seeing, is happening all across our state and not just in pockets. And I believe with this model, it's an example that we can scale in rural communities all across Iowa and this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, we have been talking all morning about the jobs report, we're going to get the numbers in 25 minutes, but one issue is that people need to be retrained, right? There's a real skills gap going on over there, throughout the country.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what do you want to say to people out there who, you know, maybe it's a -- you know, a construction worker, a truck driver, whatever, they don't know anything about coding. They don't know anything about some of this technology new, you know, million-dollar words that we're talking about. How are they going to thrive?</p><p>REYNOLDS: Well, we want to make sure we start and have that pipeline in middle school and high school so that we are training our young people to be adaptive, to be lifelong learners, but we have a program in Iowa that we launched a couple years ago, and that we're really -- it's -- we're implementing it right now and it's called Future ReadyIowa.</p><p>And it has a goal of having 70 percent of Iowans, in the workforce, have either education or training beyond high school by the year 2025. We've put funding into that so that we can help not only with the pipeline for our K-12, but to work with our adult learners to provide that support system, to help them get the skills, to match them up with the jobs that we have available in the state right now.</p><p>These are great careers to help them be lifelong learners and the -- I believe, the hub, like the forge, is an opportunity to -- you know, to serve as a launchpad, to retrain, to help kids get the skills to fill the jobs, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think it's an important point.</p><p>REYNOLDS: -- we're seeing this happen all over the state. Pardon?</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, I think it's an important point that you make about older workers, because, that's the group, white collar too, by the way, who are being left behind in some -- in some regard. Congressman Khanna, let me ask you about these antitrust investigations, the Texas attorney general set to lead an effort, looking into Google and digital advertising, this, according to \"The Wall Street Journal.\"</p><p>New York attorney general is also overseeing a review of Facebook and personal data concerns. These investigations could expand to other companies. What do you want to see in terms of regulation, on big tech, knowing that these companies are more powerful today than they've ever been?</p><p>KHANNA: Well, I think we, obviously, have to enforce antitrust law and make sure that these platforms are competitive, that they aren't privileging their own products, but we also need to make sure that we are innovative. America leads the world in innovation. Our technology is far superior to any tech company in Europe. And our real competition is China.</p><p>And so, I want to make sure that we have strong antitrust enforcement, but I also want to make sure that America leads the world in technology. And a quick point, I think you're absolutely right, Maria, that there are going to be jobs in all different industries, manufacturing, construction, logistics --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>KHANNA: -- not everyone has to go become a coder, but everyone is going to need some technology skill --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KHANNA: -- even in the industry that they may work in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's absolutely right. The skills training is really important at this moment in time. Does it bother you that Google has an A.I. lab in China? I mean, look, this China fight with the U.S., is getting deeper. Retail giant, Target, is telling suppliers ahead of the September 1st tariff hike, they'd have to pay for additional costs, not consumers. Beijing is (ph) also feeling the tariff pinch, a report from the Tokyo investment bank, Nomura, says that countries like Vietnam and South Korea are benefiting the most from the trade impasse.</p><p>And we know, Governor, that Google walked away from a contract with the Pentagon, Project Maven, and yet, it has an A.I. lab in China. Is there any reason to believe that China will try to dictate or meddle in the U.S. elections through Google?</p><p>REYNOLDS: Is that to me?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Oh, I'm sorry. OK. Well, listen, I think that's something that we need to be mindful of. We know that China has been a bad actor. We need to hold them accountable, and that's what we're trying to do. And so, it's important that we take this seriously, and that we, you know, stay firm in what we're trying to do through the negotiations of -- with China, but they have a history of being a bad actor.</p><p>They -- it's intellectual property and technology transfer is a cost of doing business. Our businesses are aware of that. And so, we need to hold them accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm just -- I'm just wondering about Google, Congressman Khanna, because, you know, you heard Peter Thiel's comments, right? I mean, Peter Thiel wrote an op-ed and he said it's a national security risk, that Google has an A.I. lab in China, what do you think about that? Any worries?</p><p>KHANNA: Well, I agree with Governor Reynolds that China has been stealing intellectual property. There's no doubt about that. We need to protect our most sensitive technology from going to China. I don't think we ought to allow China, access, to our most sensitive technology.</p><p>What we also need to do, as a country, is invest in the technologies of the future, Artificial Intelligence, quantum computing --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are we doing enough of that?</p><p>KHANNA: -- and make sure America leads --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KHANNA: -- in the industries of the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right, especially as China wants to be number one in all of those industries, so you wonder if we are, in fact, doing enough. It's great to have this conversation with you both, and it's great to see you both working together on this very important project. Thank you, Congressman Ro Khanna and Governor Kim Reynolds, good to see you both.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Thank you.</p><p>KHANNA: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you. Have a good day. Coming up, Dorian's devastation, high winds, life-threatening storm surges, menacing the Carolina coast, leaving hundreds of thousands without power. We're going to take you there, live, next.</p><p>And we are just under 20 minutes away from the August jobs report, we're breaking that down, see if it's going to impact markets with the highs of the morning, up 118 now in the Dow. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are tracking Hurricane Dorian. The storm weakening to a category 1 now but it's still packing a punch, as it turns off the North Carolina coast. High winds, torrential downpours, knocking out power to thousands of people. Jeff Flock is live this morning in Awendaw, South Carolina with the very latest. Did I say that right, Jeff, Awendaw?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: You pronounce that right. Nice work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, good.</p><p>FLOCK: That's not easy down here. The locals are very particular. So, it's a small little fishing village here. And this is characteristic of the damage perhaps that you see behind me. But I have breaking news for you, Maria, Hatteras, Cape Hatteras is now in the eye of the storm. If we take a look at the radar and the track, perhaps we can see that. This does not, though, technically constitute a landfall. According National Hurricane Center, the very center of the eye must go over land in order to call it a landfall. So, at this point, we still don't have a landfall for Hurricane Dorian.</p><p>But that category 1 storm, as you point out, still lashing the coast up there, causing all kinds of havoc. Although, when it's said and done, it appears because a lot of communities have already been in the eyewall, the kind of damage you're going to see after it will be the kind that you see behind me, which is essentially trees uprooted, you know, some signs knocked down, but nothing major, catastrophic. So, I think a positive story there of the landfall or the almost landfall of Hurricane Dorian. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Jeff, thank you so much. Jeff Flock this morning with incredible reporting this whole week. We are minutes away from the August jobs report. Everything you need to know ahead of that release when we come right back. Markets at the high of the morning right now, up 129 points on the Dow. 14 points higher in the S&amp;P, and the NASDAQ up 30 points. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The August jobs report due out in just 10 minutes' time. Economists are expecting you to show 150,000 jobs were added to the economy in the month of August with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent.</p><p>We have an all-star panel this morning to break it all down. Chief Workforce Analyst at EmployBridge Joanie Courtney is with us this morning. She knows exactly where all the jobs are. Senior writer for The Wall Street Journal, Jon Hilsenrath knows exactly where rates are going. And the former Wall Street Journal editorial board member and Trumponomics co- author, Stephen Moore, knows everything about the economy. And then, I've got an incredible group here on set. Thanks, everybody for joining us. Stephanie Pomboy, let me ask you what's most important in this report from your standpoint?</p><p>STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS: Well, I guess I was ranting and raving all last year about how profits were going to go into recession. And profits are the number one input into employment hiring decisions. Lo and behold, profits are in recession now. And it wasn't some great crystal ball that I had, it's that the government profit numbers were already much weaker than S&amp;P, which speaks to an underlying weakness in the economy that's been in place long before all this tariff talk.</p><p>So, I think we're starting to see that impact. You've seen a slowdown in growth and employment, which, you know, would naturally follow this slowdown in profit growth. So, I think that continues. I have no issue with $165,000 -- 165,000 estimate, but I think it's just a continuation of this broad slowdown alongside the profit slowdown that you can see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jon Hilsenrath, are we going to see that slowdown in this report today, you think?</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I mean, the consensus estimate kind of points to a slowdown. So, I'm going to be looking like Stephanie at that overall headline number. I think it's also really important to look at how many hours employers are asking their workers to work. They don't want to let go of people because it's so hard to find them right now. But if you look, for instance, in the manufacturing sector, we've seen a real slow down in overtime hours. And I think if we see ours work slowing down more, that's a sign that more broadly, some of the heat is coming out of this economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We're going to get that number in about seven minutes. President Trump just tweeted on immigration. Here's what the President just wrote: \"DACA will be going before the Supreme Court. It is a document that even President Obama didn't feel he had the legal right to sign -- he signed it anyway. Rest assured that if the Supreme Court does what all say it must, based on the law, a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all!\" writes the President about DACA. We're going to slip in a quick break here, then we got the August jobs report and expert analysis right after this break. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, it is Jobs Friday, September 6th. Your top stories right now 8:27 a.m. on the east coast. We are waiting for the August jobs report due out in 2-1/2 minutes. Economists are expecting 158,000 jobs created in the month of August with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent. This is the kind of report that moves markets.</p><p>Futures are higher headed into the report. Take a look, we are near the -- we are at the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Futures up 126 points, the S&amp;P at 13-1/2, and the NASDAQ up 26. We are waiting on this number. And we want to see what our incredible panel here thinks about it. John Lonski, your expectations this morning, what are you going to be focused on?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKET: I'm think -- looking at the consensus number, 160,000 new jobs, be paying, you know, a good deal of attention to what the jobs report is telling us about personal income. Do we get an increase in wages, lengthening of the workweek that suggests we're going to have another healthy increase in personal income, then that will be a positive for consumer spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Steve Moore, what are you focused on this morning?</p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, FORMER EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, we find out, Maria, this morning, whether that dreaded \"our\" word is actually on the agenda. And I'm talking about recession. And you know, if we get a good healthy jobs report, I think we can put, you know, aside all of these concerns about the economy sinking into negativity. And Charles had it right, the one number I'm going to really be focusing on is manufacturing construction. So, please, Maria, tell us what that number is as soon as it comes out.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. The manufacturing number, we got it. What else you got -- Dagen, you always look at wages, you also look at obviously rates, and the participation rate as well, what's your most important factor today?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: So, the expectation for wage growth is still 3.1 percent. We are still not close to the 3.4 percent, which was the fastest wage growth number that we've gotten so far this year. But if you get a tick up in wages, say, if they're holding it, say, 3.2, 3.3 percent, that's still very solid. Puts money in people's pockets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Joanie Courtney, anything special you want to hear in this report?</p><p>JOANIE COURTNEY, CHIEF WORKFORCE ANALYST, EMPLOYBRIDGE: You know, we definitely need to look at the revisions, Maria. Last month, we saw 164,000 jobs. We've been averaging 165,000 for the first seven months of this year. So, definitely looking at revisions, wages, labor participation, a lot to unpack this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, 158,000 is the estimate. Jon, how important is this for the Federal Reserve, very quickly in a word or two.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I think the Fed is doing a quarter point at the next meeting and this doesn't really change that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we're going to watch what these numbers are. Edward Lawrence is at the Labor Department. He is looking at the embargoed release right now. And we are going to get to him so that we get that number right at 8:30. Edward Lawrence, take it away.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And 130,000 jobs are created in the economy last -- in August, that's 96,000 in the private sector, 28,000 were in the public sector and the government hiring the 25 of those, 25,000 of those, is for the census.</p><p>Now the unemployment rate, 3.7 percent, that's a third month in a row that it's been at that rate. In June, the numbers have been revised down by 15,000, July also revised down by 5,000 so net revisions for the last two months down 20,000 jobs. The U-6 ticked up to 7.2 percent long-term unemployment at 20.6 percent. Now average hourly wage is up 0.4 percent month-over-month for the last 12 months. It's up 3.2 percent.</p><p>Now labor force participation rate edged up at 63.2 percent, average hourly workweek also up 0.1 hour to 34.4 hours, nonsupervisory wages rose $0.11, the white unemployment rate 3.4 percent, black unemployment rate at a historic low since they've been keeping records in 1972, 5.5 percent, Hispanic unemployment rate 4.2 percent, Asian unemployment rate 2.8 percent.</p><p>Now healthcare added 24,000 jobs. That makes 392,000 jobs over the course of the last 12 months. Now the last time there was a decline in healthcare was five years ago, in January of 2014.</p><p>Manufacturing added 3,000 jobs, mining lost 6,000 jobs, retail lost 11,000 jobs, construction adding 14,000 jobs. Now most of those construction jobs coming in residential or half of them, 7,000, the rest sort of spread out. But again, the headline here, 130,000 jobs created, unemployment rate stays the same at 3.7 percent. Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Did you mention manufacturing jobs? Because that is something that --</p><p>PAYNE: Three thousand.</p><p>MOORE: Three thousand.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Three thousand.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Manufacturing up 3,000 jobs. The job growth in the industry has been slower than it was in 2018, it's averaging about 6,000 jobs a month this year where it was 22,000 jobs a month last year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much. Edward Lawrence with the latest there. Steve Moore, you wanted to hear about manufacturing. Your reaction to this.</p><p>MOORE: You know, this is pretty much right on target of what a lot of people were expecting. I'm maybe a little bit disappointed the number wasn't higher, but still given the fact that so many economists have been saying that the American economy is headed to recession, this report says no recession on the horizon at least for now.</p><p>You know, I was very pleased about that manufacturing number because as you know, last month, we had negative manufacturing activity so at least there's still hiring. I was a little surprised, weren't you, Maria? I think that he said that the retail hiring actually had fallen whereas, you know, the retailers have been doing really well and the consumer has been carrying the economy.</p><p>One other quick point, we underestimate how stimulative these low interest rates are. The fact that you've got construction doing well, and housing, is an indication that people can refinance, they can now afford houses more because of low, you know, 30-year mortgage at 3-1/2 percent. So, that's a -- that's a positive thing for the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Look at wages up 3.8 percent.</p><p>MOORE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Charles Payne, your reaction here.</p><p>PAYNE: Let me tell you, outside of the overall, I give this whole a B- plus, and I'll tell you why. Participation is up and unemployment is down from like -- I can't wait to see if more black Americans came into the labor force, a historical low. That would be great, especially if more people joined the labor force.</p><p>The wage part of this, yesterday, Lands' End was up 22 percent, Cigna was up 27 percent, G3 was up 24 percent, this morning, Genesco, the company Johnson &amp; Murphy, Zumiez, Lululemon, they're all going to be up anywhere from five to 15 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>PAYNE: The American consumer, Steve, shouldn't be surprised about retail, that's the brick-and-mortar side of the business, right? It doesn't have anything to do with the consumer out there, that's why these retailer stocks are going through the roof. I feel sorry for anyone that sold them at a loss because they were waiting for the tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Don't forget about July, payrolls were actually revised upwards. Joanie Courtney, you wanted to see the revisions. This has to be a good revision, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: I think it was down 20, yes. June and July combined, down 20.</p><p>COURTNEY: The revisions were slightly down, but I -- but I will say overall --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Apologies, revision in July was down? Thank you.</p><p>COURTNEY: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Thank you.</p><p>COURTNEY: Revision in July, and in June were both down I think for net of 20,000. But overall, we did see in this report that the size of the employed population grew by 590,000 people.</p><p>PAYNE: Wow. Wow.</p><p>COURTNEY: That is a huge number. We have not seen that many people come back into the workforce, so it kind of goes along with consumer spending, consumer sentiment. The, you know, worker is feeling like, yes, it's a good time to participate in this economy. And we're seeing that in wages as well.</p><p>So even though this headline number of only 96,000 in the private sector is not that strong, all the other details in this report are very, very positive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And yet it is a slowdown, it's lower than we thought, Stephanie.</p><p>POMBOY: Yes. I mean I think 96,000 is the number to focus on, and I think that's extremely disappointing. I think the headline, 130, is kind of interesting because if you look at the household survey versus the payroll survey, the household survey is actually averaged 130,000 over the last 12 months, whereas the payroll survey has averaged 190,000. So we're seeing a resolution of that gap, which you do normally see the household survey tends to lead.</p><p>But I go back to profits, and I think that the idea that the profit recession that we're seeing now is temporary, and strictly a function of the trade war, is going to be proven false and we should expect to see a continuation in the deterioration in profits and, therefore, a continued slowdown in these employment numbers going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joanie Courtney, you just mentioned the revisions, but where can you tell us the job opportunities are right now?</p><p>COURTNEY: Well, when you -- when you look at this report, Maria, just about every sector did add some type of job with the exception of, you know, retail lost 11,000 and of course mining, I think there was a very small loss in utilities. What I was very interested in in digging into this is that the temporary sector, which usually is a leading indicator of a recession if we see that employers are letting their temporary workers go that would show some softening.</p><p>It actually jumped up to 15,000 jobs created this month but, you know, jobs are in healthcare, the professional business service sector, technology, you know, still tremendous need in developers, analysts, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and services as well. I am a little --</p><p>COURTNEY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I am a little struck by this decline in retail jobs, because this is the area that has been strong.</p><p>PAYNE: This has been happening though. Yes, but this is -- these are brick-and-mortar retail jobs. They're being replaced by warehouse jobs which, by the way, retail --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you think this this is just a measure of bifurcation within the retail sector?</p><p>PAYNE: And not only this, this is the second lowest paying sector there is. Leisure is the only that one pays less, so we want people moving out of these low paying jobs into higher paying warehouse jobs, that's where the transition is happening.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the softness in this economy has been in manufacturing activity, and this is evidence of that with 3,000 jobs created, the -- and you have a slowing of the -- of the number of jobs in terms of the average over last three months. Average payroll growth was 156,000. The average per month in the eight years since jobs started growing is 190,000. So, you don't have to see a recession, but we surely see an economy that's looking soft here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. For sure.</p><p>MOORE: Yes, but can I -- allow me to say something about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Go ahead, Steve.</p><p>MOORE: I mean clearly there's been a slowdown in manufacturing, no question about it. But, you know, it still all goes back to this trade deal. I mean if you get the trade deal done, sometime in the next few months, and we all have our fingers crossed that happens, you're just going to see an explosion of manufacturing and construction jobs, and the stock market's going to, you know, I'm with Art Laffer, you're going to see a 5,000 point rise in the Dow once that deal gets done.</p><p>So, so much of what's going on with the economy and what businesses are anticipating in my opinion is tied to how we resolve this China trade situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Definitely. But you're betting on a deal that happen, right, Steve? I mean how do we know --</p><p>MOORE: Yes. Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- that it happens? How -- is China going to all of a sudden get religion on theft of intellectual property?</p><p>MOORE: Well, I'd put -- I still am going to put the odds at 60 percent. We get a deal sometime in the next six months, and probably because it's been said earlier on the show, China's getting whacked by these tariffs. They're getting really killed by this. It's in their own economic self- interest to get a deal done.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But you have to factor in, Steve, the entire global economy is slowing, it's not just U.S. versus China.</p><p>MOORE: That's true. That's a good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And so in terms of the softness in manufacturing, what, 40 percent of the revenue for S&amp;P 500 comes from overseas. It's more than half for technology companies. So in terms of predicting an explosion to the upside and manufacturing, you got to temper that a little bit given the backdrop of the entire globe not just China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jon Hilsenrath, jump in. Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, just one -- let me just say one thing about that then.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH: You're right, you're absolutely right, but a trade deal with China -- I mean you got the two biggest economies in the world, if they come to resolution here, it benefits not just the U.S. and China but everybody around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is there any reason to believe that a resolution is at hand?</p><p>MOORE: Well, I mean, it's impossible to tell because -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: Because the ball is in Beijing's court.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. That's right.</p><p>MOORE: And we're trying to predict, you know, what the Chinese leaders are going to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. What do you think, John?</p><p>LONSKI: I think you're going to get a resolution if the equity market weakens, if we get more troubling news on the economy, more disappointments with profitability, corporate revenues, President Trump is going to have no choice but the -- make a deal even if that amounts to just simply saving face, get this out of the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But after he told us and was so adamant about the seven sins or whatever that China is doing, manipulating the currency stealing I.P., forcing the transfer of technology, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Can you do a deal without --</p><p>LONSKI: Well, I think political -- you're right. It's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- taking care of those things? I don't know about that.</p><p>LONSKI: He's not going to come off of this looking clean --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: -- but the political risk might be most reduced by coming up with some sort of deal. You know, on the positive side, we still have a historically low unemployment rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fifty-year low, fifty-one year low.</p><p>LONSKI: 3.7 percent, that's good. However, as Stephanie mentioned, if you continue to generate fewer than a hundred thousand new jobs in the private sector, for several more months, you're going to see that unemployment rate begin to rise, and sad to say, historically every time the unemployment rate rises by what is it, a quarter of a percentage point from a year ago, you're either in a recession or you're about to slip into one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jon Hilsenrath, jump in here.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I'll say three things. First of all, you know, broadly, these numbers are consistent with an economy that's slowing down, not in recession but slowing down and that's not a pleasant thing. Two, there's a lot of talk on the panel about trade. You know, I think it's worth pointing out that as we get closer to the election, the Chinese gain leverage on getting a deal, because, you know, the president wants to get the economy faster.</p><p>The third thing I'd say, you know, point out to everybody is the president is tweeting while we're talking about the fed. The fed is going to be his punching bag on this. He asked in a -- in a -- in a tweet this just a few minutes ago, \"Where did I find this guy, Jerome Powell?\" He is going to blame the fed for this slowdown. Nevertheless, I think the fed is lining up.</p><p>We reported for a quarter point interest rate cut later this month, you know. A lot of people -- some people want the fed to do a half point, I don't think there's enough in this data to convince them to go a half.</p><p>MOORE: Well, just look at the -- look at the numbers on what's happening with prices. I mean the fed should be cutting rates by 50 basis points. They should have done it yesterday. They're way behind the curve. I'm with Trump on this. I think a major factor in the slowdown has been this that the fed has created an inflationary environment out there.</p><p>You look at what's happening with -- for everything, from prices from oil, to corn, to -- commodities are falling, they're below their inflation target, we need to inject more dollar liquid in the economy --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: -- head off a recession in my opinion.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, I mean the one -- the one thing I'd say to that is it's inflation, the inflation numbers have been running below the fed's two percent target for many years now. They've actually firmed a little bit over the last few months. And if you look at yesterday's revision to productivity, numbers unit labor costs are going up. They're strengthening a little bit, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But --</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- it's a little bit complicated for the fed right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The market -- the market dip to -- when these numbers first came out, we are back up to near the highs. Let's check in with Kristina Partsinevelos. She's on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching the earlier reaction to this job's report on the floor. Kristina.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Maria, that's exactly right. What you saw is you saw a selloff moment. The headline came in much lower than expected, about 130,000 jobs added, but once people started to parse through the information, you started to see the futures market climb higher.</p><p>The Dow up 132 points, the S&amp;P up over 15, and the NASDAQ up 35 -- or almost 35 points. And we're talking about an average not including this month, the U.S., on average, for 2019 has created 165,000 jobs, that's a little bit lower than last year as we know because it's slowing down. Last year, the pace was 223,000.</p><p>But I want to focus on the good news because I know we're talking about the strength in the consumer. Charles Payne alluded to that, Dagen as well. The U.S. only really has to create roughly a hundred thousand jobs to soak up all the new people entering the labor force. So, across the board though, because we're talking about the markets, originally I thought we were checking a technology sector because there's strength in technology, because there was strength in healthcare.</p><p>But those sectors right now aren't doing as well technology, and that's for separate reasons having to do with the weight of Facebook weighing down overall. The Dow Futures, roughly the same spot where we were prior to the jobs' report at around 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Back to you guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Kristina.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Can I ask Jon Hilsenrath a question? Jon, because we talk about this bounce back in business spending, and boom, and hiring if a trade deal gets done. Do businesses really operate like that?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, I mean I think what business is dealing with right now is just a lot of uncertainty. So, you know, what happens tomorrow if the president and Xi say we have a deal, you know? I think after all the back- and-forth over the last couple of years. You have to look at that with some measure of caution about whether it will actually end up getting signed, sealed, and delivered, and whether the Chinese will follow through on it, so, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- you know, I think we're baked a lot of uncertainty into corporate boardrooms for at least the next -- the next 12 months.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, because they don't -- they don't change direction on a dime. It takes a bit of time there. Jon, I know --</p><p>HILSENRATH: And that's frankly why I find the markets -- I find the market's reaction yesterday to these talks being on again, to be kind of puzzling because they're on-again, and off-again all the time. So, you know --</p><p>PAYNE: Can I weigh in on markets?</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- for me, it just looks like more uncertainty.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we're going to -- we're going to a short break and then we're going to come back. Jon, I know you've got heart out at 45, so we want to thank you so much for joining the conversation.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got more on the jobs' report right after this break, Stuart Varney will weigh, in Stephanie and Charles have a lot to say, but first, here's a special update from the Tennis Channel right now.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Oh my God. Welcome back to another Tennis Channel Court Report for FOX Business, I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>Serena Williams is one win away from equaling the all-time record at the Slams after reaching her tenth final at the U.S. Open. The 23-time major champion blew Elina Svitolina off the court in Thursdays, opening semifinals.</p><p>Serena fires six aces and 33 winners on her away to her 100st victory in New York tying Chris Evert for most wins at the American Slam. She'll face Indian Wells champ, Bianca Andreescu in the championship match after the Canadian fought back from 5-2 down in the second set to take out Belinda Bencic. Andreescu beat Serena in their only previous meeting in Toronto last month. And you can watch the men's semis on Tennis Channel. Our coverage starts Friday at 11:00 p.m. Eastern. For Court Report, I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, the August jobs' report is out, the economy added 130,000 jobs in the month of August. That missed economist expectations. The unemployment rate holding steady 3.7, that's a 51-year low. Joining us right now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in. Good morning,</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR\" Stu. Good morning, Maria. Let me make three points, number one, I think this is very modest job growth in a slowing economy that has been affected by uncertainty of china trade. Number two, the participation rate went up nicely. In fact, it's up a half point in the last year, doesn't sound like much, but a lot of people pulled back into the labor force. Number three, the unemployment rate for black folks 5.5 percent. That is the lowest ever recorded. That's what I got to say, Maria. That's how I would wrap it up.</p><p>But we still -- we will cps that's an important throw and somebody's -- So Manuel are talking about out there. We've got growing economy, albeit a slower growth story. Markets have come off the highs. Stuart, we'll see you in about 10 minutes. We know you'll have a lot more on this this. Morning \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" but first, we've got analysis here as the market has come in, friends. Charles we're looking at a rally, but up about 93 points.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, and we're two percent off the eight-time all, you know. I'm in this to make how. OK? And I think most of our previous are in this the mercury and we pontificate the economy is. As some point, we're going to hit all-time unemployment and start to etch back higher.</p><p>My big concern is have missed out on this rally, and I deliberately brought up the retailers because these retailers have 25 percent one day. People saw these stats in a lot, listening to the expertness.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>PAYNE: You know what, the market likes this new. It's amazing news where 590,000 Americans into the labor force and wages are going up. I like where we are. The end is near somewhere, but I'll let that happen when it happens. In the meantime, I think, you know what, continue to make money in the stock market particularly now as broadening out and the financials by the way might take over leadership. Bank earnings last quarter, record all-time record so we're doing pretty good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know what I want to know from you guys, what do you think these low rates are going to mean for the economy in the next six months? Are these rock-bottom rates going to spur something? Because Stephanie, we had 49 corporate bond deals done in the last 30 hours, OK? $74 billion raised so far in terms of corporate companies, borrowing $74 billion in the U.S. investment grade bond market this week alone.</p><p>So they're taking advantage of rock-bottom rates. Is it going to stimulate consumers?</p><p>POMBOY: Well, I mean, this was going to be my point was that I think Trump is absolutely right, that the tariff -- the trade war is an exacerbating factor, but the primary reason for the slowdown in the economy is the fed and the fact that they tighten starting in 2015 and that did QT starting in 2017. If you look at the peak in profits was in 2015, the peak in discretionary consumer spending was in 2015. Wal-Mart, which is one of my recession indicators, started to outperform S&amp;P in 2015 when the fed started raising rates. It's up one hundred percent over that time. The S&amp;P is up 40. It is massively outperforming S&amp;P. Always been a recession signal in the past.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So in other words when --</p><p>POMBOY: I think Trump is right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When people are feeling squeezed, they go to Wal-Mart.</p><p>POMBOY: They have to trade down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I get that.</p><p>POMBOY: And so the question is, do the lower rates like you just asked, have -- now that the fed's cutting rates and reversing the mistake it made, is it sufficient? Is it going to do the job? And the problem is that if you look at the responsiveness in the housing market for example, the most intrasensitive sector out there, you're not seeing any real response to the collapse in mortgage rates.</p><p>We have had six consecutive quarters where housing has detracted from GDP, ten of the last 12 quarters housing (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you're not expecting these mortgage rates, it's too late now?</p><p>POMBOY: I think it's too late. I think that the fed waited too long, tightened too far, and now it's too much to a little too late.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And by the way, Steve Moore, I know Steve (INAUDIBLE) and the frenzy is not going to let up on the -- on the corporate side. You've got another $50 billion projected for the rest of the month, the activity spilling over to junk bonds, leveraged loans as well.</p><p>$16 trillion of bonds in Europe and Asia are actually paying negative yields right now.</p><p>MOORE: Yes, that's why -- look, you know, I just disagree with Jon. Jon, there's no inflation whatsoever. There's not even a whiff of deflation in the economy, there's deflation. And that's why these bond rates are so low. I mean my goodness, who would buy a 30-year bond at a two percent interest rate?</p><p>I mean it's the most insane buy out there and the reason is why do you have a flattened, and in some cases, negative yield curve? Because people are worried about prices falling, not rising and so I do -- I completely agree with Stephanie. I think the fed has been way behind the curve. One other quick point, I think we should be, you know, given the fact that employers are literally running out of workers, I think this hundred thousand or so jobs a month is going to be kind of the new normal just because employers can't find the workers they need to fill the jobs.</p><p>LONSKI: You know, I think it's important to note that amid all this recent equity market volatility, nobody mentioned those two terrible words credit crunch and with this latest surge by investment grade bond issuance moving into high yield, that tells me the U.S. economy is remaining safely distanced from a credit crunch, we'll have more than enough financial systemic liquidity. Money will be plentiful and that may do the trick of keeping us safely distanced from a recession, from a deep and lasting drop in equity prices.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean we were expecting things to slow down, right? I mean with the trade uncertainty, we saw it in capex, we see it in manufacturing and housing. Joanie Courtney, final words from you before you say goodbye.</p><p>COURTNEY: Yes, you know, I think you're right, Maria. The manufacturing we've definitely seen a slowness, but if you look at the overall picture of the job market, there's still over seven million open jobs --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>COURTNEY: -- to Steve's point. Many of these jobs are going unfilled because employers cannot find workers. We've seen that in many studies, so that will also cause a slowness.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>COURTNEY: A lot of different factors there, but overall, great opportunities, wages are moving, that does impact corporate profits --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>COURTNEY: -- as we see and that will slow things down as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll start seeing the quarterly earnings --</p><p>COURTNEY: But still a strong market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- coming out at the end of September. Joanie Courtney, Stephen Moore, good to see you. We will take a short break then we got final thoughts from this all-star panel here on set. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got a jam-packed show on Monday. The founder of Papa John's, John Schnatter here, Schnatter here joining me in his first interview since stepping down as chairman and CEO of Papa John's. You're going to want to see that.</p><p>Plus Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will join me exclusive there to talk trade and the economy. Thanks to this great panel today. Have a great weekend. Let's get right to Stuart Varney in \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stu, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY: I shall indeed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019090603cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0J-JNC1-JB20-G3RX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7815\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 6, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>REP. RO KHANNA, </nameText></person>D-CALIF., IS INTERVIEWED ON BB TV</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">OCTOBER 23, 2017</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: <person><nameText>REP. RO KHANNA, </nameText></person>D-CALIF.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG HOST: Well, on November 1st, three of the top tech firms will testify before congress. Lawmakers want them to answer publicly about Russia interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But one congressman isn't waiting until them to challenge Silicon Valley. <person><nameText>Representative Ro Khanna </nameText></person>of California has spend a stirring Op-Ed in the Washington Post titled \"Trump beat Silicon Valley at its own game. Now, it must prove itself.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In it, he takes big tech to task over a variety of issues from election meddling to diversity and more, he joins me now from Washington. Representative Khanna, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>So you say Trump used the tools of technology to win despite Silicon Valley's overwhelming support for <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton.</nameText></person></p><p>It's almost as if Trump bested tech leaders at the game they invented, how so?</p><p><person><nameText>REP. RO KHANNA, </nameText></person>D-CALIF.: Well, Trump was very effective in using Twitter and Facebook to get passionate support to get his message out.</p><p>But a lot of these platforms, of course, we're abused. They amplified fake voices, extreme voices that pretended to be 10,000 people even though there was only one person they've crafted in false news.</p><p>And so tech needs to help figure out how to solve some of these issues. We know it can empower individuals in extraordinary ways but we need to fix the excess that we saw in the 2016 election cycle.</p><p>CHANG: Right, you say tech tools should strengthen not weaken democracy and Russia interference aside. Someone argue that, you know, social media has dramatically increase the number of voices that are being heard. You know, can tech companies really be responsible for all of this?</p><p>KHANNA: Well, I actually think tech has played a very positive role overall. I mean, it gave a rise -- give rise to Barack Obama and to <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders.</nameText></person></p><p>I often joke at town halls that the average person could have more of a voice by having a clever tweet or Facebook posts than I can by speaking to an empty chamber in congress.</p><p>So tech has empowered individuals in extraordinary ways, but that said there are things that now that they have become a platform where almost 50 percent of Americans get their news there that they need to do.</p><p>One if having some basic differentiation between fact and opinion on newspapers, TV stations like yours have third-party verification and they independently checked facts.</p><p>There can be third-party verification on some of the posts. They should look at providing perhaps an alternative perspective if viewers want that alternative perspective.</p><p>They just need to look at what their journalistic responsibilities can be without suppressing the freedom of expression.</p><p>And I'm encouraged that the number of tech companies are doing that and that dialogue has begun.</p><p>CHANG: You wonder though how far these companies can go? How well companies can distinguish between fact and opinion when our own president may have a different opinion of the facts than the facts?</p><p>KHANNA: I agree, it's a very difficult issue. But there are independent third-party sites which can at least rate content so if some part one that's out there saying the sky is green or that, you know, Barack Obama isn't an American citizen.</p><p>They could at least have a rating and verification. Just like newspapers do, just like television stations do where they could provide a link to say, \"Here are some alternative perspectives if you saw the truth.\"</p><p>I think these tech companies -- tech company and social media is very different than television.</p><p>Television is an as interactive, people aren't responding to me. It's a broadcast, two individuals and tech is a person-to-person communication.</p><p>So tech can't be responsible for every single post in the content of every single post.</p><p>That said they do need to move towards adopting some journalistic standards of third-party verification, fact verification so they could give users an informed perspective.</p><p>CHANG: That said, I wonder how much can we rely on companies to do the right thing or whatever is in the best interest of society rather than what's in the best interest of their business.</p><p>And how much should the government actually be in charge of figuring out whether there's Russia interference on these platforms? Should there be government regulation?</p><p>KHANNA: Well, I think there are two different questions. In terms of the best interest of society, I think that was Silicon Valley's tradition with David Packard and Hewlett-Packard and some of the early founders, Andy Grove.</p><p>They talked about building technology in a way that would help society, help empower people.</p><p>And if you talk to tech leaders that's what they really hope that their platforms would help improve communication, lead to a more connected world, create more jobs.</p><p>Tim Cook recently said that business leaders have a moral responsibility to care about education and jobs.</p><p>Sundar Pichai recently announced a one billion dollar initiative to prepare folks for the tech jobs of the future.</p><p>And so I think there is an ongoing awareness with tech leaders that they have to care about their contribution to jobs in places that don't have them and to the democratic conversation.</p><p>Given that they are some of the largest companies in the nation and some of them have such great responsibility in so many viewers.</p><p>On the Russia issue, I think their -- we definitely need better intelligent sharing between tech companies and the government so that they can get advance notice if there is suspicious activity and act on it.</p><p>And tech companies need to help adapt exceptional processing to look at false accounts or bad accounts, bad actors, the way some bank (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>Some of it is hiring more people, but even if they hire a thousand of more people given the volume, they probably need investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence to be able to do some of that work.</p><p>So I'm hopeful a lot of it will be tech coming to its own conclusion but some -- there will probably be a role for congress and lawmakers as well to have constructive rules that tech can follow.</p><p>CHANG: Similarly, you talk about the importance of increasing diversity at these companies upward mobility, is this something that you think companies can do on their own?</p><p>We know that the representation of women in minorities at tech companies is very low or is this something that the government should regulate?</p><p>KHANNA: Well, I think it's in the tech companies own advantage to expand their imagination in recruiting. Let me give you a concrete example, 45 percent of African-Americans who have STEM degrees go to a historically black college or university, 45 percent.</p><p>Now, if tech companies want to expand where there's talent, they should form partnerships with some of the best historically black colleges and universities in the country and recruit from there.</p><p>The NFL in the 1960s, the Oakland Raiders did that. They started recruiting at the HPCUs and it gave them a whole competitive advantage over the rest of the teams in the NFL.</p><p>At the time where it have such scarcity for engineers and tech talent and everyone is concern that Google and Facebook and Apple is getting all the talent, expanding the pool and going to places to like HPCUs would make a difference. Same with in -- you know, go ahead.</p><p>CHANG: But the question -- the question is whether or not they should, it's whether the government should force them to do so or legislate, you know, various requirements for representation of women in minorities in your ranks?</p><p>KHANNA: Well, I'm not for quote our government regulating that but I do think government can make investment and women's schools that focus on STEM and HPCUs in providing greater opportunities and pathways in getting incentives for corporate mentorship for women leaders.</p><p>I think government can incentivize the creation of the pipeline and in getting people in to those leadership ranks.</p><p>But I don't think they should regulate a number of that tech companies have to fill as a quote I think that will be going too far.</p><p>CHANG: All right. <person><nameText>Representative Ro Khanna, </nameText></person>thank you so much for joining us.

RO KHANNA, </nameText></person>D-CALIF.: Well, Trump was very effective in using Twitter and Facebook to get passionate support to get his message out.</p><p>But a lot of these platforms, of course, we're abused. They amplified fake voices, extreme voices that pretended to be 10,000 people even though there was only one person they've crafted in false news.</p><p>And so tech needs to help figure out how to solve some of these issues. We know it can empower individuals in extraordinary ways but we need to fix the excess that we saw in the 2016 election cycle.</p><p>CHANG: Right, you say tech tools should strengthen not weaken democracy and Russia interference aside. Someone argue that, you know, social media has dramatically increase the number of voices that are being heard. You know, can tech companies really be responsible for all of this?</p><p>KHANNA: Well, I actually think tech has played a very positive role overall. I mean, it gave a rise -- give rise to Barack Obama and to <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders.</nameText></person></p><p>I often joke at town halls that the average person could have more of a voice by having a clever tweet or Facebook posts than I can by speaking to an empty chamber in congress.</p><p>So tech has empowered individuals in extraordinary ways, but that said there are things that now that they have become a platform where almost 50 percent of Americans get their news there that they need to do.</p><p>One if having some basic differentiation between fact and opinion on newspapers, TV stations like yours have third-party verification and they independently checked facts.</p><p>There can be third-party verification on some of the posts. They should look at providing perhaps an alternative perspective if viewers want that alternative perspective.</p><p>They just need to look at what their journalistic responsibilities can be without suppressing the freedom of expression.</p><p>And I'm encouraged that the number of tech companies are doing that and that dialogue has begun.</p><p>CHANG: You wonder though how far these companies can go? How well companies can distinguish between fact and opinion when our own president may have a different opinion of the facts than the facts?</p><p>KHANNA: I agree, it's a very difficult issue. But there are independent third-party sites which can at least rate content so if some part one that's out there saying the sky is green or that, you know, Barack Obama isn't an American citizen.</p><p>They could at least have a rating and verification. Just like newspapers do, just like television stations do where they could provide a link to say, \"Here are some alternative perspectives if you saw the truth.\"</p><p>I think these tech companies -- tech company and social media is very different than television.</p><p>Television is an as interactive, people aren't responding to me. It's a broadcast, two individuals and tech is a person-to-person communication.</p><p>So tech can't be responsible for every single post in the content of every single post.</p><p>That said they do need to move towards adopting some journalistic standards of third-party verification, fact verification so they could give users an informed perspective.</p><p>CHANG: That said, I wonder how much can we rely on companies to do the right thing or whatever is in the best interest of society rather than what's in the best interest of their business.</p><p>And how much should the government actually be in charge of figuring out whether there's Russia interference on these platforms? Should there be government regulation?</p><p>KHANNA: Well, I think there are two different questions. In terms of the best interest of society, I think that was Silicon Valley's tradition with David Packard and Hewlett-Packard and some of the early founders, Andy Grove.</p><p>They talked about building technology in a way that would help society, help empower people.</p><p>And if you talk to tech leaders that's what they really hope that their platforms would help improve communication, lead to a more connected world, create more jobs.</p><p>Tim Cook recently said that business leaders have a moral responsibility to care about education and jobs.</p><p>Sundar Pichai recently announced a one billion dollar initiative to prepare folks for the tech jobs of the future.</p><p>And so I think there is an ongoing awareness with tech leaders that they have to care about their contribution to jobs in places that don't have them and to the democratic conversation.</p><p>Given that they are some of the largest companies in the nation and some of them have such great responsibility in so many viewers.</p><p>On the Russia issue, I think their -- we definitely need better intelligent sharing between tech companies and the government so that they can get advance notice if there is suspicious activity and act on it.</p><p>And tech companies need to help adapt exceptional processing to look at false accounts or bad accounts, bad actors, the way some bank (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>Some of it is hiring more people, but even if they hire a thousand of more people given the volume, they probably need investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence to be able to do some of that work.</p><p>So I'm hopeful a lot of it will be tech coming to its own conclusion but some -- there will probably be a role for congress and lawmakers as well to have constructive rules that tech can follow.</p><p>CHANG: Similarly, you talk about the importance of increasing diversity at these companies upward mobility, is this something that you think companies can do on their own?</p><p>We know that the representation of women in minorities at tech companies is very low or is this something that the government should regulate?</p><p>KHANNA: Well, I think it's in the tech companies own advantage to expand their imagination in recruiting. Let me give you a concrete example, 45 percent of African-Americans who have STEM degrees go to a historically black college or university, 45 percent.</p><p>Now, if tech companies want to expand where there's talent, they should form partnerships with some of the best historically black colleges and universities in the country and recruit from there.</p><p>The NFL in the 1960s, the Oakland Raiders did that. They started recruiting at the HPCUs and it gave them a whole competitive advantage over the rest of the teams in the NFL.</p><p>At the time where it have such scarcity for engineers and tech talent and everyone is concern that Google and Facebook and Apple is getting all the talent, expanding the pool and going to places to like HPCUs would make a difference. Same with in -- you know, go ahead.</p><p>CHANG: But the question -- the question is whether or not they should, it's whether the government should force them to do so or legislate, you know, various requirements for representation of women in minorities in your ranks?</p><p>KHANNA: Well, I'm not for quote our government regulating that but I do think government can make investment and women's schools that focus on STEM and HPCUs in providing greater opportunities and pathways in getting incentives for corporate mentorship for women leaders.</p><p>I think government can incentivize the creation of the pipeline and in getting people in to those leadership ranks.</p><p>But I don't think they should regulate a number of that tech companies have to fill as a quote I think that will be going too far.</p><p>CHANG: All right. <person><nameText>Representative Ro Khanna, </nameText></person>thank you so much for joining us.

It's  a  broadcast, two individuals and tech is a person-to-person communication.</p><p>So tech can't be responsible for every single post in the content of every  single post.</p><p>That said they do need to move towards adopting some journalistic standards  of third-party verification, fact verification so they could give users an  informed perspective.</p><p>CHANG:  That said, I wonder how much can we rely on companies to do the  right thing or whatever is in the best interest of society rather than  what's in the best interest of their business.</p><p>And how much should the government actually be in charge of figuring out  whether there's Russia interference on these platforms?  Should there be  government regulation?</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, I think there are two different questions.  In terms of the  best interest of society, I think that was Silicon Valley's tradition with  David Packard and Hewlett-Packard and some of the early founders, Andy  Grove.</p><p>They talked about building technology in a way that would help society,  help empower people.</p><p>And if you talk to tech leaders that's what they really hope that their  platforms would help improve communication, lead to a more connected world,  create more jobs.</p><p>Tim Cook recently said that business leaders have a moral responsibility to  care about education and jobs.</p><p>Sundar Pichai recently announced a one billion dollar initiative to prepare  folks for the tech jobs of the future.</p><p>And so I think there is an ongoing awareness with tech leaders that they  have to care about their contribution to jobs in places that don't have  them and to the democratic conversation.</p><p>Given that they are some of the largest companies in the nation and some of  them have such great responsibility in so many viewers.</p><p>On the Russia issue, I think their -- we definitely need better intelligent  sharing between tech companies and the government so that they can get  advance notice if there is suspicious activity and act on it.</p><p>And tech companies need to help adapt exceptional processing to look at  false accounts or bad accounts, bad actors, the way some bank (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>Some of it is hiring more people, but even if they hire a thousand of more  people given the volume, they probably need investments in machine learning  and artificial intelligence to be able to do some of that work.</p><p>So I'm hopeful a lot of it will be tech coming to its own conclusion but  some -- there will probably be a role for congress and lawmakers as well to  have constructive rules that tech can follow.</p><p>CHANG:  Similarly, you talk about the importance of increasing diversity at  these companies upward mobility, is this something that you think companies  can do on their own?</p><p>We know that the representation of women in minorities at tech companies is  very low or is this something that the government should regulate?</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, I think it's in the tech companies own advantage to expand  their imagination in recruiting.  Let me give you a concrete example, 45  percent of African-Americans who have STEM degrees go to a historically  black college or university, 45 percent.</p><p>Now, if tech companies want to expand where there's talent, they should  form partnerships with some of the best historically black colleges and  universities in the country and recruit from there.</p><p>The NFL in the 1960s, the Oakland Raiders did that.  They started  recruiting at the HPCUs and it gave them a whole competitive advantage over  the rest of the teams in the NFL.</p><p>At the time where it have such scarcity for engineers and tech talent and  everyone is concern that Google and Facebook and Apple is getting all the  talent, expanding the pool and going to places to like HPCUs would make a  difference.  Same with in -- you know, go ahead.</p><p>CHANG:  But the question -- the question is whether or not they should,  it's whether the government should force them to do so or legislate, you  know, various requirements for representation of women in minorities in  your ranks?</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, I'm not for quote our government regulating that but I do  think government can make investment and women's schools that focus on STEM  and HPCUs in providing greater opportunities and pathways in getting  incentives for corporate mentorship for women leaders.</p><p>I think government can incentivize the creation of the pipeline and in  getting people in to those leadership ranks.</p><p>But I don't think they should regulate a number of that tech companies have  to fill as a quote I think that will be going too far.</p><p>CHANG:  All right.  Representative Ro Khanna, thank you so much for joining  us.  Great to have you here on the show.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Phil and Jackie's colleaguesat \"The Washington Post\" report that President Trump and his alliesare working to block more than 20 separate investigations byDemocrats into his actions as president, his personal finances, andhis administration's policies.</p><p>House Democrats say the Trump administration has failed torespond to or comply with at least 79 requests for documents orother information. The president is blocking aides from testifying,refusing entire document requests from some committees, filinglawsuits against corporations to bar them from responding tosubpoenas, and asserting executive privilege to keep informationabout the special counsel's Russia investigation out of public view.And one of the points that the piece makes is that somecongressional experts fear the strategy could undermine theinstitutional power of Congress for years to come.</p><p>But, Congressman Khanna, what is the strategy here forDemocrats as you simply watch the president refuse request afterrequest after request and subpoena after subpoena?</p><p>REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA):  Well, Kasie, it's an assault on the ideaof separation of powers. Look, every administration pushes backagainst Congress. That's normal and you have these fights. But noadministration denies every single request. That's what's going onhere. They are simply refusing to recognize Congress' role ofoversight.</p><p>There is only one thing we can do, and that's the courts.</p><p>HUNT:  Is there a risk there? I mean, what is the kind ofthinking behind the scenes as to how to approach that withoutgetting a court decision that stops you in your tracks?</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, I think the courts will rule clearly for us,because the law is clear. Unless there is national security atstake, when there are issues of obstruction or corrupt action in theexecutive branch, the Congress has clear ability to get thesedocuments. And I think courts are ruling expeditiously. We just hadthe D.C. court -- a court in D.C. say that they aren't going tostonewall. So, I expect that the courts will rule for us, andthey'll rule expeditiously.</p><p>HUNT:  Juanita, you kind of worked in the Center for AmericanProgress which is very in touch, of course, with the base of theDemocratic Party. What's your view of how Democrats in Congressare kind of going about this and whether they should be moreaggressive than perhaps they're being?</p><p>JUANITA TOLLIVER, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS FUND CAMPAIGNDIRECTOR:  I mean, Democrats in Congress are operating off themandate in which they retook the house from voters overwhelminglysupporting Democrats in the midterms in 2018. And so, they'reactually really doing a great job of conducting that oversight. Ofcourse, there is tension on how far to go, but I think recentpolling showed that a lot of Democratic voters really want to waitfor additional evidence. They want the oversight to run its course.</p><p>And so I think it's really falling in line with what we've seenfrom Speaker Pelosi and Democratic leadership on Congress that hey,steady the course. Let's tow that line because let's not -- we'renot going to fall into the trap that Trump wants us to by pullingthe ultimate card of impeachment.</p><p>HUNT:  Jackie, I mean, Pelosi said this week that the presidentis trying to goad Democrats into impeachment. But at the same time,they seem to be moving the line a little bit, closer and closer.</p><p>JACKIE ALEMANY, AUTHOR, \"POWER UP\" NEWSLETTER, THE WASHINGTONPOST:  That's exactly right. Over the past few weeks, where you havereally seen Pelosi's position evolve here. She was prettyconservative at first, and now, she's using terms likeself-impeachment and goading.</p><p>But if you notice that language really puts the burden back onthe president because I think she still is hesitant here. There isimmense frustration amongst Democrats. I'm sure you can speakbetter to that than I can, but, you know, there is clearly an issueenforcement mechanisms working here.</p><p>And, you know, at the end of the day, this is a fight that thepresident wants to be having. He'd much rather be talk aboutfighting these oversight battles than talking about, you know, thecrises going on in Venezuela, China, North Korea, Iran, and Russia.</p><p>HUNT:  Is that -- I mean, is that sort of the thinking behindthe scenes here, Phil, that this is good ground for the president tobe on to solidify his base?</p><p>PHIL RUCKER, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST:  Absolutely, because hecan make himself the victim and the persecuted, and he can arguethat the Democrats are reaching beyond what is reasonable in theCongress to investigate him, and to try to force him out of officesomehow.</p><p>HUNT:  We are losing our light here is in our studio. Sorry,Phil. We didn't mean to interrupt you. I think we're still on theair. But to all of our viewers who are now watching us in the dark,I sincerely apologize.</p><p>All right. I think we're back. So, we'll keep going. I know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUNT:  Better look out. Maybe there is dragons outside thestudio somewhere.</p><p>Phil, I'm so sorry you were interrupted. Please continue.</p><p>RUCKER:  One thing we should really keep in mind, though, is thescope and breadth of these investigations. There are 20investigations. It's not just about Russia and obstruction ofjustice and interference in the election, but it's looking into thesecurity clearance process at the White House. You know, how is itthat Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump got their security clearancesdespite the objections of career staff?</p><p>It's looking into the president's personal finances, his taxreturns. Who does he owe money to? Where is that money coming from?These are accountability measures that were missing in the first twoyears of the administration because the Republicans controlled bothhouses of Congress. And the Democrats are trying to catch up.</p><p>HUNT:  Congressman, I mean, what -- how far would you say thisline is moving? I mean, is your caucus in general when you guys gettogether behind the scenes -- I mean, Nancy Pelosi has her finger onthe pulse of that.</p><p>KHANNA:  She does.</p><p>HUNT:  You know, unlike anyone. And to hear her moving in thisdirection tells me there is something building inside your caucus.How strong is it at this point?</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, there is greater and greater frustration. I mean,there was first frustration when the ten counts of obstruction weredetailed. Then there is frustration when the president refuses tocomply with anything and is basically insulting members of Congressand our constitutional duty.</p><p>But Nancy Pelosi is very clear. The speaker believes we need tohave public sentiment with us, and we are to make that case. And shewill move when public sentiment moves. She quotes Abraham Lincolnall the time. Public sentiment is everything.</p><p>So, she is -- anyone who knows her knows how she is looking atthis. She wants to build a case and then she is going to see wherepublic sentiment is.</p><p>HUNT:  I mean, Jackie, what's your sense of -- I mean, having-- I know you look at the polling when you put together yournewsletter and all that. I mean, public sentiment has not movedtowards -- in favor of impeachment.</p><p>ALEMANY:  No, it hasn't. And you even have people like SenatorSanders who are saying to voters on the campaign trail, even thoughhe's -- you know, he's trying to fund-raise off the Muellerreport, he's saying to voters, when we're talking about Mueller,when we're talking about all of these oversight pushes, we're nottalking about health care and issues that affect the American peopleon a consistent basis.</p><p>And so, I think Speaker Pelosi does realize that the more timeeveryone is spending, the more air time everyone is spending ontalking about these fights feeds into what the president is talkingabout, it helps distract from issues of health care -- trade, taxissues, of potentially repealing the president's tax bill.</p><p>HUNT:  We get that bombshell \"New York Times\" report on thepresident's finances. The push for more details is also going on.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  In his mind, he is wildlysuccessful. That's part of his branding, is to be bigger than life.By any reasonable definition, he is successful. He is the presidentof the United States. He owns a bunch of golf courses that are a lotof fun to play. So, the American people figure out about what theywant to believe or not believe about Donald Trump and his marketing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT:  On Tuesday, a federal judge is expected to rule onwhether the president can put a stop to a House subpoena demandingfinancial records from his personal accounting firm. And the waysand means committee issued subpoenas Friday to Treasury SecretarySteve Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig by this comingFriday.</p><p>Over the weekend, the president reflected on the politicaloptics of it all, tweeting, quote:  I won the 2016 election partiallybased on no tax returns while I'm under audit, which I still am,and the voters don't care making it a part of the 2020 election.</p><p>And here is what the IRS commissioner said one month ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. SANFORD BISHOP (D-GA):  But there is no rule that wouldprohibit the release of a tax return because it's under audit.</p><p>CHARLES RETTIG, IRS COMMISSIONER:  I'm not aware of such arule. And I believe I've answered that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT:  And let's just be clear in terms of fact checking thepresident, Juanita, that, first of all, presidents are auditedregularly. And yet we still see tax returns from past residents and,of course, the IRS commissioner did some fact checking for us theresaying there is nothing preventing this. But at the same time, itdoesn't necessarily seem as those Democrats have a clear pathforward to actually getting these released.</p><p>TOLLIVER:  Well, I think the clear path forward is what they'redoing already, issue the subpoena, make the request, because whatthey've done now is looped in the IRS commissioner who is notbeholden to Trump the way Mnuchin is. And so, it's really callingon people further down the chain of command. Hey, are you reallygoing to put yourself on the line, put your future on the line toprotect a president who is hiding something at this point, and folkshave reason to believe?</p><p>And I think also in terms of public opinion on this, in pollsover the last four to six weeks, there is shown that the majority ofAmericans do believe that Trump should release his tax returns. Ithink Democrats have that going in their favor too.</p><p>HUNT:  Phil, what of these is the most dangerous for thepresident? I mean, is Democrats going after his tax returns, thebiggest, you know, non-Russia problem that he has coming from theHill or not?</p><p>RUCKER:  You know, it might be the most embarrassing problem forhim so far as if the returns from the more recent years show thatthe 10-year span that \"The New York Times\" reported on, it wouldshow that the president is not as rich as he says he is, and that hehad a lot of losses and is not the grand golden success that he haspitched himself to the American people as. But I don't know thatthat's politically that dangerous for him, or legally that'sdangerous for him.</p><p>If I were President Trump, I would be much more concerned aboutpeople like Don McGahn coming in to an open forum and testifying onany number of issues where the president could be implicated, andnot only bad behavior, but obstruction of justice or other criminalbehavior.</p><p>HUNT:  Yes, the kicker of that \"New York Times\" report about histax returns, about how he said it was difficult to make money inreal estate. But his father never lost any money except when heinvested in his son.</p><p>Anyway, Phil Rucker, thanks so much for being here. We're sorryagain about the lights.</p><p>Everyone else is going to stay with us.</p><p>So, you have heard this week calls to break up Facebook, evenfrom one of the company's founders. Now it is turning into a wedgefor 2020 candidates in what has been a pretty tame election cyclejust got a little more heated.</p><p>Plus, her identity as a covert CIA agent was leaked during theBush administration to settle a political score against her husband.Now, Valerie Plame is running for Congress. She joins me live aheadon KASIE DC.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HUNT:  The battle over big tech's accountability problem is nowspilling into the presidential race and pitting 2020 Democratsagainst each other. Senator Cory Booker is making clear he doesn'tthink breaking up tech giants, which Elizabeth Warren has proposed,is a solution. But it's how Booker describes his disagreement withWarren's proposal that turned heads.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I don't thinkthat a president should be running around pointing at companies atcompanies and say breaking them up without any kind of process here.It's not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks.That sounds like a Donald Trump thing to say. I'm going to breakup you guys.</p><p>No. We need to create systems and processes.</p><p>INTERVIEWER:  You just compared Elizabeth Warren to DonaldTrump?</p><p>BOOKER:  I most certainly did not. She's my friend --</p><p>INTERVIEWER:  That's what she's saying. She's the onethat's saying that.</p><p>BOOKER:  Well, again, she has -- let her discuss and debate herpositions. I'm telling you right now, we do not need a presidentthat is going to use their own personal beliefs and tell you whichcompanies we should break up. We need a president who is going toenforce antitrust laws in this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT:  The call to reduce the power of big tech grew loud theirweek when Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes called the company,quote, dangerous. Hughes wrote in a \"New York Times\" op-ed that thegovernment must, quote, break up Facebook's monopoly.</p><p>And this morning, Senator Kamala Harris was also asked to weighin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  There is noquestion in my mind that there needs to be serious regulation, andthat has not been happening there needs to be more oversight thathas not been happening.</p><p>INTERVIEWER:  You think they should be broken up?</p><p>HARRIS:  Yes, I think we have to seriously take a look at that,yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT:  Quite some comments from Cory Booker.</p><p>Congressman, I know you represent Silicon Valley. So, I want toget your take on this in a minute.</p><p>But, Jackie, just to kind of look at this from the lens of CoryBooker essentially calling Elizabeth Warren Trumpian in her kind ofattack on this on Facebook. At the same time, I mean, it isn't justany random company that she might have a personal vendetta against.</p><p>ALEMANY:  No, it's not. And this has been Elizabeth Warren'spretty consistent position. It is really interesting as the campaignprogresses to finally see positions, different positions betweencandidates in the Democratic Party differentiating from themselves.Cory Booker sort of, you know, appearing to take actually the sidesof corporations a little bit more than Elizabeth Warren, which Ithink is a standpoint that you could have surmised from theirpositions in Congress.</p><p>But, you know, they both are part of a Congress that has failedreally to regulate Facebook over the last few years, and I thinkboth of them really need to grapple with their role in that. Youknow, France just finished their review in which the governmentconducted a six-month review internally in Facebook overseeing howtheir regulatory processes work and actually provided a report whichZuckerberg praised. And so, I don't think these two things, breakingup Facebook and increasing regulation are necessarily mutuallyexclusive.</p><p>HUNT:  Yes, Congressman, to that point about Congress -- I mean,do you think that the United States Congress is equipped to regulatethese big tech companies, specifically Facebook? Are they capable ofit?</p><p>KHANNA:  We need to have more technology and knowledge. But weneed to look to the Microsoft case. I think that was an example thatworked, that government went after Microsoft. They said you couldn'ttie Internet Explorer to Windows. If you had done that, theMicrosoft --</p><p>HUNT:  We would all have to use Internet Explorer and our liveswould be way harder and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KHANNA:  Google would never have emerged, right? But it went tothe D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit said you don't have breakthem up. You need to make sure they can't do bad mergers, they can'tbe privileging their own platforms. So, there may be kind of ground.</p><p>I do think Elizabeth Warren has added a lot to the debate. Imean, she has called for stronger, thoughtful regulation. Thequestion is, how do we get there? And I think the Microsoft caseoffers the paradigm.</p><p>HUNT:  I'm going to put you a little bit on the spot here.</p><p>KHANNA:  Sure.</p><p>HUNT:  And I will admit that, you know, I'm not intimatelyfamiliar with where Bernie Sanders stands on this question. But youare co-chair of his campaign. Where does he fall on the spectrum ofthese 2020 candidates?</p><p>KHANNA:  I haven't asked him specifically. He usually focuses onWall Street and defense contractors and airline industries. I mean,I don't know his exact position on this. But I do know when he talksabout technology, he often talks about how do we get universalbroadband, how do we get technology into rural communities and jobsthere. But you'd have to ask him or his campaign --</p><p>HUNT:  Well, you are his campaign. That's why I'm asking you.</p><p>KHANNA:  I'm one of his co-chairs. I don't want to -- Idon't want to misrepresent his nuanced view on this without talkingto him about it.</p><p>HUNT:  So, when it comes to the idea of breaking up Facebook, Imean, I think a lot of people, sort of, you know, Chris Hughesreally turned heads because to explore your Microsoft analogy alittle further, I mean, you're talking about a centralization ofpower that is much different from a company that is sellingcomputers and softwares to consumers, right? You're instead talkingabout the fact that because all these people are using thisplatform, the platform itself has immense power.</p><p>How do you actually -- I mean, you must have to take steps thatare slightly different than what happened in the Microsoft case toactually make it work.</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, I think if you had scrutiny on mergers, right, Ithought they shouldn't have been allowed to acquire Instagram. Ithought they shouldn't have been allowed to acquire WhatsApp. And ifyou have different social media platforms, then you a choice.</p><p>I mean, I don't think it's the end of the world if someonedoesn't use Facebook. It would be the end of the world if someonedidn't have access to the Internet. That's why Facebook is autility. It's not like water or electricity.</p><p>HUNT:  Well, for a lot of small businesses, it does serve apurpose like a utility does.</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, I think that there have to be regulations so thatthey shouldn't be able to privilege their own products, theyshouldn't be able to bully vendors.</p><p>HUNT:  They certainly bully the news industry in some cases aswell.</p><p>KHANNA:  And I think that should be looked at. But what we haveto do is have a fact-based investigation and then have thoughtfulregulation on privacy, on making sure that they're not privilegingtheir platform, on making sure they're not getting a favorable dealagainst vendors.</p><p>But here is -- you say well, why not just break them up? Thereare two reasons. One, you don't want China, Alibaba, Tencent andBaidu to become the social media platforms around the world. I mean,there is some competition there and --</p><p>HUNT:  Do you think Facebook views itself as fundamentallyAmerican? Because sometimes when I talk to my sources who workthere, they view themselves more as a global company than anAmerican one. I mean, how important do you think that Americanidentity is to Mark Zuckerberg?</p><p>KHANNA:  I think they know they are an American company becausethey would never have succeeded under Chinese or European laws. Imean, it's the American First Amendment and Section 230 thatallowed a lot of these Internet companies to emerge. They aren'tcensored. They have a much more competitive environment than Europeallows.</p><p>So, I think they understand that their success, they owed it toAmerica, and they want to make sure some of those values continue.</p><p>Now, do they need to be more accountable? Absolutely. They needto do a better job to prevent interference from foreign actors. Theyneed to do a better job to protect privacy. They need to do a betterjob to create jobs and not just in my district, but across thecountry.</p><p>They need to hire more people of color. It's dismal what thehiring is of African Americans, African-American women.</p><p>So there are a lot of issues we can talk about. But we alsoshould look at their success. The #MeToo movement wouldn't havehappened in the extent it did without Facebook. Black Lives Matterused Facebook. Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, they alluse Facebook.</p><p>You know, Josh Hawley, the senator from Missouri, criticizingTitter saying we don't need it. Well, why don't you get off theplatforms then? Of course the social media platforms have beencritical to democracy. We need to make sure that they're doing it ina positive way.</p><p>HUNT:  Well, it seems like the question whether they havefundamentally, Juanita, undermined democracy by empoweringauthoritarians and misinformation.</p><p>TOLLIVER:  I think that's exactly right. With 2020 electioncoming up, all sorts of alarm bells are going off. Will our electionbe interfered in through this platform of Facebook, something that Ithink there has been a lot of evidence of? So how are user databeing protected? How are consumers being protected, folks like youand me who use these platforms?</p><p>I think the other thing here is these candidates, while they'reon a spectrum, still belief in those same fundamental components,protect consumer data, ensure innovation in the industry and makesure that this platform is working for the American good.</p><p>HUNT:  All right. Congressman Ro Khanna, thank you very much forcoming on.</p><p>KHANNA:  Thank you.</p><p>HUNT:  It was always great, this particular conversation, it'svery interesting to have with you.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

RO KHANNA, D-CA</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PHILIP RUCKER, WASHINGTON POST</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JUANITA TOLLIVER, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JACKIE ALEMANY, WASHINGTON POST</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KASIE HUNT, MSNBC</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]     KASIE HUNT, MSNBC HOST:  Welcome to the second hour of KASIE DC.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining me here on set:  a member of the House OversightCommittee and co-chair of Senator Bernie Sanders's presidentialcampaign, Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna of California,\"Washington Post\" White House bureau chief and MSNBC politicalanalyst Philip Rucker, campaign director for the Center for AmericanProgress Action Fund, Juanita Tolliver, and author of \"TheWashington Post's\" \"Power Up\" newsletter, Jackie Alemany.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In real-time and full public view, Congress and the White Houseare testing the limits of their power. Phil and Jackie's colleaguesat \"The Washington Post\" report that President Trump and his alliesare working to block more than 20 separate investigations byDemocrats into his actions as president, his personal finances, andhis administration's policies.</p><p>House Democrats say the Trump administration has failed torespond to or comply with at least 79 requests for documents orother information. The president is blocking aides from testifying,refusing entire document requests from some committees, filinglawsuits against corporations to bar them from responding tosubpoenas, and asserting executive privilege to keep informationabout the special counsel's Russia investigation out of public view.And one of the points that the piece makes is that somecongressional experts fear the strategy could undermine theinstitutional power of Congress for years to come.</p><p>But, Congressman Khanna, what is the strategy here forDemocrats as you simply watch the president refuse request afterrequest after request and subpoena after subpoena?</p><p>REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA):  Well, Kasie, it's an assault on the ideaof separation of powers. Look, every administration pushes backagainst Congress. That's normal and you have these fights. But noadministration denies every single request. That's what's going onhere. They are simply refusing to recognize Congress' role ofoversight.</p><p>There is only one thing we can do, and that's the courts.</p><p>HUNT:  Is there a risk there? I mean, what is the kind ofthinking behind the scenes as to how to approach that withoutgetting a court decision that stops you in your tracks?</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, I think the courts will rule clearly for us,because the law is clear. Unless there is national security atstake, when there are issues of obstruction or corrupt action in theexecutive branch, the Congress has clear ability to get thesedocuments. And I think courts are ruling expeditiously. We just hadthe D.C. court -- a court in D.C. say that they aren't going tostonewall. So, I expect that the courts will rule for us, andthey'll rule expeditiously.</p><p>HUNT:  Juanita, you kind of worked in the Center for AmericanProgress which is very in touch, of course, with the base of theDemocratic Party. What's your view of how Democrats in Congressare kind of going about this and whether they should be moreaggressive than perhaps they're being?</p><p>JUANITA TOLLIVER, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS FUND CAMPAIGNDIRECTOR:  I mean, Democrats in Congress are operating off themandate in which they retook the house from voters overwhelminglysupporting Democrats in the midterms in 2018. And so, they'reactually really doing a great job of conducting that oversight. Ofcourse, there is tension on how far to go, but I think recentpolling showed that a lot of Democratic voters really want to waitfor additional evidence. They want the oversight to run its course.</p><p>And so I think it's really falling in line with what we've seenfrom Speaker Pelosi and Democratic leadership on Congress that hey,steady the course. Let's tow that line because let's not -- we'renot going to fall into the trap that Trump wants us to by pullingthe ultimate card of impeachment.</p><p>HUNT:  Jackie, I mean, Pelosi said this week that the presidentis trying to goad Democrats into impeachment. But at the same time,they seem to be moving the line a little bit, closer and closer.</p><p>JACKIE ALEMANY, AUTHOR, \"POWER UP\" NEWSLETTER, THE WASHINGTONPOST:  That's exactly right. Over the past few weeks, where you havereally seen Pelosi's position evolve here. She was prettyconservative at first, and now, she's using terms likeself-impeachment and goading.</p><p>But if you notice that language really puts the burden back onthe president because I think she still is hesitant here. There isimmense frustration amongst Democrats. I'm sure you can speakbetter to that than I can, but, you know, there is clearly an issueenforcement mechanisms working here.</p><p>And, you know, at the end of the day, this is a fight that thepresident wants to be having. He'd much rather be talk aboutfighting these oversight battles than talking about, you know, thecrises going on in Venezuela, China, North Korea, Iran, and Russia.</p><p>HUNT:  Is that -- I mean, is that sort of the thinking behindthe scenes here, Phil, that this is good ground for the president tobe on to solidify his base?</p><p>PHIL RUCKER, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST:  Absolutely, because hecan make himself the victim and the persecuted, and he can arguethat the Democrats are reaching beyond what is reasonable in theCongress to investigate him, and to try to force him out of officesomehow.</p><p>HUNT:  We are losing our light here is in our studio. Sorry,Phil. We didn't mean to interrupt you. I think we're still on theair. But to all of our viewers who are now watching us in the dark,I sincerely apologize.</p><p>All right. I think we're back. So, we'll keep going. I know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUNT:  Better look out. Maybe there is dragons outside thestudio somewhere.</p><p>Phil, I'm so sorry you were interrupted. Please continue.</p><p>RUCKER:  One thing we should really keep in mind, though, is thescope and breadth of these investigations. There are 20investigations. It's not just about Russia and obstruction ofjustice and interference in the election, but it's looking into thesecurity clearance process at the White House. You know, how is itthat Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump got their security clearancesdespite the objections of career staff?</p><p>It's looking into the president's personal finances, his taxreturns. Who does he owe money to? Where is that money coming from?These are accountability measures that were missing in the first twoyears of the administration because the Republicans controlled bothhouses of Congress. And the Democrats are trying to catch up.</p><p>HUNT:  Congressman, I mean, what -- how far would you say thisline is moving? I mean, is your caucus in general when you guys gettogether behind the scenes -- I mean, Nancy Pelosi has her finger onthe pulse of that.</p><p>KHANNA:  She does.</p><p>HUNT:  You know, unlike anyone. And to hear her moving in thisdirection tells me there is something building inside your caucus.How strong is it at this point?</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, there is greater and greater frustration. I mean,there was first frustration when the ten counts of obstruction weredetailed. Then there is frustration when the president refuses tocomply with anything and is basically insulting members of Congressand our constitutional duty.</p><p>But Nancy Pelosi is very clear. The speaker believes we need tohave public sentiment with us, and we are to make that case. And shewill move when public sentiment moves. She quotes Abraham Lincolnall the time. Public sentiment is everything.</p><p>So, she is -- anyone who knows her knows how she is looking atthis. She wants to build a case and then she is going to see wherepublic sentiment is.</p><p>HUNT:  I mean, Jackie, what's your sense of -- I mean, having-- I know you look at the polling when you put together yournewsletter and all that. I mean, public sentiment has not movedtowards -- in favor of impeachment.</p><p>ALEMANY:  No, it hasn't. And you even have people like SenatorSanders who are saying to voters on the campaign trail, even thoughhe's -- you know, he's trying to fund-raise off the Muellerreport, he's saying to voters, when we're talking about Mueller,when we're talking about all of these oversight pushes, we're nottalking about health care and issues that affect the American peopleon a consistent basis.</p><p>And so, I think Speaker Pelosi does realize that the more timeeveryone is spending, the more air time everyone is spending ontalking about these fights feeds into what the president is talkingabout, it helps distract from issues of health care -- trade, taxissues, of potentially repealing the president's tax bill.</p><p>HUNT:  We get that bombshell \"New York Times\" report on thepresident's finances. The push for more details is also going on.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  In his mind, he is wildlysuccessful. That's part of his branding, is to be bigger than life.By any reasonable definition, he is successful. He is the presidentof the United States. He owns a bunch of golf courses that are a lotof fun to play. So, the American people figure out about what theywant to believe or not believe about Donald Trump and his marketing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT:  On Tuesday, a federal judge is expected to rule onwhether the president can put a stop to a House subpoena demandingfinancial records from his personal accounting firm. And the waysand means committee issued subpoenas Friday to Treasury SecretarySteve Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig by this comingFriday.</p><p>Over the weekend, the president reflected on the politicaloptics of it all, tweeting, quote:  I won the 2016 election partiallybased on no tax returns while I'm under audit, which I still am,and the voters don't care making it a part of the 2020 election.</p><p>And here is what the IRS commissioner said one month ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. SANFORD BISHOP (D-GA):  But there is no rule that wouldprohibit the release of a tax return because it's under audit.</p><p>CHARLES RETTIG, IRS COMMISSIONER:  I'm not aware of such arule. And I believe I've answered that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT:  And let's just be clear in terms of fact checking thepresident, Juanita, that, first of all, presidents are auditedregularly. And yet we still see tax returns from past residents and,of course, the IRS commissioner did some fact checking for us theresaying there is nothing preventing this. But at the same time, itdoesn't necessarily seem as those Democrats have a clear pathforward to actually getting these released.</p><p>TOLLIVER:  Well, I think the clear path forward is what they'redoing already, issue the subpoena, make the request, because whatthey've done now is looped in the IRS commissioner who is notbeholden to Trump the way Mnuchin is. And so, it's really callingon people further down the chain of command. Hey, are you reallygoing to put yourself on the line, put your future on the line toprotect a president who is hiding something at this point, and folkshave reason to believe?</p><p>And I think also in terms of public opinion on this, in pollsover the last four to six weeks, there is shown that the majority ofAmericans do believe that Trump should release his tax returns. Ithink Democrats have that going in their favor too.</p><p>HUNT:  Phil, what of these is the most dangerous for thepresident? I mean, is Democrats going after his tax returns, thebiggest, you know, non-Russia problem that he has coming from theHill or not?</p><p>RUCKER:  You know, it might be the most embarrassing problem forhim so far as if the returns from the more recent years show thatthe 10-year span that \"The New York Times\" reported on, it wouldshow that the president is not as rich as he says he is, and that hehad a lot of losses and is not the grand golden success that he haspitched himself to the American people as. But I don't know thatthat's politically that dangerous for him, or legally that'sdangerous for him.</p><p>If I were President Trump, I would be much more concerned aboutpeople like Don McGahn coming in to an open forum and testifying onany number of issues where the president could be implicated, andnot only bad behavior, but obstruction of justice or other criminalbehavior.</p><p>HUNT:  Yes, the kicker of that \"New York Times\" report about histax returns, about how he said it was difficult to make money inreal estate. But his father never lost any money except when heinvested in his son.</p><p>Anyway, Phil Rucker, thanks so much for being here. We're sorryagain about the lights.</p><p>Everyone else is going to stay with us.</p><p>So, you have heard this week calls to break up Facebook, evenfrom one of the company's founders. Now it is turning into a wedgefor 2020 candidates in what has been a pretty tame election cyclejust got a little more heated.</p><p>Plus, her identity as a covert CIA agent was leaked during theBush administration to settle a political score against her husband.Now, Valerie Plame is running for Congress. She joins me live aheadon KASIE DC.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HUNT:  The battle over big tech's accountability problem is nowspilling into the presidential race and pitting 2020 Democratsagainst each other. Senator Cory Booker is making clear he doesn'tthink breaking up tech giants, which Elizabeth Warren has proposed,is a solution. But it's how Booker describes his disagreement withWarren's proposal that turned heads.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I don't thinkthat a president should be running around pointing at companies atcompanies and say breaking them up without any kind of process here.It's not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks.That sounds like a Donald Trump thing to say. I'm going to breakup you guys.</p><p>No. We need to create systems and processes.</p><p>INTERVIEWER:  You just compared Elizabeth Warren to DonaldTrump?</p><p>BOOKER:  I most certainly did not. She's my friend --</p><p>INTERVIEWER:  That's what she's saying. She's the onethat's saying that.</p><p>BOOKER:  Well, again, she has -- let her discuss and debate herpositions. I'm telling you right now, we do not need a presidentthat is going to use their own personal beliefs and tell you whichcompanies we should break up. We need a president who is going toenforce antitrust laws in this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT:  The call to reduce the power of big tech grew loud theirweek when Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes called the company,quote, dangerous. Hughes wrote in a \"New York Times\" op-ed that thegovernment must, quote, break up Facebook's monopoly.</p><p>And this morning, Senator Kamala Harris was also asked to weighin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  There is noquestion in my mind that there needs to be serious regulation, andthat has not been happening there needs to be more oversight thathas not been happening.</p><p>INTERVIEWER:  You think they should be broken up?</p><p>HARRIS:  Yes, I think we have to seriously take a look at that,yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT:  Quite some comments from Cory Booker.</p><p>Congressman, I know you represent Silicon Valley. So, I want toget your take on this in a minute.</p><p>But, Jackie, just to kind of look at this from the lens of CoryBooker essentially calling Elizabeth Warren Trumpian in her kind ofattack on this on Facebook. At the same time, I mean, it isn't justany random company that she might have a personal vendetta against.</p><p>ALEMANY:  No, it's not. And this has been Elizabeth Warren'spretty consistent position. It is really interesting as the campaignprogresses to finally see positions, different positions betweencandidates in the Democratic Party differentiating from themselves.Cory Booker sort of, you know, appearing to take actually the sidesof corporations a little bit more than Elizabeth Warren, which Ithink is a standpoint that you could have surmised from theirpositions in Congress.</p><p>But, you know, they both are part of a Congress that has failedreally to regulate Facebook over the last few years, and I thinkboth of them really need to grapple with their role in that. Youknow, France just finished their review in which the governmentconducted a six-month review internally in Facebook overseeing howtheir regulatory processes work and actually provided a report whichZuckerberg praised. And so, I don't think these two things, breakingup Facebook and increasing regulation are necessarily mutuallyexclusive.</p><p>HUNT:  Yes, Congressman, to that point about Congress -- I mean,do you think that the United States Congress is equipped to regulatethese big tech companies, specifically Facebook? Are they capable ofit?</p><p>KHANNA:  We need to have more technology and knowledge. But weneed to look to the Microsoft case. I think that was an example thatworked, that government went after Microsoft. They said you couldn'ttie Internet Explorer to Windows. If you had done that, theMicrosoft --</p><p>HUNT:  We would all have to use Internet Explorer and our liveswould be way harder and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KHANNA:  Google would never have emerged, right? But it went tothe D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit said you don't have breakthem up. You need to make sure they can't do bad mergers, they can'tbe privileging their own platforms. So, there may be kind of ground.</p><p>I do think Elizabeth Warren has added a lot to the debate. Imean, she has called for stronger, thoughtful regulation. Thequestion is, how do we get there? And I think the Microsoft caseoffers the paradigm.</p><p>HUNT:  I'm going to put you a little bit on the spot here.</p><p>KHANNA:  Sure.</p><p>HUNT:  And I will admit that, you know, I'm not intimatelyfamiliar with where Bernie Sanders stands on this question. But youare co-chair of his campaign. Where does he fall on the spectrum ofthese 2020 candidates?</p><p>KHANNA:  I haven't asked him specifically. He usually focuses onWall Street and defense contractors and airline industries. I mean,I don't know his exact position on this. But I do know when he talksabout technology, he often talks about how do we get universalbroadband, how do we get technology into rural communities and jobsthere. But you'd have to ask him or his campaign --</p><p>HUNT:  Well, you are his campaign. That's why I'm asking you.</p><p>KHANNA:  I'm one of his co-chairs. I don't want to -- Idon't want to misrepresent his nuanced view on this without talkingto him about it.</p><p>HUNT:  So, when it comes to the idea of breaking up Facebook, Imean, I think a lot of people, sort of, you know, Chris Hughesreally turned heads because to explore your Microsoft analogy alittle further, I mean, you're talking about a centralization ofpower that is much different from a company that is sellingcomputers and softwares to consumers, right? You're instead talkingabout the fact that because all these people are using thisplatform, the platform itself has immense power.</p><p>How do you actually -- I mean, you must have to take steps thatare slightly different than what happened in the Microsoft case toactually make it work.</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, I think if you had scrutiny on mergers, right, Ithought they shouldn't have been allowed to acquire Instagram. Ithought they shouldn't have been allowed to acquire WhatsApp. And ifyou have different social media platforms, then you a choice.</p><p>I mean, I don't think it's the end of the world if someonedoesn't use Facebook. It would be the end of the world if someonedidn't have access to the Internet. That's why Facebook is autility. It's not like water or electricity.</p><p>HUNT:  Well, for a lot of small businesses, it does serve apurpose like a utility does.</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, I think that there have to be regulations so thatthey shouldn't be able to privilege their own products, theyshouldn't be able to bully vendors.</p><p>HUNT:  They certainly bully the news industry in some cases aswell.</p><p>KHANNA:  And I think that should be looked at. But what we haveto do is have a fact-based investigation and then have thoughtfulregulation on privacy, on making sure that they're not privilegingtheir platform, on making sure they're not getting a favorable dealagainst vendors.</p><p>But here is -- you say well, why not just break them up? Thereare two reasons. One, you don't want China, Alibaba, Tencent andBaidu to become the social media platforms around the world. I mean,there is some competition there and --</p><p>HUNT:  Do you think Facebook views itself as fundamentallyAmerican? Because sometimes when I talk to my sources who workthere, they view themselves more as a global company than anAmerican one. I mean, how important do you think that Americanidentity is to Mark Zuckerberg?</p><p>KHANNA:  I think they know they are an American company becausethey would never have succeeded under Chinese or European laws. Imean, it's the American First Amendment and Section 230 thatallowed a lot of these Internet companies to emerge. They aren'tcensored. They have a much more competitive environment than Europeallows.</p><p>So, I think they understand that their success, they owed it toAmerica, and they want to make sure some of those values continue.</p><p>Now, do they need to be more accountable? Absolutely. They needto do a better job to prevent interference from foreign actors. Theyneed to do a better job to protect privacy. They need to do a betterjob to create jobs and not just in my district, but across thecountry.</p><p>They need to hire more people of color. It's dismal what thehiring is of African Americans, African-American women.</p><p>So there are a lot of issues we can talk about. But we alsoshould look at their success. The #MeToo movement wouldn't havehappened in the extent it did without Facebook. Black Lives Matterused Facebook. Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, they alluse Facebook.</p><p>You know, Josh Hawley, the senator from Missouri, criticizingTitter saying we don't need it. Well, why don't you get off theplatforms then? Of course the social media platforms have beencritical to democracy. We need to make sure that they're doing it ina positive way.</p><p>HUNT:  Well, it seems like the question whether they havefundamentally, Juanita, undermined democracy by empoweringauthoritarians and misinformation.</p><p>TOLLIVER:  I think that's exactly right. With 2020 electioncoming up, all sorts of alarm bells are going off. Will our electionbe interfered in through this platform of Facebook, something that Ithink there has been a lot of evidence of? So how are user databeing protected? How are consumers being protected, folks like youand me who use these platforms?</p><p>I think the other thing here is these candidates, while they'reon a spectrum, still belief in those same fundamental components,protect consumer data, ensure innovation in the industry and makesure that this platform is working for the American good.</p><p>HUNT:  All right. Congressman Ro Khanna, thank you very much forcoming on.</p><p>KHANNA:  Thank you.</p><p>HUNT:  It was always great, this particular conversation, it'svery interesting to have with you.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Phil and Jackie's colleagues at \"The Washington Post\" report that President Trump and his allies are working to block more than 20 separate investigations by Democrats into his actions as president, his personal finances, and his administration's policies.   </p><p>      House Democrats say the Trump administration has failed to respond to or comply with at least 79 requests for documents or other information. The president is blocking aides from testifying, refusing entire document requests from some committees, filing lawsuits against corporations to bar them from responding to subpoenas, and asserting executive privilege to keep information about the special counsel's Russia investigation out of public view. And one of the points that the piece makes is that some congressional experts fear the strategy could undermine the institutional power of Congress for years to come.   </p><p>      But, Congressman Khanna, what is the strategy here for Democrats as you simply watch the president refuse request after request after request and subpoena after subpoena?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA)</emphasis>:  Well, Kasie, it's an assault on the idea of separation of powers. Look, every administration pushes back against Congress. That's normal and you have these fights. But no administration denies every single request. That's what's going on here. They are simply refusing to recognize Congress' role of oversight.   </p><p>      There is only one thing we can do, and that's the courts.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  Is there a risk there? I mean, what is the kind of thinking behind the scenes as to how to approach that without getting a court decision that stops you in your tracks?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Well, I think the courts will rule clearly for us, because the law is clear. Unless there is national security at stake, when there are issues of obstruction or corrupt action in the executive branch, the Congress has clear ability to get these documents. And I think courts are ruling expeditiously. We just had the D.C. court -- a court in D.C. say that they aren't going to stonewall. So, I expect that the courts will rule for us, and they'll rule expeditiously.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  Juanita, you kind of worked in the Center for American Progress which is very in touch, of course, with the base of the Democratic Party. What's your view of how Democrats in Congress are kind of going about this and whether they should be more aggressive than perhaps they're being?   </p><p>      JUANITA TOLLIVER, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS FUND CAMPAIGN </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DIRECTOR</emphasis>:  I mean, Democrats in Congress are operating off the mandate in which they retook the house from voters overwhelmingly supporting Democrats in the midterms in 2018. And so, they're actually really doing a great job of conducting that oversight. Of course, there is tension on how far to go, but I think recent polling showed that a lot of Democratic voters really want to wait for additional evidence. They want the oversight to run its course.   </p><p>      And so I think it's really falling in line with what we've seen from Speaker Pelosi and Democratic leadership on Congress that hey, steady the course. Let's tow that line because let's not -- we're not going to fall into the trap that Trump wants us to by pulling the ultimate card of impeachment.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  Jackie, I mean, Pelosi said this week that the president is trying to goad Democrats into impeachment. But at the same time, they seem to be moving the line a little bit, closer and closer.   </p><p>      JACKIE ALEMANY, AUTHOR, \"POWER UP\" NEWSLETTER, THE WASHINGTON </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POST</emphasis>:  That's exactly right. Over the past few weeks, where you have really seen Pelosi's position evolve here. She was pretty conservative at first, and now, she's using terms like self-impeachment and goading.   </p><p>      But if you notice that language really puts the burden back on the president because I think she still is hesitant here. There is immense frustration amongst Democrats. I'm sure you can speak better to that than I can, but, you know, there is clearly an issue enforcement mechanisms working here.   </p><p>      And, you know, at the end of the day, this is a fight that the president wants to be having. He'd much rather be talk about fighting these oversight battles than talking about, you know, the crises going on in Venezuela, China, North Korea, Iran, and Russia.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  Is that -- I mean, is that sort of the thinking behind the scenes here, Phil, that this is good ground for the president to be on to solidify his base?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PHIL RUCKER, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST</emphasis>:  Absolutely, because he can make himself the victim and the persecuted, and he can argue that the Democrats are reaching beyond what is reasonable in the Congress to investigate him, and to try to force him out of office somehow.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  We are losing our light here is in our studio. Sorry, Phil. We didn't mean to interrupt you. I think we're still on the air. But to all of our viewers who are now watching us in the dark, I sincerely apologize.   </p><p>      All right. I think we're back. So, we'll keep going. I know.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  Better look out. Maybe there is dragons outside the studio somewhere.   </p><p>      Phil, I'm so sorry you were interrupted. Please continue.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUCKER</emphasis>:  One thing we should really keep in mind, though, is the scope and breadth of these investigations. There are 20 investigations. It's not just about Russia and obstruction of justice and interference in the election, but it's looking into the security clearance process at the White House. You know, how is it that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump got their security clearances despite the objections of career staff?   </p><p>      It's looking into the president's personal finances, his tax returns. Who does he owe money to? Where is that money coming from? These are accountability measures that were missing in the first two years of the administration because the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress. And the Democrats are trying to catch up.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  Congressman, I mean, what -- how far would you say this line is moving? I mean, is your caucus in general when you guys get together behind the scenes -- I mean, Nancy Pelosi has her finger on the pulse of that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  She does.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  You know, unlike anyone. And to hear her moving in this direction tells me there is something building inside your caucus. How strong is it at this point?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Well, there is greater and greater frustration. I mean, there was first frustration when the ten counts of obstruction were detailed. Then there is frustration when the president refuses to comply with anything and is basically insulting members of Congress and our constitutional duty.   </p><p>      But Nancy Pelosi is very clear. The speaker believes we need to have public sentiment with us, and we are to make that case. And she will move when public sentiment moves. She quotes Abraham Lincoln all the time. Public sentiment is everything.   </p><p>      So, she is -- anyone who knows her knows how she is looking at this. She wants to build a case and then she is going to see where public sentiment is.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  I mean, Jackie, what's your sense of -- I mean, having -- I know you look at the polling when you put together your newsletter and all that. I mean, public sentiment has not moved towards -- in favor of impeachment.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALEMANY</emphasis>:  No, it hasn't. And you even have people like Senator Sanders who are saying to voters on the campaign trail, even though he's -- you know, he's trying to fund-raise off the Mueller report, he's saying to voters, when we're talking about Mueller, when we're talking about all of these oversight pushes, we're not talking about health care and issues that affect the American people on a consistent basis.   </p><p>      And so, I think Speaker Pelosi does realize that the more time everyone is spending, the more air time everyone is spending on talking about these fights feeds into what the president is talking about, it helps distract from issues of health care -- trade, tax issues, of potentially repealing the president's tax bill.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  We get that bombshell \"New York Times\" report on the president's finances. The push for more details is also going on.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC)</emphasis>:  In his mind, he is wildly successful. That's part of his branding, is to be bigger than life. By any reasonable definition, he is successful. He is the president of the United States. He owns a bunch of golf courses that are a lot of fun to play. So, the American people figure out about what they want to believe or not believe about Donald Trump and his marketing.   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  On Tuesday, a federal judge is expected to rule on whether the president can put a stop to a House subpoena demanding financial records from his personal accounting firm. And the ways and means committee issued subpoenas Friday to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig by this coming Friday.   </p><p>      Over the weekend, the president reflected on the political optics of it all, tweeting, quote:  I won the 2016 election partially based on no tax returns while I'm under audit, which I still am, and the voters don't care making it a part of the 2020 election.   </p><p>      And here is what the IRS commissioner said one month ago.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REP. SANFORD BISHOP (D-GA)</emphasis>:  But there is no rule that would prohibit the release of a tax return because it's under audit.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHARLES RETTIG, IRS COMMISSIONER</emphasis>:  I'm not aware of such a rule. And I believe I've answered that.   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  And let's just be clear in terms of fact checking the president, Juanita, that, first of all, presidents are audited regularly. And yet we still see tax returns from past residents and, of course, the IRS commissioner did some fact checking for us there saying there is nothing preventing this. But at the same time, it doesn't necessarily seem as those Democrats have a clear path forward to actually getting these released.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TOLLIVER</emphasis>:  Well, I think the clear path forward is what they're doing already, issue the subpoena, make the request, because what they've done now is looped in the IRS commissioner who is not beholden to Trump the way Mnuchin is. And so, it's really calling on people further down the chain of command. Hey, are you really going to put yourself on the line, put your future on the line to protect a president who is hiding something at this point, and folks have reason to believe?  </p><p>      And I think also in terms of public opinion on this, in polls over the last four to six weeks, there is shown that the majority of Americans do believe that Trump should release his tax returns. I think Democrats have that going in their favor too.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  Phil, what of these is the most dangerous for the president? I mean, is Democrats going after his tax returns, the biggest, you know, non-Russia problem that he has coming from the Hill or not?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUCKER</emphasis>:  You know, it might be the most embarrassing problem for him so far as if the returns from the more recent years show that the 10-year span that \"The New York Times\" reported on, it would show that the president is not as rich as he says he is, and that he had a lot of losses and is not the grand golden success that he has pitched himself to the American people as. But I don't know that that's politically that dangerous for him, or legally that's dangerous for him.   </p><p>      If I were President Trump, I would be much more concerned about people like Don McGahn coming in to an open forum and testifying on any number of issues where the president could be implicated, and not only bad behavior, but obstruction of justice or other criminal behavior.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  Yes, the kicker of that \"New York Times\" report about his tax returns, about how he said it was difficult to make money in real estate. But his father never lost any money except when he invested in his son.  </p><p>      Anyway, Phil Rucker, thanks so much for being here. We're sorry again about the lights.   </p><p>      Everyone else is going to stay with us.   </p><p>      So, you have heard this week calls to break up Facebook, even from one of the company's founders. Now it is turning into a wedge for 2020 candidates in what has been a pretty tame election cycle just got a little more heated.   </p><p>      Plus, her identity as a covert CIA agent was leaked during the Bush administration to settle a political score against her husband. Now, Valerie Plame is running for Congress. She joins me live ahead on KASIE DC.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  The battle over big tech's accountability problem is now spilling into the presidential race and pitting 2020 Democrats against each other. Senator Cory Booker is making clear he doesn't think breaking up tech giants, which Elizabeth Warren has proposed, is a solution. But it's how Booker describes his disagreement with Warren's proposal that turned heads.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE</emphasis>:  I don't think that a president should be running around pointing at companies at companies and say breaking them up without any kind of process here. It's not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds like a Donald Trump thing to say. I'm going to break up you guys.   </p><p>      No. We need to create systems and processes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INTERVIEWER</emphasis>:  You just compared Elizabeth Warren to Donald Trump?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  I most certainly did not. She's my friend --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INTERVIEWER</emphasis>:  That's what she's saying. She's the one that's saying that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  Well, again, she has -- let her discuss and debate her positions. I'm telling you right now, we do not need a president that is going to use their own personal beliefs and tell you which companies we should break up. We need a president who is going to enforce antitrust laws in this country.   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  The call to reduce the power of big tech grew loud their week when Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes called the company, quote, dangerous. Hughes wrote in a \"New York Times\" op-ed that the government must, quote, break up Facebook's monopoly.   </p><p>      And this morning, Senator Kamala Harris was also asked to weigh in.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE</emphasis>:  There is no question in my mind that there needs to be serious regulation, and that has not been happening there needs to be more oversight that has not been happening.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INTERVIEWER</emphasis>:  You think they should be broken up?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  Yes, I think we have to seriously take a look at that, yes.   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  Quite some comments from Cory Booker.   </p><p>      Congressman, I know you represent Silicon Valley. So, I want to get your take on this in a minute.   </p><p>      But, Jackie, just to kind of look at this from the lens of Cory Booker essentially calling Elizabeth Warren Trumpian in her kind of attack on this on Facebook. At the same time, I mean, it isn't just any random company that she might have a personal vendetta against.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALEMANY</emphasis>:  No, it's not. And this has been Elizabeth Warren's pretty consistent position. It is really interesting as the campaign progresses to finally see positions, different positions between candidates in the Democratic Party differentiating from themselves. Cory Booker sort of, you know, appearing to take actually the sides of corporations a little bit more than Elizabeth Warren, which I think is a standpoint that you could have surmised from their positions in Congress.   </p><p>      But, you know, they both are part of a Congress that has failed really to regulate Facebook over the last few years, and I think both of them really need to grapple with their role in that. You know, France just finished their review in which the government conducted a six-month review internally in Facebook overseeing how their regulatory processes work and actually provided a report which Zuckerberg praised. And so, I don't think these two things, breaking up Facebook and increasing regulation are necessarily mutually exclusive.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  Yes, Congressman, to that point about Congress -- I mean, do you think that the United States Congress is equipped to regulate these big tech companies, specifically Facebook? Are they capable of it?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  We need to have more technology and knowledge. But we need to look to the Microsoft case. I think that was an example that worked, that government went after Microsoft. They said you couldn't tie Internet Explorer to Windows. If you had done that, the Microsoft --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  We would all have to use Internet Explorer and our lives would be way harder and --   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Google would never have emerged, right? But it went to the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit said you don't have break them up. You need to make sure they can't do bad mergers, they can't be privileging their own platforms. So, there may be kind of ground.  </p><p>      I do think Elizabeth Warren has added a lot to the debate. I mean, she has called for stronger, thoughtful regulation. The question is, how do we get there? And I think the Microsoft case offers the paradigm.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  I'm going to put you a little bit on the spot here.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Sure.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  And I will admit that, you know, I'm not intimately familiar with where Bernie Sanders stands on this question. But you are co-chair of his campaign. Where does he fall on the spectrum of these 2020 candidates?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  I haven't asked him specifically. He usually focuses on Wall Street and defense contractors and airline industries. I mean, I don't know his exact position on this. But I do know when he talks about technology, he often talks about how do we get universal broadband, how do we get technology into rural communities and jobs there. But you'd have to ask him or his campaign --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  Well, you are his campaign. That's why I'm asking you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  I'm one of his co-chairs. I don't want to -- I don't want to misrepresent his nuanced view on this without talking to him about it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  So, when it comes to the idea of breaking up Facebook, I mean, I think a lot of people, sort of, you know, Chris Hughes really turned heads because to explore your Microsoft analogy a little further, I mean, you're talking about a centralization of power that is much different from a company that is selling computers and softwares to consumers, right? You're instead talking about the fact that because all these people are using this platform, the platform itself has immense power.   </p><p>      How do you actually -- I mean, you must have to take steps that are slightly different than what happened in the Microsoft case to actually make it work.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Well, I think if you had scrutiny on mergers, right, I thought they shouldn't have been allowed to acquire Instagram. I thought they shouldn't have been allowed to acquire WhatsApp. And if you have different social media platforms, then you a choice.   </p><p>      I mean, I don't think it's the end of the world if someone doesn't use Facebook. It would be the end of the world if someone didn't have access to the Internet. That's why Facebook is a utility. It's not like water or electricity.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  Well, for a lot of small businesses, it does serve a purpose like a utility does.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Well, I think that there have to be regulations so that they shouldn't be able to privilege their own products, they shouldn't be able to bully vendors.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  They certainly bully the news industry in some cases as well.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  And I think that should be looked at. But what we have to do is have a fact-based investigation and then have thoughtful regulation on privacy, on making sure that they're not privileging their platform, on making sure they're not getting a favorable deal against vendors.   </p><p>      But here is -- you say well, why not just break them up? There are two reasons. One, you don't want China, Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu to become the social media platforms around the world. I mean, there is some competition there and --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  Do you think Facebook views itself as fundamentally American? Because sometimes when I talk to my sources who work there, they view themselves more as a global company than an American one. I mean, how important do you think that American identity is to Mark Zuckerberg?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  I think they know they are an American company because they would never have succeeded under Chinese or European laws. I mean, it's the American First Amendment and Section 230 that allowed a lot of these Internet companies to emerge. They aren't censored. They have a much more competitive environment than Europe allows.   </p><p>      So, I think they understand that their success, they owed it to America, and they want to make sure some of those values continue.   </p><p>      Now, do they need to be more accountable? Absolutely. They need to do a better job to prevent interference from foreign actors. They need to do a better job to protect privacy. They need to do a better job to create jobs and not just in my district, but across the country.   </p><p>      They need to hire more people of color. It's dismal what the hiring is of African Americans, African-American women.   </p><p>      So there are a lot of issues we can talk about. But we also should look at their success. The #MeToo movement wouldn't have happened in the extent it did without Facebook. Black Lives Matter used Facebook. Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, they all use Facebook.   </p><p>      You know, Josh Hawley, the senator from Missouri, criticizing Titter saying we don't need it. Well, why don't you get off the platforms then? Of course the social media platforms have been critical to democracy. We need to make sure that they're doing it in a positive way.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  Well, it seems like the question whether they have fundamentally, Juanita, undermined democracy by empowering authoritarians and misinformation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TOLLIVER</emphasis>:  I think that's exactly right. With 2020 election coming up, all sorts of alarm bells are going off. Will our election be interfered in through this platform of Facebook, something that I think there has been a lot of evidence of? So how are user data being protected? How are consumers being protected, folks like you and me who use these platforms?   </p><p>      I think the other thing here is these candidates, while they're on a spectrum, still belief in those same fundamental components, protect consumer data, ensure innovation in the industry and make sure that this platform is working for the American good.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  All right. Congressman Ro Khanna, thank you very much for coming on.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNT</emphasis>:  It was always great, this particular conversation, it's very interesting to have with you.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3J-5P01-F15W-H042-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Ro Khanna of California represents Silicon Valley, home to many of the tech companies that members of his party are talking about breaking up. The second-term Democratic congressman is also co-chairman of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 43-year-old \u2014 the son of Indian immigrants and a former law professor at Santa Clara University \u2014 recently spoke with the Washington Examiner about his thoughts on the regulation of tech, wealth taxes, and other topics being debated among Democrats. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Washington Examiner: Thoughts on Bernie [Sanders] and what he\u2019s said many times, that billionaires shouldn't exist and his wealth tax that could eradicate much of their wealth over a number of years?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Khanna: I have no problem with Steve Jobs or Elon Musk being billionaires. What I want to make sure is that people in minority communities, rural communities have the opportunity to have the jobs of the future. That they get STEM [science, technology, engineering, and math] credentials or education that they are able to go to college without going into debt. That they're able to get a quality public school education. That they're able to have access to good jobs. That's my concern. The dearth of opportunity in so many parts of this country.</p><p>Washington Examiner: So you disagree with [Sanders] regarding billionaires?</p><p>Khanna: I don't know. I mean, I think that we, if someone is doing what Steve Jobs did, or Elon Musk, I don't have a problem with them being billionaires. I think there are people who had extractive ways of making billions of dollars, and that has to be dealt with [through] regulation. But do I have a problem with Bill Gates being a billionaire and then contributing billions of dollars to fighting malaria in Africa? No.</p><p>Washington Examiner: Any particular thoughts on the wealth tax that is being discussed a lot within the Democratic primary? [Sanders has proposed a progressive wealth tax on taxpayers with wealth above $32 million.]</p><p>Khanna: It definitely needs to be explored. But you know, I think we have to start with this premise: Bill Clinton left this country with budget surpluses, and then, three things happened. The George Bush tax cut to the 1%, wars of $6 trillion in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the Trump tax cut to the very wealthy. If you reverse those three, you would be left with budget surplus, and you could probably raise a lot of the revenue for free public college, for infrastructure, for universal childcare, for expanding your tax credit. So I would start with those three things.</p><p>Washington Examiner: So currently, are you in favor of a wealth tax?</p><p>Khanna: I'm in favor of looking at it. But I would start with the reversal of the Bush and Trump tax cuts to the 1% and the reversal of interventions overseas. I think it should be on the table, but we should start with that. And then we should look at it. And then we should look at it in a way that's going to be well-designed. </p><p>And we have a wealth tax in this country, it\u2019s called the estate tax. And what I would first try to do is close the loopholes. I mean, there's so many people who aren't paying the estate tax, why aren\u2019t we closing some of those loopholes? And how would we design a wealth tax that wouldn't be subject to the same evasion that is subject currently in the estate tax? So what I'd first do is try to close the loopholes, and then I'd be open to it if it can generate revenue. But I think we have to be realistic about how much revenue it would generate based on historical experience with tax avoidance and make sure that whatever we do is grounded in proper economics.</p><p>Washington Examiner: Regarding the 2020 candidates, [Sanders] himself and then Warren, of course, and a number of other Democrats have called for the breakup of big tech companies, and some Republicans even have gotten behind this, with [Department of Justice] antitrust chief [Makan] Delrahim talking about this yesterday \u2014 what makes you differ from some of them?</p><p>Khanna: I believe in strong antitrust laws. But I think that we have to have well-crafted antitrust laws. So what I would focus on is that companies shouldn't be able to advantage their own platforms. I would be skeptical of horizontal mergers and really scrutinize companies from either copying their competitors or acquiring their competitors. But I wouldn't just reflexively break up companies without consideration. What I would look to is the Microsoft case, where Microsoft wasn't broken up. The D.C. circuit [court] actually struck that down. But Microsoft wasn't allowed to tie Internet Explorer with Netscape; that led to Google emerging and a lot of companies emerging. So that provides a thoughtful way of having strong antitrust protection.</p><p>Washington Examiner: So what circumstances do you think you would be supportive of breaking up big tech companies in Silicon Valley, for example?</p><p>Khanna: Well, if there was [an] investigation by the [Federal Trade Commission] and Justice Department and a fact-based investigation that concluded that there was some major antitrust violation that required that remedy, I would support what the civil servants investigated. But I think there has to be a fact-based, nonpolitical determination. What Congress should do is strengthen the antitrust laws in making sure that we're regulating companies so that they don't privilege their own platforms.</p><p>Washington Examiner: So you would go with whatever recommendation the FTC and DOJ made on particular investigations?</p><p>Khanna: I mean I would not override it, but I would also make sure that whoever I was recommending to the president to be appointed would be someone independent and wouldn't be someone who came \u2014 who was either too sympathetic to industry or who was either biased against industry.</p><p>Washington Examiner: What specific actions do you hope occur from the investigations into Google, Facebook, Apple? I know FTC is investigating Facebook [and] the DOJ, Apple and Google.</p><p>Khanna: They need to focus on platform neutrality. That Google or Facebook or Amazon or any company shouldn't be able to say that it uses its own platform to advantage its own products, these platforms should be largely neutral, and they should focus on making sure these companies aren't acquiring competition to prevent competition from emerging.</p><p>Washington Examiner: As in the issue of being umpires and referees and players at the same time?</p><p>Khanna: Yes, for example, Amazon shouldn't be able to put Amazon basics high up on the search or Amazon should be able to copy someone's small business's product and then use the data it acquired to outcompete them and drive them out of business.</p><p>Washington Examiner: I was curious about your thoughts on the \u2018hipster antitrust\u2019 movement that Lina Khan and others have kind of created in the past couple years \u2014 that the definition of antitrust law should be about more than just consumer welfare and about wages and jobs and other metrics.</p><p>Khanna: I agree with that. I think that consumer welfare is a primary consideration. But there also has to be consideration for the impact on communities, for the impact on jobs, for the impact on wages. And that's very important. Now, I wouldn't go as far as Europe, where the antitrust laws actually protect the competitor. But I think you can have a balance going back to Brandeis\u2019s original conception or the original conception of the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act \u2014 that you did want to consider the impact on communities and jobs and wages.</p><p>Washington Examiner: [Khan] and others want to drastically rewrite the law to have much broader, sweeping definitions. Are you in support of really changing and rewriting the law?</p><p>Ro Khanna: I'm in favor of moving away from the Robert Bork strict definition of consumer welfare being the only thing that matters and introducing other factors as consideration. But you know, I'd have to look at the specifics of that. But as a framework, I think, it shouldn't be consumer welfare is the only consideration. </p><p>Washington Examiner: What are some of the other specific considerations?</p><p>Khanna: Jobs, wages, impacts on community. So you could, for example, conceive of the FTC evaluating a merger saying it's going to be good for consumer welfare, but it's going to have a displacement effect on jobs and wages and particular communities and charging a tax on the company to make up for that displacement if they're going to approve the merger. So my view is that consumer welfare has to still be the guiding principle, but you have to also look at other considerations, and you can\u2019t make those other considerations irrelevant. </p><p>Washington Examiner: Do you think we have ways of accurately analyzing such economic metrics like wages and jobs when a merger is happening? </p><p>Khanna: I think we can. I think consumer welfare is also not a precise science. So, we have to look and make our best efforts, and then courts will have to do that, and regulators will have to do that.</p><p>Washington Examiner: Are there any particular areas that you think we can look toward Europe in terms of antitrust or why do you think they haven't had innovation the way that we've had?</p><p>Khanna: They don't have a First Amendment. They don't have the same entrepreneurial risk-taking culture. They don't have the same immigration. I mean, people still from around the world want to come to the United States and Silicon Valley, comparatively. They don't have the same access to capital. They don't have the same research universities. </p><p>Washington Examiner: Do you think there's anything in particular related to their laws or regulations around tech companies? </p><p>Khanna: I don't know about that. I mean, I think it's more just the entrepreneurial culture, the culture of welcoming immigrants, the culture of risk-taking, the First Amendment that has given America an advantage.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2314514817</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH9-PVN1-DY0W-44J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1636\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

Seth Moulton, D-Massachusetts, issued the following news release on July 13:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congressman Seth Moulton (D-MA) partnered with Congressman John Curtis (R-UT) to introduce bipartisan legislation to put American consumers in the driver's seat by giving them clearer knowledge about the technology they are purchasing. The Informing Consumers about Smart Devices Act, introduced by Reps. Curtis (R-UT), Moulton (D-MA), and Bilirakis (R-FL), requires the creation of reasonable disclosure guidelines for products that have audio or visual recording components that are not clearly obvious to a reasonable person, such as a kitchen or another household appliance.</p><p>\"This legislation balances protecting American consumers with continuing to foster innovation, and I am extremely pleased with this final bipartisan product we introduced today,\" said Curtis. \"By working with a broad range of stakeholders, this legislation will allow regulatory flexibility without hamstringing the technological pioneers who are developing smart technologies, while ensuring consumers are aware of the capabilities of items they are putting in their homes.\"</p><p>\"We should be allowed to make informed decisions about the electronic eavesdroppers we invite into our homes. But we can't do it if big tech hides microphones and cameras that are always listening in refrigerators, toasters, and other household gadgets,\" said Moulton. \"Let's pass this bill so consumers know when big tech is listening in.\"</p><p>Background:</p><p>The legislation is in response to reports about household devices listening to individuals' conversations without their knowledge. While some manufacturers have taken steps to more clearly label their products with listening devices, this legislation would make this information more obvious to consumers without overly burdensome requirements on producers of these devices.</p><p>Specifically, the bill requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to work alongside industry leaders to establish guidelines for properly disclosing the potential for their products to contain audio or visual recording capabilities. To ensure this does not become an overly burdensome labeling requirement, the legislation provides manufacturers the option of requesting customized guidance from the FTC that fits within their existing marketing or branding practices in addition to permitting these disclosures pre or post-sale of their products.</p><p>Text of the bill available here <url normalizedValue=\"https://curtis.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Informing-Consumers-About-Small-Devices-Act.pdf\">https://curtis.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Informing-Consumers-About-Small-Devices-Act.pdf</url>.</p><p>The Informing Consumers about Smart Devices Act builds on the next generation privacy laws pushed by Rep.

John R. Curtis, R-Utah, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Representative Curtis (R-UT) introduced bipartisan legislation to put American consumers in the driver's seat by giving them clearer knowledge about the technology they are purchasing. The Informing Consumers about Smart Devices Act, introduced by Reps. Curtis, Moulton (D-MA), and Bilirakis (R-FL), requires the creation of reasonable disclosure guidelines for products that have audio or visual recording components that are not clearly obvious to a reasonable person, such as a kitchen or another household appliance.</p><p>\"This legislation balances protecting American consumers with continuing to foster innovation, and I am extremely pleased with this final bipartisan product we introduced today,\" said Curtis. \"By working with a broad range of stakeholders, this legislation will allow regulatory flexibility without hamstringing the technological pioneers who are developing smart technologies, while ensuring consumers are aware of the capabilities of items they are putting in their homes.\"</p><p>\"We should be allowed to make informed decisions about the electronic eavesdroppers we invite into our homes. But we can't do it if big tech hides microphones and cameras that are always listening in refrigerators, toasters, and other household gadgets,\" said Moulton. \"Let's pass this bill so consumers know when big tech is listening in.\"</p><p>Background:</p><p>The legislation is in response to reports about household devices listening to individuals' conversations without their knowledge. While some manufacturers have taken steps to more clearly label their products with listening devices, this legislation would make this information more obvious to consumers without overly burdensome requirements on producers of these devices.</p><p>Specifically, the bill requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to work alongside industry leaders to establish guidelines for properly disclosing the potential for their products to contain audio or visual recording capabilities. To ensure this does not become an overly burdensome labeling requirement, the legislation provides manufacturers the option of requesting customized guidance from the FTC that fits within their existing marketing or branding practices in addition to permitting these disclosures pre or post-sale of their products.</p><p>Text of the bill available here <url normalizedValue=\"https://curtis.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Informing-Consumers-About-Small-Devices-Act.pdf\">https://curtis.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Informing-Consumers-About-Small-Devices-Act.pdf</url>.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7173841 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7173841</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BW-NV31-JC11-12BG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"419\"/><timeReceived>9:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Mike Doyle, D-Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, and Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois, chairman of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce, issued the following opening remarks at a joint subcommittee hearing entitled \"A Country in Crisis: How Disinformation Online is Dividing the Nation\" on June 24:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chairman Doyle: Welcome to today's joint hearing on disinformation and the crisis it is creating in our country and for our democracy. I'd like to thank our panel of witnesses for joining us virtually today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the Committee has held several virtual hearings so far, this is the first one I have chaired, so please bear with us.</p><p>The matter before the Committee today is one of pressing importance, the flood of disinformation online - principally distributed by social media companies - and the dangerous and divisive impact it is having on our nation as we endure the COVID-19 epidemic.</p><p>More than 120,000 Americans have already lost their lives to this virus, and nearly 2.4 million Americans have been infected. Tens of millions of people are out of work as we attempt to stop the spread of this virus and prevent an even greater disaster.</p><p>In the midst of this historic crisis, we are also facing a historic opportunity. Tens of millions of Americans are calling for racial justice and systemic changes to end racism and police brutality in the wake of the horrific murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless other Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement.</p><p>The Black Lives Matter movement has resulted in protests around the globe and online, as people are taking to the streets and to social media to express their support for change.</p><p>But as we march for progress and grapple with this deadly disease, the divisions in our country are growing. While our nation has long been divided, today we see that much of this division is driven by misinformation distributed and amplified by social media companies - the largest among them being Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.</p><p>These platforms have become central to the daily lives of many around the globe - and to the way that people get their news, interact with each other, and engage in political discourse.</p><p>Our nation and the world are facing an unprecedented tsunami of disinformation that threatens to devastate our country and the world. It has been driven by hostile foreign powers seeking to weaken our democracy and divide our people, by those in our country who seek to divide us for their own political gain, and by the social media companies themselves - who have put profits before people as their platforms have become awash in disinformation and their business models have come to depend on the engaging and enraging nature of these false truths.</p><p>When Congress enacted Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in 1996, this provision provided online companies with a sword and a shield to address concerns about content moderation and a website's liability for hosting third party content. And while a number of websites have used 230 for years to remove sexually explicit and overly violent content, they have failed to act to curtail the spread of disinformation. Instead they have built systems to spread it at scale and to monetize the way it confirms our implicit biases.</p><p>Everyone likes to hear and to read things that confirm what they think is true, and these companies have made trillions of dollars by feeding people what they want to hear. As a result, these platforms have peddled lies about COVID 19, Black Lives Matter, voting by mail, and much, much more.</p><p>When companies have done the right thing and stepped up to take down disinformation, they have been attacked by those who have benefited from it. Recently, Twitter labelled a number of tweets by President Trump as inaccurate, abusive, and glorifying violence. In response, President Trump issued an Executive Order threatening all social media companies. The Department of Justice has issued similarly thuggish proposals as well. The intent of these actions is clear: to bully social media companies into inaction.</p><p>Social media companies need to step up to protect our civil rights, our human rights, and human lives - NOT sit on the sidelines as our nation drowns in a sea of disinformation.</p><p>Make no mistake, the future of our democracy is at stake and the status quo is unacceptable.</p><p>While Section 230 has long provided online companies the flexibility and liability protections they need to innovate and to connect people from around the world, it has become clear that reform is necessary if we want to stem the tide of disinformation rolling over our country.</p><p>Chair Schakowsky: Good morning and thank you for being here today. Thank you to our distinguished panel for joining us today.</p><p>Last fall Chairman Doyle and I held a joint hearing on Section 230, and subsequently my subcommittee held a hearing on unsafe products and fake reviews found online. At both hearings, industry representatives from Big Tech testified, and we heard that content moderation and consumer protection were really hard, and that industry could always do better. They made promises and discouraged Congressional action. I think they may have even apologized, as Big Tech typically does when it appears before this committee.</p><p>Fast forward 6 months, add a global health crisis and nationwide protests against police brutality and racial inequality. As we will hear today, it's an understatement to say that industry could still be doing better.</p><p>The harms associated with misinformation and disinformation continue to fall disproportionately on communities of color, who already suffer worse outcomes from COVID-19.</p><p>All the while, the President himself is continually spreading dangerous disinformation that Big Tech is all too eager to profit from.</p><p>No matter what the absolutists say, Section 230 is not only about free speech and content moderation. If it were, our conversation today would be different. Instead, Big Tech uses it as a shield to protect itself from liability when it fails to protect consumers or harms public health, and uses it as a sword to intimidate cities and states when they consider legislation, as Airbnb did in 2016 when New York City was considering regulating its online rental market for private homes.</p><p>The truth is, Section 230 protects business models that generate profits off scams, fake news, fake reviews, and unsafe, counterfeit, and stolen products. This was never the intent, and since both courts and industry refuse to change, Congress must act.</p><p>But we must do so responsibly. The President's recent actions are designed to kneecap platforms that fact check him or engage in what he claims is bias against conservative views. Let me be clear, the President is using his position to chill speech and that is wrong.</p><p>We must encourage content moderation that fosters a safer and healthy online world. And don't be fooled by made up claims of bias against conservatives. Today, it seems there is a less of a bias against conservatives and rather a bias for conservatives.</p><p>On June 19th, 9 of the 10 top-performing political pages on Facebook were conservative pages, including Donald J. Trump, Donald Trump for President, Ben Shapiro, Breitbart and Sean Hannity.</p><p>And as the New York Times reported over the weekend, Facebook in particular seems to enjoy a cozy relationship with the Trump Administration, aided by Facebook's own loyal Trump supporters, Joel Kaplan and Peter Theil. I hope Mr. Kaplan and Mr. Theil will soon make themselves available to Congress to answer questions about what role they play in information dissemination, and how they balance this incredible responsibility with their extreme partisan ties and views.</p><p>Regardless, as the testimony today demonstrates, something needs to be done. The American people are dying and suffering as a result of online disinformation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to modernize Section 230 and put platforms on a path that helps all Americans.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7154583 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7154583</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606V-2Y61-JC11-1143-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1351\"/><timeReceived>8:50 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 25, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, September 5th. Your top stories, right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S.-China trade talks back on, Chinese and American officials will have face-to-face meetings in Washington, D.C., in early October. The news is leading to a rally in the premarket this morning, we got the market up about one percent right now, on the Dow Industrials, take a look, Dow up 227 points, S&amp;P up 24 and the NASDAQ up 82 points that's better than 1 percent. We're just shy of the highs right here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In about 15 minutes' time, we will get another read on jobs in America, when the August ADP report is released. The estimate is calling for 149,000 jobs added to the economy, in the month of August. We will have the numbers and analysis, and check if it is, in fact, impacting markets. Tomorrow, we got the jobs' report out from the labor department.</p><p>Yesterday, markets rallied as well, after Hong Kong's controversial extradition bill was withdrawn. The Dow was up 237 points at close yesterday. The S&amp;P was up 31, and the NASDAQ was up 103 points, one and a third percent.</p><p>Global markets, this morning, are mostly higher, although we are looking at weakness in the U.K. The FT-100 is down 50 points right now. The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 48, and the DAX Index in Germany is up 86.</p><p>We did have another sign of a slowing economy, when German factory orders came in, weaker than expected. They were down in the month of July. Nonetheless, the DAX is up, as many people expect more stimulus from the ECB.</p><p>Asian markets this morning, look like this, and as you can see, the Hong Kong, Hang Seng was down a fraction, the others, major standout was Japan, Nikkei Average was up better than two percent.</p><p>We are tracking Hurricane Dorian this morning, the storm gained strength overnight. It is now back up to a Category 3 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 115 miles an hour, moving up the East Coast, taking aim at the Carolinas, we will take you there, live.</p><p>Slack is warning a slower growth this morning, the stock is taking a dive, take a look, it's down better than 12 percent, in the premarket, following its first earnings report, since going public.</p><p>Plus, a hungry thief on the loose, look at this, a man breaks into a subway shop and he just fixes himself a sandwich, and it's all on tape. Yes, break in, and have a sandwich. All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.</p><p>And joining me to break it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, commentary writer at The Federalist, Emily Jashinsky is here, and the assistant editorial page editor at The Wall Street Journal, James Freeman. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I don't want to question the intelligence of our thief here, but I am wondering about the risk reward calculus there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He got a sandwich.</p><p>EMILY JASHINSKY, COMMENTARY WRITER, THE FEDERALIST: High reward.</p><p>FREEMAN: The one --</p><p>JASHINSKY: A foot long?</p><p>FREEMAN: -- on the other, it's a six-inch Italian with cold cuts.</p><p>JASHINSKY: Those are big sandwiches.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, they're good. I'm not saying it's not a good sandwich.</p><p>JASHINSKY: Worth it for the foot-long.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's hilarious. We don't know what else he stole, but --</p><p>JASHINSKY: That's true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But he broke in.</p><p>JASHINSKY: He also got chips. He probably got the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he (INAUDIBLE) the sandwich.</p><p>JASHINSKY: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lot to talk about this morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Somehow, I think alcohol was involved.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>JASHINSKY: Alcohol is something else.</p><p>FREEMAN: That sandwich --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Could be. Could be. Joining the conversation this morning, Laffer Associates chairman, former Reagan economic adviser, Art Laffer is here, wait until you hear what he says, happens to markets, if we get a deal with China.</p><p>He's going to talk about China trade negotiations and the economy. B- Strong founder, former Real Housewives of New York Star, Bethenny Frankel, is joining us this morning, on her foundation's efforts in Hurricane Dorian and the recovery there, and the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney, weighs in, as well. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big hour right here.</p><p>And our top story this hour, is U.S.-China trade. Top trade officials agreeing to hold talks in Washington, next month. This month, deputy level discussions will lay the groundwork, each side is ramping up tariffs which have been particularly hard on American farmers.</p><p>Joining us right now is Wisconsin congressman and member of the House Financial Services Committee, Sean Duffy. Congressman, it's good to see you, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R-WI): Hey, thanks, Maria, good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, a lot to talk about with you, given the fact that you have announced your retirement. We are sorry to hear that. But first, give us your sense of Wisconsin farmers and where they stand now, that we are several months into this, or a year into this trade fight with China, and the impact has been pretty hard.</p><p>DUFFY: Yes, so it depends on what kind of farmers we're talking about. In Wisconsin, we have a lot of dairy, and we sell some milk and some dairy products to China, but we don't have a huge market in China, so it hasn't had a real impact, the negotiations with China, on dairy farmers.</p><p>But, you know, we also have a problem in dairy, altogether, because, you know, we have -- we have more milk and, you know, less people are consuming milk, and you have to supply the ban problem which has affected our dairy farmers.</p><p>But, I think, across the Ag industry, it's been somewhat painful, and that's what the president has tried to take some of the tariff revenue. Recently, Sonny Perdue and the president took $16 billion, there's a payout going to our farmers in Wisconsin. Here, we grow the premier ginseng in the world, we're like the -- we're like the Napa Valley of ginseng and cranberries.</p><p>So, the president is making sure that, you know, especially crops and our larger farmers are being taken care of, you know, with the payout from revenue from the tariffs. So, it's not great. But let me tell you what, the farmers actually are standing with the president.</p><p>They understand the threat of China, and so there is some pain that's coming to them. They understand the rising threat that this country has to our long-term freedom and democracy and our status as a global leader.</p><p>And they wrap that American flag -- that American flag around them, and they support the president, and they want the president to support them and make sure they can weather the storm, and he has thus far. And that's why --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DUFFY: -- I think our farmer are still with him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, let me -- let me switch gears because, also, pain has been felt in the Republicans ranks, the congressional shake-up we want to talk about. Texas Republican Bill Flores says he will not run for re- election, making him the fifth Republican retirement in the state.</p><p>Your fellow Wisconsin congressman Jim Sensenbrenner announced his retirement after 21 years, and you are leaving later this month, you say, to spend more time with your family. Congratulations on your ninth child that you are expecting, with your wife, Rachel, we are all big fans of you and Rachel.</p><p>But, to leave now, Congressman, while you've got all these other retirements happening now, the Republicans will have to do another special election. You couldn't wait a year.</p><p>DUFFY: Yes, so, first of all, I mean, Jim Sensenbrenner is the second longest serving member of the Congress. He was there for 42 years, 21 terms. He's the dean of our delegation. I think -- I mean, listen, for a lot of them, not me, but I mean, the minority is not fun. And this progressive liberal agenda --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, good point.</p><p>DUFFY: -- for a lot of members. Now, I look at our members who are retiring, like Jim Sensenbrenner, he's in the suburbs of Milwaukee. It is -- it's a really Republican seat, mine is a Republican seat. I mean, will hurt in Texas. That's a tough seat for us to hold, but a lot of the retirements, Bill Flores, these are, you know, Republican seats that we will hold.</p><p>And by the way, Maria, and we'll step back to mine, in a second, but like Jim Sensenbrenner, the suburbs of Milwaukee, that is a huge influence on the presidential election in November of next year because, you know, Jim Sensenbrenner was a known entity.</p><p>People didn't have to rally to come out and vote for him. When you have a race with a new Republican and a new Democrat, that is only going to improve the turnout, not only for the Republican candidate to replace Sensenbrenner, but to drive votes up for President Trump. And that's the area that's been soft in Wisconsin, in the polling, and in the last election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DUFFY: So, if he's -- traditional Republicans turn up because of Sensenbrenner's retirement, Trump is in a better position to win our state. For me, our little baby --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Emily, you're from Wisconsin, right?</p><p>JASHINSKY: Yes, yes, I'm from Wisconsin, just got back from your district, Congressman, beautiful district, when you announced your retirement, I think a lot of people were, obviously, surprised and disappointed, but you had to come out and say, like, listen, my future is not over, I will be back.</p><p>Is that the case do you expect that you will continue to have a political future in Wisconsin, whether that would be pursuing seats that may be open in the very near future or you're looking further down the road even.</p><p>DUFFY: Yes, that's a good question. You know, for me, I'm focused on my family, right now, we're going to have a baby that's going to need open heart surgery. Our congressional counters are really aggressive.</p><p>And if you want to serve people well, I mean, you've got to have that kind of heart and passion, you know, into the job, and I felt like my family is going to need me a little bit more, listen, I'm 48 years old, 7 years old, I can't retire right now. I'm going to have to do something, but something that's not that schedule in Congress.</p><p>But once I get my family healthy, I don't know what my future holds, I'm just going to focus on family now and see what comes around the corner. But, listen, I'm hopeful for our state, and I think, you know, we have a -- we have a great deep bench in Wisconsin.</p><p>And, you know, I think this is only going to benefit from my seat and Sensenbrenner's seat is going to help Donald Trump win in 2020.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman, it's Dagen, I just want to say to you and Rachel, and your whole family, this is a -- this a choice that, virtually, every American has made or will have to make or is making, right now, about, do you give up your job, and what you love, temporarily, take a break, to spend time with your family in need.</p><p>And I hope that you guys continue to talk about that. Because these are days you don't get back, right?</p><p>DUFFY: No, you don't get back. And you know what? Listen, this is -- this is the greatest fight of our generation. I mean, this is -- this is a battle between free enterprise and capitalism versus socialism. I love that fight because I believe in the American model that has made this country so great and so prosperous, and so innovative, and so generous. I love that.</p><p>And I want to fight to preserve it. But, if you don't first fight to, you know, keep your family strong, you know, what do you -- what do you have? I mean, our whole country is built on the strength of our family. And so, I got to tell you, it was -- it was -- it was sad to say goodbye.</p><p>It was sad to, you know, write the Facebook post that I put out and say I'm going to -- I'm going to step aside, right now, because I've worked so hard and I'm so passionate about what I'm doing. But my family needs me, I got to -- I'm going to have a different schedule, and so that's the choice that I made and, you know, who knows what the future holds.</p><p>But I got to tell you, what I -- whether we're talking about trade or the economy or taxes or regulation. I think the things that we have done have made our family stronger, have made our economy stronger, and, you know, I'm very hopeful for the Republican Party to continue those policies as opposed to this progressive socialist left that's being pushed by the Democrats.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: Congressman, last question, we're talking about those retirements and you said it's no fun being in the minority. Should we read most of those departures as people saying there's no realistic chance of the House going Republican next fall?</p><p>DUFFY: I don't think so. Actually, I think if Trump wins, I think we have a great shot of winning the House, you know, but so I -- Bill Flores and I came in together, and where we've been, we've served, and they're 8-1/2 years. Bill will be there 10 years.</p><p>I think what's unique is people are saying I'm not -- I'm not a lifetime member of Congress. Service is not for a lifetime. I'm going to come in. I'm going to serve. I'm going to give my talents to my country and the people I represent. And then, I'm going to do something else.</p><p>So, I think this is, you know, just a natural transition that happens, you know, in the House, and especially with Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DUFFY: We have better transition than Democrats. Democrats stick around forever. We come in and we go out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, I know this must have been a hard and emotional decision for you. Congratulations to you and we are wishing you the best with your ninth child on the way.</p><p>DUFFY: Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, good to see you, sir. Sean Duffy there. We'll be right back with the ADP numbers after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news, the August ADP report due out moments from now. Economists are expecting 149,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of August. This is the ADP report which gives us a sense of what we could expect from the jobs' report coming out tomorrow, which is from the Labor Department.</p><p>There were expecting 160,000 jobs -- 158, actually. 158,000 jobs added to the economy for the month of August. This is an important report, this ADP number. Obviously, the jobs picture has stayed strong in the face of the uncertainty around tariffs.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, and this is more hard data. Some of the disturbing news lately has been surveys, whereas this is a little more concrete number. Now, Steve Auth was telling us earlier that August can be kind of quirky. So, maybe we don't want to overreact one way or another, but this is important hard data on the health of the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The number is out. Let's get to Deirdre Bolton. Deirdre?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Yes, I was going to say we can overreact. This is 195,000, and if you look at what economists were expecting, 149,000. So much better than expected. And Maria, as you alluded to, this is such a key data point ahead of tomorrow's figure. Just rounding out how strong our economy is. Many people told me if there were a miss on this figure, it would have ruffled a lot of feathers, especially given that manufacturing data that we got yesterday, which was the worst since 2016. So, 195,000 beating estimates of 149,000.</p><p>I also just want to flash out what we saw last month as well. And it's backing up the same sort of pattern, because you'll remember from July, that 156,000 number, super strong and services jobs. Similar pattern coming in here, and of course, this spins forward, as I mentioned to tomorrow, but then also, what the Fed does with this number on September 17th and 18th. We'll watch the yields. But the main point here is a beat, so it should help push the Futures even higher this morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Deirdre. I mean, we got a market that has stayed strong. But you wonder what a number like this does for the Federal Reserve thinking, because they're going to be meeting on September 18th. And there were expectations as 25 basis point cut, but even as high as 50 basis points. So, does this number -- is this number strong enough to get the Fed to stand down? Or ...</p><p>FREEMAN: It should be. What's the argument? We're in a low inflation environment, we've got interest rates just a little above inflation. So, as you would expect, you get some return for lending people money. I -- now, yes, this is one month. And as we said, August can be an outlier or surprising, but I don't see the argument. This is -- this is a generally healthy economy with some notes of concern, but ...</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I can give you the argument. That you still have the three-month Treasury higher -- the yield higher than the 10-year, it's been that way since late May. I think Charlie Brady emailed me earlier today about it's 48 basis points. So, 0.48 percentage -- percent. That's how much the inversion is. So, it's almost half of one percent.</p><p>If you want to rectify that inversion, when you have the 10-year yield, what it was at 1.52 percent, that the Fed funds rate is about half a percentage point higher than the -- than the 10-year yield. So, if you want to actually make it -- give banks the ability to lend money and make money from the short end to the long end, you have borrowing on the long end, lending out on the longer -- on the short end, lending out on the longer end, then they need to rectify that because the banking system doesn't really work that well.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, you -- no, no, no, no. Cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting, as we've seen in Europe is not the path to a healthy banking system, right? They've gone all the way -- it's now 17 trillion and negative rate instruments around the world ...</p><p>MCDOWELL: But we're not -- but we're not Germany, because Germany, what has a fiscal surplus, they haven't done something on the fiscal side, when it's all been focused on monetary policy. This wouldn't take us to negative. This would basically straighten out what is in the upside down world in yields at this point.</p><p>FREEMAN: We have a healthy -- this says we have a healthy economy. It's not growing as fast as we'd like it. Obviously, it's been slower in this part of the year than earlier in the year, but the economy is growing, the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Consumer is strong.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- rates are historically low.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But you don't believe in -- so, are you saying that the bond market is wrong, the Treasury market is wrong? Because the Treasury market is saying the return rates are too high.</p><p>FREEMAN: That's a really -- that's a really interesting signal. And if you look at the history, we should take it seriously, but as a guide, the interest rate policy, I mean, they're obviously part of the downward pull on rates, is all of that negative yielding stuff that's being issued in Europe and Asia, right? So, this is a complicated picture. What we can say with certainty is, to this point, we have a growing economy, we have a good job market, wages are rising, consumers are spending.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But we have manufacturing that's contracting. And at least last month, maybe it's a one off that's according to the ISM, there's weakness in business investment. This is -- you don't believe that a mid-cycle correction is needed in terms of monetary policy. Because again, the rate cut that we got in July was just a correction of the rate increase we got in December.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, we're back to what has been the argument is that uncertainty is a cause of -- is a need to cut rates. I don't -- I don't see that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, yes, it's the uncertainty, what could happen, you know?</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The anticipation of what could happen rather than what we're seeing at because the numbers are pretty good so far, except for when you look at CapEx, when you look at manufacturing, some housing weakness as well. We'll keep talking about that. The ADP number has not moved markets. We continue to see a 238-point rally in the Dow Industrials. We're going to take a short break, and then we're going to take you on Dorian's path of destruction. The death toll rising in the Bahamas, as rescue teams work around the clock. Plus, B-Strong founder Bethenny Frankel joins me next on her foundation's hurricane relief efforts. Then shares of Slack are sliding this morning. It posted first-quarter report. The first report as a public company and it is disappointment. The stock is down 13-3/4 percent. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Hurricane Dorian again a category 3 storm, turning toward the Carolinas. The area bracing for life, threatening storm surges and jam damaging winds. Jeff Flock is live this morning in Charleston, South Carolina. Jeff?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Good news and bad news though, Maria. Here's the good news, we got the turn, the 8:00 advisory and the radar that I've seen, indicates the turn has now been made. It's now moving to the northeast that means a way from the South Carolina coast. Doesn't mean we're out of the woods, but it means less wind and less search potential. However, rain, that's a bad news. We're still getting plenty of rain. It also -- we could still -- and the sun is up, by the way. We still could get a landfall in North Carolina.</p><p>By the way, this is a spot on which Hurricane Hugo back in 1989 hit here in South -- in South Carolina in Charleston. 26 dead there. That's a plaque to commemorate them. I want to show you Charleston Harbor, though. We come up the -- up the steps here. This is where the two rivers come together. They actually in the cooper. I tell you, anytime you got white caps in the harbor, it's not a good day. But as I said, the good news is it appears now the center of circulation is moving away from us. That's a positive. Still headed to the north to North Carolina. We could get a landfall there, although it's not forecast. But that's a good news for now. And as you can tell, we're not getting as much wind right now, so that's a positive way. The latest, Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Jeff. Jeff Flock, he's in Charleston, South Carolina this morning, as you can see, where the weather is just horrible. What do you think is worse, Jeff, is it the -- is it the winds or is it the rain and are you -- what time are you expecting things to worsen?</p><p>FLOCK: Well, here in Charleston, the worst is going to be the rain and the water, specifically, because this is the -- what they call the \"low country\" and Charleston is surrounded by water. This is what they call the battery. I don't know. Hey, Martin, can you show Maria, this is what they call the battery. This goes back to civil war, you know, defense. And this is a kind of a point out into the harbor. That's the harbor out there, and surrounded by water. When you get a whole lot of rain -- think you're talking about a foot of rain. If we get all that, you can have huge flooding. The high tide is at, I believe, just before 2:00 this afternoon. So, that is probably your worst point in terms of flooding and potential surge.</p><p>FREEMAN: Hi, Jeff, James Freeman here at The Journal. Great news about the turn to the Northeast. As far as the flooding, though, which has still could be significant, you were showing the plaques of earlier storms. Do some of that experience mean that the Carolinas are maybe a little better prepared this time than previous ones?</p><p>FLOCK: Oh, that's right, James, I think you're absolutely right. I mean, these people have been down this road now many times. And, you know, you just look -- people, you wonder why their shutters at homes in the -- along the Carolinas, those are storm shutters where there's not storm shutters you can see off to the right there, they're boards. These people isn't their first rodeo here. And you're absolutely right, they are much better prepared now for a storm that they would have been in the past. I mean, you have to prepare for the worst because this was a cat 5 at one point. It's cat 3 again. Cat 3 storms a pretty strong storm. So, if you had that center of circulation here, I wouldn't be standing here right now. You know, you couldn't stand out in those kind of conditions. We're not even getting category 1 conditions right now. And that's a major part.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. Jeff, anybody?</p><p>JASHINSKY: Yes, this is an experienced group people in Charleston. Jeff, do you get the sense that most people have made the decision to evacuate or a lot of people sticking around town and trying to weather it out in Charleston, as opposed to sort of getting out and getting out of harm's way?</p><p>FLOCK: Yes, I think a lot of people stuck it out. You know, we don't see them right now because the winds starting to maybe pick up again, but we had a little bit of a lull there. And a lot of people came down here just to see -- you know, the battery is a place you come down to in Charleston to see. OK, how bad is it? Is it flooding down here? If it's flooding down here, things are going to be bad. But no, I think a lot of people stayed because, you know, they were watching the reports and, you know, this track has been very consistent all the way. You know, it never forecast a landfall along the coast.</p><p>And, you know, people I think that -- took that to heart. You know, this was a pretty good job of predicting. I think we're getting a lot better at this. But, of course, unfortunately, we've had a lot more experience with it because we've had so many storms. And now, you know, cat 5 storm out there. Boy, those kind of things are just as we saw in the Bahamas. Can you imagine that that thing come to a place like Charleston? It would have been incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it totally skipped Florida, you know, in the face of expectations otherwise.</p><p>FLOCK: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jeff, thank you.</p><p>FLOCK: You know, Florida is so built up, it's incredible. And you know, if you had a big storm, it's only a matter of time. When it hits there, boy, all bets are off.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Jeff, thank you. Jeff Flock is in Charleston this morning.</p><p>And our next guest is focusing on hurricane relief efforts, raising money and helping residents get basic needs. Joining us right now on the telephone is B-Strong founder entrepreneur and philanthropist, Bethenny Frankel. And Bethany, thanks very much for joining us this morning. What can you tell us in terms of your own efforts?</p><p>BETHENNY FRANKEL, FOUNDER, B-STRONG: I can tell you that we are probably in excess of $750,000 raised in just three days. That it really -- that by $20.00 donations at a time, that people are coming in droves. We can't keep them into donations or every single minute. I am at my daughter's schoolyard right now so I came back just to be with her to let her -- to send her off to school and then I'm going back. We are -- if you saw my Insta Story, we're sending multiple missions today, multiple planes, search-and-rescue, we have people's coordinates.</p><p>We are, you know, using chainsaws to get people out. We have -- we have dirt bikes, we have rafts, it's kind of that free beginning where it's not about clothing and it's not about the things, diapers, it's about getting people to safety, and finding people. I'm getting e-mails with people who've lost family members, they can't find them.</p><p>The death toll is not what -- it's been told the score was, I said days ago, it's the worst disaster we've ever seen. It decimated -- the Bahamian Government being really cooperative and we are just on the ground now and it's hard -- it's not -- can't get planes in because -- most planes can't get in because there are no places to land now.</p><p>The people are landing in different parts of Bahamas -- The Bahamas where there's a safe haven where people are taking people to Nassau and other islands. Sorry about the noise. I'm literally in my daughter' schoolyard. But we have C planes, so that's how we're sending eight missions in today, and keep donating. We have a warehouse on the ground in Miami. We're amassing the nation's relief like we did for, Maria, in Puerto Rico.</p><p>And we are distributing by barges also. We're preparing for our barge, but this is -- the first leg is planes every day now mission after mission helping people and finding out exactly what we need, bringing generators over, Harp. The very, very basic needs just for a disaster and a catastrophe like this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are there disasters happening more in the residential areas or hotels? Obviously, the Bahamas is a big tourist area. For --</p><p>FRANKEL: The Bahamas is very flat.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FRANKEL: The Bahamas is flat, and this area in particular, it's not the entire Bahamas, this area in particular is flat, so it's not like Puerto Rico where there are mountains and other places so it's pretty decimated.</p><p>JASHINSKY: Bethenny, you obviously dealt with the aftermath of the hurricane in Puerto Rico. I'm wondering what ongoing threats to people's safety on the grounds exist in the Bahamas right now because it's not necessarily, of course, just when the storm hits, there can be a lot of threats to people's safety in the aftermath. Are you --are you dealing with any of those threats? What do they look like?</p><p>FRANKEL: There have been some threats and there have been moving and things like that, but right now, it's -- we started Puerto Rico, Maria, nine days later. We are in so early that we're, like, in the very beginning where you're just kind of figuring out what's going on, you're assessing the damages, assessing where people are, their coordinate, and how to just -- how to help, how to get people out, how to get people medical assistance, people need influence, people having the generators, they're on dialysis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>FRANKEL: I mean this is -- this is a basic bare-bone, like, destination ground zero right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bethenny, thank you for efforts. Thanks for joining us this morning. Bethenny Frankel on the Bahamas. Coming up, Wall Street's rallying on the trade optimism. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are rallying this morning. Futures indicating a gain of 250 points on the Dow right after -- out of the gate this morning on news that the U.S. and China have agreed to resume high level trade talks in early October in Washington.</p><p>The latest round, the 15 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, took effect on Sunday, and President Trump spoke about the latest negotiations with China yesterday at the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And let me tell you, if I wanted to do nothing with China, my stock market, our stock market, would be 10,000 points higher than it is right now. But somebody had to do this. To me, this is much more important than the economy. So, we'll see what happens. If they want to make a deal, they'll make a deal. If they don't want to make a deal, that's fine, but I can tell you they're having one of the worst -- I guess the worst on record, and they want to make a deal. And if I were them, I'd want to make a deal, too, but we'll see what happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And joining me right is Laffer Associates Chairman, Former Reagan Economic Adviser, Art Laffer. And Art, it is always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for joining me.</p><p>ART LAFFER, FORMER REAGAN ECONOMIC ADVISER: My pleasure, Maria, thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's not just what no deal has done to the market, your expectations are, if we do get a deal, it's going to be huge for the market. What are you expecting?</p><p>LAFFER: I think he's running about 10,000 on the Dow. I mean that's grabbed -- pulled out of a hat, but frankly it's a huge thing for that because it starts having a dynamic consequence with the rest of the world, Japan, South Korea, Europe, everywhere in the world will start doing deals and it'll be like the Kennedy Round tariff negotiation was and that was one of the most spectacular policy events ever. It rocketed the U.S. economy during the Kennedy era, and this is the same type of thing with Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you think that the Dow is, right now, at 26,625, you think if we get a deal with China, we could see this market go all the way up to 36,000? Another 10,000 points on the Dow?</p><p>LAFFER: Remember, I pulled it out of a hat, but, yes, I -- it'll be really positive, and it'll be wonderful for the president, for the country, for everything, for politics. It'll take a lot of the nastiness out of the world. You know, people love working and they like being rich, and it really makes life a lot more pleasant.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So --</p><p>LAFFER: And I think that'll be part of the case. China -- we need China very much, Maria, and they need us very much. I mean it's a perfect match of comparative advantage between the two countries, and the only thing we need to do is get the impediments out of the way, the stealing of intellectual property, the transfer of technology, all of this stuff.</p><p>And by way, I'm sure there are a couple things we need to do to make it better for us and them as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LAFFER: So I'm excited, I'm excited about what they did with Hong Kong, they withdrew the legislation, the extraction tax, whatever it was for extradition -- the provision.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, the Extradition Bill.</p><p>LAFFER: And that's all very positive. I mean I'm really hoping China to come through.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That bill would have made anybody who's arrested in Hong Kong, you have to face trial in China.</p><p>LAFFER: Yes, that's the extradition and that's not true. I think Lam withdrew it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, she did. Yes, she formally withdrew it and obviously --</p><p>LAFFER: And that's wonderful.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- that sparked a big rally yesterday, but in terms -- but let's put China aside for a second, Art, because I want to get your take on really where we are in the economy today. There's the debate right now --</p><p>LAFFER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- when you look at jobs in America. We just had the ADP out, and that was 195,000 jobs added to the economy last month. We also have estimates this morning that show the August report out of the Labor Department which will be released tomorrow, show that 158,000 jobs are expected to be added to the economy in the month of August.</p><p>And the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent. How do you characterize things today?</p><p>LAFFER: That's very, very nice. I mean what's happening in the U.S. is relative to the recent past, we're slowing down a little bit, and I stress a little bit. But what's really amazing, Maria, no one talks about, is in 2016 and 2017, we were virtually the doppelganger of Europe. We moved right with them in growth rate of GDP.</p><p>All of a sudden, in the third and fourth quarter of 2017 and then through '18 and through half of '19, we've all of a sudden separated ourselves from Europe and we're way above it. We -- if we had grown at the European rate of growth, which we had been before, if we had we would have $750 billion cumulative less GDP than we have.</p><p>The tax cuts have worked, the deregulation have worked, the way to compare the U.S. is not with our past, but with all the rest of the world which is turning down rapidly and we are not and that's the most wonderful thing of good economics.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And yet this uncertainty seems to have impacted business managers' decisions in terms of capex, the uncertainty around China.</p><p>LAFFER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the unknown --</p><p>LAFFER: That's what they say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead.</p><p>LAFFER: Yes, but that's what they say, but, you know, if you look at the numbers, if you look at real GDP growth, which is the right thing, it's -- it is the measure, it's looking very good relative to the rest of the world and also, if you look at the stock market, U.S. stock market is looking very good relative to Eurozone or any of these other places, China.</p><p>I mean we're doing very well in the sea of nations that is doing very badly. And that's when you really need good economics was when everyone around you is doing badly because it keeps you from suffering the way they suffer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So before you go, Art, what's your reaction to these rock- bottom rates where we see an inversion still with the three-month and the 10-year yield, and of course you've got the Democrats, the contenders for the president's job talking about recession on the horizon. How do you see it?</p><p>LAFFER: Yes, well, what -- well, what they're seeing is they're seeing the rest of the world. I mean Germany has negative real yields. I mean you have to actually pay German Government money to lend to them. That's crazy.</p><p>Now what has happened here is the fed has been very tight on money and kept interest rates way too high and the discount rate, and if we -- they were to lower the discount rate by as much as a hundred basis points, which would put it just slightly below the five-year t bond yield, which is really still very high.</p><p>You would have, I think, a very nice market here, the reason people are going into gold is because there's no return anywhere else, the stock market's doing well, we have a strong dollar. With a strong dollar, U.S. interest rates should be much lower than the rest of the world not higher. But we're much, much higher than the rest of the world, because of the bad economic conditions abroad.</p><p>So I am very bullish on America, I'm very bullish. I don't see a recession. I don't see anything like that coming. There are no policies that would lead me to believe that. That can all change quickly, but I am very bullish, Maria, and I think it's good right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We like to hear that for sure. Art, it's great to see you, sir. Thanks so much.</p><p>LAFFER: And I love being on here with the market day one, the market's up. I mean, God, it pumps you, doesn't it?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's --</p><p>LAFFER: Isn't it wonderful?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm going to have to start to calling it the Art Laffer Indicator, so there you go. We -- and you --</p><p>LAFFER: Good, I love it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You were coming on --</p><p>LAFFER: I'll be on every time the markets' really up, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Market's up big today, 250 points. Art, we'll see you soon. Thank you, sir. Art Laffer joining us there. Coming up, the economy under President Trump, the ADP report beat expectations ahead of tomorrow's August jobs report. Market's up 263 points on the Dow. Stuart Varney weighs in next. But first, here's a special update from the Tennis Channel.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel Court Report. For FOX Business, I'm Dani Klupenger. Quarter Final action wrapped up Wednesday, and the final four are set at the 2019 U.S. Open.</p><p>It took almost four hours and five match points before Matteo Berrettini finally got past the finish line against the 33-year-old veteran, 23-year- old Gael Monfils. The 23-year-old had 15 aces, and 53 winners in what will be considered an instant classic. Berrettini becomes the first Italian man to reach the U.S. Open Semi Finals in over 42 years.</p><p>And it was business as usual for number two seed Rafael Nadal who beat Diego Schwartzman for the eighth time and as many meetings. With Roger and Novak both out, Rafa now the clear favorite to capture his fourth career U.S. Open title. That would up his major total to 19, only one behind Roger Federer.</p><p>Don't forget, tune in at midnight Eastern for Tennis Channel's coverage of the season's last Major. I am Dani Klupenger.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Jobs in America, we just got better-than- expected August ADP report, 195,000 jobs added to the economy in August. The monthly jobs report is out tomorrow. Expectations there, 158,000 jobs added to the economy in August, from the Labor Department.</p><p>The unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 3.7 percent, which is a 51-year low. Joining us right now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in. Good numbers there, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Terrific numbers. Well, let's not get carried away. They're pretty good numbers, they are solid and that's for sure. Let's get it straight. Maybe the economy is a little stronger than we thought? You know, 195,000 new private sector jobs last month, I'd call that pretty strong. And if you look at this -- I call it the firing rate, initial jobless claims 217,000, OK, that is pretty close to historic lows.</p><p>And we got consumer spending still pretty strong, I would say. You look at all the signals here, and maybe this economy is stronger than we think. I noticed that treasurer yields have started to go up, the yield on the 10- year above 150, the yield on the 30, well above two percent now. That's intriguing and it --I just think we've got to -- we're surrounded by negatives but the economy is stronger than we actually think.</p><p>And by the way, the Dow Industrials are now 1004 points away from the all- time closing high. That suggests to me that you got a pretty strong economy, stronger than we think, the market's reacting to it and so too a little bit is the bond market. What do you say?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes. No, I agree with you, Stu. We definitely are looking at a solid situation for the U.S. in the face of weakness across the world. And I know you'll have more about it. We'll see you in about 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY: You will. Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour 9:00 a.m. Eastern after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. But first, election security, technology titans Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, sitting down with U.S. Intel officials yesterday, how they plan to address potential threats of misinformation ahead of 2020.</p><p>Plus one hungry thief on the loose man, a breaks into subway sandwich shop and fixes himself a sandwich and it's all caught on camera. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Car companies teaming up to help prevent children from dying in hot cars. Lauren Simonetti with the details in headlines. Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria, an alliance of major automakers announcing an agreement to include rear seat alert systems in almost all new vehicles, this comes after more than 50 children died in hot cars last year. But the child safety group, Kids and Cars, calls the move inadequate saying the plan will give a false sense of security.</p><p>Big tech companies sitting down with U.S. officials yesterday all day to discuss ways to improve security for the 2020 Presidential Election. Security officials from Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter discuss potential threats and possible steps to prevent disinformation campaigns like the ones that rocked the 2016 election. Hilarious.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know. It was such a greatest. Oh my God. Hart, right, with protective goal.</p><p>JASHINSKY: Well, he took a bag of chips, too, so it may be more than $8.00 if you like to -- and look --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we don't -- so we don't think that he's still anything else then, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Not that I'm aware of.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh my God. All right. We got final thoughts from this all- star Washington when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Right out of the gate, we're going to see a 300- point rally in the Dow Industrials. We got the ADP number at 195,000 jobs, better than expected. Let's get some final thoughts from this all-star panel. James Freeman.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, we're going to get the NFIB report later today, see if small business jobs are telling a similar story and let's hope for progress on the trade front.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, what are you expecting there? Because there's a story in the Journal earlier in this week about smaller businesses are feeling the pinch in terms of the trade situation, right? Even the domestic companies, what the Journal wrote.</p><p>FREEMAN: So we do have some different surveys. I think that was with a firm called Vistage. This is a longer term survey, NFIB has been doing this for about 40 years. And I think it's a pretty good picture over time of the small business economy, hiring, plans to hire more, that's going to be an interesting part of the reading today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Emily, what are you looking at?</p><p>JASHINSKY: And what's a perfect segue into what I was thinking about is I'm still kind of stuck on what Congressman Duffy said about the ginseng farmers, the cranberry up in his farmers in Northern Wisconsin, that they're starting to see this trade war as a -- as a patriotic battle and they're not necessarily as upset with the president as people might expect them to be in a similar situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. They are seeing it as a patriotic battle.</p><p>JASHINSKY: You're right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good way to say it, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But that's why the president, as these negotiations resume in October, with the visit here to the United States, they have to get a deal that tackles the theft by China of not just our intellectual property, the force surrendered technology and what China has been doing through the likes of Huawei. You have to get a deal that tackles those issues, not just basically reduces our trade deficit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's also all the acquisitions they're doing, right? China has all this money, they're buying up Silicon Valley so that it's easy to get all that technology.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And funneling money into, like, UC Berkeley that they -- Berkeley kept taking the money. They couldn't anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. Don't forget about those Confucius centers. All right. We got more tomorrow. Have a great day, everybody. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins now. Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY: All right. Good morning, Maria.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019090503cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X08-FTB1-JB20-G04K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7547\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 5, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

This even after Turkey had launched a military offensive into the country, threatening America's allies on the ground. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle slammed the move claiming the U.S. is abandoned Kurdish forces who helped the United States fight ISIS in the region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: A day later, President Trump took executive action to impose sanctions against Turkish government leaders and then sent Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Turkey to try to broker a cease-fire. All of that unfolded. The Ukraine scandal was in front and center in Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Capitol Hill, sources tell CNN, Trump's former top Russia adviser, Fiona Hill, testified that Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was pursuing a, quote, shadow foreign policy to benefit Trump. Meanwhile, \"The Wall Street Journal\" began reporting that federal investigators here in New York City are examining Rudy Giuliani's business dealings with Ukraine, as well as his bank records.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Stay with us. We're only on Tuesday.</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence said he was not turning over documents related to his role in the Ukraine scandal, and Rudy Giuliani said he did not plan to comply with House subpoenas either. Meanwhile, State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent testified under oath that a supervisor told him to lie low after he raised complaints, as others did, about Rudy Giuliani's personal efforts in Ukraine.</p><p>HARLOW: All right, we've made it to Wednesday.</p><p>So, on Wednesday, the House voted to condemn the president's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria. By the way, with over 100 Republicans in the House joining in that chorus.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: Just a little while later, top Democrats walked out of a White House meeting after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Trump had a, quote, meltdown that she believes was prompted by that vote.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): He was shaken up by it. And that's why we couldn't continue in the meeting because he was just not relating to the reality of it.</p><p>What we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown. Sad to say.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCIUTTO: Even Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of President Trump, called the decision to remove U.S. troops from northern Syria, quote, the biggest mistake of Trump's presidency. That's significant.</p><p>As frustration mounted over the crisis in Syria, former State Department official Michael McKinley, he was testifying before Congress. A source familiar with the hearing says McKinley resigned, after 37 years, over frustration that career diplomats were being undermined. They weren't being backed up.</p><p>HARLOW: And then yesterday, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told a room full of journalists that aid to Ukraine was, in fact, tied to the president's wish for an investigation into the 2016 election.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I have news for everybody. Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: A few hours later, Mulvaney walked back those comments amid reports that Trump's legal team was, quote, stunned and the president was frustrated by the briefing.</p><p>SCIUTTO: And, by the way, what they're talking about investigating the 2016 election is a conspiracy theory that somehow the Ukrainians have the DNC server. It's just not based in fact.</p><p>Earlier in the day, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, broke with the president as he testified again under oath, before three House committees saying the president directed diplomats to work only with Giuliani, his personal lawyer, on Ukraine. Vice President Pence then announced that Turkey agreed to a cease-fire in Syria, a claim that Turkish officials challenge saying it was not a cease-fire, just a pause.</p><p>HARLOW: Five days, folks. Just this week, all of that happened. It's a lot to absorb, but it all matters. And we will stay on top of all of it right here.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Still to come, mocking remarks from former Defense Secretary James Mattis, laughing off reports that President Trump called him the world's most overrated general. He had some zingers to sling back. We'll hear from Mattis, next.</p><p>[09:38:53]</p><p>SCIUTTO: Over the past 24 hours, two high-profile retired members of the military have taken harsh jabs at the president. Retired Admiral William McRaven, the architect of the bin Laden raid, wrote a \"New York Times\" op-ed saying, our republic is under attack from the president. Think of that. That -- the significance, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: I -- you know, in the midst of things.</p><p>HARLOW: Huge.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Can't be -- can't be missed.</p><p>HARLOW: You're completely right. And then, at a dinner in New York last night, former Secretary of Defense James Mattis mocked the president, laughing off reports that the president apparently called him the world's most overrated general.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GENERAL JAMES MATTIS, FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY: I'm not just an overrated general. I am the greatest, the world's most overrated.</p><p>And I'm honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress. So I guess I'm the Meryl Streep of generals.</p><p>I earned my spurs on the battlefield, Martin, as you pointed out, and Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor. So --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:40:01]</p><p>HARLOW: Let's talk about all of this because it really isn't a laughing matter, but sometimes, I suppose, there's nothing else you can do at moments.</p><p>Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton, of course, of Massachusetts. He serves on the Armed Services Committee. He served four tours in the Marine Corps in Iraq.</p><p>Good morning, Congressman. Thank you for being here.</p><p>REP. SETH MOULTON, (D-MA): Good morning.</p><p>HARLOW: Obviously, as Jim said, we were very struck by the op-ed that admiral -- retired Admiral William McRaven wrote. Let's listen to a little bit of what he told our Jake Tapper.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADM. WILLIAM MCRAVEN (RET.), FORMER COMMANDER OF U.S. SPECIAL OPERATIONS: You know, if you want to destroy an organization, any organization, you destroy it from within, you destroy it from without and then what you do is you convince everybody that you're doing the right thing. So when you take a look at what the president has done, he's undermined the intelligence community, the law enforcement community, the Department of Justice, the State Department.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: What do you make of what he said in this moment that the country finds itself in?</p><p>MOULTON: Well, he's absolutely right. And it shows that, you know, you don't have to be on the -- on the far left of the political spectrum to think that Donald Trump needs to go. It's one of the reasons why I've supported moving forward with an impeachment inquiry for a long time. But now the national security implications are front and center. And that's why you have people like Admiral McRaven speaking out. We haven't heard too much from Secretary Mattis yet. But I think we'll probably start hearing more. Maybe his joke was a sort of tease of more to come.</p><p>But it's clear that across the political spectrum people are finally finding the courage to stand up and say there's something more at stake than the future of Republican politics. It's the future of our republic.</p><p>SCIUTTO: OK. That said, the number of Republicans, as you know, who have publicly criticized this president are few and far between. And I do want to give credit to folks who have been willing to set aside politics and speak their minds. But, as you know, it's still an endangered species here.</p><p>I speak to Republicans who privately will say, listen, yes, he's doing great damage, but they have political calculations to make.</p><p>I just wonder, from your perch, because you have good relationships with many Republican members, some of them veterans like yourself, do you sense their mood changing at all or their willingness to come out and say, listen, he's gone too far this time?</p><p>MOULTON: I think the mood is changing a little bit, but their willingness to come out, I mean, as you said, Jim, we haven't seen much of it.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes.</p><p>MOULTON: And I mean even people like Lindsey Graham, who are out there criticizing the president for betraying our Kurdish allies, he's still working to get him re-elected. He's still working to continue the Trump presidency, the Trump administration policies. So there's a lot of hypocrisy on the right for sure and not a lot of courage.</p><p>HARLOW: Speaking of General Mattis, on that point, Congressman, let's listen to a little bit more of what he said, harkening back to President Lincoln.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GENERAL JAMES MATTIS, FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY: No, Lincoln went on, it was not the foreign aggressor we must fear. It was corrosion from within. The rot (ph), the viciousness, the lassitude, the ignorance. Anarchy is one potential consequence of this. Another is the rise of an ambitious leader unfettered by conscience or precedent or decency who would make himself supreme.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: On that front, as someone who has served multiple tours overseas, what does all of this do, not just domestically to the country, but what message does it send to our allies and perhaps, more importantly, our adversaries overseas, especially seeing what we just saw play out in Turkey yesterday?</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes.</p><p>MOULTON: It sends a message that America doesn't keep its word. That the values that we've always championed, that our country was founded upon, just don't seem to matter, at least not to this president. And that's an incredibly dangerous message for our allies across the globe, for our troops who are risking their lives every single day on the ground and many of whom now feel betrayed by their own commander in chief. And it's a dangerous message for our enemies.</p><p>You know, I served under General Mattis in the Marine Corps and our division motto was no better friend, no worse enemy than the United States Marines. That should be the motto of the United States. That means that our allies trust us and our enemies trust our resolve.</p><p>SCIUTTO: So when you look at the results on the ground of this withdrawal, Russia and Iran, frankly, moving in to fill the void. But also, and I think something that folks at home can relate to, if all those issues seem too distant, hundreds of ISIS fighters, terrorists freed now.</p><p>What -- what danger does that immediate consequence of this decision posed to people at home as they're watching?</p><p>MOULTON: I mean, look, I don't want to exaggerate it, but it's a real danger. We worked very hard. We lost lives putting these ISIS terrorists in prison. And now they're just running free.</p><p>[09:45:08]</p><p>And the beneficiaries of this absolutely are Russia. They're Iran. They're Erdogan in Turkey, who seems to be Putin's protege. And it's Assad.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes.</p><p>MOULTON: You know, the butcher of Syria. The people who look bad are us and our allies. And this is going to have an effect, not just in the Middle East. It's going to have an effect on the Korean peninsula. Don't think Kim Jong-un isn't watching this and planning his next move against South Korea. Don't think Iran is not watching this and planning their next attack.</p><p>Sadly, I think we're going to see this, the implications of this, and the damage that it's done to our credibility across the globe play out sooner than later.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Those are sobering words.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: But there's no question they watch and listen.</p><p>Congressman Moulton, we appreciate your service and we appreciate your straight talk.</p><p>MOULTON: Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you, Congressman.</p><p>We're going to take a quick break. We're back after this with much more.</p><p>[09:50:45]</p><p>HARLOW: All right, Mark Zuckerberg is on the road defending FaceBook amid a flurry of criticism over the decision to run false campaign ads on the platform. Last night in Washington, he said he will not restrict freedom of expression.</p><p>Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, FACEBOOK: We are at another crossroads. We can either continue to stand for free expression, understanding its messiness, but believing that the long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us, or we can decide that the cost is simply too great.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: But not every CEO in Silicon Valley sees it that way at all, including Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff. I sat down with him this week for a wide-ranging discussion as he releases his new book \"Trailblazer.\"</p><p>And not only does he calls out FaceBook, he calls out capitalism, saying, unequivocally, capitalism is dead. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Marc, you say capitalism as we know is dead. That's saying a lot coming from a billionaire who made his money through capitalism.</p><p>So, why did it die and when did it die?</p><p>MARC BENIOFF, FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN AND CO-CEO, SALESFORCE: We do need a new capitalism. Capitalism is dead. We need a new, more sustainable, a more equitable, more fair capitalism. And that means it's a capitalism built on stakeholders, not just shareholders.</p><p>By the way, the government can have a role here. They can ask companies, probably in the SEC reporting --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>BENIOFF: To not only deliver your numbers, but what about your stakeholder results.</p><p>HARLOW: Bernie Sanders, he was asked if he thought billionaires should exist in the United States, and he said, quote, I hope the day comes when they don't.</p><p>You're a billionaire. Should they exist?</p><p>BENIOFF: I certainly think that people should pay more tax -- income taxes at higher levels. And are those tax rates fair today? I don't think they are.</p><p>HARLOW: So what should your wealth, your capital gains wealth, for example, be taxed at? What's fair, 50, 60, 70 percent, Marc.</p><p>BENIOFF: Well, I think you can look at the traditional tax rates I think actually have been quite fair. And if you look at global tax rates and where other countries tax the superrich, that's, I think, those are fair rates. So you can look at those numbers.</p><p>HARLOW: Seventy percent in France.</p><p>BENIOFF: You can look at different countries. That's the most extreme.</p><p>HARLOW: But you'd pay it, you're saying?</p><p>BENIOFF: Well, I think that we -- we should have the conversation.</p><p>HARLOW: Fair enough.</p><p>A wealth tax. This was talked about on the debate stage quite a lot this week. Do you think a wealth fax is the solution? Elizabeth Warren says it is.</p><p>BENIOFF: Well, I'm looking for more systemic change. I'm not looking for transactional solutions. I think transactional solutions are a mistake. Things that are surgical I think are actually inappropriate and will exacerbate the problem.</p><p>I think we should be looking for ways to actually create a new capitalism. I want to have an approach based on all stakeholders. My responsibility isn't just to the shareholders in the company, but to all of those stakeholders.</p><p>HARLOW: Breaking up big tech. It's a popular line on the campaign trail. We heard it on the debate stage. Do you support it?</p><p>BENIOFF: FaceBook is the new cigarettes. We've talked about this before. It's addictive. It's not good for you. They're after your kids. They're running political ads that aren't true. They're giving your data to tens of thousands of organization without your knowledge. And they're also acquiring other companies and commingling their data into theirs. And I think at that point, because they're now doing that, that they probably should be broken up, because they're --</p><p>HARLOW: How does breaking it up fix that?</p><p>BENIOFF: They're creating undue influence as the largest social media platform on the planet.</p><p>HARLOW: They're response, we've heard Mark Zuckerberg and leadership there say is, if you break us up, you just make us less powerful to combat, election interference and what was done in the 2016 election.</p><p>Is that a salient argument?</p><p>BENIOFF: No, it's not because what really the narrative is, is trust is our highest priority. Why they can't say that trust is our highest value is beyond me.</p><p>HARLOW: Right now, on FaceBook, on YouTube, on Twitter is a false Trump campaign ad that is running with no false things that it says about Joe Biden, et cetera.</p><p>[09:55:00]</p><p>FaceBook says they're following FCC law that applies to broadcasters. And, frankly, there's no regulation for them in their ads. They're not a broadcaster. But they say sort of we're following the law as we know it.</p><p>Are they making the right call?</p><p>BENIOFF: This is why I think Congress is trying to act to create truth in advertising. I think this is extremely important in the age of social media. Because they have the information of who those persuadables are. And those various political organizations are targeting those groups. That's the insight from the 2016 election. It's a very vulnerable moment right now.</p><p>HARLOW: Would you run these ads if you were running FaceBook?</p><p>BENIOFF: No.</p><p>HARLOW: No question about it?</p><p>BENIOFF: No question.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) HARLOW: Pretty clear there.</p><p>You can hear that full conversation on my podcast this morning, \"Boss Files.\"</p><p>We have a lot more ahead. Lots of headlines. Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier
