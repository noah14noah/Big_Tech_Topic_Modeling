I'm Deirdre Bolton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Strong earnings results pushing tech stocks to new levels. Our market bull, our market bear with me now with their next moves. Market bull, Michael Lee, market bear Michael Chadwick.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Michael Lee on the bullish side. Alphabet, formerly known as Google. Amazon, Microsoft all exceeding expectations, is there a worry to you, even as a bull that only three to four stocks are really pushing this rally and everyone else is just jumping on a few winners?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MICHAEL LEE, TIGER WEALTH MANAGEMENT FOUNDER &amp; MANAGING PARTNER: Well, what I would say here is these stocks are going push it higher because they're exceptional, and that's why they're going higher.</p><p>Google, if you look at them, they have over a billion users on six different platforms, and they're really just -- they're executing on a really high level now. Valuation with Google as with Microsoft one of the other big tech stocks that traded well today, you can look a little closer at, but Amazon and Facebook are almost impossible to value</p><p>And what I mean by that is Amazon is doing $100 billion a year in revenue, and growing at 20 to 25 percent, I mean, how do you put a number on that? And their goal is really not to make money. They're investing in all through it new technology.</p><p>And then Facebook, you know, not quickly the same top line of revenue, 15, around 15 to 16 billion, but they're growing the revenue at 35 to 40 percent. So, it's really difficult to value those stocks, but I would say that when you have an exceptional business model and you're best in class that you're going to deserve a premium.</p><p>And, you know, they say tech leads the market, I'm very bullish on the U.S. economy. And so, I think this is a good sign for things to come.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Michael Chadwick, what the chances this is a bear market trap?</p><p>MICHAEL CHADWICK, CHADWICK FINANCIAL ADVISORS CEO: I think the chances are at a very, very high. In fact, as you said earlier, you've got four or five big names leading the market. Where is the overall participation? And in fact, yesterday, there was 1.7 stocks up for every stock down.</p><p>Now, on a big day, where the market is up 2, 3 percent, that's horrible participation. The reality is, those are great businesses. Valuations are out of hand on some of them, others are reasonable. But the reality is the economy runs on more than four businesses, and if we don't get the broad base and start catching up to these hot, hot names, then we're going to have a big bear trap.</p><p>And I think people need to be cautious, as Mike said, about valuations. People aren't thinking about valuations. And let's step back two days, what drove this rally? Draghi yesterday, and then China overnight.</p><p>So, once again, we're back to people acting like Pavlov's dogs and running on stimulus hopes. We're not running on fundamentals here. We're running on pipe dreams on accomplishing value.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Well, I agree that obviously there are some macro moves and central banks are being supportive. But that said, at least for the three stocks we're talking about, they did actually exceed earnings expectation.</p><p>But I want to stay on the tech stock theme, because it's allowing one founder to give back to his employees. Twitter co-founder CEO, Jack Dorsey giving a third of his company stock to an employee equity pool. That by the way, is worth around $200 million, fittingly he announced it on Twitter.</p><p>He wrote, \"I'm giving one-third of my Twitter stock, exactly 1 percent of the company to our employee equity pool to reinvest directly in our people. As for me, I would rather have a smaller part of something big than a bigger part of something small. I am confident we will make Twitter big.\"</p><p>So, Michael Lee, do you see this as incentive? I mean, this follows decision to cut jobs at Twitter following Dorsey retaking the CEO position, is this his insurance against other people leaving?</p><p>LEE: Well, what I would say is this is a nice sentiment by a very famous CEO, a tech all-star. But let's face it, if it was worth two or three times as much as it is now, why would he be giving it away.</p><p>And now I would love to get more stock. But Twitter is a portfolio company, it's going to have to be bought by someone for them to stay in business and I just don't know what that price is.</p><p>So, I can't imagine, you know, look, it's a good sentiment but I don't think it's a bullish sign for the stock or whatsoever.</p><p>BOLTON: Michael Chadwick does it change your view in any way about the future of Twitter?</p><p>CHADWICK: No, I don't think it changes my view of the company but I do love the move by the CEO, and I think more CEO's should be doing that. Because the reality is the CEO's are making so much and their average guy is really having a hard time.</p><p>Now, whether the CEO, whether this particular company's stock is worth all that more down the line or its toilet paper is anybody's guess, but I love the concept in the upper echelon of corporate America sharing the wealth with the average employee.</p><p>It's wonderful incentive. It lines up everybody's interests and people working a whole lot harder for you when you have that kind of behavior.</p><p>BOLTON: Market bull, Michael Lee. Market bear, Michael Chadwick, thank you for joining me.</p><p>LEE: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: We want to bring you now to world and national news, Secretary of State John Kerry meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister in Vienna, Austria. Topic number one, the four-year Civil War raging in Syria.</p><p>Russia, by the way, launching airstrikes that are hitting U.S. backed Syrian rebels.</p><p>With me now retired General Jack Keane. General, so glad to see you here in person. You told me that the White House National Security team is talking about safe zones and no-fly zones over Syria's airspace. This is a big move and if this is put in place, it's a huge shift in policy, right?</p><p>JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, absolutely. A number of us to include Secretary Gates, Secretary Condi Rice, Secretary Clinton have all made these recommendations over the last year or two, Senator McCain goes back about three years.</p><p>And what this is as I already understand is a safe zone, we would put largely refugees in there. But once you put them in there, and you have to protect them with some kind of ground force, that would be a moderate opposition ground force that we have been backing, and then you have to protect them with air power because somebody could bomb that.</p><p>So, it gets more complicated to put it together and make sure it truly is, quote, \"a safe zone.\"</p><p>BOLTON: But it would also, at least avoid what could be called a mistake. I mean, you remember when Russia, by mistake, hit a few targets that it said it was not intending to hit and what if Russian planes and U.S. planes collided, that could start an incident.</p><p>KEANE: Well, the good news is that the United states and Russia have had a meeting, a series of meetings actually where out of that came air procedures. So, we de-conflict our operations. So, I'm not too concerned about that.</p><p>The Russians will have to make up their mind if they are going to continue to bomb our moderate rebels that the CIA has trained and armed which they have been doing since they've been in there.</p><p>BOLTON: So, General, we just saw a picture of the Russian President Vladimir Putin shaking hands with Syrian President Assad. That meeting, a surprise meeting, Assad flew to Moscow and the world is very divided.</p><p>Russia and Iran think Assad belongs in power in Syria. Everyone else, Europe and the U.S., said no way. For there to be a peaceful situation in Syria, that guy has to go. What is your stance from a military point of view on how likely it is to remove him and then have peace.</p><p>KEANE: well, from a policy perspective, Deirdre, I mean, the reason why Russia is there and the Iranians are there so strongly is because actually Assad, this last year the rebels made a lot of gains and he was in a precarious position, that is over.</p><p>They're going to create a buffer zone there, that's why they're pushing back to rebels, they'll create an enclave. Syria only owns 20 percent of the country but they'll make certain that that's a solid 20 percent, and Assad is going to stay in power until such time as the Iranians and the Russians no longer want him in power. We are no longer influenced in that decision.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Well, that is a sober comment, we will hear it, we'll digest it. Retired General, Jack Keane joining me. Thank you, sir, as always. We appreciate your perspective.</p><p>To domestic matters, Department of Justice announcing that former IRS official, Lois Lerner will not face charges for targeting political groups. \"The probe found substantial evidence of mismanagement, but poor management. But poor management is not a crime.\"</p><p>That is actually a quote, that was the assistant attorney general, Peter Kadzik, who's making that statement. So, this closes a two-year investigation into whether or not the IRS improperly targeted the Tea Party and other conservative groups.</p><p>Columnist, Deneen Borreli with me now, democratic strategic Chuck Rocha. Deneen, what does this message send to any party, Tea Party included?</p><p>DENEEN BORELLI, CONSERVATIVE COLUMIST: Well, listen, this is the Friday afternoon dump on Americans, Deirdre. And basically, the Department of Justice has essentially said that the IRS can do and say whatever they want to intimidate Americans who want to use their political standards and statures across the country.</p><p>They can do and say whatever, and we can't challenge them or we can't hold them accountable. And I think this is really horrible that Lois Lerner was able to use her power in this position to make this happen.</p><p>BOLTON: Chuck, for your view, when the Department of Justice says that it found substantial mismanagement, does that require consequences? Is that a slap on the wrist? How do you see this?</p><p>CHUCK ROCHA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I mean, I think it's what it states that it is. I mean, there's consequences in that she's no longer there. I think that there will probably be reviews, but I think if they use their own words if that you're a pretty bad manager, that will mean you got to go to jail.</p><p>I think that there's things that need to be accountable, I think that there's to be accountable to the American people. I think those are our tax dollars. But just because somebody is not good at running their department don't mean that they're a criminal.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Deneen, what -- I know you want to say something, what is your follow-up to this idea of no consequences?</p><p>BORELLI: I've met the hundreds of patriots across the country, who are waiting for months, for years to file their paperwork in the proper manner and Lois Lerner used her power to intimidate these individuals, and I find it outrageous.</p><p>And that's why we have the wave of Americans tired of the politicians and individuals in government who are not being held accountable.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, Deneen, that is why we are seeing an outliers race as far as the presidential race goes. Deneen Borelli, thank you. Chuck Rocha, I know both of you will be joining me in a bit.</p><p>But in the meantime, we want to give you this update about this monster category 5 hurricane Patricia, barreling towards Southwest Mexico. The country on track to get hit with the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Western hemisphere.</p><p>In fact, if you look at the winds right now, 160 miles per hour. Fox News meteorologist Rick Reichmuth is with me. Rick, when is this expected to hit?</p><p>RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST: Yes, it's getting very close. The winds are actually now at 190 miles an hour. And as far as records go across the globe, it looks like it's difficult to go through al of the records everywhere, but I think we're probably at about the fifth strongest storm we've ever seen anywhere, and the strongest anywhere in around the Americas in the Western hemisphere, and making landfall at a category 5.</p><p>Here's the center of the storm there just off the coast of Puerto Vallarta and Manzanillo, Mexico. And when you look at this one here, you can see it's been wobbling just as like if you had a top that you spun, the way it will wobble, and that's what normal.</p><p>But, likely making landfall somewhere here between Puerto Vallarta and Manzanillo within the next couple of hours. Very mountainous terrain, not a huge population right here, about 110 miles between these two cities and we might just thread the needle right between them, and that's important because hurricane-force winds only extend up 35 miles from the center.</p><p>So, if you get this in between, we could be looking at just tropical storm conditions in Puerto Vallarta and maybe Manzanillo as well. But any spots here right along the coast certainly we're going to be seeing storage surge and if you're right where this makes landfall, it's going to be one of the most extreme experiences that we've seen anywhere and landfall from any kind of a tropical storm.</p><p>Very incredible, it's also a quick mover, and that's good because it won't drop rainfall totals maybe in the widespread 20 inches. But we'll likely see a few spots in that range. And it's such a quick mover. Take a look at this, Texas still potentially looking at the remnants of that.</p><p>And I'll show you how that plays out. This is a future radar. So, that's what we think the radar is going to look like. Guadalajara getting a lot of rain, and by tomorrow from Monterrey, Mexico.</p><p>But you'll notice that moisture moving in here across parts of Texas, a different system that's been plaguing Texas since last week is going to pull that moisture in there, and we might be seeing some spots maybe up to a foot of rain, and this Texas' that will cause some flooding here.</p><p>So, even in the U.S., Deirdre, we're going to have some impacts from the storm.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. Rick, we will depend on you for updates. Rick Reichmuth, thank you so much, our meteorologist.</p><p>Well, when we come back, this video is going viral. A woman in China is destroying her husband's luxury BMW. There is more to the story and her motive.</p><p>We'll also talk about legal charges, would she face them if she did this in the U.S.? The answer might surprise you.</p><p>Aaron Sorkin's \"Steve Jobs,\" movie enters wide release today. The actor who played Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, Seth Rogen is my guest.</p><p>Khloe Kardashian may have to pay up to $79,000 for Lamar Odom's brothel bill. We'll tell you why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Blood is coming out of his nose, white stuff coming out of his mouth and can't get him to wake up. He's like, almost not breathing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is he conscious?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Excuse me?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is he conscious?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Jeb Bush is apparently struggling to galvanize his family's donor base, as a result, he is ordering across the board pay cuts and slashing positions at campaign headquarters.</p><p>Conservative columnist, Deneen Borelli, democratic strategist, Chuck Rocha back with me. Deneen, he has been trailing, Jeb Bush is been trailing in the national polls at fourth or fifth place, it almost seems like he just settled into that second tier of candidates.</p><p>So, is this just a consequence of failing to inspire, the idea of a successful run?</p><p>BORELLI: Well, listen, as they say in the business world, Deirdre, the trend is your friend. And Jeb Bush is not trending on the right side of the voters, especially grassroots voters. He is an establishment candidate, he's got the establishment name, political name, Bush. And this is the anti-establishment movement that is sweeping the country.</p><p>People are tired of what they're seeing represented in Washington today. And so, he's on the wrong side of the trend.</p><p>BOLTON: So, in this case, the last name and the connection to the family dynasty may be hurting him. But, Chuck, I mean, it seems as if he would have already spent something like more than $130 million to have to make these moves, right?</p><p>ROCHA: Right, and what he's doing is he's being accountable to his donors. So, he wants the donors to keep giving and he wants others to give because money is more than just the mother's milk in politics.</p><p>It's everything in a presidential race because you have to have the money to get up there to spread your message. So, he's trying to show his donors that, hey, I'm cutting back, I'm being more responsible, I'm going to wait this out, it's going to go up, it's going to go down.</p><p>So, he's trying to resurrect and show a change of all-around strategies doing his campaign.</p><p>BOLTON: But, Deneen, is this the beginning of the end?</p><p>BORELLI: Well, listen, anything is possible with politics, but the other thing with Bush is that he's on the wrong side of two issues that are really important to grassroots. And that's common core and immigration.</p><p>So, again, he's on the wrong side of the trend, wrong side on several issues as well, and it's hurting him.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. But yet, there are other candidates who say all kinds of outlandish things on those two topics and more and it only helps them.</p><p>In a new Des Moines Register poll, candidate Dr. Ben Carson actually surging past Donald Trump who is obviously been the most outspoken on numerous issues but it's worth noting has been in the lead for 100 days.</p><p>So, Carson now has 28 percent. Donald Trump coming in at 19 percent and Ted Cruz in third place with 10 percent.</p><p>Deneen, does this make sense to you, I know you say anything can happen, we're more than a year away. Does that photo, that image of who is where make sense to you?</p><p>BORELLI: Well, I don't think Trump is out at all, and you look at Carson trending in Iowa, for example, he's really tapping into the Evangelicals in that state. And so, he's a very religious gentleman. Individuals are really relating to him, and he's the anti-establishment individual.</p><p>He's not a career politician, so he's getting a lot of momentum, a lot of attention and a lot of money.</p><p>BOLTON: Chuck, what do you think about the republican field and what it means for the democratic competition, if you like?</p><p>ROCHA: Well, you know what, Pat Roberts and Huckabee and Santorum all have in common? And everyone like to be president but they all want Iowa. And there so much stuff going on in Iowa. And on the democratic side, you've got people dropping out left and right and pretty much left with Bernie Sanders and Hillary, so it will be interesting on seeing who's doing the better job in marketing.</p><p>But the key point here is it is an outsider's game right now, that's why you see that Donald Trump and Carson and even Bernie Sanders has touched a cord in trying to say we want something different.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. I thank you, both. Deneen Borelli, Chuck Rocha, great to have you both here.</p><p>BORELLI: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: And remember to tune into Fox Business republican debate, Tuesday November 10th.</p><p>Too close for comfort. Look at this midair close call. The story coming up.</p><p>Also, the Steve Jobs biopic out today, the actor who played the Apple co- founder, Steve Wozniak is my guest.</p><p>Seth Rogen is here to talk about everything from the movie to Sony's hack settlement. You don't want to miss that conversation.</p><p>First though, the Fox Business interview that is making headlines, Maria Bartiromo sat down with the infamous drug CEO, Martin Shkreli, he hired or rather, hiked his aids drug price by 5,000 percent.</p><p>We have a CEO who says if Martin won't lower the price on the treatment, he will. He is now selling his own version of the drug for just $1. He's my guest next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARTIN SHKRELI, TURING PHARMACEUTICALS CEO: When people say 750, that sounds like a lot of money. But the reality is, 60 percent of our patients get it for it $1, one penny a pill.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, MORNINGS WITH MARIA SHOW HOST: Listen, $750 doesn't sound like a lot of money, $750 is a lot of money. And when you're talking about a drug that people in this nobody else having the drug on the market, that's where the outrage came from.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: There he is. But I know you need some money.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHKRELI: Put yourself in the shoes of someone who has this illness, this drug is 70 years old and it has terrible side effects and it's not that effective.</p><p>By taking the price up, we can actually afford to do real research to make a better drug. If you were a patient that have this illness, you wouldn't want a 70-year-old drug, most people don't want a 6-month-old cell phone.</p><p>So, for me, I think it's imperative for us to actually make the drug that a price that makes sense for us and is affordable to patients.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: That is the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals defending his company's controversial decision to raise the price of aids drug, Daraprim, by 5,000 percent. He said once that he sold the drug for $13.50, then drastically increased it to $750 per tablet.</p><p>There is now a company that is offering a cheaper alternative $1 per pill. He is with me now, the CEO of the company that is doing that, Mark Baum, he is the CEO of Imprimis.</p><p>Mark, so glad you are joining us. Did you hear the CEO of Turing basically saying he is trying to raise the price on purpose to wash out a bad drug, it seems like faulty logic, and then increase R&amp;D in a better one. Does that make sense to you?</p><p>MARK BAUM, IMPRIMIS PHARMACEUTICALS CEO: Well, you know, what is really interesting is, you know, in his press release when they acquired the drug, what was fascinating is he actually included information about additional drugs that should be taken or that could be prescribed and taken by patients in concert with his drug.</p><p>And one of them is the additional component of our compounded formulation. So, you know, it's interesting. Maybe when he's talking about, you know, new and better drugs, he might be talking about our compounded formulation, which includes this additional ingredient.</p><p>BOLTON: But would you ever charge more for a drug that you think is outdated anyway, and then after the fact say, well, the higher prices for the people who are almost kind of implied too stupid to keep paying it, that's going to help us with R&amp;D?</p><p>BAUM: His logic, you know, listen, I'm no logician but it really doesn't make a lot of sense. I mean, what makes, and by the way, he's free to charge whatever he wants, God bless him. But, you know, we can act as an amazing counterbalance to what he's doing and what others are frankly doing beyond him. I mean, this is a much bigger issue from our perspective.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. So, you are offering, essentially, the same treatment for a dollar. Have people said to you is this really the same quality? Do people have that concern?</p><p>BAUM: Well, let me be clear. We cannot legally make this exact copy of his drug. That is illegal, federal law prevents us from doing that. So, we will absolutely not do that at all.</p><p>You know, and what we're committed to doing obviously is just is getting this drug out to patients at an affordable price. You won't see us raise the price up. I mean, frankly, we make a tremendous profit when we sell it at even 99 cents a pill.</p><p>So, we're quite happy to do that. But as I said, the bigger picture is this is happening across the board with a lot of these types of drugs and, you know, we're going to be there hopefully, to act as a counterbalance with the help, hopefully, of policymakers because we're not going to succeed unless we work with the FDA and others that regulate what we do.</p><p>BOLTON: So you think that the FDA and others are on your side or are they more going even though they may hate the CEO of Turing that they're saying, OK, what he's doing is not illegal, so we can't do anything about it?</p><p>BAUM: I think what's important is that we put, you know, FDA, and I know that's the FDA's mission and it's our mission as well. We have to put patients first. Our philosophy is when we put patients first, we're going to win as a company, and we're a public company. We have shareholders to account to.</p><p>So, we're committed to putting patients first. And if that's what the FDA wants to do, so we're aligned in that regard. We do need to work cooperatively with them though, to make sure that we can act as a counterbalance, you know, to this situation as well, as many others that we're going soon talk about.</p><p>BOLTON: Mark Baum, so grateful for you time. Thank you so much. We wish you all the luck. It seems like to root for people taking the high road. Thank you.</p><p>BAUM: Thank you, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: Too close for comfort, an amazing midair close call. We're going to bring you more details. What is behind this brush with a huge jetliner?</p><p>Then, actor Seth Rogen joining me to talk about his new movie, it is called Steve Jobs, of course he plays the role of Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple. We also talk about Sony's hack attack and Hollywood's challenge with equal pay.</p><p>Then a jilted lover smashing her husband's BMW, that is the video that is going viral, our attorneys have something to say, though, about property damage.</p><p>Khloe Kardashian may have to pick up the bill for her pro basketball husband, albeit estranged until now. Lamar Odom's $80,000 brothel bill, our legal guest says she might be on the hook for that. We'll bring you more details.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: This video is going viral. The woman pictured with the hammer spent about 20 minutes trying to destroy the $150,000 BMW that belongs to her husband. So she was not arrested. Local security did not try to slow her down. Our legal panel is here, Deb Blum, also Evangeline Gomez, Evangeline, before we talk about liability damages there seems to be more to the story, apparently her husband was cheating on her that was a big part of her motivation. But does that change from a legal standpoint, charges -- potential charges for property damage?</p><p>EVANGELINE GOMEZ, ATTORNEY: No. And if there is going to be any charge, guess what? The money's going to come out of the same pot. They're not divorced that we know of, so they -- he and she are both going to pay for the damage.</p><p>BOLTON: And apparently, he said let her just smash it, I can get it repaired. So Deb, as far as legal -- there are no legal issues, right?</p><p>DEB BLUM, ATTORNEY: Well, I think if this happened here, she would absolutely be arrested. It's technically his property. He probably has title. She bashed his car with a hammer. There were children in the video, so you could say she's endangering their welfare because there are children nearby and there is glass flying everywhere. So I do think if this happened here, she would end up with a criminal case.</p><p>BOLTON: Ok, well, although her motivation probably -- I'm assuming somebody would take into consideration on. But on another topic that seems to be proving legally tricky, Khloe Kardashian may actually have to pay for her estranged husband's brothel bill which is about $80,000. The owner of the brothel says that is what he is owed and if Lamar Odom doesn't pay, he's going after Khloe Kardashian because she has the money. If they are not legally divorced, Deb, is that possible?</p><p>BLUM: Well, we don't know if they had a prenuptial agreement or what the settlement agreement said in their divorce. Although, it's now rumored that Khloe is not seeking the divorce.</p><p>BOLTON: I think that's off.</p><p>BLUM: That would probably invalidate their settlement agreement, although it would not invalidate a prenuptial agreement. So I'm not sure if she will be responsible for his brothel bill.</p><p>BOLTON: Evangeline, if they're not divorced, does she have to pay?</p><p>GOMEZ: This is the situation in California. When you get a legal separation, any debts or any property that you should amass after that date, it basically goes each person individually. So at this point, they were legally separated, they were not yet divorced because the judge had not signed off on it, based on reports, and he accrued this debt when they were legally separated, so he should be held responsible for this, not Khloe. And there seems to be this back between a brothel owner and between the Kardashians, and I think there's more here. Obviously, the brothel owner can sue her, but that doesn't mean he's going to get a recovery.</p><p>BOLTON: Yeah, I think he's just trying to get paid, I guess.</p><p>BLUM: He's definitely getting a lot of publicity from this.</p><p>BOLTON: Indeed. All right, well, we thank you both, Deb and Evangeline for your legal skills. Thank you.</p><p>GOMEZ: Thank you, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: Another video that is trending on social media, a midair close call. We're going to give you more details on this story behind a brush with a jetliner.</p><p>Then forget student debt, apprenticeships are gaining popularity, in fact, some even lead to six figure salaries, one person who is capitalizing on that joining me.</p><p>But first, the actor who plays Steve Wozniak in the new Steve Jobs film is joining me. Seth Rogen weighing in on everything from North Korea to his bashing of Ben Carson and Hollywood pay inequality. He's my guest next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you do?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I play the orchestra. And you're a good musician, you sit right there. You're the best in your role.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got to get back on stage. You got two minutes of rehearsal time left. I don't want to see you get dragged off.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I get free from you. You give them to me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're going to have a stroke.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did you do? What did you do?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: We are here now with one of the stars of the Steve Jobs movie released today, Seth Rogen plays Steve Jobs' longtime friend and Apple co- founder Steve Wozniak, Seth, so glad you could join us. .</p><p>SETH ROGEN, STEVE JOBS: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BOLTON: So Steve Wozniak, playing that role that's a bit of a departure from some of your previous roles, what made you want to do this project?</p><p>ROGEN: Honestly, I was skeptical that I would want to do it when I first heard about it, and then I read the script, and it really blew my mind, it's one of the best scripts if not the best written script I've read in my entire life. And as a writer, it pains me greatly to say that and fills me with both rage and jealousy.</p><p>BOLTON: Rage and jealousy, it's a good combo.</p><p>ROGEN: Yes, it really just blew my mind, and Danny Boyle is someone I'm a huge fan of. I really wasn't interested in Steve Jobs at all going into the movie, it was just the work itself was incredible to me, and so I wanted to try to be a part of it.</p><p>BOLTON: So let me pick up on something that you said, because some of the critics of the movie have said that it actually is too geek-focused, in a way that, for example, the Social Network was a little bit more accessible for people who didn't know the Facebook story. But I've seen people write and say with the Steve Jobs movie you really have to know the history of Apple. But it sounds like after you got to know the script, you were convinced?</p><p>ROGEN: Yeah, I disagree with that honestly. Again, I knew nothing about Apple. I didn't read the Walter Isaacson book. I really just read the movie and talked to the people involved, and did a lot of research about Steve Wozniak, and I find the movie incredibly interesting. I am in the movie which probably adds some bias to that opinion, but I feel as though personally, I don't feel you have to be at all interested in Apple or any computer to enjoy the movie, because I wasn't, and I did.</p><p>BOLTON: All right, and we know Steve Wozniak is particularly a fan of yours. But I want to ask you a little bit more of an emotional question. Steve Jobs' wife did not want this released. Did that color, does that color the way that you see it or that any of your co-stars see it?</p><p>ROGEN: No, honestly. I imagine that when most movies are made about public figures, their family has very conflicted feelings about that, and the people who knew them closely have very conflicted feelings about that, and I sympathize with that. But at the same time, once you cross a certain threshold of impact culturally, I think you kind of become everyone's to interpret in some way, and that doesn't mean it has to be a realistic interpretation, it just has to be a resonant interpretation, something that strikes a chord with people and has some honesty to it at least from the perspective of the person who is interpreting it.</p><p>So I sympathize with that, but I don't think that means that we shouldn't make movies about famous people and people who have impacted our culture basically.</p><p>BOLTON: All right, now speaking of culture and emotional connection, you recently hosted a big charity bar mitzvah for your buddy James Franco, whom we interviewed, and I actually asked him about the Sony hack. So this is going back a few months. And he said essentially, you were more connected to the Sony machine than he was. You told him not to worry, so therefore he didn't worry about it. I know that Sony settled this week for $8 million with its employees. Does that affect you? How do you see that settlement?</p><p>ROGEN: Honestly, I know nothing about it, I've been filming a movie all week, and just read that headline. But yeah, I'll read more about it and get back to you.</p><p>BOLTON: Yeah, I think James Franco's quote was don't worry, whatever, so we'll go with that, but we know the issue of course was identity theft. So Seth, I'm on twitter, I follow you, a lot of your recent comments have stood out to me, especially politically-based ones. I know you said f-you, I'm not going to say it, but to the real Ben Carson. What made you be so strong in your views to this presidential candidate?</p><p>ROGEN: Is that that strong? I don't know if it's that strong. I think it's all the language you choose to use in your daily life. To me that's not that strong a statement. It's marginal.</p><p>BOLTON: It's marginal. But I know you do take issues with -- I know this from following your account. For example, there was a man killed earlier today, three women wounded in a shooting at Tennessee State University, and I know that this is an issue that you feel passionately about.</p><p>ROGEN: I do feel murder is bad, yes, passionately. I didn't know about that specific story, but I am always on the anti-murder side of things.</p><p>BOLTON: All right, one more of your tweets here on the 7th, you tweeted out just when it seems like think the real Donald Trump cornered the market on saying insane B.S., I'm paraphrasing, real Ben Carson steps up to the challenge. Which candidate is more outrageous in your view, Carson or Trump?</p><p>ROGEN: That's a tough question. Honestly, I don't know, what do you think?</p><p>BOLTON: Well, it's a toss-up. But which of the candidates, any party, do you feel makes the most sense to you right now? I'm not saying who you're going to vote for, but which candidate out there right now makes the most sense to you?</p><p>ROGEN: I don't know, honestly, but I'm happy that Stephen Harper is out of the Canadian government. That I can speak very knowledgeably about.</p><p>BOLTON: All right, but if you could create one policy that would be adapted by the next President, no matter who he or she is, let's just say you get Carte Blanche, whatever you say right now would get passed into law, as a citizen, what would it be?</p><p>ROGEN: That's a tough question. I think America has a problem with imprisoning its own citizens, and I would probably push to reform that element of things.</p><p>BOLTON: All right, one more semi-political question here, more interpersonal politics.</p><p>ROGEN: Great.</p><p>BOLTON: Jennifer Lawrence wrote an open essay about equal pay, Bradley Cooper backed her up in GQ, then just this morning Jeremy Renner made a comment saying it's not my job to help female co-stars negotiate their salaries. Where do you stand on Hollywood's pay gap?</p><p>ROGEN: I think that it is real, and I think that I don't want to tell people what their responsibility is, but I personally view it as my responsibility to try to make, you know, that gap disappear as much as humanly possible. I think Hollywood has a lot of problems that, you know, obviously, involving race and gender, that you know, we, I know in my personal life we are trying to actively come up with ways to, again, to close those gaps and get rid of them altogether, because to me they're real. I see it, and yeah, I would advocate for trying to, you know, not have there be a massive gap between how much men and women get paid to do the same thing, and how many people of color are represented in films and television.</p><p>BOLTON: All right, we look forward to seeing it, Seth Rogen, thank you so much for the time, Steve Jobs actor Seth Rogen.</p><p>ROGEN: Thank you, hard hitting questions over here on Fox Business.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Student loan debt is at a record high in the U.S., more than $1 trillion. More students are considering apprenticeships to avoid that financial burden. The appeal is that people get paid to learn, their college tuition is paid, and they have a greater chance of finding a job post graduation. Christopher Stone is with me now. He is a field engineer at a school in North Carolina. Christopher, welcome to the program, we are so glad to have you. What is a typical day like for you?</p><p>CHRIS STONE, FIELD ENGINEER APPRENTICE: A typical day for me, I normally I wake up about 5:00 a.m. start getting ready for work. I really try to make sure when I head into work, I'm set and ready to go. I normally work anywhere between 7:00 a.m. To 4:00 p.m., 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. I get to take a lot of the knowledge I'm learning in my actual college classes and apply them working some equipment for the printing industry. Normally, I get to work hands on with some mentors, get to learn a little bit of different fields that normally people don't get to see outside of the industry.</p><p>BOLTON: So will it take you longer to finish school?</p><p>STONE: It does. It's a two-year degree that I'll end up getting, it's stretched over the course of three years. I'm actually graduating a little bit earlier. I have been put on an accelerated path, trying to finish it up a little bit quicker than some people do, but three years for a two-year degree which is actually very productive for what we do.</p><p>BOLTON: I was going to say -- and with the work experience is great. What have your parents said about it?</p><p>STONE: My parents have been nothing but supportive. My senior year is when I really got into the program. You know it was either do military -- do a program or do a four-year college because that's the tendency in America. My parents were really supportive. They realized that I'm really good with my hands and I wanted to do something hands-on. So it worked out perfect for me because this program is nothing but hands-on experience and being able to use your education to do the work that you have to do.</p><p>BOLTON: So you are getting an education. You're getting paid, $13.50 an hour, and you're not going to graduate with any debt.</p><p>STONE: Yeah, exactly. I really cannot think of any other place you can get that. I'm actually making a little bit more than that, but just the fact that when I get out of there not only am I going to have no debt and a paycheck but I'm going to have experience that very few people will ever have in their life. And a lot of people are going to learn the book side of it and not actually get to apply it in real life, so it's going to be more difficult for them.</p><p>BOLTON: It makes all the sense in the world. Christopher Stone, thank you very much for the time. Congratulations, we are glad to have you with us.</p><p>STONE: Thank you very much.</p><p>BOLTON: When we come back, viewers are already speaking out about my interview with Steve Jobs actor Seth Rogen, some of your responses which are (Inaudible) after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGEN: I think America has a problem with imprisoning its own citizens, and I would probably push through reform that element of things.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGEN: I think that it is real. And I think that -- I mean, I don't want to tell people what their responsibility is, but I personally view it as my responsibility to try to make you know that gap disappear as much as humanly possible. I think that Hollywood has a lot of problems.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: My interview with Seth Rogen provoking heated response on social media, seems like a lot of you will not be lining up to get tickets this weekend. Joseph said, Rogen looked best in Horton hears a Who. Seth Rogen is a Hollywood actor who has zero relevance when it comes to telling the rest of us how to behave. Of course, that was on equal pay. Thank you for joining us on Risk and Reward. Charles Payne is up next.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

But that's exactly what happened when a 60-year-old visitor and others were gathered around an installation called \"Descent Into Limbo\" by Anish Kapoor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Viewing the exhibit involves staring down at a large black dot painted on the floor. There is an eight-foot-deep circular hole in the middle of the dot and the extremely black paint around the hole is meant to give \"the illusion of a depthless void,\" according to reports of the back injuries sustained by the observer when he fell into the work of art. (Curious readers can see a photo of the installation on Facebook.) The hole within a circle of blackness was a risk hiding in plain sight-right in front of the art enthusiast but very easy to miss.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why Only 22?

So, there is nothing about drones shutting down airports, biometric privacy lawsuits or Alexa spying capabilities. This subjective list consists of items that intrigued<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carrier Management</emphasis>editors for one reason or another. Some are worrisome; others perhaps laughable.

Simpson.</p><p>Here are 22 risks hiding in plain sight:</p><p>1. More people are anxious and depressed. The World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in late January reported on the No. 1 mental health problem in the world: anxiety. According to 2016 data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, anxiety impacted 3.83 percent of the world's population, or about 275 million people. Depression ranks second, affecting 3.77 percent. Are members of your workforce part of the statistics? What is your company doing to recognize the signs and help? Will depression and anxiety increase the cost of bodily injury liability and workers comp claims? The Forum's Global Risks 2019 report also discusses the ripples of individual anxiety on the global risk landscape. Psychological and emotional well-being is not just a risk for individuals in and of itself, \"it also affects the wider global risks landscape, notably via impacts on social cohesion and politics,\" the report says.</p><p>(\"This is the world's biggest mental health problem-and you might not have heard of it,\" weforum.org, Jan. 14, 2019 by Sean Fleming; 2019 Global Risks Report, Jan. 16, 2019)</p><p>2. Is the ledger truly immutable? The question addresses one of a number of new risks arising from the use of smart ledgers, according to Michael Mainelli, executive chairman of Z/Yen Group. Others are: \"Who indemnifies who for data entered on the ledger? What about systemic failure?\" The risks, he said, suggest \"some potentially big solutions...that insurers can provide.\"</p><p>(\"Unblocked by the Chain, Smart Ledger Systems Are 'The Thing' to Insure,\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carrier Management</emphasis>, Sept. 17, 2018 by Michael Mainelli)</p><p>3. ADA website accessibility suits. While not a new risk, the number of lawsuits alleging that business websites are not compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act are reaching record levels, according to Seyfarth Shaw attorneys in their<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ADA Title III News &amp; Insights</emphasis>blog in mid-July last year.

The video service stands accused of breaking laws overseeing kids' web habits, placing a massive library of media and accompanying revenue in jeopardy. Neither YouTube nor the regulators have discussed the talks publicly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet despite the secrecy, a small British marketing firm started emailing some marquee YouTube advertisers about the developments. Reports indicated that the FTC would hit YouTube with a record fine and force its operations to change -- something, the emails noted, that would \"be of interest\" to YouTube's sponsors. \"Regardless of what size the fine actually is, it represents a shift in the world for children's digital privacy,\" read the message. \"Look forward to seeing you soon.\"</p><p>The emails were from SuperAwesome Ltd. Toy makers, animators and other brands pay the company to place online ads or access tools such as the start-up's \"safe, moderated\" system for internet comments. In July, SuperAwesome added another offering: a video service, called Rukkaz, that works much like YouTube. Amateur broadcasters upload videos, sponsors back them and kids watch. Only the start-up pledged to work with only hand-picked broadcasters, and it pitched the service as a way to abide by privacy laws and avoid the demented footage lurking on the open web.</p><p>\"This is something that Google and Facebook, and arguably Apple, should have been doing for the past five years,\" said Dylan Collins, SuperAwesome's chief executive. \"And they haven't.\"</p><p>Waves of new media darlings have tried to unseat YouTube, with no success. But Collins is one of several entrepreneurs trying to strike while YouTube is in turmoil. The video behemoth, owned by Alphabet Inc.'s Google, has earned a reputation as a Wild West of media, a place where young viewers have too readily stumbled on footage of crass humor or bloody violence. Lawmakers have asked about this, part of the scrutiny of the privacy practices and dominance of big tech.</p><p>The FTC is probing whether Google violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, which prohibits tracking the personal information of minors younger than 13. YouTube's frequent tweaks to its all-powerful algorithms and ads policies have left video creators disgruntled. A handful of upstarts are hoping this momentum will help their cause. They've roped in venture financing, licensing deals and customers with the promise of creating kid-safe internet real estate.</p><p>The FTC is inadvertently playing a role, too. Uncertainty over the case is producing panic in parts of the YouTube community, prompting some stars to hunt for alternatives. News reports surfaced that the FTC may force YouTube to move all children's videos to its Kids app or cut them off from ads.</p><p>\"No one really has a sense of what is going to happen,\" said Michael, who runs KidCity and two other YouTube family channels. He is one of more than 150 YouTubers jumping to Rukkaz. He isn't moving off YouTube but will cross-post select YouTube clips with the start-up, which will share ad revenue. He asked that his last name not be revealed to protect the privacy of his children.</p><p>Kids media online is booming as millions of children swap Saturday morning cartoons for streaming and smartphones. Most streaming services, such as Netflix, run curated, slickly produced shows for kids, while YouTube relies on a mountain of unscripted, user-generated content. Multiple people who make these videos said that, in recent months, support representatives from YouTube have halted contact without explanation.</p><p>A chief concern for many creators is that their videos will be restricted to the YouTube Kids mobile app, a much less popular service, where Google runs fewer ads. \"That would put everyone out of business. I mean, almost overnight,\" Michael said.</p><p>YouTube is unlikely to do that, or to cut off all its kids and family footage from ads. On Wednesday, YouTube said it would launch a separate website for children and change the age categories on Kids. Also, YouTube is planning to end \"targeted\" ads on videos kids are likely to watch. That solution would make it harder for the creators behind those clips to earn more from ads, although it's a less draconian move than some other rumored options.</p><p>A problem with this approach, though, is defining kids videos. COPPA applies to any web service \"directed to children.\" While most clips on YouTube Kids, such as nursery rhyme cartoons, clearly are, other huge swaths of YouTube, such as footage of video game streaming, arguably aren't. Yet it's an open secret that younger viewers love watching people play video games. Roughly a quarter of the YouTube ads one major toy company buys run on \"Minecraft\" videos, according to a media buyer with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private data.</p><p>\"The difficulty here is determining what is 'kids directed,' \" said Ashkan Soltani, a privacy researcher who was previously the chief technologist for the FTC. \"It's not a bright-line rule.\"</p><p>Once the line is drawn, YouTube creators do not want to fall on the wrong side. Many, like KidCity's Michael, now describe their productions as \"family-based play\" or \"co-play\" -- videos that feature adults and, the hope is, that adults watch.</p><p>YouTube is not the only major player in an uncomfortable spot. The FTC fined Bytedance Inc., the owner of popular app TikTok, for violating federal guidelines on minors. Critics have complained that Facebook Inc. illegally tracks children's online behavior. Many in children's media don't expect a viable solution to come from the household names.</p><p>\"It doesn't make sense that big internet companies can take something they designed for grown-ups and make that for kids,\" said Kevin Donahue, an early YouTube executive who now runs Epic, an e-book start-up. \"You have to create something new.\" (Donahue said he has no interest in rivaling his old company, though. \"We're not at all doing that,\" he said.)</p><p>For most newcomers, that something looks like Netflix: A subscription service with a limited selection. The idea is that parents would pay for some parts of YouTube popular with kids -- the toy unboxers and niche animators -- without the pratfalls of an unlimited content library. Three years ago, Epic added video to its $7.99-a-month e-books app. It offers a few thousand clips, all reviewed by staff members. Kidoodle.TV, a Canadian company, offers children's videos on set-top box services such as Roku. Another, JuniorTube, had a slate of curated amateur videos available on a subscription-based app. Roku added a new curated kids and family section.</p><p>Highbrow, a London-based start-up, sells a $6.49 monthly service with the tagline \"Trusted by schools and parents worldwide.\" Priyanka Raswant, a corporate lawyer, formed the company as she was preparing to have her first child. She found most videos available on YouTube Kids \"nonsensical\" and the app unhelpful for parents.</p><p>\"If you see something outrageous, you have to report it,\" Raswant said. \"They've put the onus on the parents. Most parents don't even have time to brush their teeth.\"</p><p>Highbrow has partnered with telecoms in Latin America and India for distribution, but it doesn't share sales data. The service carries videos from Pinkfong, the studio behind mega-hit \"Baby Shark,\" as well as smaller shows such as \"Travel With Kids\" from PBS.</p><p>SuperAwesome is one of the few borrowing YouTube's model of free, ad-supported programming. It is set to book $60 million in revenue this year. (YouTube doesn't share sales, but estimates place the yearly sales from its kids content north of $700 million.) Collins said his company is profitable. Of course, the uncertainty surrounding kids online video could also threaten those profits. His ad business is competing against those at the twin giants of Google and Facebook. The benefits of SuperAwesome's ad services might not be as apparent if YouTube passes through the FTC probe unscathed and grows its Kids app.</p><p>That could mean that more is riding on Collins' video service. For Rukkaz, Collins is targeting YouTube's blind spots. Most of YouTube Kids caters to preschoolers, so Collins is recruiting creators aiming for an older audience. He's also approaching creators with between 500,000 and a million subscribers on YouTube -- enough to earn livings from the site, but not to be inoculated from its swings. \"This entire community is really being orphaned by YouTube,\" Collins said.</p><p>Michael, who runs the KidCity channel, is optimistic about Rukkaz. He's planning to use SuperAwesome's feature for hosting video comments, which he finds useful for getting audience feedback. YouTube shut off comments on videos with children this year but allowed a select group of channels to keep them with the condition that they \"actively moderate\" the posts. Filtering those comments, though, requires using a manual system. \"You have to go in there and spell the dirty words,\" he said.</p><p>His attempts to find footing beyond YouTube haven't succeeded in the past. On KidCity, the Texan father and his two children perform long skits dressed up as familiar cartoon characters -- Marvel Comics' Wolverine or Disney's Queen Elsa. They tried to post one of these clips on Amazon's self-publishing service, Prime Video Direct, but the company rejected the videos, citing intellectual property concerns. A KidCity clip of his son donning a Spider-Man costume and testing a Spider-Man toy has more than 85 million views on YouTube. YouTube's laissez-faire approach to media has brought scathing critics, but it has also enabled countless careers online.</p><p>\"That's the creator platform for kids,\" Michael said. \"The only one, unfortunately.\"</p><p>At least one would-be YouTube rival has already bit the dust. JuniorTube, a company based in Indiana, made a paid app and recruited a few established YouTubers. Like the others, it managed the costs of hosting video and other back-end services, splitting sales with video producers. In May, these producers received an email that JuniorTube had shut down \"due to very poor business performance and audience interest.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: A YOUNG BOY watches \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" on YouTube at a Massachusetts school.

The public adored the companies' new devices, educators embraced their tools and politicians extolled their contributions to the economy. Even traditionally powerful voices, like media and telecom businesses, found little success in criticizing the technology industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But now, as lawmakers look into how Russia used Google, Facebook and Twitter to influence the 2016 presidential election, many critics see a rare opening -- and are lining up to take their shots. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The reviews site <person><nameText>Yelp, </nameText></person>which has long complained about the size and power of Google, has filed a new federal antitrust complaint against the search giant. Media organizations are arguing, to a more receptive Capitol Hill, that internet businesses should have the same advertising disclosure rules that print and television companies do.</p><p>  And the support behind a sex-trafficking bill, which tech companies argue could make them the unfair target of lawsuits, reads like a Who's Who list of companies that have long complained about tech's sway in Washington, including the Walt Disney Company, Oracle and 21st Century Fox.</p><p>  ''We've had low points, when we were out of energy and felt like we weren't heard,'' said Jeremy Stoppelman, chief executive of <person><nameText>Yelp. </nameText></person>''But we feel we have a clean slate now.''</p><p>  The action is nascent, but gaining momentum fast. Lawmakers are pushing for regulations for technology companies for the first time in years, encouraged along by big tech's broad assortment of rivals. For several weeks, a group of companies including smaller tech companies and entertainment and retail businesses has informally begun regular meetings and conference calls to compare notes about Google, Facebook and Amazon and to find a way to join in a stronger opposition force.</p><p>  ''Before, any negativity was a risk for the media business because if you were critical, you could be defined as not getting it and being old school,'' said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times. ''But now the halo is a bit off these companies.''</p><p>  In recent years, lawmakers have held up technology companies as the epitome of American ingenuity and felt that voters did not want the government to slow them down. That attitude was hardened in 2012, after lawmakers suffered a bruising defeat in a bill to strengthen antipiracy rules for internet companies. The proposals set off huge online protests, aided by the big technology companies, that helped stop the legislation.</p><p>  ''Over the years, I've watched as the major tech companies not only sought to protect the unlevel playing field they already had, but have used their political influence to expand it to disadvantage businesses with which they compete,'' said Jim Cicconi, who recently retired after years overseeing lobbying at AT&amp;T. ''Now I think policymakers are seeing the consequences.''</p><p>  But even as they sense an opportunity today, the rivals say that challenging the internet companies remains a daunting task. They doubt they can put a dent into the online ad duopoly of Facebook and Google. It will also be difficult, they say, to restrain Amazon's fast movement into new markets, given the company's willingness to lose money to gain a foothold.</p><p>  Internet companies are deploying some of the largest armies in corporate America to battle on Capitol Hill. House and Senate staffs say lobbyists for the big technology companies have swarmed their offices in recent weeks. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Googleand Microsoft have sharply increased their lobbying spending -- a combined $14.2 million in the third quarter, up from $11.9 million a year earlier. Facebook, which has faced the most scrutiny over the election, increased its third-quarter lobbying budget this year by 40 percent, to $2.85 million.</p><p>  The technology companies go to lawmakers to talk about how their businesses are creating jobs and providing free or lower-priced services for consumers. They also regularly mention donating money for public science, technology and math classes.</p><p>  ''It is unfortunate that companies that have been slow to innovate in a changing consumer-first marketplace are looking for wins through regulation or by scoring cheap political points,'' said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google.</p><p>  The tech giants are also lodging a strong defense against the newly proposed regulations. Facebook and Googlehired high-profile political operatives to thwart changes in election disclosures at the Federal Election Commission and have deployed lobbyists to water down a bipartisan bill introduced last week that would require social media platforms to disclose the financing behind political ads.</p><p>  Still, their rivals say that for the first time in many years, criticism of Silicon Valley is getting a receptive audience.</p><p>  The clearest opening has been in an unpopular battle that Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple have waged against a bill aimed to curb sex trafficking. The bill would take away some legal protections for sites that knowingly host content that promotes sex trafficking, a move that the internet companies warn could stifle free speech, even though it would largely exempt the big tech companies from liability. Disney, Oracle and 21 Century Fox have endorsed the legislation.</p><p>  The tech companies initially pushed back vigorously against the bill. In recent weeks, though, some of them have softened their stance, saying they hope to seek a compromise.</p><p>  ''It's past time to dispel the myth that big internet firms cannot or should not be accountable for their business,'' Chip Smith, the executive vice president for global public affairs at 21st Century Fox, ''and that includes the personal data they collect and the content and behaviors they promote and profit from online.''</p><p>  The tech companies are playing defense on other fronts as well. In September, <person><nameText>Yelp </nameText></person>said it had filed a complaint against Googlewith the Federal Trade Commission. In the complaint, <person><nameText>Yelp </nameText></person>argued that Googlehad violated a promise it made to the commission in 2013 that it would not reuse the content of competitors for its own advantage.</p><p>  Representative Keith Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, recently wrote the commission to ask it disclose information about why it closed its case on Googlein 2013. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, has asked the agency to reopen its investigation in light of new evidence that surfaced in the case led by European regulators.</p><p>  In July, the News Media Alliance, which represents 2,000 news organizations including The Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, began advocating for antitrust exemptions that would allow the companies to collectively bargain with Facebook and Googlefor ad revenue. On Tuesday, David Chavern, president of the group, argued at a House hearing that digital platforms like Googleand Facebook should follow the same rules that broadcast and print news organizations do.</p><p>  ''In the fall, you will see us getting increasingly vocal about Googleand Facebook and the future of the news business,'' Mr. Chavern said in an interview before the hearing.</p><p>  Even nonprofit consumer interest groups are taking advantage of the situation. John Simpson of Consumer Watchdog, who is a longtime critic of Google's collection of personal data, has pushed for online privacy rules and restrictions for self-driving vehicles. He has struggled to get attention in the past, but that is not much of a problem now.</p><p>  ''I'm getting more calls these days,'' Mr. Simpson said.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-136247171026</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PT9-F2N1-DXY4-X3BC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1296\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/technology/big-tech-government-regulation.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/technology/big-tech-government-regulation.html</url><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 26, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That's created opportunity for big tech vendors such as Hewlett-Packardand IBM, as well as smaller companies, which have launched campaigns to win over Sun's clients and distributors.</p><p>They're offering technical assistance and cash discounts to Sun's business and government customers, while highlighting   some say exaggerating   questions about whether Oracle will continue to sell and upgrade Sun's Unix servers, data storage systems and other product lines.</p><p>\"Don't settle for an uncertain future,\" urges an online marketing pitch from IBM, which is offering discounted technical consulting for customers who transfer their data processing from Sun computers to IBM systems.</p><p>Rival Hewlett-Packarddescribed its offer of technical advice and other assistance for those switching to HP products in a recent announcement headlined: \"HP to Sun Customers: We've Got Your Back.\"</p><p>The prospective deal between Oracle, known primarily for selling business software, and Sun, a storied but struggling computer maker, set tongues wagging across Silicon Valley when it was announced April 20. The two parties have said little since then, citing legal constraints while the deal is pending. They declined to comment for this report.</p><p>But many analysts believe Oracle will embark on restructuring and extensive layoffs to make Sun's operations more profitable. And despite assurances from Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, who said in May that he wants to integrate Sun's hardware with Oracle's software, industry experts say they won't be surprised if Oracle eventually divests some of Sun's hardware business.</p><p>\"Nobody knows what Oracle's plans are, but there's a feeling that they don't have much experience in this area, so they may not be committed to it,\" said James Staten, a data center infrastructure expert at Forrester Research.</p><p>Antitrust experts say the Justice Department's request for more information at the end of June means it could take until mid-autumn to review the deal. An Oracle attorney said June 26 that \"all that's left is one narrow issue\" about licensing rights to Sun's widely used Java programming language. Analysts say officials may want assurances that Oracle won't exert undue control over software that's an essential part of programs sold by rivals such as IBM.</p><p>Still, a review that includes a request for more information can typically last six months, said Ted Henneberry, a Washington, D.C., antitrust attorney at Orrick Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe.</p><p>In addition, German software developer Bjorn Schotte reported on his blog this week that regulators for the European Union had contacted him to ask about MySQL, the Sun open-source database program that competes with Oracle's database software.</p><p>The EU, which will decide by Sept. 3 whether to launch a more extensive review, has historically used stricter standards than U.S. law, added antitrust expert Katherine Funk at Sonnenschein Nath &amp; Rosenthal, also based in Washington.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packardsays it persuaded more than 100 Sun customers to buy HP's servers and storage systems in the past six months. While offering them technical assistance and other incentives, HP also says companies like BT Vision, a British on-demand video service, concluded that HP systems performed better.</p><p>IBM reacted nine days after the Oracle deal was announced by doubling an earlier offer of credit toward technical consulting for Sun hardware customers who switched to IBM, from $4,000 to $8,000 for each microprocessor \"core.\" IBM Vice President Scott Handy said this week that his company had more than 250 sales \"wins,\" in which Sun customers chose IBM products in the first half of 2009, with most coming in the second quarter.</p><p>Smaller companies also see an opportunity. Ingres, a Redwood City software company, is promoting new tools that make it easier for programmers to move their work from Sun's MySQL onto Ingres' database products. CEO Roger Burkhardt said interest in those products has \"accelerated\" since the Oracle deal was announced.</p><p>But an industry expert said he hasn't seen evidence that Sun's customers are defecting in droves.</p><p>\"HP and IBM are milking this for everything that they can,\" said Gordon Haff at the Illuminata consulting group. \"There certainly is some nervousness out there. To go from that and suggest that every Sun customer is in total panic probably overstates things.\"</p><p>Contact Brandon Bailey at 408-920-5022.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-13000021</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SANJOSEMNG2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7WB2-9RN0-Y9NC-P2C9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>San Jose Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>August 5, 2009 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000243V</classCode><className>ORACLE AMERICA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001QLL</classCode><className>FORRESTER RESEARCH INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7379 COMPUTER RELATED SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7371 COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS334118 COMPUTER TERMINAL &amp;

Visually, night two of four was essentially the same using the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium and the White House interiors and gardens as a stage. There were montages, especially the Vice President's one, where we see interviews taking place in different locations around the country. Additionally, a speech delivered on Navajo land, ShiprockNew Mexico, with stunning scenery that takes your breath away. </p><p>There were less smooth transitions tonight and, some edits were glitchy. The most noticeable issue was when Nick Sandmann spoke from the Lincoln Memorial and, the ambient sound from visitors bled through the audio. Stylistically the energy was high but more intimate if that is even possible from last evening. There were plenty of bridges that connected Americans born on our soil to those just arriving, culminating in Mrs. Trump's immigrant journey as well. The emotive thread of opportunity, redemption, and the sense that we are all America's community stood out. Again message discipline was fierce. There was no day session for public view. Evening Session Opening video 'Tonight we explore together, America'on American exceptionalism narrated by Jon Voight. Watch the videohere.[1] Rev. Norma Urrabazo International Church of Las Vegas - watch her prayer here[2]. Leighanne Ball, a military spouse, then recites the Pledge of Allegiance.

Watch his speech here[4]. Jon Pondera convicted bank robber and the FBI officer who made his arrestRichard Beasley. Both are shown in a video at the White House as the President issues Ponder a pardon, and highlight the importance of rehabilitation and their unique story and bond. The President said this is an example of 'a beautiful testament to the power of redemption.' Ponder is the founder of the nonprofit Hope For Prisoners, read[5] more about his life here. This is a powerful perspective on law enforcement and criminals who turn their lives around. 'Every Social Justice Warrior' and Inner city Americans are better off for watching it. [embedded content]embedded content (Article Continues Below Advertisement)Forgotten Men and Women Video - watch the video here.[6] Kentucky Senator Rand Paul reviewed Trump's record on criminal justice reform (First Step Act), noting Trump acted to undo the harms that people like Biden did to lock up a generation of young black men ( Clinton Crime Bill). Paul was animated when praising Trump policies for keeping us out of war and drawing down troops to get us out of wars he inherited, pointing out Biden never met a war he did not like (Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Libya). He shared that as citizen Trump, his charity to help blind people, Trump funded and supported. The Senator's pitch was aimed at Independents and Libertarians pointedly. Watch his speech here.[7] Jason Joyce, lobster fisherman, Swan's Island ME. Declared he did not vote for Trump in 2016, but Trump's promises kept has him voting for him in 2020. He told the viewers about how Obama/Biden used the Antiquities Act to appease radical environmentalists to cripple the lobster industry. He described the actions Trump has taken to unleash prosperity for him and other families who are both conservationists and fishermen. He warned a vote for Biden/Harris will destroy their livelihoods. Watch his speech here.[8] Cris Peterson, a Wisconsin dairy farmer, talked about how her 120-year-old barn caught on fire, and how Trump's economic boom started to help dairy farmers across the United States after decades of regulations and taxes swamped them.' Trump knows what Farmers need to survive, she added and has done more good for farming and agriculture, more than any president in her lifetime.' She championed Trump's trade deals as great for farmers and National and Domestic security. Watch her speech here.[9] Small Business Video - was a montage of real people explaining how taxation and regulation changes under Trump policies changed their lives and grew their businesses. Also, post COVID how PPP had been a lifeline. Larry Kudlow, the White House National Economic Council Director, Reviews what Trump has done on the economy with free and fair trade deals lower taxation and regulatory reforms. He predicts a V-shaped recovery and more tax cuts and rollback of regulation if Trump gets another term. He chides Biden's platform, who raises taxes in a pandemic recession? He asks voters if they want economic health, prosperity, and optimism or stagnation and pessimism. Watch his speech here.[10] John Peterson was a small business owner in Wisconsin of Schuette Metals. He explained how lean it was during Obama years and blamed Obama-Biden, two people who knew nothing about business, for not getting government out of the way. His company was booming under Trump before COVID and said 'By getting rid of the job-killing NAFTA and negotiating the US-Mexican-Canada trade agreement, President Trump ensured a more competitive playing field for American companies like ours,' he says before adding that Trump will make the economy roar back again after the Coronavirus. He then compared Trump to the WI Badgers football team - he is smart, tough, and dependable - watch his speech here[11]. Cissie Graham Lynch,the granddaughter of late Rev. Billy Graham, spoke about how religious freedoms were under attack during the Obama-Biden administration by facing faith-based organizations to pay for abortion-inducing drugs and force schools to allow boys to compete as girls and use girls' locker rooms. Trump is a 'fierce advocate in the White House.' for Christians, and she said as she reviewed all the steps Trump has done to advocate and protect religious freedoms, including SCOTUS and judges. Watch her speechhere.[12] Bob Vlaisavljevich, a life-long Democrat and Eveleth, MN, Mayor (Iron Range), declared this is a make or break election for Americans. He gave background and ripped politicians on both sides for not standing up to China steel dumping, which wiped out the Iron Range. He credits Trump and his policies on trade and regulations for bringing the Iron Range back to life and 'roaring' and communities thriving again. He warned that, like the previous Obama /Biden administration, Biden would cave to radical environmentalists. Watch his speech here.[13] Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood employee now Pro-Life Activist, gave a compelling testimony for the sanctity of life from a front-row seat. She touched on Planned Parenthood's founder, Margaret Sanger, racist and eugenicist background, and PP purpose. She also pointed out their clinics are strategically placed in minority communities.' Safe legal and rare is a lie,' she said. Every American should hear her out and reconcile hard truths. [embedded content]embedded content Nick Sandmann, KY, was a Covington High School student. This teen was mercilessly targeted by the media when he attended the March for Life rally in Washington last year for wearing a MAGA hat. The media placed him at the center of a viral video controversy with professional activist protesters leaving out all context to the video. He later sued several media outlets for defamation and, in a landmark case, won huge settlements. Tonight he wanted to tell his story, the real story, and let all Americans know how the media smeared him because the truth didn't matter and tried to 'cancel' him. Standing at the Lincoln monument, he says he looks forward to a day when media returns to providing unbiased coverage. He encourages all Americans to embrace our First Amendment rights and not cower from the media, tech companies, or the outrage mob who seek to censor or cancel us. Then he steels himself, stares right into the camera and proudly places the red MAGA hat on his head and smiles. His painful journey is palpable as he speaks, but his resolve and value system is on full view. This young man's story is about real bigotry and injustice and one of the most stirring speeches of the night. If you are raising a child, you should share this video with them. America could afford to have millions more Nick Sandmann. [embedded content]embedded content Pam Bondi,former Florida Attorney General, showed up to make her case. The case that Biden is the swamp and an opportunist who has enriched himself and his family members over the last four decades in government. Bondi lists the specific alleged offenses and which family member is involved and ends with, 'Joe says he will build back better,' Bondi says. 'Yeah, build the Bidens back better.' Watch her speechhere.[14] Montage Video of women working for Trump.Those he has hired and elevated in the White House and government in their own words. An honest person could not watch the video and still claim Trump does not promote women or is not supportive of working women their children or families. Tiffany Trump, daughter, and recent Law school graduate was the surprise speech of the evening. She spoke to millennials' fears and issues and came across knowledgeable, authentic, and relatable. 'This election, I urge each and every one of you to transcend political boundaries. This is a fight for freedom versus oppression, for opportunity versus stagnation, a fight to keep America true to America,' she says. 'I urge you to make your judgment based on results and not rhetoric.' Cutting through to the heart of the matter, she drags out the elephant in the room and says, 'misinformation system keeps people mentally enslaved to the ideas they deem correct,' referring to establishment media and big tech. She speaks to bold policies the Trump administration has implemented and laws that have a huge impact on people's lives. She, like her brothers, did a good job humanizing their father, Then admonishes Americans to stop allowing those to divide us and seek out both sides to a story or issue. This was also one of the best speeches this evening. It was a well crafted and delivered message. But will anyone outside Trump supporters hear it? [embedded content]embedded content Iowa Governor Kim Reynoldsspeaks about Trump's rapid response to the natural disasters her state has suffered. She explained how Trump cut through the bureaucracy to help Iowa farmers and communities on several devastating events.' This is an administration of action and outcomes.

'Two worlds collided as I knelt down beside her, a police officer and a homeless drug addict-brought together by forces outside of our control. As we talked, our humanity, distinct from our stations in life, was made abundantly clear,' he says. 'Her name was Crystal, and in the midst of her suffering, she confided that she loved her unborn baby. She wanted the best for her child. At that moment, I saw her the way that all of you who know or love an addict see them, as fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, cousins, friends. Human beings full of value and dignity but robbed of their potential by this disease.' Watch his speech here.[19] Florida Lieutenant Gov. Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez,daughter of Cuban immigrants. She shared the nightmare, which was her parent's life in communist Cuba.' The government confiscated private property\u2014stealing people's homes, farms, and businesses,' she says. 'For my parents, the difficult decision to flee Communist Cuba came when the Castro regime abolished religious freedom.'She says the 'fabric of our nation is in peril' because the radical left is chiseling away 'all the freedoms we cherish.' 'They peddle dangerous ideologies, cower to global progressives, and normalize socialism to dismantle our Constitution,' she says. 'Let me assure you, socialism doesn't offer opportunity. Socialism deprives. It is a falsehood that feigns promises for its masses and consistently yields only misery.' Like Maximo Alvarez last evening, she gave a stern warning about the path she feels this country is on if we vote in the radical left, and socialism is just window dressing for authoritarianism. Watch her speech here.[20]Video of Trump hosting a naturalization ceremony in the White House for five new citizens from five different countries (Bolivia, Lebanon, India, Sudan, and Ghana). Trump tells each new American they have earned the most priceless possession-American citizenship. He says it is an honor to be their President. Watch the video here[21]. Eric Trump is a son, and trustee and executive vice president ofthe Trump Organization[22]. He reminded all of how his father was dismissed leading up to the 2016 election, and supporters mocked. He championed the Silent Majority saying, 'The politics of identity, cancellation, and mob rule are not acceptable to me, and Republicans trust you, the people, to think for yourselves and to pursue your American Dream; however you see fit.' Then he contrasted and compared Biden's direction to his fathers. Like Tiffany, he humanized his father, and in a touching moment, he looked in the camera and told his father how proud he was of him, and to be his son. Watch his speech here.[23] Opportunity for all Americans Video Montage. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron. There is no getting around what a GOP rising star this man is, and this speech certainly fast tracks his political advancement. There were so many lines with depth, but rather than spoil the viewing in advance, and I will give you just one. 'Backwards, Joe Biden, I am not in chains!' Right Wire Report[24] wishes every 8 yr old black child in America could watch this speech. For that matter, every 8 yr old child period. [embedded content]embedded content Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State address, was delivered from Jerusalem with the old city as a background. He touted the Foreign policy successes of the Trump Administration, including the recent historic peace deal between Israel and the UAE. The summary was impressive. Watch his speechhere.[25] First Lady Melania Trumpwas the keynote speaker and delivered her words standing in the newly renovated Rose Garden along the colonnade at the White House with approximately 75 in attendance. Full disclosure - This writer as an American has been enraged watching how the media and Democrats have ostracized and belittled Our First Lady over these years, so it was lovely watching the montage video played honoring her accomplishments before she spoke. Read more about those here.[26] The setting was perfect just enough formality but also serene enough to settle her spirit as she poured it out to the county as a salve to start healing. The speech was, however, too long and needed a tad more construct at times but, none of that diminished the power and humanity of her message.The  First Lady as mother, wife, daughter, historian, mentor, unifier, and visionary delivered a speech wrapped up in a warm summers night in a historical Garden that whispered the occupant's lessons and heavy burdens that came before. This legacy was evident as she spoke to a divided nation suffering from a pandemic, civil unrest, and a world's pace that feels crushing at times to us all. You could hear the maturity and balance she set forth to cradle all of American's confused souls on this evening. Her plea to nurture and protect the world's most vulnerable, the children, and support to parents was frankly Mary Poppins spoonful of sugar time that was sorely needed. As far as the phrase 'when they go low, we go high'- Melania needs no platitudes or bromides to set the right tone. She delivered a sermon on the mount in regards to violence in our streets and enabling false narratives for political agendas and did so all while leaving those in need of the lesson with their dignity intact. She was authentic and credible and, her love and admiration for her husband, her family, and our country are undeniable. The campaign needs to expand the suburban female vote and, I do think any woman listening tonight with the capability to reason, and feel-was touched and moved. The C-Span callers said it best, here[27], here[28], here[29] and here.[30] America, listen to your hug and homework assignment: [embedded content]embedded content President Donald Trump released his second-term agenda in advance, and many of the items were highlighted tonight - seehere.[31] The four objectives for night two: Religious faith and freedoms are of critical importance and serve to maintain a healthy republic for believers and non-believers. Absolute commitment to defend life and gone are the days of the Republican Party, making apologies for one's faith or religious principles. Women talking directly to women and impressing upon them Trump's platform aligns with their needs and concerns. Female voices advocating that Trump is fair and cares about women issues Safety law and order, healthcare, education/school choice, income and employment, and no war. The Republican Party is a natural fit for women. Small Business is the engine of our economy. Tax and regulation policy can enhance growth or crush it. Trump has a proven record on building a strong economy he did it once he will do it again - YOU can trust him on the pocketbook issues. The alternative will drastically change your economic picture. Trump loves our country and its citizens and is not anti-immigrant. But American citizen's prosperity and safety are before that of those who do not follow our laws and reside in our country illegally. All policy objectives must adhere to that above principle if we are to be a sovereign, safe, and prosperous nation. Espousing that principle does not make you racist or a bigot. Law and order is justice for all. So far, one thing keeps bubbling to the surface - this is not your Daddy's Republican Party anymore. The Country Club, Corporate lobbyist, CEOs, Hollywood elites, Big Tech were off the stage the last two nights and, star billing was the Red White and Blue Jane and Joe American. We will be doing a summary on each consecutive night remaining, so check back. Like night one's brief, we will ask again for you to engage in an intellectual exercise that will be both enlightening and affirming as well as depressing. Take 15 minutes of your day and google headlines after each night, and compare and contrast, to Democrat convention headlines. Truly, eye-opening. First Lady Melania Trump was the keynote speaker and delivered her words standing in the newly renovated Rose Garden at the White House with approximately 75 in attendance. Her outreach to woman voters was one of my favorite uplifting moments of first lady's forward-looking 'Be Best' campaign The two nights was a resume.

Visually, night two of four was essentially the same using the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium and the White House interiors and gardens as a stage. There were montages, especially the Vice President\u2019s one, where we see interviews taking place in different locations around the country. Additionally, a speech delivered on Navajo land, ShiprockNew Mexico, with stunning scenery that takes your breath away.    There were less smooth transitions tonight and, some edits were glitchy. The most noticeable issue was when Nick Sandmann spoke from the Lincoln Memorial and, the ambient sound from visitors bled through the audio. Stylistically the energy was high but more intimate if that is even possible from last evening. There were plenty of bridges that connected Americans born on our soil to those just arriving, culminating in Mrs. Trump\u2019s immigrant journey as well. The emotive thread of opportunity, redemption, and the sense that we are all America\u2019s community stood out. Again message discipline was fierce. There was no day session for public view.

This is a powerful perspective on law enforcement and criminals who turn their lives around. \u201cEvery Social Justice Warrior\u201d and Inner city Americans are better off for watching it.    [embedded content]   [embedded content]  (Article Continues Below Advertisement)     Forgotten Men and Women Video \u2013 watch the video here.  Kentucky Senator Rand Paul reviewed Trump\u2019s record on criminal justice reform (First Step Act), noting Trump acted to undo the harms that people like Biden did to lock up a generation of young black men ( Clinton Crime Bill).

Cris Peterson , a Wisconsin dairy farmer, talked about how her 120-year-old barn caught on fire, and how Trump\u2019s economic boom started to help dairy farmers across the United States after decades of regulations and taxes swamped them.\u201d Trump knows what Farmers need to survive, she added and has done more good for farming and agriculture, more than any president in her lifetime.\u201d She championed Trump\u2019s trade deals as great for farmers and National and Domestic security. Watch her speech here.  Small Business Video \u2013 was a montage of real people explaining how taxation and regulation changes under Trump policies changed their lives and grew their businesses. Also, post COVID how PPP had been a lifeline.  Larry Kudlow , the White House National Economic Council Director, Reviews what Trump has done on the economy with free and fair trade deals lower taxation and regulatory reforms. He predicts a V-shaped recovery and more tax cuts and rollback of regulation if Trump gets another term. He chides Biden\u2019s platform, who raises taxes in a pandemic recession?

He explained how lean it was during Obama years and blamed Obama-Biden, two people who knew nothing about business, for not getting government out of the way.

He credits Trump and his policies on trade and regulations for bringing the Iron Range back to life and \u201croaring\u201d and communities thriving again. He warned that, like the previous Obama /Biden administration, Biden would cave to radical environmentalists. Watch his speech here.  Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood employee now Pro-Life Activist, gave a compelling testimony for the sanctity of life from a front-row seat. She touched on Planned Parenthood\u2019s founder, Margaret Sanger, racist and eugenicist background, and PP purpose. She also pointed out their clinics are strategically placed in minority communities.\u201d Safe legal and rare is a lie,\u201d she said. Every American should hear her out and reconcile hard truths.    [embedded content]   [embedded content]    Nick Sandmann , KY, was a Covington High School student. This teen was mercilessly targeted by the media when he attended the March for Life rally in Washington last year for wearing a MAGA hat. The media placed him at the center of a viral video controversy with professional activist protesters leaving out all context to the video. He later sued several media outlets for defamation and, in a landmark case, won huge settlements. Tonight he wanted to tell his story, the real story, and let all Americans know how the media smeared him because the truth didn\u2019t matter and tried to \u201ccancel\u201d him. Standing at the Lincoln monument, he says he looks forward to a day when media returns to providing unbiased coverage. He encourages all Americans to embrace our First Amendment rights and not cower from the media, tech companies, or the outrage mob who seek to censor or cancel us. Then he steels himself, stares right into the camera and proudly places the red MAGA hat on his head and smiles. His painful journey is palpable as he speaks, but his resolve and value system is on full view. This young man\u2019s story is about real bigotry and injustice and one of the most stirring speeches of the night. If you are raising a child, you should share this video with them. America could afford to have millions more Nick Sandmann.    [embedded content]   [embedded content]    Pam Bondi,  former Florida Attorney General, showed up to make her case.

Montage Video of women working for Trump .Those he has hired and elevated in the White House and government in their own words.

Tiffany Trump, daughter, and recent Law school graduate was the surprise speech of the evening. She spoke to millennials\u2019 fears and issues and came across knowledgeable, authentic, and relatable. \u201cThis election, I urge each and every one of you to transcend political boundaries. This is a fight for freedom versus oppression, for opportunity versus stagnation, a fight to keep America true to America,\u201d she says. \u201cI urge you to make your judgment based on results and not rhetoric.\u201d Cutting through to the heart of the matter, she drags out the elephant in the room and says, \u201cmisinformation system keeps people mentally enslaved to the ideas they deem correct,\u201d referring to establishment media and big tech. She speaks to bold policies the Trump administration has implemented and laws that have a huge impact on people\u2019s lives. She, like her brothers, did a good job humanizing their father, Then admonishes Americans to stop allowing those to divide us and seek out both sides to a story or issue.

Vice President Mike Pence introduces various people who have been helped by Trump\u2019s support for policies as they share their personal paths.     America is the Land of OPPORTUNITY! #RNC2020  pic.twitter.com/KIMDm5SKlF    \u2014 Mike Pence (@Mike_Pence) August 26, 2020    Ryan Holets , a New Mexico police officer who adopted a child of a person struggling with drug addiction, shares his inspirational story. \u201cTwo worlds collided as I knelt down beside her, a police officer and a homeless drug addict\u2013brought together by forces outside of our control. As we talked, our humanity, distinct from our stations in life, was made abundantly clear,\u201d he says. \u201cHer name was Crystal, and in the midst of her suffering, she confided that she loved her unborn baby. She wanted the best for her child. At that moment, I saw her the way that all of you who know or love an addict see them, as fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, cousins, friends. Human beings full of value and dignity but robbed of their potential by this disease.\u201d Watch his speech here.  Florida Lieutenant Gov. Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez,  daughter of Cuban immigrants. She shared the nightmare, which was her parent\u2019s life in communist Cuba.\u201d The government confiscated private property\u2014stealing people\u2019s homes, farms, and businesses,\u201d she says. \u201cFor my parents, the difficult decision to flee Communist Cuba came when the Castro regime abolished religious freedom.\u201d  She says the \u201cfabric of our nation is in peril\u201d because the radical left is chiseling away \u201call the freedoms we cherish.\u201d \u201cThey peddle dangerous ideologies, cower to global progressives, and normalize socialism to dismantle our Constitution,\u201d she says. \u201cLet me assure you, socialism doesn\u2019t offer opportunity. Socialism deprives. It is a falsehood that feigns promises for its masses and consistently yields only misery.\u201d Like Maximo Alvarez last evening, she gave a stern warning about the path she feels this country is on if we vote in the radical left, and socialism is just window dressing for authoritarianism. Watch her speech here.   Video of Trump hosting a naturalization ceremony in the White House for five new citizens from five different countries (Bolivia, Lebanon, India, Sudan, and Ghana). Trump tells each new American they have earned the most priceless possession\u2013American citizenship. He says it is an honor to be their President. Watch the video here .  Eric Trump is a son, and trustee and executive vice president of  the Trump Organization . He reminded all of how his father was dismissed leading up to the 2016 election, and supporters mocked. He championed the Silent Majority saying, \u201cThe politics of identity, cancellation, and mob rule are not acceptable to me, and Republicans trust you, the people, to think for yourselves and to pursue your American Dream; however you see fit.\u201d Then he contrasted and compared Biden\u2019s direction to his fathers. Like Tiffany, he humanized his father, and in a touching moment, he looked in the camera and told his father how proud he was of him, and to be his son. Watch his speech here.  Opportunity for all Americans Video Montage.  Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron. There is no getting around what a GOP rising star this man is, and this speech certainly fast tracks his political advancement. There were so many lines with depth, but rather than spoil the viewing in advance, and I will give you just one. \u201cBackwards, Joe Biden, I am not in chains!\u201d Right Wire Report wishes every 8 yr old black child in America could watch this speech. For that matter, every 8 yr old child period.    [embedded content]   [embedded content]    Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State address, was delivered from Jerusalem with the old city as a background. He touted the Foreign policy successes of the Trump Administration, including the recent historic peace deal between Israel and the UAE. The summary was impressive. Watch his speech  here.  First Lady Melania Trump  was the keynote speaker and delivered her words standing in the newly renovated Rose Garden along the colonnade at the White House with approximately 75 in attendance. Full disclosure \u2013 This writer as an American has been enraged watching how the media and Democrats have ostracized and belittled Our First Lady over these years, so it was lovely watching the montage video played honoring her accomplishments before she spoke. Read more about those here. The setting was perfect just enough formality but also serene enough to settle her spirit as she poured it out to the county as a salve to start healing. The speech was, however, too long and needed a tad more construct at times but, none of that diminished the power and humanity of her message.  The First Lady as mother, wife, daughter, historian, mentor, unifier, and visionary delivered a speech wrapped up in a warm summers night in a historical Garden that whispered the occupant\u2019s lessons and heavy burdens that came before. This legacy was evident as she spoke to a divided nation suffering from a pandemic, civil unrest, and a world\u2019s pace that feels crushing at times to us all. You could hear the maturity and balance she set forth to cradle all of American\u2019s confused souls on this evening. Her plea to nurture and protect the world\u2019s most vulnerable, the children, and support to parents was frankly Mary Poppins spoonful of sugar time that was sorely needed.    As far as the phrase \u201cwhen they go low, we go high\u201d- Melania needs no platitudes or bromides to set the right tone. She delivered a sermon on the mount in regards to violence in our streets and enabling false narratives for political agendas and did so all while leaving those in need of the lesson with their dignity intact. She was authentic and credible and, her love and admiration for her husband, her family, and our country are undeniable. The campaign needs to expand the suburban female vote and, I do think any woman listening tonight with the capability to reason, and feel-was touched and moved. The C-Span callers said it best, here , here , here and here. America, listen to your hug and homework assignment:      [embedded content]   [embedded content]    President Donald Trump released his second-term agenda in advance, and many of the items were highlighted tonight \u2013 see  here.    The four objectives for night two:    Religious faith and freedoms are of critical importance and serve to maintain a healthy republic for believers and non-believers. Absolute commitment to defend life and gone are the days of the Republican Party, making apologies for one\u2019s faith or religious principles.  Women talking directly to women and impressing upon them Trump\u2019s platform aligns with their needs and concerns. Female voices advocating that Trump is fair and cares about women issues Safety law and order, healthcare, education/school choice, income and employment, and no war. The Republican Party is a natural fit for women.  Small Business is the engine of our economy. Tax and regulation policy can enhance growth or crush it. Trump has a proven record on building a strong economy he did it once he will do it again \u2013 YOU can trust him on the pocketbook issues. The alternative will drastically change your economic picture.  Trump loves our country and its citizens and is not anti-immigrant. But American citizen\u2019s prosperity and safety are before that of those who do not follow our laws and reside in our country illegally. All policy objectives must adhere to that above principle if we are to be a sovereign, safe, and prosperous nation. Espousing that principle does not make you racist or a bigot. Law and order is justice for all.    So far, one thing keeps bubbling to the surface \u2013 this is not your Daddy\u2019s Republican Party anymore. The Country Club, Corporate lobbyist, CEOs, Hollywood elites, Big Tech were off the stage the last two nights and, star billing was the Red White and Blue Jane and Joe American.    We will be doing a summary on each consecutive night remaining, so check back. Like night one\u2019s brief, we will ask again for you to engage in an intellectual exercise that will be both enlightening and affirming as well as depressing. Take 15 minutes of your day and google headlines after each night, and compare and contrast, to Democrat convention headlines. Truly, eye-opening.    First Lady Melania Trump was the keynote speaker and delivered her words standing in the newly renovated Rose Garden at the White House with approximately 75 in attendance. Her outreach to woman voters was one of my favorite uplifting moments of first lady\u2019s forward-looking \u201cBe Best\u201d campaign    The two nights was a resume.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42928914554</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P6-6GK1-JCSC-J481-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3331\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Conservative Daily News</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 26, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>China Steel Corp</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China Steel Corp</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China Steel Corp</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China Steel Corp</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China Steel Corp</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China Steel Corp</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China Steel Corp</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China Steel Corp</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>2002</className><className>TAI</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>2002A</className><className>TAI</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CHSTC</className><className>LUX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CNS</className><className>STU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CISXF</className><className>PINX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CISEY</className><className>PINX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CNSD</className><className>LON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CISEF</className><className>GREY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: TW0002002003</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ISIN: TW0002002A04</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ISIN: </className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ISIN: </className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ISIN: </className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ISIN: </className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ISIN: </className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ISIN: TW0002002003</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Rehabilitations</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDcxOTg3NzE0Q0JENEIxNzg5RkQ5NUEzRDk2MjA4OUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0NCQzIzRkIxMzUzNEE2ODg4OUUyOUExOEU2MEM4MEU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

As more than 50 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance, billionaires became $637 billion richer. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's wealth has ballooned by 59%. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' wealth has increased by 39%. Walmart's Walton family has added $25 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big drug company CEOs and their major investors are doing nicely, too. Since the start of the pandemic, Big Pharma has raised prices on 245 prescription drugs, 61 of which are being used to treat COVID-19.</p><p> Apologists say this is the \"free market\" responding to supply and demand \u2013 the barons of Big Tech, online retail and Big Pharma merely providing what consumers desperately need during the pandemic.</p><p> But the market also operates under laws that ban profiteering, price gouging and monopolizing, and that tax excess profits in wartime. Where did these laws go? The Trump administration hasn't enforced them.</p><p> Donald Trump is also ignoring laws that ban trades on insider information. The White House is distributing billions in subsidies and loans to select corporations \u2013 enabling CEOs and boards to load up on stocks and stock options just before deals are announced, then rake in fat profits after stock prices surge.</p><p> Insiders from at least 11 companies have sold shares worth more than $1 billion after such announcements, according to an analysis by the New York Times.</p><p> In late June, a San Francisco company called Vaxart announced that the Trump administration had selected it to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Presto. The value of stock options distributed to company insiders just weeks before increased sixfold, according to the Times. Stock options held by Vaxart's CEO went from $4.3 million to more than $28 million.</p><p> Moderna, based in Cambridge, Mass., has never brought a vaccine to market, but company insiders have sold some $248 million of shares \u2013 most of them after the company was selected in April to receive federal funding. (Moderna plans to sell its vaccine for profit even though taxpayers have footed its research and development.)</p><p> The most blatant instance involves the venerable old camera and film maker, Kodak. On July 28, Trump announced a $765 million loan to the firm to bring drug production back to the United States. He called it \"one of the most important deals in the history of the U.S. pharmaceutical industries,\" even though Kodak isn't even a pharmaceutical company.</p><p> Before the announcement, Kodak had handed its board of directors 240,000 stock options, and just the day before had given its CEO 1.75 million stock options. After Trump's announcement, Kodak shares shot up more than 2,757%. Suddenly, the board's stock options were worth about $4 million, and the CEO's about $50 million.</p><p> Is this sort of insider trading against the law? You bet. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the deal, which is now temporarily on hold.</p><p> But the SEC's co-director of enforcement, Steven Peikin, who had been investigating several of the deals involving the White House and corporate insiders, including Kodak, resigned last week without explanation. Another in the lengthening list of independent regulators and inspectors general forced out by Trump?</p><p> This much is clear: Trump and his Republican enablers won't provide $600 per week to tens of millions of Americans who need the money to survive the pandemic, because Trump and the GOP believe the money undermines incentives to work. Yet Trump has no problem letting billionaires illegally profit off the pandemic. He thinks that as long as they buoy the stock market, they're helping the American economy.</p><p> That's pure rubbish. The stock market is not America. The richest 1% of Americans own half the value of all shares of stock held by American households. The richest 10% own 92%. For years now, stock prices have risen largely because profits have been siphoned from the wages of ordinary workers.</p><p> In the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, stock prices are almost back to where they were before the pandemic began.

Elizabeth Warren, a presidential hopeful, announced Friday she wants to bust up giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">America's first Gilded Age began in the late 19th century with a raft of innovations -- railroads, steel production, oil extraction -- but culminated in mammoth trusts run by \"robber barons\" such as J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller and William H. (\"The public be damned!\") Vanderbilt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The answer then was to bust up the railroad, oil and steel monopolies.</p><p> We're now in a second Gilded Age -- ushered in by semiconductors, software and the internet -- that has spawned a handful of high-tech behemoths and a new set of barons such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page.</p><p> The answer now is the same: Bust up the monopolies.</p><p> The current effort is bipartisan. At a Senate hearing I testified at last week, arch-conservative Missouri Republican Josh Hawley asked me, rhetorically, \"Is there really any wonder that there is increased pressure for antitrust enforcement activity, for privacy activity when these companies behave in the way that they do?\"</p><p> Hawley added, \"Every day brings some creepy new revelation about these companies' behaviors. Of course the public is going to want there to be action to defend their rights. It's only natural.\"</p><p> Nearly 90 percent of all internet searches now go through Google. Facebook and Google together account for 58 percent of all digital ads (where most ad money goes these days).</p><p> They're also the first stops for many Americans seeking news (93 percent of Americans receive news online). Amazon is now the first stop for a third of all American consumers seeking to buy anything.</p><p> With such size comes the power to stifle innovation. Amazon won't let any business that sells through it sell any item at a lower price anywhere else. It's even using its control over book sales to give books published by Amazon priority over rival publishers.</p><p>Google uses the world's most widely used search engine to promote its own services and content over those of competitors. Facebook's purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram killed off two potential rivals.</p><p> Contrary to the conventional view of America as a hotbed of entrepreneurship, the rate at which new job-creating businesses have formed in the United States has been halved since 2004, according to the Census Bureau.</p><p> Such size also confers political power to get whatever these companies and their top executives want.</p><p>Amazon, the richest corporation in America, paid nothing in federal taxes last year. Meanwhile, it's holding an auction to extort billions from states and cities eager to have its second headquarters.</p><p> It also forced Seattle, its home headquarters, to back down on a plan to tax big corporations like itself to pay for homeless shelters for a growing population that can't afford the sky-high rents caused in part by Amazon.</p><p>Facebook withheld evidence of Russian activity on its platform far longer than previously disclosed. When the news came to light, the company employed a political opposition research firm to discredit critics.</p><p> Zuckerberg, who holds the world speed record for falling from one of the most admired figures on the planet to one of the most reviled, just unveiled a plan to \"encrypt\" personal information from all his platforms. The new plan is likely to give Facebook even more comprehensive data about everyone. If you believe it will better guard privacy, you don't remember Zuckerberg's last seven promises to protect privacy.</p><p> The New America Foundation, an influential think tank Google helped fund, fired researchers who were urging antitrust officials to take on the company. And Google has been quietly financing hundreds of professors to write research papers justifying Google's market dominance.</p><p> What to do? Some argue that the tech mammoths should be regulated like utilities or common carriers, but this would put government in the impossible position of policing content and overseeing new products and services.</p><p> A better alternative is to break them up. That way, information would be distributed through a large number of independent channels without a centralized platform giving all content apparent legitimacy and extraordinary reach. And more startups could flourish.</p><p> Like the robber barons of the first Gilded Age, those of the second have amassed fortunes that gave them unparalleled influence over politicians and the economy.</p><p> The combined wealth of Zuckerberg ($62.3 billion), Bezos ($131 billion), Brin ($49.8 billion) and Page ($50.8 billion) is larger than the combined wealth of the bottom half of the American population.</p><p> A wealth tax (also proposed by Warren) would help.</p><p> Some of the robber barons of the first Gilded Age were generous philanthropists, as are today's. That didn't excuse the damage they did to America.</p><p> Monopolies aren't good for anyone except for the monopolists. In this new Gilded Age, we need to respond to them as forcefully as we did the first time around. Warren's ideas are a good start.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKVA-87652638da504314b5ad47e5ed88e0737529911d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28992B331E5C3B NWBKVA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN2-WD81-JBCN-44VW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401985</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"840\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Northern Virginia Daily<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Both are powered by an inexorable sense of self-righteousness. And both have an awful lot of experience of saying sorry.</p><p>The most recent example came when Sir Nick appeared on the BBC in the wake of the furore over the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7536264/nick-clegg-facebook-global-head-of-affairs-wife-miriam-gonzalez-durantez/\">death of 14-year-old Molly Russell.</url></p><p>It turned out, after she was found dead in her bedroom in December 2017, that she had been viewing material online relating to depression, self-harm and suicide - material which was shockingly easy to find.As her father Ian Russell put it bluntly: \"Instagram helped kill my daughter.\"</p><p>Sir Nick, to his credit, said all the right things about how the firm was determined to do more. But he also made the striking claim that it is sometimes better for Facebook and Instagram to keep suicide images online, because it helps other vulnerable young people get support.</p><p>This after The Sun, on Saturday, found and flagged up multiple images appearing to normalise and even romanticise suicide, all within a few clicks. Many remained published for days, and a Facebook spokesman claimed they could be beneficial to users battling mental health issues.</p><p>Sir Nick says the firm is following the advice from leading experts and charities. And it may well be doing the right thing. But this is the latest example of Facebook - and other social media giants in general - only acting to tackle a problem once it becomes impossible not to.</p><p>Over the past decade, social media has come to dominate our lives. The latest research from Ofcom shows internet use rocketing among children and teenagers, with friendships and social lives increasingly run through screens and phones.</p><p>And it is now clear that this great move online has been accompanied, for our children, by a staggering increase in mental health problems.</p><p>The situation is particularly alarming when it comes to young women. The latest NHS data found that one in four of those aged 17 to 19 report having a mental health disorder - twice the rate among boys.</p><p>In 2017 alone, one in five US girls aged between 12 and 17 suffered a major depressive episode - one in five! Suicide rates for teenage girls, according to academic Jonathan Haidt, have risen by 82 per cent in the US and 46 per cent in the UK in a decade.</p><p>This isn't just about what happens on the internet. Those having problems online often tend to be experiencing problems offline too, such as bullying, harassment or broken families.</p><p>More broadly, Haidt believes the \"snowflake\" phenomenon reflects that \"helicopter parenting\" leaves children less prepared to cope with shocks and difficulty. But the internet, and social media, are very clearly intensifying those problems. And the big tech firms are still playing catch-up.</p><p>The traditional argument from Silicon Valley is that it's not their job to regulate human behaviour. They add that even if they wanted to, there is simply too much out there.</p><p>They are doing their best to crack down on inappropriate content, but it's like trying to stem the tide. Behind the scenes - they insist - thousands of people are working day and night to detect and delete messages promoting terrorism, hatred, Holocaust denial and self-harm.</p><p>But this argument just doesn't wash. It's very clear that, in the interests of their bottom lines, many of the big social media firms have long failed to put enough resources into detecting damaging content.</p><p>Researchers have shown, for example, how following the recommended links from reputable YouTube content can lead to a carnival of horrors. News reports that segue into crackpot conspiracy theories and videos for toddlers that give way to horrendous scenes of a bloodied Minnie Mouse trapped in an escalator.</p><p>Every day brings new horror stories, such as rival fans of royals Kate and Meghan using the Kensington Palace Instagram to send death threats to each other. Increasingly, online hate is triggering real-life violence. The slaughter of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma was, The New York Times said, \"a genocide incited on Facebook\".</p><p>Part of the reason that Zuckerberg has hired Clegg is to put his house in order. Clegg has talked the right talk about changing Facebook's culture, and in particular doing more to tackle self-harm.</p><p>He even says they might start paying more tax. But if Zuckerberg's answer to \"how to fix the internet\" is \"hire Nick Clegg\", we have still got an awfully long way to go.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Robert Colvile is the director of think tank Centre for Policy Studies.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>If you are worried about yourself or someone else, the Samaritans are available free at any time on 116 123.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>GOT a story?

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: We should mention the study mentioned by Representative Smith has been refuted by multiple third parties. And while there's no evidence of systemic censoring of conservatives, there's also little denying that Google's workforce is largely liberal. That has fueled Republican claims from House Judiciary Chair Bob Goodlatte to President Trump himself that they are being silence across search, news, and social media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining us now to discuss Congressman Bob Goodlatte himself who led Tuesday's hearing. So, Congressman Goodlatte, thank you so much for joining us. First question, how satisfied were you with Pichai's answers about bias or lack thereof?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">REP. ROBERT GOODLATTE (R), VIRGINIA: Well, it was a very good hearing. I the members on both sides of the aisle asked a lot of very good questions. I think on this issue of bias, Mr. Pichai was not very helpful in determining whether or not when they rely on third parties, like the Southern Poverty Law Center which has labeled some groups that are clearly not racist as being racist. In fact, have been sued by at least one entity and had to pay multimillion dollar judgment, that indicates to me that this is a problem that Google is still wrestling with, has not resolved</p><p>And when you see the California Republican Party labeled by Google, when it say ideology and they bring up nazism or a North Carolina senator when her photograph is placed up, below that it says that she's a bigot. These are things that whether it's systemic bias or whether it's simply a flaw in their algorithms is a serious problem that they do need to address. There were a lot of other issues we talked about today as well.</p><p>CHANG: How does Google square the other perception problem that because its workforce is largely left leaning that it is biased no matter what Pichai says?</p><p>GOODLATTE: I think they have to work overtime to gain the confidence of a large percentage of the American population who wants to be assured that when they conduct search or when they search for particular things on Youtube, a Google subsidiary, they're going to get fairly treated and they're going to get unbiased information about what it is they are searching for.</p><p>CHANG: Now, we heard several Republicans say things along the lines of \"I don't want to regulate you, but\", which is it? Do the Republicans want to regulate Google or not?</p><p>GOODLATTE: I think overwhelmingly the Republicans do not want to regulate Google, but the problem they find themselves in, Google does, is that they have an exemption under the law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that allows them to censor objectionable material without facing the kind of liability laws that others, for example, organizations that they rely upon, are subject to.</p><p>And just like your news organization or a radio station or a newspaper are subject to those libel laws and can be held liable for falsehoods. This exemption that technology companies have, given the fact that they have moved from simply providing a platform on which anybody can post whatever they want to, people can look at it. And therefore, they're saying, well, we're like a phone company, we can't control what people do over our system. They have now become editors of that content.</p><p>And therefore, I think the Congress does need to take a close look at how these companies are regulating themselves. I'm not, again, I'm not saying that the government should regulate them, but if they are subject to libel laws, you don't need regulations because I can assure you that media companies that are subject to libel laws, take great pains to make sure that they are not sued for libel. If that same standard were applied to these technology companies, that might be a self-regulatory influence.</p><p>CHANG: So if Democrats brought antitrust legislation, how do you imagine Republicans would respond?</p><p>GOODLATTE: Well, I think you'd have to see what the legislation does, our antitrust laws are important with regard to Google because they control about 90% of the searches in this country. I think that Youtube has about 75% of the adult population and close to 95% of the 18 to 24-year-olds using it.</p><p>So they are definitely an important market power. They've grown to that position because they have provided services that people want and people need. And when you go in and try to use the antitrust laws, I'm not opposed to doing that, but you have to do it in a way that takes great pains to make sure that you don't result. You don't have a result that takes away from people the kinds of things that they count on for Google to provide them.</p><p>The other thing I think that this hearing helped with American consumer was to make them more painfully aware than they may already be about just exactly how much overwhelming information Google has about you. If you have an android device on your person and a majority of Americans do, they know when you bend over. They know when you go from the first floor to the second floor.</p><p>They know the temperature in the room that you're in and you couple that with all of the informations they gain by the things that you search for. They know a tremendous amount about people and they have to work overtime, as I say, to make sure that they continue to have the trust of the American people.</p><p>And I think they're losing that right now. And I think that's why after months and months and months of trying, we were fortunate that their CEO Sundar Pichai did agree to come forward and talk to us about all of this.</p><p>CHANG: So where do you think Republicans and Democrats might actually be able to find common ground when it comes to legislating big tech in a new Congress?</p><p>GOODLATTE: Well, it might be around examining how Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, it might be around some antitrust law. I think we're too new into this know where that consensus might develop. There certainly was a lot of consensus and concern about the fact that Google is right now in discussions with the Chinese government about entering into their market, a market that they withdrew from in 2010, re-entering that market with technology that would allow the Chinese government to censor and gather information that Americans would be very appalled about if they tried to do thing in United States.</p><p>That kind of double standard is concerning. But again, their competitors are in that Chinese market. So they're trying to figure out how they can do that in a way that still allows them to uphold their American ideals of free speech and privacy and so on, that one would be concerned about in doing business in China. I think that they need to be very careful before they enter into kind of agreement to get into that market.</p><p>CHANG: Now, Facebook and Twitter have gotten a disproportionate amount of the criticism when it comes to meddling, disinformation in the United States, in US elections. What do you think Google's role in preventing the spread of misinformation should be?</p><p>GOODLATTE: Well, how you conduct a search can be very, very influential in terms of what information you have and how you go about the decision-making process of what candidate to vote for or what information you're going to rely upon.</p><p>So when you type in a search term in Google, it immediately starts giving you suggestions, three, four, five suggestions right below the search bar and those have been shown by some studies to be biased. Now, if indeed that's the case, Google needs to re-evaluate that to make sure that when people do that, they are getting a fair sampling of the information they need.</p><p>Then, once the search is conducted and they produce information, how they put it up in front of the viewer. I know there are company that wants to monetize the information they have and, therefore, make as much revenue from advertising as possible, but they have to balance that against their responsibility to provide balanced information to their customers.</p><p>CHANG: All right. Representative Bob Goodlatte, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, thank you so much, Congressman, for stopping by.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: We should mention the study mentioned by Representative Smith has been refuted by multiple third parties. And while there's no evidence of systemic censoring of conservatives, there's also little denying that Google's workforce is largely liberal. That has fueled Republican claims from House Judiciary Chair Bob Goodlatte to President Trump himself that they are being silence across search, news, and social media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining us now to discuss Congressman Bob Goodlatte himself who led Tuesday's hearing. So, Congressman Goodlatte, thank you so much for joining us. First question, how satisfied were you with Pichai's answers about bias or lack thereof?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">REP. ROBERT GOODLATTE (R), VIRGINIA: Well, it was a very good hearing. I the members on both sides of the aisle asked a lot of very good questions. I think on this issue of bias, Mr. Pichai was not very helpful in determining whether or not when they rely on third parties, like the Southern Poverty Law Center which has labeled some groups that are clearly not racist as being racist. In fact, have been sued by at least one entity and had to pay multimillion dollar judgment, that indicates to me that this is a problem that Google is still wrestling with, has not resolved</p><p>And when you see the California Republican Party labeled by Google, when it say ideology and they bring up nazism or a North Carolina senator when her photograph is placed up, below that it says that she's a bigot. These are things that whether it's systemic bias or whether it's simply a flaw in their algorithms is a serious problem that they do need to address. There were a lot of other issues we talked about today as well.</p><p>CHANG: How does Google square the other perception problem that because its workforce is largely left leaning that it is biased no matter what Pichai says?</p><p>GOODLATTE: I think they have to work overtime to gain the confidence of a large percentage of the American population who wants to be assured that when they conduct search or when they search for particular things on Youtube, a Google subsidiary, they're going to get fairly treated and they're going to get unbiased information about what it is they are searching for.</p><p>CHANG: Now, we heard several Republicans say things along the lines of \"I don't want to regulate you, but\", which is it? Do the Republicans want to regulate Google or not?</p><p>GOODLATTE: I think overwhelmingly the Republicans do not want to regulate Google, but the problem they find themselves in, Google does, is that they have an exemption under the law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that allows them to censor objectionable material without facing the kind of liability laws that others, for example, organizations that they rely upon, are subject to.</p><p>And just like your news organization or a radio station or a newspaper are subject to those libel laws and can be held liable for falsehoods. This exemption that technology companies have, given the fact that they have moved from simply providing a platform on which anybody can post whatever they want to, people can look at it. And therefore, they're saying, well, we're like a phone company, we can't control what people do over our system. They have now become editors of that content.</p><p>And therefore, I think the Congress does need to take a close look at how these companies are regulating themselves. I'm not, again, I'm not saying that the government should regulate them, but if they are subject to libel laws, you don't need regulations because I can assure you that media companies that are subject to libel laws, take great pains to make sure that they are not sued for libel. If that same standard were applied to these technology companies, that might be a self-regulatory influence.</p><p>CHANG: So if Democrats brought antitrust legislation, how do you imagine Republicans would respond?</p><p>GOODLATTE: Well, I think you'd have to see what the legislation does, our antitrust laws are important with regard to Google because they control about 90% of the searches in this country. I think that Youtube has about 75% of the adult population and close to 95% of the 18 to 24-year-olds using it.</p><p>So they are definitely an important market power. They've grown to that position because they have provided services that people want and people need. And when you go in and try to use the antitrust laws, I'm not opposed to doing that, but you have to do it in a way that takes great pains to make sure that you don't result. You don't have a result that takes away from people the kinds of things that they count on for Google to provide them.</p><p>The other thing I think that this hearing helped with American consumer was to make them more painfully aware than they may already be about just exactly how much overwhelming information Google has about you. If you have an android device on your person and a majority of Americans do, they know when you bend over. They know when you go from the first floor to the second floor.</p><p>They know the temperature in the room that you're in and you couple that with all of the informations they gain by the things that you search for. They know a tremendous amount about people and they have to work overtime, as I say, to make sure that they continue to have the trust of the American people.</p><p>And I think they're losing that right now. And I think that's why after months and months and months of trying, we were fortunate that their CEO Sundar Pichai did agree to come forward and talk to us about all of this.</p><p>CHANG: So where do you think Republicans and Democrats might actually be able to find common ground when it comes to legislating big tech in a new Congress?</p><p>GOODLATTE: Well, it might be around examining how Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, it might be around some antitrust law. I think we're too new into this know where that consensus might develop. There certainly was a lot of consensus and concern about the fact that Google is right now in discussions with the Chinese government about entering into their market, a market that they withdrew from in 2010, re-entering that market with technology that would allow the Chinese government to censor and gather information that Americans would be very appalled about if they tried to do thing in United States.</p><p>That kind of double standard is concerning. But again, their competitors are in that Chinese market. So they're trying to figure out how they can do that in a way that still allows them to uphold their American ideals of free speech and privacy and so on, that one would be concerned about in doing business in China. I think that they need to be very careful before they enter into kind of agreement to get into that market.</p><p>CHANG: Now, Facebook and Twitter have gotten a disproportionate amount of the criticism when it comes to meddling, disinformation in the United States, in US elections. What do you think Google's role in preventing the spread of misinformation should be?</p><p>GOODLATTE: Well, how you conduct a search can be very, very influential in terms of what information you have and how you go about the decision-making process of what candidate to vote for or what information you're going to rely upon.</p><p>So when you type in a search term in Google, it immediately starts giving you suggestions, three, four, five suggestions right below the search bar and those have been shown by some studies to be biased. Now, if indeed that's the case, Google needs to re-evaluate that to make sure that when people do that, they are getting a fair sampling of the information they need.</p><p>Then, once the search is conducted and they produce information, how they put it up in front of the viewer. I know there are company that wants to monetize the information they have and, therefore, make as much revenue from advertising as possible, but they have to balance that against their responsibility to provide balanced information to their customers.</p><p>CHANG: All right. Representative Bob Goodlatte, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, thank you so much, Congressman, for stopping by.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

There  were a lot of other issues we talked about today as well.</p><p>CHANG:  How does Google square the other perception problem that because  its workforce is largely left leaning that it is biased no matter what  Pichai says?</p><p>GOODLATTE:  I think they have to work overtime to gain the confidence of a  large percentage of the American population who wants to be assured that  when they conduct search or when they search for particular things on  Youtube, a Google subsidiary, they're going to get fairly treated and  they're going to get unbiased information about what it is they are  searching for.</p><p>CHANG:  Now, we heard several Republicans say things along the lines of \"I  don't want to regulate you, but\", which is it?  Do the Republicans want to  regulate Google or not?</p><p>GOODLATTE:  I think overwhelmingly the Republicans do not want to regulate  Google, but the problem they find themselves in, Google does, is that they  have an exemption under the law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency  Act that allows them to censor objectionable material without facing the  kind of liability laws that others, for example, organizations that they  rely upon, are subject to.</p><p>And just like your news organization or a radio station or a newspaper are  subject to those libel laws and can be held liable for falsehoods.  This  exemption that technology companies have, given the fact that they have  moved from simply providing a platform on which anybody can post whatever  they want to, people can look at it.  And therefore, they're saying, well,  we're like a phone company, we can't control what people do over our  system.  They have now become editors of that content.</p><p>And therefore, I think the Congress does need to take a close look at how  these companies are regulating themselves.  I'm not, again, I'm not saying  that the government should regulate them, but if they are subject to libel  laws, you don't need regulations because I can assure you that media  companies that are subject to libel laws, take great pains to make sure  that they are not sued for libel.  If that same standard were applied to  these technology companies, that might be a self-regulatory influence.</p><p>CHANG:  So if Democrats brought antitrust legislation, how do you imagine  Republicans would respond?</p><p>GOODLATTE:  Well, I think you'd have to see what the legislation does, our  antitrust laws are important with regard to Google because they control  about 90% of the searches in this country.  I think that Youtube has about  75% of the adult population and close to 95% of the 18 to 24-year-olds  using it.</p><p>So they are definitely an important market power.  They've grown to that  position because they have provided services that people want and people  need.  And when you go in and try to use the antitrust laws, I'm not  opposed to doing that, but you have to do it in a way that takes great  pains to make sure that you don't result.  You don't have a result that  takes away from people the kinds of things that they count on for Google to  provide them.</p><p>The other thing I think that this hearing helped with American consumer was  to make them more painfully aware than they may already be about just  exactly how much overwhelming information Google has about you.  If you  have an android device on your person and a majority of Americans do, they  know when you bend over.  They know when you go from the first floor to the  second floor.</p><p>They know the temperature in the room that you're in and you couple that  with all of the informations they gain by the things that you search for.   They know a tremendous amount about people and they have to work overtime,  as I say, to make sure that they continue to have the trust of the American  people.</p><p>And I think they're losing that right now.  And I think that's why after  months and months and months of trying, we were fortunate that their CEO  Sundar Pichai did agree to come forward and talk to us about all of this.</p><p>CHANG:  So where do you think Republicans and Democrats might actually be  able to find common ground when it comes to legislating big tech in a new  Congress?</p><p>GOODLATTE:  Well, it might be around examining how Section 230 of the  Communications Decency Act, it might be around some antitrust law.  I think  we're too new into this know where that consensus might develop.  There  certainly was a lot of consensus and concern about the fact that Google is  right now in discussions with the Chinese government about entering into  their market, a market that they withdrew from in 2010, re-entering that  market with technology that would allow the Chinese government to censor  and gather information that Americans would be very appalled about if they  tried to do thing in United States.</p><p>That kind of double standard is concerning.  But again, their competitors  are in that Chinese market.  So they're trying to figure out how they can  do that in a way that still allows them to uphold their American ideals of  free speech and privacy and so on, that one would be concerned about in  doing business in China.  I think that they need to be very careful before  they enter into kind of agreement to get into that market.</p><p>CHANG:  Now, Facebook and Twitter have gotten a disproportionate amount of  the criticism when it comes to meddling, disinformation in the United  States, in US elections.  What do you think Google's role in preventing the  spread of misinformation should be?</p><p>GOODLATTE:  Well, how you conduct a search can be very, very influential in  terms of what information you have and how you go about the decision-making  process of what candidate to vote for or what information you're going to  rely upon.</p><p>So when you type in a search term in Google, it immediately starts giving  you suggestions, three, four, five suggestions right below the search bar  and those have been shown by some studies to be biased.  Now, if indeed  that's the case, Google needs to re-evaluate that to make sure that when  people do that, they are getting a fair sampling of the information they  need.</p><p>Then, once the search is conducted and they produce information, how they  put it up in front of the viewer.  I know there are company that wants to  monetize the information they have and, therefore, make as much revenue  from advertising as possible, but they have to balance that against their  responsibility to provide balanced information to their customers.</p><p>CHANG:  All right.  Representative Bob Goodlatte, Chair of the House  Judiciary Committee, thank you so much, Congressman, for stopping by.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p> EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  We should mention the study mentioned by  Representative Smith has been refuted by multiple third parties.  And while  there's no evidence of systemic censoring of conservatives, there's also  little denying that Google's workforce is largely liberal.  That has fueled  Republican claims from House Judiciary Chair Bob Goodlatte to President  Trump himself that they are being silence across search, news, and social  media.</p><p> Joining us now to discuss Congressman Bob Goodlatte himself who led  Tuesday's hearing.  So, Congressman Goodlatte, thank you so much for  joining us.  First question, how satisfied were you with Pichai's answers  about bias or lack thereof?</p><p> REP. ROBERT GOODLATTE (R), VIRGINIA:  Well, it was a very good hearing.  I  the members on both sides of the aisle asked a lot of very good questions.   I think on this issue of bias, Mr. Pichai was not very helpful in  determining whether or not when they rely on third parties, like the  Southern Poverty Law Center which has labeled some groups that are clearly  not racist as being racist.  In fact, have been sued by at least one entity  and had to pay multimillion dollar judgment, that indicates to me that this  is a problem that Google is still wrestling with, has not resolved</p><p> And when you see the California Republican Party labeled by Google, when it  say ideology and they bring up nazism or a North Carolina senator when her  photograph is placed up, below that it says that she's a bigot.  These are  things that whether it's systemic bias or whether it's simply a flaw in  their algorithms is a serious problem that they do need to address.  There  were a lot of other issues we talked about today as well.</p><p> CHANG:  How does Google square the other perception problem that because  its workforce is largely left leaning that it is biased no matter what  Pichai says?</p><p> GOODLATTE:  I think they have to work overtime to gain the confidence of a  large percentage of the American population who wants to be assured that  when they conduct search or when they search for particular things on  Youtube, a Google subsidiary, they're going to get fairly treated and  they're going to get unbiased information about what it is they are  searching for.</p><p> CHANG:  Now, we heard several Republicans say things along the lines of \"I  don't want to regulate you, but\", which is it?  Do the Republicans want to  regulate Google or not?</p><p> GOODLATTE:  I think overwhelmingly the Republicans do not want to regulate  Google, but the problem they find themselves in, Google does, is that they  have an exemption under the law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency  Act that allows them to censor objectionable material without facing the  kind of liability laws that others, for example, organizations that they  rely upon, are subject to.</p><p> And just like your news organization or a radio station or a newspaper are  subject to those libel laws and can be held liable for falsehoods.  This  exemption that technology companies have, given the fact that they have  moved from simply providing a platform on which anybody can post whatever  they want to, people can look at it.  And therefore, they're saying, well,  we're like a phone company, we can't control what people do over our  system.  They have now become editors of that content.</p><p> And therefore, I think the Congress does need to take a close look at how  these companies are regulating themselves.  I'm not, again, I'm not saying  that the government should regulate them, but if they are subject to libel  laws, you don't need regulations because I can assure you that media  companies that are subject to libel laws, take great pains to make sure  that they are not sued for libel.  If that same standard were applied to  these technology companies, that might be a self-regulatory influence.</p><p> CHANG:  So if Democrats brought antitrust legislation, how do you imagine  Republicans would respond?</p><p> GOODLATTE:  Well, I think you'd have to see what the legislation does, our  antitrust laws are important with regard to Google because they control  about 90% of the searches in this country.  I think that Youtube has about  75% of the adult population and close to 95% of the 18 to 24-year-olds  using it.</p><p> So they are definitely an important market power.  They've grown to that  position because they have provided services that people want and people  need.  And when you go in and try to use the antitrust laws, I'm not  opposed to doing that, but you have to do it in a way that takes great  pains to make sure that you don't result.  You don't have a result that  takes away from people the kinds of things that they count on for Google to  provide them.</p><p> The other thing I think that this hearing helped with American consumer was  to make them more painfully aware than they may already be about just  exactly how much overwhelming information Google has about you.  If you  have an android device on your person and a majority of Americans do, they  know when you bend over.  They know when you go from the first floor to the  second floor.</p><p> They know the temperature in the room that you're in and you couple that  with all of the informations they gain by the things that you search for.   They know a tremendous amount about people and they have to work overtime,  as I say, to make sure that they continue to have the trust of the American  people.</p><p> And I think they're losing that right now.  And I think that's why after  months and months and months of trying, we were fortunate that their CEO  Sundar Pichai did agree to come forward and talk to us about all of this.</p><p> CHANG:  So where do you think Republicans and Democrats might actually be  able to find common ground when it comes to legislating big tech in a new  Congress?</p><p> GOODLATTE:  Well, it might be around examining how Section 230 of the  Communications Decency Act, it might be around some antitrust law.  I think  we're too new into this know where that consensus might develop.  There  certainly was a lot of consensus and concern about the fact that Google is  right now in discussions with the Chinese government about entering into  their market, a market that they withdrew from in 2010, re-entering that  market with technology that would allow the Chinese government to censor  and gather information that Americans would be very appalled about if they  tried to do thing in United States.</p><p> That kind of double standard is concerning.  But again, their competitors  are in that Chinese market.  So they're trying to figure out how they can  do that in a way that still allows them to uphold their American ideals of  free speech and privacy and so on, that one would be concerned about in  doing business in China.  I think that they need to be very careful before  they enter into kind of agreement to get into that market.</p><p> CHANG:  Now, Facebook and Twitter have gotten a disproportionate amount of  the criticism when it comes to meddling, disinformation in the United  States, in US elections.  What do you think Google's role in preventing the  spread of misinformation should be?</p><p> GOODLATTE:  Well, how you conduct a search can be very, very influential in  terms of what information you have and how you go about the decision-making  process of what candidate to vote for or what information you're going to  rely upon.</p><p> So when you type in a search term in Google, it immediately starts giving  you suggestions, three, four, five suggestions right below the search bar  and those have been shown by some studies to be biased.  Now, if indeed  that's the case, Google needs to re-evaluate that to make sure that when  people do that, they are getting a fair sampling of the information they  need.</p><p> Then, once the search is conducted and they produce information, how they  put it up in front of the viewer.  I know there are company that wants to  monetize the information they have and, therefore, make as much revenue  from advertising as possible, but they have to balance that against their  responsibility to provide balanced information to their customers.</p><p> CHANG:  All right.  Representative Bob Goodlatte, Chair of the House  Judiciary Committee, thank you so much, Congressman, for stopping by.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Here\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing\">the sign-up</url>.) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening. Here\u2019s the latest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. The Justice Department agreed to give Congress<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/mueller-judiciary-committee.html\">key evidence</url> collected by Robert Mueller related to possible obstruction of justice by President Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agreement comes after weeks of tense negotiations. The exact scope of the material was not immediately clear, but it appeared to provide a rationale for House Democrats\u2019 choice to back away from threats to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress. Above, Capitol Hill today.</p><p>Mr. Barr is quickly emerging as the most <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/us/politics/who-is-william-barr.html\">influential figure</url> in the second half of Mr. Trump\u2019s term. A former senior Justice Department official described him as \u201cthe closest thing we have to Dick Cheney,\u201d referring to President George Bush\u2019s unusually powerful vice president.</p><p>_____</p><p>2. President Trump claimed a \u201cfully signed and documented\u201d agreement between the U.S. and Mexico would be revealed soon. But a top Mexican official said no such agreement existed.</p><p>Instead, Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, said that there was an understanding that both sides would <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/immigration-mexico-deal-trump.html\">evaluate the flow of migrants</url> in the coming months. If the numbers do not change, he said, both sides had agreed to renew discussions about more aggressive changes.</p><p>His remarks came as doctors along the border said migrants who were sick or injured were being <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/border-migrants-medical-health-doctors.html\">treated like criminals</url> when they were taken to hospitals for medical care. Above, migrants from Central America at a church shelter in El Paso, Tex.</p><p>The president also defended the decision to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/trump-tariffs-china.html\">threaten trade partners</url> like Mexico with tariffs, which he called \u201cbeautiful.\u201d</p><p>_____</p><p>3. Senator Elizabeth Warren has lots of plans. Together, they would remake the economy.</p><p>The policies include tipping power from executives and investors to workers, placing big tax increases on the wealthiest individuals and companies, and splintering technology groups. Critics say they could hurt businesses and consumers, but the sheer volume of her plans is forcing her rivals to play catch-up.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020-policies-platform.html\">Here's a look at her proposals</url>.</p><p>Separately, after years of showing little interest, lawmakers and regulators plan to scrutinize the power of big tech companies. Small business owners say they <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/technology/big-tech-antitrust-scrutiny.html\">finally feel heard</url>.</p><p>_____</p><p>4. The Vatican rejected the notion that individuals can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/world/europe/vatican-francis-gender-identity-sexuality.html\">choose their own sexual identity</url>, a blow to L.G.B.T.Q. advocates who had hoped for a more tolerant message. Above, Pope Francis at the Vatican this weekend.</p><p>In its first extensive document on gender theory, the church argues that increasing acceptance of fluid definitions of gender poses a threat to traditional families. The document says that \u201cideas of \u201cintersex\u201d or \u201ctransgender\u201d lead to a masculinity or femininity that is \u201cambiguous.\u201d</p><p>Separately, evangelical churches have long distanced themselves from the Catholic Church\u2019s abuse crisis. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/southern-baptist-convention-sex-abuse.html\">But a reckoning may be at hand</url>.</p><p>_____</p><p>5. A helicopter pilot is dead in a crash on top of a 51-story building in Manhattan, which left the city unsettled. Officials saw <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/nyregion/helicopter-crash-nyc.html\">no sign of terrorism</url>.</p><p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the helicopter seemed to have made an emergency landing. Above, firefighters on the scene.</p><p>The Midtown crash was just the latest of several fatal episodes involving helicopters in and around New York City in the last 20 years. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/nyregion/helicopter-crash.html\">Here\u2019s how the aircraft navigate the city skies</url>.</p><p>_____</p><p>6. With summer come mosquitoes and sunscreen. We have new studies on both. Above, champion open-water swimmer Kim Chambers in 2016.</p><p>Climate change and urbanization could increase the number of people at risk of contracting dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease that can be deadly, researchers found, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/10/climate/dengue-mosquito-spread-map.html\">significant expansion</url> in the southeastern U.S., and parts of China, Japan and Australia.</p><p>And how safe is sunscreen? A recent study on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/upshot/how-safe-is-sunscreen.html\">absorption into the bloodstream</url> has caused concern, but you should be more worried about skin cancer.</p><p>_____</p><p>7. The Toronto Raptors are one game away from winning the N.B.A. finals. Will they have Kevin Durant to contend with?</p><p>Durant is listed as \u201cquestionable\u201d for the game with the Golden State Warriors down 1-3 in the series. He practiced Sunday for the first time since he was injured in the second round of the playoffs. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/sports/kevin-durant-warriors-returns.html\">Here\u2019s what to expect if he returns</url>. Tipoff is at 9 p.m. Eastern. We\u2019ll have live updates at nytimes.com.</p><p>Raptor fever has taken over Toronto, especially immigrant neighborhoods. The basketball team provides <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/world/canada/basketball-toronto-raptors.html\">a clear reflection</url> of Canada\u2019s largest city in the 21st century.</p><p>_____</p><p>8. \u201cI always had so much impatience and ambition \u2014 these things that if you had them, you were supposed to have them secretly.\u201d</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/10/magazine/mindy-kaling-late-night-diversity-comedy.html\">Mindy Kaling</url> \u2014 a writer, producer and actor on the sitcoms \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cThe Mindy Project,\u201d as well as the new movie \u201cLate Night\u201d \u2014 has helped change Hollywood\u2019s ideas about who\u2019s in charge of making us laugh.</p><p>She talks to David Marchese at the Times Magazine about the current state of TV, motherhood and being a boss.</p><p>_____</p><p>9. Swinging lights, Broadway beefs, words of wisdom and a restroom serenade: We have the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/theater/tony-awards-best-worst.html\">best and worst</url> of the Tony Awards.</p><p>\u201cHadestown\u201d won eight prizes, including best musical, and Ali Stroker, above, became the first wheelchair user to receive a Tony, for her role in \u201cOklahoma!\u201d Her acceptance speech was a standout, our theater critic says. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/theater/tony-awards.html\">Here are the highlights</url>.</p><p>The ceremony was a safe, unsurprising show that even its host James Corden couldn\u2019t liven up, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/arts/television/tony-awards-review.html\">our TV critic writes</url>.</p><p>Speaking of TV: The second episode of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/the-weekly/nyc-taxi-medallion-suicides-the-weekly.html\">\u201cThe Weekly\u201d</url> is now available on Hulu.

And finally, peering through seawater.</p><p>The world\u2019s coral reefs are gravely threatened, but researchers have only a rough idea of how extensive those reefs are because most airborne and satellite instruments have difficulty peering through seawater.

So, I thought it was a cute--</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Too cute for Greg. He doesn't like cute stories; it makes him sick. Look at him. Breaking out of cold sweat. Have a nice weekend everybody.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, while most of you are getting ready for a much-deserved weekend, your Representatives in the House are already sprinting toward a six-week vacation tonight. Whether that is much deserved is up to you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What we know for certain this evening is that the Mueller hearings are over, but the Democratic effort to remove or at least befuddle President Trump will go on. Met by full and fierce resistance from the President himself.</p><p>And in the midst of that impeachment drive, the leader of the House is fighting an uprising led by an aggressive young congresswoman, who is now at least saying the right things. We have Fox team coverage tonight, Mike Emanuel on Capitol Hill where the speaker is trying to bring her caucus back together. We start off tonight though with Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts and the President back on the attack. Good evening, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you. President Trump was laying low throughout most of the day today as the Democrats were holding their press conferences. But late this afternoon, he came out swinging.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I think it's a disgrace what the Democrats are doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump today railed against the Democrats plans to keep investigating whether his actions on the Russia probe constituted obstruction of justice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: It's so sad to see how they're impeding all of the good things that we're doing; all they want to do is impede. They want to investigate. They want to go fishing and I watch Bob Muller and they have nothing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: The Democratic Chairman of the Judiciary Committee today insisting the Mueller Report and Mueller's testimony were just the first layers of the investigative onion.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): There appears to be compelling evidence of the President's misconduct outside of the four corners of the redacted version of the Mueller Report. And we will work to uncover that evidence as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Jerrold Nadler is now going after the grand jury materials behind the Mueller Report, that is upping the pressure on former White House Counsel Don McGahn to come before Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NADLER: Unless he complies with our accommodation efforts in very short order, we expect to file an additional suit to enforce a subpoena for his testimony. And that would be next week.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump says any future inquiry should focus on how the investigation of the President started in the first place.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The Democrats and clowns. I watched Nancy Pelosi trying to get through that with the performance that Robert Mueller put on, the documents said no collusion. They don't even talk about that. So, there was no crime.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Even some Democrats agreed that Mueller sometimes halting testimony wasn't the knockout punch they were hoping for. Republicans had heard Mueller may have lost a step from his prime and honed their questions for maximum political effect.</p><p>(Robert Mueller's Testimony)</p><p>ROBERTS: The president's son insists the Mueller hearings illuminated the politics behind the investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP JR., AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN: I think the American public saw that he was put in there as a figurehead. He had no idea who was running the ship. The inmates were running the asylum and those inmates were the Democrat Party who were doing whatever they could to destroy my father's presidency.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Democrats had hoped that Wednesday's testimony from Robert Mueller would form a strong basis for impeachment proceedings against the President. Now it's clear that if they want to go down that road, the Democrats are going to have to develop compelling evidence through investigation of their own, which is going to take an awful lot of investigative legwork. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: John Roberts live from the North Lawn. John, thanks. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is setting a high bar for an impeachment effort. She clearly does not want that is just part of the struggle she faces as she seeks to bring her caucus back together. Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel tells us what happened today during a big meeting between the House leader and the Squad leader. Good evening, Mike.</p><p>MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you. There is a great deal of simmering tension after some heated battles among Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to hold off the charge and trying to hold on to control.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I think the Speaker respects the fact that we're coming together as a party and unity and I'm looking forward to us getting back in September.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: After some nasty bickering, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tried today to patch things up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): These are some personality issues and the rest, they're minor. We have a big schism in our country between what is happening - could happen in this Congress and what is happening in the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: But the feud with the four freshmen lawmakers known as The Squad has been public and ugly with Pelosi mocking their Twitter world, their influence and their policy ideas. Ocasio-Cortez fired back at the speaker telling The Washington Post, \"the persistent singling out, it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful. The explicit singling out of newly elected women of color\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Probably downright disrespectful.</p><p>PELOSI: We're in the political arena.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: The top Republican in the House says Pelosi is losing control of her caucus and her agenda.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): It's more of an internal fight. This is not a family fight. This is a war and a feud. The Socialist Democrats inside that party are taking the party over.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Meanwhile, there is building pressure from other rank and file Democrats on Pelosi to go forward with impeachment. New Hampshire's Annie Kuster says, she supports a formal inquiry. And freshman Democrat Mike Levin from California tweeted, he's now in favor writing, I now support an impeachment inquiry in order to get the truth from my constituents. That means at least 100 House members are now publicly on board. Pelosi is trying to hold them off for now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PELOSI: We will proceed when we have what we need to proceed. Not one day sooner.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: But more and more of her members want it now. And tension may only get worse when her members get pressured by their constituents back home. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Mike Emanuel after a busy week upon Capitol Hill. Mike, thank you. Also breaking tonight, a new assessment of just how many nuclear weapons North Korea may now have. Some intel officials say, they were completed since President Trump's outreach to the North Korean leader.</p><p>North Korea and Iran sending messages to the U.S. with new missile tests. Correspondent Benjamin Hall reports tonight from London.</p><p>BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Iran and North Korea are provoking again, both testing missiles capable of striking U.S. bases. Now, according to The Wall Street Journal, analysts at the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency say North Korea may have produced 12 nuclear weapons since the first Trump Kim summit alone, giving them as many as 60.</p><p>North Korea released these photos earlier showing Kim Jong un at the launch of two short range ballistic missiles fired yesterday from a mobile launcher. They are the first test since President Trump and Kim agreed to revive denuclearization talks last month. President Trump says, he isn't worried.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: They're short range missiles and my relationship is very good with Chairman Kim and we'll see what happens. But they are short range missiles and many people have those missiles.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HALL: North Korea said the launches were a warning to South Korea to stop holding joint military exercises with the U.S. Hours earlier, Iran also fired off a medium range ballistic missile which traveled over 650 miles.</p><p>The Shahab 3 missile is based on a North Korean design. And intelligence officials worry a nuclear warhead could be attached to the nose cone. Speaking on this show last night, Secretary Pompeo addressed the Iranian threat.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: They continue to build out their missile program. They continue to work on their nuclear systems, and yet they want to tell the world that, no, they're just defensive and they're just being a normal nation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HALL: Today, Secretary Pompeo also said that he was willing to go to Iran for talks and would welcome the chance to speak directly to the Iranian people. This latest provocation comes one week after Iranian forces seized a British oil tanker and her 23 crew members. As a result, at least three European nations are now sending warships to escort their tankers through the Straits of Hormuz.</p><p>And amid the growing tensions, all signatories of the nuclear deal, excluding the U.S. will gather in Vienna, Austria, this weekend to discuss its continued implementation, hoping to salvage the deal.</p><p>That meeting comes as the Trump administration faces a deadline on whether to continue waivers on Iran's civilian nuclear program. Ending those waivers could collapse whatever's left of the JCPOA. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Benjamin Hall in London. Benjamin, thank you.</p><p>Federal regulators are green lighting T-Mobile's $26.5 billion takeover of rival Sprint, despite fears of higher prices and job cuts. Today's approval by the Justice Department and five state attorneys general comes after Sprint and T-Mobile agreed to conditions that would set up satellite TV provider Dish as a fourth wireless companies. So, the number of major U.S. providers remains at four.</p><p>The economy is slowing even as consumer spending is surging. That's the takeaway from news that the gross domestic product, the GDP grew at 2.1 percent annual rate in the second quarter. That's down from 3.1 in the first quarter.</p><p>The Dow today gained 51. The S&amp;P 500 was up 22 for an all-time high. A new record close. The NASDAQ also hit the daily double, a record close after surging 92 for the week. The Dow was up 14 hundredths of a percentage point. The S&amp;P 500 jumped one and two thirds. The NASDAQ exploded by two and a quarter. Let's talk about the markets, the economy, possibly what comes next.</p><p>Susan Li, the Fox Business Network joins us from New York. Good evening, Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. To the U.S. economy is doing better than expected but slowing down from a strong first quarter.</p><p>Consumer and government spending helping offset a drop off in business investment extending the longest economic expansion in U.S. history, crossing at 10 years since the global financial crisis.</p><p>President Trump is sounding satisfied, tweeting Q2 GDP up 2.1 percent. Not bad considering we have the very heavy weights of the Federal Reserve anchor wrapped around our neck. Almost no inflation. USA is set to zoom.</p><p>Now, the Federal Reserve is still expected to cut interest rates next week by a quarter of 1 percent and lower interest rates usually means a currency falls in value, but it's a strength of the U.S. dollar that's making news with reports. A Senior White House Trade Adviser, Peter Navarro, had pitched the idea of intervening in the currency markets to weaken the U.S. dollar. And that to better compete with other trading nations, an idea the President hasn't entirely shot down.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I didn't say I'm not going to do something, but, look, having a strong dollar. There is a reason that it sounds so good. And having the strong dollar is having a strong dollar. We have an amazing country; we have a very strong country. That's why our country has a strong currency. Other countries have a currency that's down the tubes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LI: Recently, the U.S. Treasury put nine countries on watch for possible currency manipulation, including China, Germany and Japan. And speaking of trade, Monday, we have U.S. China trade talks back on with a first face-to- face since Trump's G-020 meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. But the U.S. President also saying tonight that China may be waiting until after the election to agree to any trade deal. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Susan, thank you. Also has a problem with France. We'll follow that. Several Democratic presidential candidates made their cases before the National Urban League today in Indianapolis. The meeting serves as a warmup for next week's second round of debates. One candidate who hopes to build on momentum from that first round, California Senator Kamala Harris.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Doocy has more on her campaign tonight from Indianapolis.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: This is how much the world has changed in the last five months. When Joe Biden saw Kamala Harris on the train in February, he was polite. When Joe Biden sees Kamala Harris on the debate stage in July. He says, he won't be polite, but that doesn't mean Harris will change her approach.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Senator of Detroit how polite will you be?</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I was raised to be polite.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY: Harris hit the stage at the National Urban League conference today to argue that she's not disqualified from reforming the criminal justice system despite a career as a prosecutor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRIS: Why do we only have to be on the outside, on bended knee or trying to break down the door? Shouldn't we also have a role on the inside where the decisions are being made?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY: Harris and everyone else trailed Biden by double-digits. So, President Trump's focus is on the top of the polls.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The only good thing about Mueller is it made Joe Biden look like a dynamo.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY: The Biden campaign is taunting Trump back with a hypothetical head to head writing this. We're glad you saw the latest from Fox. Biden, 49 percent. Trump, 39. You're losing by 10. Have a nice day. Biden has been working with the Democratic speech coach since stumbling in his debate debut, but it's clear he's not the only candidate testing out new lines.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So, on the first day that I become president, after I Clorox the Oval Office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY: Another candidate hoping to break out of the bottom tier, Andrew Yang, who tweets, I would like to signal to the press that I will be attacking Michael Bennet at next week's debate. Sorry, Michael Bennet, but you know what you did?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TREVOR NOAH, COMEDIAN: Of all the candidates I've seen on the trail, you seem to be having the most fun, are you?</p><p>ANDREW YANG (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, it's a very low bar you've set, Trevor.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY: Biden is trying to raise the bar after that first debate where he admitted he was not prepared for an attack from one contender. But next week, he's going to share a stage with nine contenders who all saw there is a potential for a big boost by bashing Biden. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Peter Doocy at Indianapolis. Peter, thank you. Up next, an exclusive look inside one of the largest migrant processing centers in the country. First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 5 in Atlanta as lawyers for election integrity advocates say Georgia officials intentionally destroyed evidence about potential manipulation of election results. The Secretary of State's office denies those allegations. The lawsuit also alleges Georgia's voting machines are not secure and are vulnerable to hacking.</p><p>Fox 5 in San Diego as the Coast Guard offloaded more than 13 tons of cocaine seized in international waters of the Eastern Pacific Ocean. The drugs are said to be worth an estimated street value of $350 million. They were seized from six suspected smuggling vessels and two floating cocaine bales found off the coast of Mexico, Central and South America.</p><p>And this is a live look at Miami from our affiliate WSVN, one of the big stores there tonight. A local newspaper reports a security guard at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School says the boy who killed 14 students during a Valentine's Day shooting last year was considered such a threat that he was searched for weapons every morning.</p><p>Administrators eventually forced Nicholas Cruz to withdraw from school in 2017. The guard's deposition comes in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the parents of one of the victims. That is tonight's live look outside the Beltway from Special Report. We'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER: The Head of the House Ways and Means Committee is calling for good faith negotiations with the administration over the new trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Chairman Richard Neal, a Democrat, met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer following a trip to Mexico. Leaders of the three nations have signed the agreement, but it must still be ratified by lawmakers in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>Some protesters in Puerto Rico are now setting their sights on driving out the replacement for outgoing Governor Ricardo Rossello. His designated successor is Justice Secretary Wanda Vasquez. Many consider her unacceptable because of her ties to Rossello. He resigned earlier this week over a scandal involving inappropriate chats with advisers and ongoing corruption probes.</p><p>President Trump says, Guatemala is signing an agreement to restrict asylum applications to the U.S. from Central America. The so-called Safe Third Country Agreement would require migrants, including Salvadorans and Hondurans, who cross into Guatemala on their way to the U.S. to apply for protections in Guatemala instead of at the U.S. border.</p><p>Tonight, a Fox News Exclusive. We get a behind the scenes look at one of the busiest migrant processing centers in the country. Correspondent Griff Jenkins shows us tonight from the Southern California. Griff?</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Some 53,000 individuals are in ICE custody across the country held in facilities like this one behind me in Adelanto, California. This one is run by privately contracted company GO. And we've got a rare look inside.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Acting Director, where are we?</p><p>THOMAS GILES, IMMIGRATIONS AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: We're currently in the intake processing center at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center. This facility here, houses up to 1940 detainees. After they get classified and after they get booked in by the facility, we're giving them hygiene items. They have soap, shampoo, conditioner, toothbrush, toothpaste, as well as they get their - they have a bed linen, socks, shoes, shower shoes, and then their uniform when they're detained here.</p><p>Medical care is a top-notch priority. We have a full-time medical clinic here. One thing that we do offer here is for consulate phone calls and pro bono attorneys. It's a free phone call for the detainee.</p><p>While they're in here, they have open movement. And you can - they have the ability to roam around the area. Here we have phone calls, phones for them to use. We have books for them to use. Individuals are able to play Xbox and watch movies. Well, people know with that, when these individuals are detained here, we're giving them the care and custody that they need. We're going to do everything we can to keep the individuals safe while they're detained here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think this is humane treatment.</p><p>JESUS HERNANDEZ, DETAINEE: Yes, I think it is. You know, I think it is, it's a blessing, we know it's a blessing to wake up and have a little bit of freedom.</p><p>REP. MARK TAKANO (D-CA): I feel that this is a very inappropriate use of taxpayer dollars to detain hundreds of people who pose no threat to our society.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS: Last August, a group of California lawmakers came in, toured this facility and found it lacking adequate resources. Now, Director Giles hopes critics will come and see it for themselves. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Griff Jenkins in Southern California. Griff, thanks. Up next, nuking the American crocodile. It is actually helping to save the species. We'll explain.</p><p>First, beyond our borders tonight. Protesters in Hong Kong crowded into one of the world's busiest airports as part of anti-government activity. More than a thousand demonstrators dressed in black filled the arrival hall at Hong Kong International Airport chanting, there are no riots. There is only tyranny.</p><p>It was another scorching day in Europe, although not as hot as yesterday. Paris got up yesterday to 109. The high temperatures are disrupting rail travel in Britain. And severe weather is causing delays and cancellations for flyers. Belgium suffered its first heat related death when a woman was found dead near the beach.</p><p>Severe conditions have a different kind of impact in the Tour de France bicycle race. Stage 19 was stopped today because of a hailstorm. Riders also faced obstruction from a landslide. No reports of any locust yet. The race is scheduled to finish Sunday in Paris. Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight. We'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER: A federal judge has thrown out a Kentucky teen's lawsuit accusing The Washington Post of falsely labeling him a racist after an encounter with a Native American man at the Lincoln Memorial.</p><p>You'll remember this. Nicholas Sandeman sued the paper for 250 million dollars in February. The judge ruled that there may have been erroneous opinions published by the Post, but they are protected by the First Amendment.</p><p>Florida is a state known for its alligators. But tonight, we're talking about American crocodiles there and how workers at a nuclear power plant in South Florida are helping to try to save the species. Correspondent Phil Keating takes us there tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'll release some right and off they go.</p><p>PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: American crocodiles are crawling back from the brink of extinction and thriving at, of all places, South Florida's Turkey Point nuclear power plant, once in danger. They are now listed as threatened, thanks in large part to the Florida Power and Light croc team.</p><p>During hatching season, July and August, the croc team hops on their airboat, zig zagging up and down Turkey Point to 170 miles of nuclear cooling canals, looking for nests and rescuing hatchlings. This year, they found 27 nests and taking about 300 baby crocs back to the lab.</p><p>MARK LLORET, WILDLIFE BIOLOGIST: Head length 4.0.</p><p>KEATING: Wildlife biologist Mike Lloret measures their length with the girth and inserts a tiny microchip into each tail in order to track them over their lives.</p><p>LLORET: They're not radioactive. That's definitely a question we get a lot.</p><p>KEATING: The croc team then releases the hatchlings back into the wild. 25 percent of the crocodile population calls this nuclear crocodile sanctuary home, which is perfect for them thanks to the canals, berms and minimal human encounters since it is a high security facility.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEATING: This right here is an old crocodile nest and you can still see some of the eggshells left behind. Adult females lay about 30 to 50 eggs every year, but most won't end up surviving due to predation by birds, fish, even other crocs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LLORET: Besides the fact that they're so crucial for the environment and you know, you go throughout the whole year waiting for this moment, waiting for those babies to hatch, collecting those babies and then release them back into the wild, which is just the ultimate satisfaction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEATING: And from there, these cute baby crocs, at least cute for now, are ready for the world. In Homestead, Florida. Phil Keating, Fox News.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAIER: Breaking tonight, a huge win for President Trump this evening. The U.S. Supreme Court has just cleared the way for the Trump administration to use Pentagon funds for border wall construction. The amount is said to be $2.5 billion. Again, the U.S. Supreme Court clearing the way for that to happen.</p><p>It has been a long week in Washington, a long partisan week on Capitol Hill. So this morning when I was invited to meet up with about two dozen lawmakers from both parties, who are all veterans who served America's armed forces, I couldn't pass it up. It was for an important and at times emotional cause. You see these veterans, these lawmakers, who may occasionally battle politically in the building behind me, put aside differences this morning, using brushes and soap to clean one of the most poignant sites in the nation's capital. So I brought a camera crew to be able to show you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've lost so many lives in war. And while you are here washing the wall, I want you to take a second and kind of realize that.</p><p>REP. PAUL COOK (R-CA): UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In November of 1967, we had gone from down south up to the north.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We worked from the corners into the center, that allowed the water to drain. You don't forget the names.</p><p>REP. MIKE WALTZ, (R-FL): After last week, everybody fighting over tweets, and this week with Mueller -- sorry -- it would be good for America to see politicians leading, showing reverence to those who came before us, coming together.</p><p>BAIER: There's also something about when you're scrubbing these names.</p><p>WALTZ: That's why I love this memorial, because the casualty number becomes real when you see 58,000 names.</p><p>COOK: I had First Platoon Bravo in Delta Company. The whole battalion, look at that. Five pages in one year.</p><p>BAIER: They are all on this wall that we are cleaning today.</p><p>REP. SETH MOULTON, (D-MA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Do something good for the country, and respect people who have given a lot more than we have for America.</p><p>REP. MIKE GALLAGHER, (R-WI): The idea that we are kind of building a next- generation group of veterans to do little things like this, it makes you believe you can change the culture with this.</p><p>REP. ELAINE LURIA, (D-VA): We always have common grounds in issues for military families. So this is just a small example of what we really do together every day.</p><p>REP. BRIAN MAST, (R-FL): This is what service is all about. Every one of these names, the one thing they have in common is their service. They served on behalf of everybody from every background. That is the way we are supposed to see.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In the foxhole nobody cares. Nobody care about party, race, religion, creed. It's about serving your country, getting stuff done.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The fact that you come out like everyday citizens and chip in in taking care of these important places.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAIER: Poignant morning this morning to start Friday. After this week, Park Service says you can volunteer, too. Just come here to D.C., ask about it. They clean all the monuments every week.</p><p>President Trump keeps up the fight against Democrats over impeachment while Nancy Pelosi makes nice with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. We'll get reaction from the panel when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JERROLD NADLER, (D-NY) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Whether you call that an inquiry or whatever you want to call that, that is what we've been doing and we are doing and we'll continue to do.</p><p>REP. JOHN GARAMENDI, (D-CA): I would like to call it, and I think it properly is, an impeachment inquiry.</p><p>MARY GAY SCANLON, (D-PA) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Impeachment isn't a binary thing, that you either are or you aren't.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA) HOUSE SPEAKER: We will proceed when we have what we need to proceed.</p><p>JAMIE RASKIN, (D-MD) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: It means different things to different people, but from my personal standpoint, I think we are in an impeachment investigation.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They have nothing. There's no collusion, there's no obstruction. They have nothing. These people are clowns. The Democrats are clowns.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Well, the impeachment go, no-go, our senior Capitol Hill producer Chad Pergram said the Democrat press conferences was one of the most bizarre he has seen in 25 plus years of covering the place. What about this and the next steps? Let's bring in our panel, Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, and Hugo Gurdon, editor in chief of the \"Washington Examiner.\"</p><p>A.B., to Chad's point, there was a lot of, are we in it, are we doing impeachment, it this really impeachment, is it not. It was a little bizarre.</p><p>A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Yes. And I think that people have been saying for a while, particularly on the right, that if it sounds like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it is a duck, and really that came true today. They are trying to have it both ways where they can proceed on that track while not having all members be all in on a vote and have to hold the line. Obviously, an impeachment vote is different than an inquiry. The beginnings of an inquiry that might become official are different from an actual one.</p><p>So it's a way to have both feet in two different places. They are under a lot of pressure, rising number of people who support it in their caucus, pressure from the outside. And at the same time I think that they do have a point that there is sort of a new threshold, which is that if Trump defies a court order than they have to proceed with impeachment, at which point that's rational. President Clinton lied under oath, there are certain things you can't do. I don't know that they're all on that song page, but that seems the most rational, one of their new arguments to me.</p><p>MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": In the '90s, it was depends on what the meaning of \"is\" is. Today it depends on what the meaning of \"impeachment\" is. Is impeachment an inquiry, is impeachment an actual process that leads to a vote. One of the congresswomen there in that opening clip said impeachment is not a binary choice. Yes, it is. You either decide you are going to impeach the president or you don't.</p><p>The Democrats have found themselves in a pickle. I would say that Republicans felt I think a false sense of assurance after Mueller's testimony flopped that this was the end of the impeachment debate. And the fact is Mueller was always a means. The end remained the same all along. It has been the same since Maxine Waters called to impeach 45 one month into his presidency, and that is to remove Donald Trump from office.</p><p>BAIER: Coming to the end of the week, just 30,000 feet, just tonight we just announced the U.S. Supreme Court clears the way for the Trump administration to tap into the $2.5 billion of Pentagon funds to build the wall. If you had to characterize this week, that's a pretty good week for President Trump.</p><p>HUGO GURDON, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": It's a very good week for President Trump. That decision obviously goes against what the Democrats wanted. But for two days at least the Democrats have I think looked terrible. The Mueller inquiry, or the Mueller testimony on Capitol Hill was not just an utter flop because it did not give any further information that would inculcate President Trump, but it was a flop too because it showed huge gaps and it revealed the investigation as even more likely to have been sort of biased and partisan, not looked into things where the Democrats might have been guilty of relations, using information from Russia, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>And then today they come out and they're at sixes and sevens, completely mixed on their messages. And one of them, I think it was Raskin who said that impeachment means different things to different people. No, it's one thing. And they don't know what they want to do. It was bad for Pelosi because she wants it to go away, but it has a flared up again. It will be in the conversation for a long time still.</p><p>BAIER: A.B., just 16 days ago \"The Washington Post\" had this about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, quoting her about the House Speaker. \"When these comments,\" speaking of Pelosi's comments, \"first started, I kind of thought she was keeping the progressive flank at more of arms distance in order to protect more moderate members, which I understood. But the persistent singling out, it got to the point where it just was outright disrespectful, the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.\" Here is the reaction today after their meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA) HOUSE SPEAKER: We are not a lockstep, rubberstamp representation of anything except representatives of our districts and what that means. We sat down today. We had a good meeting. And the congresswoman is a very gracious member of Congress. I don't think there ever was any hatchet.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRA OCASIO-CORTEZ, (D-NY): I'm looking forward to us continuing our work. And as always, I think the Speaker respects the fact that we are coming together as a party, and that unity. And I'm looking forward to us getting back after the summer.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: It's not just us. It's all media are covering the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the squad, the focus. If you look at opinion polls, we have one out, the House Speaker up against AOC, and their favorability. Pretty high for a freshman congresswoman, 58 percent. And that she gets a lot of attention in the party. What about this?</p><p>STODDARD: She learned from President Donald Trump that it's all about the spotlight, and she games it pretty hard. No publicity is bad publicity. And Nancy Pelosi knows this problem is not going away. It will rear its head again.</p><p>She, as you quoted, inferred that the speaker is racist. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan went even further. She has been incredibly disrespectful to the speaker. I think Nancy Pelosi chooses her tactics wisely. In interviews with third parties she drops bombs on them. She went to AIPAC purposely to single them out as not representative of her caucus in terms of their loyalty to Israel. And she knows this is going to come down the road. Whatever she said privately to have AOC come out and say everything is hunky-dory, and her use of the word \"gracious\" is all intentional. It's not a problem that can be entirely controlled, but I think Nancy Pelosi is smart to take the high road. She's trying to give them a lesson about leadership and followership. It's not likely to succeed, but she is sort of taking this one week at a time.</p><p>BAIER: And she has some weeks now. They are on recess. We'll see what comes with that.</p><p>Next up, the Friday lightning round, Iran, North Korea, winners and losers, and another trip to the Candidate Casino.</p><p>BAIER: Big week for Iran, North Korea, testing missiles, but also this blockbuster from \"The Wall Street Journal\" today. \"Analysts at the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency say North Korea's scientists may have produced 12 nuclear weapons since the first Trump-Kim meeting in Singapore last year. In total, Pyongyang currently possess between 20 and 60 nuclear bombs according to estimates by various security analysts.\"</p><p>Back with the panel. Hugo, I talked to the secretary of state yesterday. He said, listen, these tests, part of the deal. We are still moving forward, heading towards negotiations.</p><p>GURDON: The tests by North Korea clearly are warnings to the United States that there could be escalations. After the short-range missiles, there could be medium-range, and the threat is for ICBMs. This is not really about South Korea, which is what they were saying. President Kim knows that the crops in North Korea have failed. There's likely to be famine later this year. He really needs some sanctions relief, and President Trump has said it's not happening.</p><p>BAIER: Iran needs sanctions relief, too, A.B., and that's the going bet is that they're --</p><p>STODDARD: I think unlike Chairman Kim, who is having a wonderful time with President Trump in office because he is a nuclear power and President Trump only talks about how great their relationship is, and everyone has these missiles and it's all fine, he tells the Iranians he would like to negotiate but they can't have nuclear weapons. And they are not coming to the table. And they seem to be preparing to ride him out of his term. He doesn't have a cohesive Iranian policy or strategy that he has articulated to the public beyond they can't have nuclear weapons and I would like to talk, and we'll see what happens. And I think that they are going to continue with these provocations.</p><p>BAIER: I tried to press Pompeo on that strategy part yesterday. Matthew?</p><p>CONTINETTI: This gets the sense that if these waivers are rescinded, they will be dealing a crushing blow to the Iranian economy, and that is the point at which the Mullahs will have to decide, do they try to restart negotiations for a broader nuclear deal that incorporates other elements including their missile programs and malign behavior in the region, or are they going to go down the path of further escalation? Right now we don't the answer to that question.</p><p>BAIER: OK, it's time. It's Friday. That means -- I just want you to hear the ball, because it kind of signals the casino. Candidate Casino, you have $100 in chips. We have a Democratic primary field. How are you going to break up your $100? You have to spend $100. Hugo?</p><p>GURDON: It's $55 on Kamala Harris. She checks more boxes than anybody else and that is with the left is all about these days, checking the boxes. She's a female, she's black, she's attractive, and she's a new generation. And $40 for Elizabeth Warren. She is actually the best candidate as she has stolen all the credentials from Bernie Sanders. She has policies, even though they are awful. I only put $5 on Joe Biden. I think he is running on empty. Even though he's in the lead, I think he is going to overhauled by the time Iowa comes around.</p><p>BAIER: That's interesting. A.B., $100.</p><p>STODDARD: Mine is opposite. I have $45 on Biden, $35 on Harris, $15 on Warren. I can't get into the other players, maybe later. And in honor of the late and beloved Charles Krauthammer, $5 on wine, women, and song.</p><p>BAIER: That's fantastic. Matthew?</p><p>CONTINETTI: As you can see, I'm playing it safe. I'm spreading my bets all over the place. Most of my chips on Biden, $35.</p><p>BAIER: Do you ever win in a casino?</p><p>CONTINETTI: No, I'm horrible at this.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BAIER: I can see that. I can see that.</p><p>CONTINETTI: But Bret, my lucky day is on its way because I have my $5 chip on Michelle Obama. And when she comes in at the last minute and surprises us all, I will make big bank.</p><p>BAIER: That's pretty good. We will see. There's obviously a lot of candidates. Two debates next week. We'll follow those.</p><p>OK, winner and loser, winner first. Matthew?</p><p>CONTINETTI: My winner of the week is hip-hop artist ASAP Rocky for becoming the center of this dispute between the USA and Sweden. He was detained and then finally charged with assault. His real accomplishment, though, is getting me to pay attention to the world of hip-hop.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BAIER: OK, loser?</p><p>CONTINETTI: My loser is Bill de Blasio for running a vanity campaign for president while disorder in New York city rises, including these very disturbing attacks on police officers. De Blasio needs to get out of the presidential race and return to New York City.</p><p>BAIER: Winner and loser?</p><p>STODDARD: My winner is Christian Larsen of Idaho. He is a nine-year-old boy with autism whose mom Lindsay was discussing on Facebook her nerves about only one person RSVPing to his birthday. When the high school football team at Napa High School found out about it, they came and celebrated his birthday with him. And this picture is so darling I'm about to start crying.</p><p>My loser is big tech. This has been building for a long time, but if you look at the combination of Warren's efforts to break it up, Senator Hawley's transparency legislation, the DOJ and state attorneys general looking at antitrust actions. The FTC decision broke along party lines, but most of this is very nonpartisan. They waited too late to give something. They have no political safe harbor anymore.</p><p>GURDON: My winner is President Trump because Robert Mueller's bumbling performance ripped away credibility that he had given to the investigation, or the Russia hoax. And my loser, Nancy Pelosi. The testimony left the Democrats thinking that they had actually won something. It meant that the impeachment fires will flare and flare again even though she is trying to dampen them down. I don't think there is any hope of those going away now before the election.</p><p>BAIER: All right, panel, you are winners. We made it through in time.</p><p>When we come back, \"Notable Quotables.\"</p><p>BAIER: Finally tonight, it is Friday. It may feel like two weeks, but it is only one week. This is \"Notable Quotables.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I knew the type of person that he was, and he had no respect for women.</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: The heroes who rushed to the towers 18 years ago will no longer have to worry about compensation for their families when they're gone.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The United States is going to payback for what it buys, and it's going to payback what it borrows.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When American lives are at risk, the United States will defend itself wherever that risk takes place.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We'll be renouncing the post of governor.</p><p>REP.

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, July 24th. Your top stories right now just before 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have breaking news this morning. Robert Mueller on the hill. The former special counsel has arrived on Capitol Hill. He arrived moments ago. His testimony will kick off in 30 minutes' time. We have full coverage this morning. We're going to take right into that testimony with the live guests on the inside.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings, meanwhile, the focus on Wall Street this morning. Boeing reporting a big earning miss. Caterpillar also missed earnings expectations. The company seeing cooling demand in Asia-Pacific region and that is certainly moving markets. Caterpillar shares are down better than four percent right now. Boeing down just a fraction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dow Industrials, meanwhile, taken a toll on the Dow as a result, both companies are Dow Components. Dow Futures are down 100 points right now, a third of a percent. This is the low of the morning right here. S&amp;P Futures down seven points and the NASDAQ Futures lower by 28.</p><p>In Europe this morning, we had some bad economic data. The purchasing managers' index out of Germany was weaker than expected that nonetheless, the DAX Index is actually higher this morning, up 38 points, because I think investors are surmising this is going to mean more stimulus. However, the Germans can do it; they're basically at negative rates already, but maybe they will buy equities like (INAUDIBLE) told us from Blackrock just a week ago. FT-100 down, 68. CAC Quarante down 21. DAX up 36.</p><p>We have a -- I told you about the weak PMI date out of France and Germany and then in the U.K., of course, Boris John will become new Prime Minister later today, of the U.K.</p><p>Trouble for big technology. The Justice Department opening an anti-trust review into tech; what that means for companies including Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple.</p><p>All those stories coming up. And joining me to break it down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; Rosecliff CEO and Managing Partner, Mike Murphy; and former U.S. Attorney Bud Cummins. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF VENTURES: Good morning. Lots to talk about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: 30 minutes away. the Mueller testimony, what's your big takeaway? What do you want to look for, hear from Mueller? Dagen, what do you think</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I think that he's going to stick to the script. I think he's going to stick to the report, and the Democrats are going to get paltry little out of Bob Mueller. Again, they're trying to approve a number of different things and the Wall Street Journal goes into this and its editorial today. That the Democrats want to push Mueller into saying their parts of the Trump-Russia story that he didn't investigate money laundering and the like, and they also want to get him to basically give some more information about the issue of obstruction of justice. Again, he has stayed that he didn't, the report did not exonerate President Trump which is not the proper standard for prosecutor as she has been pointing out.</p><p>BUD CUMMINS, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: That's correct. The report, is not in the language of a prosecutor and in fact, prosecutors don't write reports like that. Prosecutors investigate, then they indict, and the public can see what the information is in the indictment and then they have trial. And the public can see --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, somebody else wrote the Mueller report.</p><p>CUMMINS: Or they decline to prosecute and they write a confidential memo to their supervisor. And into in a file that the public never see you want that because you might get investigated one day or you might get investigated. And they're going to use, highly intrusive tools are going to use grand jury subpoenas, they're going to FBI agents to your friends, and your colleagues, and threaten them with prosecution and make them tell, all your dirty secrets.</p><p>But if they don't find a crime, you're entitled to not have that information out in public. That -- that course horse left; they've already written this report. I think important -- an interesting question that Congressman Biggs raised, is how will he -- we expect him to not really answer questions. But how will he explain why he should not answer about the origin and the investigation, but he did break all the rules by putting this report out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>CUMMINS: Does he get the arrogantly draw the line about what he is going to release and what he is not one? Because none of it should be out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And is he not going to address, at all, the fact that there was obviously, FISA abuse? And here again, the same point that you both brought up. If somebody could just decide to wiretap Carter Page and George Papadopoulos because they were Trump campaign people then what's -- you know what's them from stopping investigating you or me wiretapping me or you? I mean, that is the point that is why everybody on both o sides of the aisle should be outraged by what this cabal of individuals did in 2016.</p><p>MURPHY: Exactly. It's both sides. Dagen points out that Democrats are going to want to get something out of Mueller. But I think just as much Republicans are wanting so much out of Mueller, but I think if you can look past the -- separate sides of the aisle just say in United States of America, you don't want people abusing power to for their own or for their political party agenda, so he hopefully we get something out of that where we can learn from it and move forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And former Special Counsel Robert Mueller will be testifying in about 25 minutes before lawmakers. Hillary Vaughn is covering the story. She's on Capitol Hill this morning. And Hillary, we just saw Robert Mueller walk through. He's obviously, getting set up to release his opening statement in 25 minutes.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Maria, that's exactly right. He walked right past our cameras; made his way into the room. And a new Fox Poll out shows this morning that 49 percent of voters say there is zero chance that what Special Counsel Robert Mueller says today could change their mind, about the president.</p><p>Only 23 percent say there is a small chance, that his testimony could sway their opinion, the president getting some early shots, at Mueller this morning on twitter tweeting this moments ago: \"It has been reported that Robert Mueller is saying that he did not apply an interview for job of FBI director and get turned down the day before he was wrongfully appointed special counsel.</p><p>Hope he doesn't say that under oath in the -- we have numerous witnesses to the interview including, the vice president, of the United States. He continued to say \"no\" collusion, no obstruction. House Democrats are hoping to dig more information out of Mueller in these hearings but they may be disappointed because yesterday the DOJ released a letter instructing him not to venture outside the report that he published months.</p><p>House Judiciary Chairman, Jerry Nadler called the move arrogant. And House Intel Chair, Adam Schiff said he does not wanted Mueller to abuse executive privilege to dodge questions that they may ask but the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee Doug Collins wrote in op-ed in the New York Times this morning his fellow Democrats on the committee are desperate writing: \"Judiciary Democrats have built their investigative strategy around this hearing, for emphasis on this event reveals they have not got no other cards to play than one Attorney General William Barr handed them April 18, the report itself which Mr. Mueller said was his testimony, now we're expecting to hear to get started 25 minutes from now, Maria, and we're expecting a lot of fireworks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We sure are. All right, we'll get back to you as news develops, Hillary, thank you. Hillary is right there at the opening of the door, to this hearing, which is, of course, in front of Judiciary Committee; and then after that, the Intel Committee. The markets will be watching Mueller's testimony closely, of course. Joining us right now is CFRA Research Chief Investment Strategist Sam Stovall with the word on Mueller as well as earnings that we saw this morning. How important is Mueller for the markets?</p><p>SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: I don't think it's important at all. I think basically, it's great for headlines but it has no effect on the bottom line.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We did have the big bottom line impact, though, from Caterpillar and Boeing this morning. Your reaction?</p><p>STOVALL: My reaction was that the Boeing situation really is of the if company can get planes back in air by fourth quarter, then that will being a positive and that's why we really didn't see much of a reaction to the Boeing's announcement. But Caterpillar, I think, is a different situation, in a sense shows that a lot of international stocks are being plowed under by this china trade dispute, and has greater impact on global growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you see it Mike? I mean, you got Boeing reporting a miss and loss on earnings; they lost money. We were expecting that but it was also miss on revenue and then the guidance is just not telling you anything, in terms of when they're going to be back. But you make a really good point, Sam. If they're back in -- if they can stabilize by the fourth quarter, this is in the background -- this is in the rearview mirror.</p><p>MURPHY: It is, for sure. And remember, Boeing was 337, I think, was the (INAUDIBLE) recently and now it's trading at 370 on the back of a huge whip on earnings and the stock really has a very muted reaction. So, I think it tells you that people (INAUDIBLE) and tone Boeing. They want a reason to hold on to it. Caterpillar, much different, I think. They disappointed the street for a long time.</p><p>But you know, I get asked a lot: can the market make new highs from and here my answer typically is yes, but if you want a reason for a sell-off, if you two big -- few big earnings misses coupled with a government investigation, into the real growth areas in the markets I think that is what concerns me the most is how much is the government going to go after big tech, because that's obviously what's --</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, you have -- and going into this week, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Facebook represented almost one-fifth of performance of the S&amp;P 500 and you have most those companies now, staring at Justice Department inquiry into any potential antitrust practices, theirs dominate. And then, if you look at housing market, I don't think you can discount that. The housing numbers is on existing. We get new home sales today, I think. Existing home sales were down.</p><p>They fell 1.7 percent in June slumping year-over-year for 16 straight months. And again, and even these rock bottom interest rates are not helping, and that cannot be particularly with new home sales which have a bigger economic impact, when someone buys a new home because of construction that goes into it. It is -- it's worrisome, so maybe the Federal Reserve maybe and they do something more than a quarter point now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, maybe, I mean, the international money is gone right? From housing? I mean, for a long time, they had the Russians, the oligarchs buying. You have the Chinese, big byers, that's tried up.</p><p>STOVALL: Absolutely, an housing is a very important read on whether we are heading toward recession. Every recession since 1960 was preceded by a double-digit decline in housing starts. We're at a single digital decline year-on-year, so I call that a faint yellow light in traffic signal of economic readings, but in terms of consumer confidence which is a better reflection I think what with a housing is, still in a positive camp and likely to be showing and event stronger number one reportedly later this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about Mike's concern? The Department of Justice is opening antitrust probe likely affecting Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. This is where growth in the market has been.</p><p>STOVALL: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That reverse?</p><p>STOVAL: Well, I don't know, I scratch my headed and say this isn't anything new. So, why is it that technical is outperforming the market by a two 2-1 margin whether you look at the new 1 month, free months, six months so yes, maybe if it forces some sort of a move out of tech. The real question is, will investors rotate or retreat? Will they rotate into other areas of the market such as materials, in energy areas have been beaten down or will they just step to the sidelines.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Quick before you go, in terms of earnings are companies of you've seen beating the lowered expectations.</p><p>STOVAL: Absolutely. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me 29 times, shame on me. This could be 30th consecutive quarter in which actual results exceed end of quarter estimates.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow! All right, Sam, great to have you. Thanks so much.</p><p>STOVALL: My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sam Stovall joining us there on earnings and all of the above. Coming up, Mueller's house hearing. He said he would not testify, but in just under 30 minutes from now, in fact 20 minutes, the former special counsel will in fact testify. He's in the hot seat on Capitol Hill. We'll bring you the special coverage live right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, Robert Mueller on the Hill. The former special counsel Mueller about to appear before the House Judiciary Committee and then before the House Intelligence Committee. President Trump and House Judiciary Committee Chairmen Jerry Nadler spoke out ahead of the testimony which will happen in 15 minutes, watch.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: How about this whole witch hunt that's going on, should I talk about it for a second?</p><p>First of all, it is very bad for our country. Makes it very hard to deal with Russia, and we should be able to. They're a nuclear power. They have a big country. And we should be able to deal with them without having this artificial stuff.</p><p>They interviewed 500 people. Listen to this, 2500 subpoenas. They did everything. Their collusion, no collusion. They have no collusion.</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): The Mueller investigation reveals a lot of conduct by the president, which the American people should be aware of. The president and the attorney general have systematically lied to the American people about what was in that report. And no -- they have said no obstruction, no collusion, it was totally exonerated, all of those three statements are not true. It's important that the American people understand what was in that report, and then we'll go from there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Robert Mueller's long-time aide Aaron Zebley will appear beside the former special counsel. He will not be able about to answer questions but can advise Mueller.</p><p>Joining us right now is former senior adviser to the Clintons and Stagwell Group, president and managing partner, Mark Penn. Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano and the Daily Caller News Foundation editor in chief, Christopher Bedford. Great to see everybody. Thanks so much for being here on such an important day.</p><p>Mark, let me kick off with you. Your expectations for Robert Mueller, what do you think we'll hear?</p><p>MARK PENN, PRESIDENT &amp; MANAGING PARTNER, STAGWELL GROUP: Well, I think politics and not law will be on display this morning I think as each side tries to score points. I think if Robert Mueller follows the DOJ guidelines, you're going to have some very frustrated Democrats and Republicans, because I think if he does that, he's just going to refer to pages in the report. And when people ask him, why didn't you do this, or why didn't you do that? He will say that's deliberative privilege.</p><p>So, if he just follows all that, I think this is going to be a big nothing burger with a lot of furious people from Congress, otherwise he has going to have to give them something and depart from the guidelines, we don't know which.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, what about, you know, the simple questions like, you know, did you read the dossier? You know, how much of the dossier did you look into in terms of writing your Mueller report? Or when did you know that there was no collusion? Or what about the FISA abuse? Can he just blow off those questions?</p><p>PENN: According to the way I read it, maybe the others on your panel will disagree that's deliberative process turning forward product. All of that stuff except what's in the report is privileged, and therefore, he can't comment on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Judge.</p><p>PENN: Unless he's going to break the rules.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: You know, I agree with a lot of what Mark just said, this is a political experience not a legal one. There's no judge there to rule on questions when there's an objection. The question is will they maybe lawyers are essentially -- not like my colleague here, they're essentially politicians who are trying to score points at home rather than lawyers trying to extract evidence from a reluctant witness.</p><p>But my own view is that Bob Mueller, you know, the Marine that he is will probably do the right thing and comply with DOJ regulations even though I don't think he has to because he's no longer employed there. There's very little that he can say under oath short of lying for which he could be prosecuted, sued, disciplined or otherwise harmed by the DOJ he once served.</p><p>So, if the Democrats pull a rabbit out of the hat, we look at the Steele dossier and found some of it to be credible. Well, then they have their headline. But if they don't pull the rabbit out of the hat, if he does as Mark Penn suggested, he might do just points to various pages of the report which I understand will be available on a screen for Power Pointing, people will fall asleep.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Now, Bob Mueller holds the record for the number of congressional committees before which he's appeared. This is his 90th appearance, he's done 89. He's probably the smartest person in the room. So, I don't think anybody is going to talk him into saying anything he doesn't want to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Chris? Chris Bedford, weigh in here.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION: I think that the Democrats maybe the homerun they're hoping for, is that they can get him to say -- Mueller to say, that he would have charged Donald Trump were he not president with obstruction of justice. If they can get that out of him, which he got a little close to on his press conference from tossing at the Congress, that will be a homerun, but it's unlikely.</p><p>And for Republicans, their homerun is going to be finding out what exactly what the scope of this investigation and why did it go for so long. Why did you only get parameters from Rod Rosenstein after you have been investigating two months after you already started arresting people? After you ordered started raiding Paul Manafort's home? Then the parameters were set. And also when did you find out that there was actually no conspiracy? No criminal conspiracy and why did this -- why did this go for two years as opposed to maybe one?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, exactly right. Because the midterm elections came and went with everybody's heads on fire, bad comments. Wondering whether or not there was collusion.</p><p>BEDFORD: It was unlikely they'll get any.</p><p>BARTIROMO: As recent as November of 18.</p><p>PENN: They were, but I can remember being on your show, and you and I discussing, reporting at that time that made it pretty apparent that the theory had already started to fall apart.</p><p>So, look, the Democrats have shown Chairman Nadler's statement. They're going to go misrepresent what happens today no matter what happens today. And they're going to get video clips of Robert Mueller. I'm almost certain they're going to point him the paragraphs that they've --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Selective sound bites -- selective sound bites.</p><p>PENN: -- circled, that they think sound bad and they're going to have him read them so they can videotape it and replay it over and over and over. And that's what they'll get out of this.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That's why I think we're in agreement, this is a political adventure, not a -- not a legal one, it is no --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, it's been a political adventure for two years.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes, it is of no legal moment what he -- what he says here. The part each side will try and get some sound bites to help them. You inherited an investigation that you know was started by fraudulently material presented to a judge in secret, did you correct that fraudulent material? So, how's he going to answer that?</p><p>Look, and Chris Bedford is right, the Grand Slam in the bottom of night of the seventh game of the World Series for the Democrats will be, isn't it true that you found acts of obstruction which had he not been president, had been a private citizen would have triggered an indictment. If he says yes to that, then they have pulled a rabbit out of the hat.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, obstruction of what? Obstruction of what kind?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Obstruction of the -- obstruction of the investigation of him. The attorney general has a very narrow view of obstruction, that the obstructer must have actually committed the crime being investigated. If that were the law, then Richard Nixon would have to have been one of the Watergate burglars. That's not the law, that's Bill Barr's view of the law. But that's probably going to come out. What is obstruction? Is it possible to obstruct an investigation of a crime that he didn't commit? We'll probably going to hear go through that again today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is all what the Democrats want to -- want to talk about this morning, but the fact is, is we still are looking at a serious investigation into how the Russia investigation started. The origins of the investigation is the real news, that's what we've been covering here for 2-1/2 years. And if he doesn't start coming clean and answering questions of why they inserted Donald Trump into Russia meddling. I don't think anybody's going be to be happy with any of this thing.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: But nothing in the report is about the origin. If he sticks just to the report, he can't answer questions about the origin.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But the whole point is the origin.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is the story. That is where there was crime.</p><p>PENN: How could he be investigated and not have information that he should. If he's going to share what he has shared, how can he justify withholding that knowledge that he must have. Because he couldn't have gone through this investigation without knowing.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I wonder if he shared an investigation of the origins with the attorney general who is not sharing it with the public until the attorney general's own investigation of some of his former colleagues and the FBI and the DOJ is complete --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Two reviews, inspect -- the inspector general's review Horowitz and also the John Durham review. So there are two reviews go -- that are looking at broadly speaking, the evidentiary basis of the investigation and the people behind it. And Bob --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don't forget Senate Judiciary Lindsey Graham.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And indeed, and Bob Mueller is going to have to answer Republican questions about the team that he assembled. People who donated to Democratic candidates. The FBI agent Peter Strzok was on the team, the lawyer, his former lover Lisa Page. What does he have to say about that? About their conflicts? About --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That's a great question.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How about this, what did you --</p><p>MCDOWELL: What did you think -- when did you find out about these text messages?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What did you think, what did you do? Can you describe the conversation that you had with Peter Strzok when you -- when you got these text messages which by the way, the inspector general's the one who dug them up.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And what --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Barely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think was the insurance policies that Peter Strzok was telling his girlfriend Lisa Page about? Chris Bedford, you've written all about this.</p><p>BEDFORD: Yes, exactly. And Peter Strzok is saying right now that (INAUDIBLE) always maintained that Mueller never mentioned anything about his text messages when he was released from the team. Which is kind of dubious in and of itself, because a lot -- it seems like that's the main reason for having to release him. And he's also the person who kicked off the investigation to look into the president.</p><p>But I agree, with everyone here on the panel that we're probably not going to be able to hear anything about the origins. One thing I would be might be able to hear, though I'm even doubtful of that. Is if Mueller proves of the attorney general's investigations into the origins of this investigation. He thinks that is warranted.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD: But I still think we're not going to get much out of it and both -- and the Democratic Party here trying to push that Robert Mueller reading children's stories in the news for five hours or reading the report is going to change anyone's mind or change any votes, unlikely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: My favorite quote -- again to shift public sentiment, because, what 21 percent in the new -- in the recent Wall Street Journal, ABC News poll found people were in favor -- just 21 percent in favor of impeachment proceedings. My favorite quote in all of this was from William Howell, he teaches political science at the University of Chicago. And he said, Mr. Mueller's remarks might not shift public sentiment because the manner in which he speaks is quote, vague cryptic and at times convoluted.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it's all by design.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So this is not an episode of --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: And then so Bob -- this is a good point, I know you raised it in a -- in a humorous way as you often to, but it's a good point. Bob Mueller speaks as if his words are going to be reviewed by a court. And the words are measured so that if he must in another forum under oath, he justify them, he can do so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Secretary Mnuchin, (INAUDIBLE) a gaggle right now talking to reporters, let's get there and see what he has to say, the Treasury Secretary.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY: So, and in a negotiation I think, you know, this was as good a deal as we were going to get. We held expenses to two percent a year. We're going to have revenues at four percent a year. President protected the military and the veterans which is very important, we have an increase that's in line with inflation. And we also got a 2-1/2 year debt ceiling and we got protected on no riders and no poison pills.</p><p>So the president wants to keep the government open. The president wants to make sure the military is protected, and they're not so protected, we got all those issues done.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Secretary, let me ask you a short term, midterm -- short term, long term question, in the short term. What are your expectations for next week with the discussions with China? And then, in the long term, now that both sides are talking again, what is the calendar look like for a potential deal?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, it's good we're going -- we're going back there. I think Xi and I are going to Shanghai at their request for some symbolic importance to them of the Shanghai communique with Kissinger. So I take that as an important step that they really are sincere in wanting to move forward. It's very important to us they're back in the markets buying agriculture. They've made those commitments to us. We want to see those commitments fulfilled.</p><p>My expectation is there'll be a few more meetings before we get a deal done. So, I wouldn't expect to resolve all the issues but the fact that we're back at the table of the direction of two presidents is important.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can I follow up on that? Was there something specific that led you and ambassador Lighthizer to schedule to go back to Beijing on Monday?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, I think -- I think we have the expectation coming out of the G20 that negotiations will start again. We have two polls, I think as we said before polls are important but really there's no substitute for in person. And China came here last time, so it's our turn to go back. So I think it was really just a question of scheduling issues.</p><p>You know, and my expectation is there'll be a follow-up meeting back here, shortly thereafter assuming things go as we expect them today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) the meeting that you expect to be talking about?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, there's a lot of specific things I --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But which one's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MNUCHIN: All right, again, I'm not going to comment on all the different things but we have a lot of issues. I think you've heard the top line, forced technology transfer. You know, no forced joint ventures. We want to make sure they're back on buying our products, that they're competing fairly with us. So, we have a long list of issues.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) in the U.K., has the president and the new prime minister spoken yet? And do you have any idea about when Prime Minister Boris Johnson might visit the U.S.?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Unfortunately, I don't know the answer on both, but I know her were pleased with the outcome there. I know that they have met when they were -- we were in the U.K. last time and we look forward to working with the new government. The U.K. is one of our closest allies. It's the very important long-term relationship and I look forward to the new prime minister getting a deal done, one way or another. And we all want to move on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think that there needs to be a Brexit deal rather than go for no deal?</p><p>MNUCHIN: No, again, whatever they want to do, that's up to them. So whether they have a deal or they have no Brexit, I think we look forward to their committed to getting this over with.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In terms of the U.S.-U.K. deal.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just to clarify it --</p><p>MNUCHIN: One last question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just to clarify what you have said in this -- in this interview, does the president believe the 737 Max should be scrapped in favor of the seven, and bring back the 757? What is his view on the 737?</p><p>MNUCHIN: I think the president has no view as to whether the 737 Max what they should do other than they need to fix it if they're going to fly it and get approvals. I think as I've said, the president likes the 757, you know, kind of he thinks it's a great line. Whether they want to do that in addition to (INAUDIBLE) but obviously that's up to Boeing to decide.</p><p>But I think the most important issue is Boeing is a very strong company, they got a lot of cash flow. But they got to fix this issue, so that we are sure that it is safe. Thank you, everybody.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin speaking to reporters, talking about the debt ceiling. He's pretty pleased about the deal that they're getting. Will the markets be pleased? What's your --</p><p>MURPHY: I think the markets are pleased. I mean we're sitting right at all-time highs, Maria, and this is one thing that could have been another potential negative or uncertainty for the markets, and now that you can look out, we won't have to have that discussion again for over two years, big positive for the market.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No more -- I mean there's no such thing as fiscal responsibility. Two more years of nothing of that, no tradeoffs as The Wall Street Journal reports. Again, this is the biggest mistake by President Trump according to James Freeman, that this is his biggest failing in terms of his presidency --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, he's hitting --</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- where he can't control spending.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: He's hitting a trillion dollars a year in debt, it's the same guy who said he could -- he could eradicate the debt in eight years. He's now adding more to it than -- at a faster rate than any president in history.</p><p>CUMMINS: But he promised to not such Social Security and Medicare. You can't fix the deficit without fixing Social Security and Medicare.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Two-thirds of spending.</p><p>CUMMINS: If he gets -- it'll be -- deficit's going to be an issue after this election because he --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I --</p><p>CUMMINS: I believe he'll attack it --</p><p>BARTIROMO: One hundred percent.</p><p>CUMMINS: -- in his second term.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I totally agree.</p><p>CUMMINS: And if the Democrats get elected, we're going to accuse them of not addressing to address it so it will be an issue --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CUMMINS: -- after the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We want to talk about this other important story this morning and that's Facebook being fined. The Federal Trade Commission set to slap a massive penalty on Facebook over privacy issues as well as sharing data. Jackie DeAngelis is covering that story. Jackie.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning to you, Maria. That's right it's a $5-billion settlement with the FTC and Facebook and it's actually the largest civil penalty ever paid to the FTC. What the FTC is saying here is that Facebook violated a prior order from 2012 concerning privacy issues and that's what this fine relates back to, what's really interesting here, a privacy committee has to be set up. That committee has to be independent. CEO Mark Zuckerberg, he's got to certify that the company is complying with rules, that's on a quarterly and annual basis.</p><p>If he makes false statements, he would be subject to criminal and civil penalty himself, so Zuckerberg taking on a lot of responsibility here, and it doesn't just deal with Facebook, but it also deals with what WhatsApp and also Instagram and any products that Facebook may offer in the future. A couple of other privacy restrictions included in this Facebook is banned from using phone numbers to enable security features. Facebook must exercise greater oversight on the third party apps that it work with. It must provide clear and conspicuous notice of facial recognition if going to use it. And it's prohibited from asking for e-mail passwords for other services that it's connected to.</p><p>In an interview with FOX Business, the FTC Commissioner, Christine Wilson, said the order creates a robust of checks and balances that spreads responsibility and accountability for consumer privacy. But, Maria, largest civil penalty ever paid to the FTC, $5 billion, this is a huge amount of money we're talking about, and huge in terms of setting the stage and the scope of what's to come in terms of social media companies and privacy issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you, Jackie. Huge fine that Facebook is facing Judge and it's also part of this other bigger story when the attorney general has started a new antitrust inquiry into big tech.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: All right. So this is an inquiry by an administrative agency. Even though it's an administrative agency, it's still the federal government. It's hard for me to take seriously the federal government fining some entity for violating privacy when the federal government itself is the biggest violator of privacy on the planet.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is what they do, $5 billion is a lot of money, but it's a -- it's a drop on the bucket for Facebook. The reason it is so high is this is an express violation of an agreement previously entered into. You can get away with one of this, but you violate an agreement that already restrains you, that's already in place. They're going to come down on you very hard.</p><p>As for the attorney general's investigation announced yesterday, this is some sort of anticompetitive investigation. I don't know how he's going to show harm to consumers. Facebook is free, Google is free, there's no amount of --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but do you think censor --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- harm to the consumer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- conversation judge, I mean, like yes --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: They can do that. They're not the government so they can sensor anybody they want. No, it's harmful and hateful but they can do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But if they're the only game in town. Google has 90 percent market share, so if Google has 90 percent market share in search, they are the big kahuna on search, and if they are putting certain headlines in a search -- if I search Donald Trump and I'm getting all these ugly headlines.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then I search Hillary Clinton and I'm getting \"Hillary Clinton is a superstar. She's the best thing since slice bread.\"</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that censoring information?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And using their 90 percent market share.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It is and it's lawful, and if you don't like that use another, use another one. The First Amendment doesn't restrain that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But they've got 90 percent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CUMMINS: I have a question but not answer about, you know, slanderous material, if somebody gets on one of these platforms and commits slander per se, and I complain against you and you complain about, \"Don't take it down.\"</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That --</p><p>CUMMINS: What's their liability there?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That's a very -- that's a very good question, though, and I'll tell you where --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's why Devin Nunes is suing Twitter.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I'll tell you where you that door has been opened. So if Amazon sells a product from a third-party vendor, and that product (INAUDIBLE) and the third-party vendor doesn't have insurance or goes out of business, Amazon can now be sued. For the first time, Supreme Court ruled on that just about a month or so ago. That is opening the door to litigation over this. But doing something to Google because you don't like their politics, the answer is, find somebody else and compete with them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's --</p><p>MURPHY: Well, I think what -- they're going to get them --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It doesn't fly if they're a media company.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Why?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because if you're --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Media companies is protected by the First Amendment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But they're saying --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: They're going to come after FOX --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They're saying --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- because we dominate a certain viewpoint?</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, they're saying we're not content creators, we're just the platform. In fact, they are creating content. There is -- that's what Devin Nunes is suing Twitter about, that they create content, they cannot call themselves a tech platform. They're dictating.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're not -- under the law -- they're -- under the law, these companies are not considered media companies and they cannot be sued for defamation. That was a law that was passed in the mid-90s, really at the very beginning of the growth in the internet.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That is going to be, for reasons just articulated, reexamined because this is really the Wild West of whether or not you can publish something you know is false. It's one thing for them to say, \"Ah, Judge Napolitano doesn't know what he's talking about.\"</p><p>MURPHY: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: But if they publish something they know is false, that's a very serious issue.</p><p>MURPHY: I think to Maria's point thought --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to -- I just want to add --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is what Twitter did.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because I just want to add one thing to what the judge was talking about, and this is these are two separate stories in The Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department, the broad review of the big tech companies for antitrust issues, and another story in The Wall Street Journal, mentioned earlier on the show, Apple dominates the app store search results, thwarting competitors. That's the gist of it. Search for music, audio book, other categories rank company apps first, developers find it is unfair. Apple says, \"Oh, well, our algorithm doesn't do -- the algorithm's not written that way.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, right.</p><p>MURPHY: Well --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, again, blame the algorithm. How many times have we heard that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Somebody programs the algorithm.</p><p>MURPHY: Somebody does, but when you -- Apple put up an Apple Store, they invested a lot of time and money into the Apple Store, so I think the argument can be made that they can promote their product, and as the judge was saying, if you don't like it, you -- as a developer, you can choose to only serve -- put your product on Android, or on Google's platform, so I think the ultimate thing here will be for the big tech companies like if you're aware, you the public know, you go on Google and you search for something, you're going to get a anticonservative bias or very left wing type bias, then you may choose to go to a different search engine.</p><p>So, I think the ultimate thing here will be them policing themselves and if Apple is going to promote their products above someone else's, now you know about it, so you can choose deal with it or go elsewhere.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: But the lynchpin of all criminal antitrust prosecution is, was the consumer harmed? And if government can't show harm to the consumer, it doesn't matter that Apple favors its own products.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Devin Nunes was harmed.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, that -- that's not criminal, now. The DOJ --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But he was harmed. There were -- there were texts and tweets - -</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, that's (INAUDIBLE) apples and oranges. Whether Devin Nunes was harmed is irrelevant to whether or not the DOJ is going to have a successful criminal prosecution of the four big tech ones.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, we are watching earnings this morning. A slew of heavy hitters like Boeing and Caterpillar all reporting before the opening bell this morning. The stocks are reacting. As you see, Caterpillar down better than 4-1/2 percent, Boeing down almost one percent next up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are awaiting Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's opening statement before the House Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill. What you're looking at right here is the hearing beginning. It is in progress right now. So far, here's what we've heard. Jerry Nadler, the Chairman, made his opening statement, Doug Collins, the ranking member made his. Let's listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NADLER: -- 2016 special election. He received his B.A. from Princeton University and M.A. from New York University in my district, and his J.D. from the University of Virginia. Mr. Mueller is accompanied by his -- by Counsel Aaron Zebley who served as Deputy Special Counsel on the investigation. We welcome our distinguished witness and we thank you for participating in today's hearing.</p><p>Now, if you would please rise, I will begin by swearing you in. Would you raise your right hand, please? Left hand. Do you swear or affirm under penalty of perjury that the testimony you're about to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information and belief, so help you God? Let the record show the witness answered the affirmative. Thank you, and please be seated. Please note that your written statement will be entered into the record in its entirety. Accordingly, I ask that you summarize your testimony in five minutes. Director Mueller, you may begin.</p><p>ROBERT MUELLER, FORMER SPECIAL COUNSEL: Good morning, Chairman Nadler, the -- and Ranking Member Collins, and the members of the committee. As you know, in May 2017, the acting attorney general asked me to serve as special counsel. I undertook that role because I believe that it was of paramount interest to the nation to determine whether a foreign adversary had interfered in the presidential election.</p><p>As the acting attorney general said at the time, the appointment was necessary in order for the American people to have full confidence in the outcome. My staff and I carried out this assignment with that critical objective in mind, to work quietly, thoroughly and with integrity so that the public would have full confidence in the outcome.</p><p>The order appointing me as special counsel directed our office to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential Election. This included investigating any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. It also included investigating efforts to interfere with or obstruct our investigation.</p><p>Throughout the investigation, I continually stressed two things to the team that we had assembled. First, we needed to do our work as thoroughly as possible and expeditiously as possible. It was in the public interest for our investigation to be complete, not to last a day longer than was necessary.</p><p>Second, the investigation needed to be conducted fairly and with absolute integrity. Our team would not leak or take other actions that could compromise the integrity of our work. All decisions were made based on the facts and the law.</p><p>During the course of our investigation, we charged more than 30 defendants with committing federal crimes, including 12 officers of the Russian military. Seven defendants have been convicted or plead guilty.</p><p>Certain of the charges we brought remain pending today. And for those matters, I stress that the indictments contain allegations and every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.</p><p>In addition to the criminal charges we brought, as required by Justice Department regulations, we submitted a confidential report to the attorney general at the conclusion of our investigation. The report set forth the results of our work and the reasons for our charging and declination decisions. The attorney general later made the report largely public.</p><p>As you know, I made a few limited remarks -- limited remarks about our report when we closed the Special Counsel's Office in May of this year. There are certain points that bear emphasis. First, our investigation found that the Russian government interfered in our election in sweeping and systematic fashion.</p><p>Second, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its election interference activities. We did not address collusion, which is not a legal term, rather we focused on whether the evidence was sufficient to charge any member of the campaign with taking part in a criminal conspiracy, and it was not.</p><p>Third, our investigation of efforts to obstruct the investigation and lie to investigators was of critical importance. Obstruction of justice strikes at the core of the government's effort to find the truth and to hold wrongdoers accountable.</p><p>Finally, as described in volume two of our report, we investigated a series of actions by the president towards the investigation. Based on Justice Department policy and principles of fairness, we decided we would not make a decision as to whether the president committed a crime. That was our decision then and it remains our decision today.</p><p>Let me say a further word about my appearance today. It is unusual for a prosecutor to testify about a criminal investigation. And given my role as a prosecutor, there are reasons why my testimony will necessarily be limited.</p><p>First, public testimony could affect several ongoing matters. In some of these matters, court rules or judicial orders limit the disclosure of information to protect -- to protect the fairness of the proceedings. And consistent with longstanding Justice Department policy, it would be inappropriate for me to comment in any way that could affect an ongoing matter.</p><p>Second, the Justice Department has asserted privileges concerning investigative information and decisions, ongoing matters within the Justice Department, and deliberations within our office. These are Justice Department privileges that I will respect.</p><p>The department has released the letter discussing the restrictions of my testimony. I, therefore, will not be able to answer questions about certain areas that I know are of public interest.</p><p>For example, I am unable to address questions about the initial opening of the FBI's Russia investigation which occurred months before my appointment or matters related to the so-called Steele dossier. These matters are subject of ongoing review by the department. Any questions on these topics should, therefore, be directed to the FBI or the Justice Department.</p><p>As I explained when we closed the Special Counsel's Office in May, our report contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made. We conducted an extensive investigation over two years. In writing the report, we stated the results of our investigation with precision. We scrutinized every word.</p><p>I do not intend to summarize or describe the results of our work in a different way in the course of my testimony today. And as I said on May 29th, the report is my testimony, and I will stay within that text.</p><p>And as I stated in May, I will not comment on the actions of the attorney general or of Congress. I was appointed as a prosecutor, and I intend to adhere to that role and to the department's standards that govern it.</p><p>I'll be joined today by Deputy Special Counsel Aaron Zebley. Mr. Zebley has extensive experience as a federal prosecutor and at the FBI, where he served as my chief of staff. Mr. Zebley was responsible for the day-to-day oversight of the investigations conducted by our office.</p><p>Now, I also want to, again, say thank you to the attorneys, the FBI agents, the analysts, the professional staff who helped us conduct this investigation in a fair and independent matter. These individuals who spent nearly two years of -- working on this matter were of the highest integrity.</p><p>Let me say one more thing. Over the course of my career, I have seen a number of challenges to our democracy. The Russian government's effort to interfere in our election is among the most serious. And as I said on May 29th, this deserves the attention of every American. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>NADLER: Thank you. Thank you. We will now proceed under the five-minute rule with questions. I will begin by recognizing myself for five minutes.</p><p>Director Mueller, the president has repeatedly claimed that your report found there was no obstruction --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Robert Mueller is -- just finished his opening statement now. You'll hear from Jerry Nadler followed by Doug Collins for five minutes, as you heard. Mark Penn is with us this morning. And, Mark, he was very clear, he's not going to go beyond that report, and, you know, he's talking about, the significance of Russia getting in the U.S.'s issues and meddling. What about the FBI meddling? What's your reaction?</p><p>PENN: Well, my reaction is, he's not giving much of anything to anybody, with the exception that he was ambiguous about Justice Department policy in terms of the president and obstruction. That will be the important and probably the only question that anybody will get out of him, and, of course, what he said is he's not going to talk about the dossier, the origins of the -- of the investigation or any of that, he is just going to pass the buck on that so Republicans are going to get -- be extremely frustrated by this. We're not going to get the straight story from him. And finally, he called the Russian intervention sweeping and systematic. I'm not sure he documented that it was sweeping, perhaps systematic, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But, Mark, can he really get away with that? I mean, look, you know this better than anybody. You've written about it. I've written about it and we've talked about this for 2-1/2 years, we know what went down as a result of that cabal of individuals who tried to stop Donald Trump. Can he get away saying that? I'm not looking at the oranges of the Russia investigation, I'm not discussing with dossier, I'm not discussing the FISA abuse.</p><p>PENN: Look, this is a prosecutor who's gotten away with unfettered power investigating every associate and friend of the president who knew there was no underlying crime early in the investigation, and then prosecuted people by systematically looking for anything in their life to try to get leverage and threaten them to turn on the president. When you look at what this practitioner has gotten away with, it's a lot more than this testimony.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Chris Bedford, real quick.</p><p>BEDFORD: Yes, I think it looks like he's almost intentionally using a cadence that would make it so people won't be able to use his speaking in campaign ads interrupting himself coughing, going slowly, his word spacing, it's as if he's designing this to not be used politically, which is basically what the Democrats are hoping for. This is going to go back to politics and they're going to have to ask was the investigation launched, was Rosenstein fired, was Mueller fired, was the -- were the -- was the report released?</p><p>If all if that happened, then you're going to have to make the public case for a collusion, or obstruction, and that's going to be very difficult.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Mark Penn, stay with me because I have a question on Microsoft to you before you go. But, Dagen, that's exactly what you said earlier, watch his cadence, watch whether or not he's feeble.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Whether -- and it raises the question, Chris, whether it's intentional or not. Does he come across as if he's in command of the facts of the investigation? Again, he has this sidekick with him, for help, potentially. Does he come across like he was the man in charge of the investigation? Because then that raises issues about all the Democratic donors who were on his team. But, again, to quote that professor, William Howe, vague, cryptic, and at times convoluted, that doesn't make good campaign ad.</p><p>CUMMINS: But he did get a little bit, you know, emotional or put a little punch into his defense of the notion that, you know, obstruction of justice is a very serious thing, kind of a sanctimonious speech about that, and I think in doing so, he may you know, arguably open the door to answering questions about obstruction of justice.</p><p>For instance, who he has ever prosecuted for obstruction of justice that was legally entitled to do what they did? Did it openly and notoriously on -- most of it on T.V., and was not guilty of any crime and was being wrongly investigated?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But you just said a second ago in terms of the U.S., officials paying foreigners.</p><p>CUMMINS: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Explain what you just said to me during the -- during the hearing.</p><p>CUMMINS: Well, I mean, yes, he -- they're investigating these allegations of collusion, but they seem to have completely ignored the fact that the other party was paying foreign citizens to create false information, which was knowingly injected, became the predicate for all of this, $40 million two years and who's holding them accountable?</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know what that sounds like? That sounds like collusion and obstruction, Bud.</p><p>CUMMINS: For real.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what it sounds like. All right. Let's quickly -- let me get to Mark Penn real quick because, Mark, you were the Chief Strategy Officer of Microsoft when Microsoft was being investigated. You worked with them through that case. Your reaction today to A.G. Barr starting this new antitrust investigation into the tech giants.</p><p>PENN: Yes. No, I was Chief Strategy Officer later, but worked with them through the case and remember, that was a tie-in case whether or not they were leveraging their market power in Windows to sell the -- to get people to use their browser. Remember, Facebook has Instagram. Google has Search, but they also have YouTube. So those same questions are going to come up whether they're using their market power to sell or launch and create huge market share for these other products.</p><p>And second, there's an enormous market power that they have in advertising so when the judge says there's no consumer harm, people are going to look at whether or not the advertising rates here are basically being set by an oligopoly and, therefore, may be costing consumers or not. So, there's a lot of big issues here that I think the DOJ could look at. And we'll find out, you know, how smart they are when they begin to open this onion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great insights from you on both subjects, Mark and Chris, as always, great to see you both, gentlemen. Thank you.</p><p>BEDFORD: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Christopher Bedford, Mark Penn, joining us there. Meanwhile, there's Boeing, earnings in focus this morning. The company reporting a massive loss, much worse than expected. Deirdre Bolton on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange --</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- with those details. Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: Maria, this is sending the stock down premarket, $5.82 a share is what Boeing lost on an adjusted basis, so we knew this company obviously is having so many problems with that 737 Max model being grounded. As we recall, there were two deadly crashes within five months of one another. The company forced to ground the plane. If you want to look for a bright side, it's hard to find, but I can tell you the defense and the services unit did post -- basically posting profit.</p><p>So, a lot of analysts' saying, OK, once they get this 737 Max issues behind them, the company does have strengths -- pockets of strength in other areas. I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about Caterpillar as well, these two Dow Components obviously going to drive trade. Caterpillar missing heavily actually on the earnings. $2.83 a share is what they posted. Consensus was $3.12 a share. Ever so slight a miss on revenue, but a miss all the same when you can see essentially the red on your screens premarket for both of these Dow members.</p><p>Of course, so many of us in the community looking forward to after the bell, Ford, Tesla, Facebook, of course, also going to be posting earnings this afternoon. But I have to tell you, Maria, everyone here, every single T.V. is on this Mueller statement. In the meantime, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Isn't that interesting that all the T.V.s --</p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- are on the Mueller testimony? Thank you so much. Deirdre Bolton. We'll check in. Markets are down 102 points of the Dow Jones Industrial Average this morning. We're going into the open, Mike, with the lows of the morning right here.</p><p>MURPHY: We are right near all-time highs in the stock market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: True. True.</p><p>MURPHY: I'm looking past the Boeing and Caterpillar earnings, I'm looking forward to the Facebook earnings today after the close, but, really, this government investigation into big tech is -- can turn into a really big story because if they -- if they continue this, and these large growth companies that have led the market start to see selling coming into them, where does that money go? Does it rotate into other techs? Is it the newer techs, recent IPOs like the Ubers, the Lyfts, or is it companies that have been through this already like a Microsoft, does this benefit? Money won't leave the market, it will rotate but I think there's an opportunity for investors to watch that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see if they go into manufacturing or the banks. Banks have had a pretty good run. Final thoughts? Bud Cummins, great to have you.</p><p>CUMMINS: I think -- I think Mueller's already confirmed what we suspected. There's going to be no new information today and the skilled interrogators like John Ratcliffe won't have a chance in this format to really get anything out of him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that will be a shame. Great show, you guys. Dagen, Mike, Bud, good to see you.</p><p>MURPHY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have a great day, everybody. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right now. Stuart, take it away.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning -- good morning, Maria.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019072403cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-BR61-JB20-G097-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9914\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And Bob, by the way, you - you've been in this seat four times --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROBERT NARDELLI, FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, CHRYSLER</emphasis>: Yes, I have. I have.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: - on the Hill.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: I have. And I think Matt poses probably one of the most challenging questions that Mary will face today. You've been there over 30 years. Is it possible that this never reached your level?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: Is it possible?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Setting that aside though, I - I agree with Matt. I think Mary's doing a great job. And it's unfortunate that as she's trying to get her arms around the CEO job that this now will totally consume her. I can tell you preparing for four of these, you are head down, locked up in a room trying to recall and recant everything that's happened during that period. So it certainly takes her off track relative to running the company to get ready for this grilling that will go on today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: Well how do you prepare, Bob, for something like this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Well, for me when I was at Chrysler and GM, when we were going through this hearings, it really was heads down, in a conference room with a dozen or so 4 or 5-inch binders going through every document, every email, everything that was turned over to the congressional committees so that you knew you were going to get grilled. They have armies of people going through here looking for questions to try and trip you up. Certainly - and I think will Mary will prepare appropriately for this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: Well, getting back though to that - that key question which I'm sure she's going to be asked over and over again is how did you not know, and if you knew, why didn't you do anything about it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Yeah. Again, I don't want to - it's hard for me to predict how that answer will come out. It's - there are situations where things are kept at the very lowest level to avoid disclosure and what have you. I'm not saying that's the case here, but it's possible in an organization of that site that something like this maybe didn't elevate itself to the CEO, which would be unfortunate.   </p><p>      I think Mary's taken a very positive forward step here in creating the vice president's office for safety. She's met with the families. She's been very forthcoming. She's been very open. You look at the number of documents that have been turned over. I think this is a critical moment for a new CEO, particularly Mary, to do what she's doing. So she - she certainly has broke with tradition, as Matt said, how maybe prior CEOs of various companies would have handled it. So I give her a lot of credit for stepping out.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: She certainly broke with tradition also with the way how GM has traditionally been run and - and again, as you say, with this whole reorganization that she's going through right now as the CEO. One of the questions we - we were thinking about as we were preparing for the story is what exactly goes into a recall, Bob? You were - you did not oversee any recalls when you were at Chrysler, but - but what happens at a car company? What are the steps that take place until a car company decides, we've got to call these vehicles back?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Yeah. One of the things we did when we acquired Chrysler from - from Daimler was we installed a very senior person that has a very successful track record. We were able to recruit him away from Nissan. And we put him in place and we started weekly quality tables. We would go through our tech center. We would find those things that were causing quality problems, performance problems. Obviously if anything would endanger life, then that was escalated.   </p><p>      So we made it a very important part of our culture. We did about 400 improvements in the first 90 days relative to quality and performance improvements. And I think you just have to instill in the DNA, the culture of the company that market focused, customer centric is critical, particularly if it's endangering lives of your customers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: Of course. And at what point do you - as a car company, at what point do you say, you know what? We have to actually issue - issue a notice, right, to our - to our consumers? That's a big decision and it's certainly not one that sheds any positive light on the company. So it's got - there's got to be a lot of thinking obviously behind that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: I hope today isn't a case of he said, she said and between General Motors and the National Transportation Safety Board. There ought to be - there ought to be some cooperative tension between those two organizations, not combative. It ought not to be --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: But is there a notice given to NTSB first?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Yeah. There is a requirement that you have to notify them if you start to see fatalities or injuries of that kind. If it's a performance problem it's probably not as critical to get them involved. But obviously if it gets to the point where there are --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: If we're talking seat belts or airbags or anything like that. OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Exactly, exactly. Then you're required to notify them and then you want to work in a harmonious way with them, not in a combative way. And I hope this congressional hearing doesn't create that unnecessary tension and we don't get over regulated now. The pendulum tends to swing, as you know, when something like this happens.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: It does.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELI</emphasis>: Hopefully we can be constructive. Each of the committees will be - do their diligence and not trying to catch anything in their - in their depositions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: Well what about the relationship now between General Motors and the dealerships who now have to handle these recalls and who I'm assuming not happy with the fact that these recalls keep happening and their customers are angry with them?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: But again, I think Mary has really done a great job for the dealership relative to not creating angst against the brands.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: Because you've got to take care of the dealerships, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: You must take care of the dealerships. And they're going to have to handle this plethora of recalls. I think it's important to say regardless of how aggressive and forward positioned she is with GM, chances are there's going to be another one. There are millions of cars in the system today. And let's be careful to say we will never have another recall because that is really going to be --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: It's difficult to make that promise.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: When you think of the thousands parts and the tier one, tier two, tier suppliers and what goes into assembling a car, it is a huge challenge to make sure everything comes together appropriately.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: I want to bring back Bob Nardelli, the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler. Bob, you know this issue inside and out.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Very cool.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: What do you think about what Elon Musk is trying to do?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Well on one - in one regard I think he's brilliant. And again, I've --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: Brilliant for fighting the auto dealers or brilliant for -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Well brilliant in his approach. If you think about it, a good friend of mine in Arizona traveled to California.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: They banned Teslas.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: They banned it so he couldn't buy it in Arizona. He goes to California, puts his modest $40,000 down payment to hold a slot. Goes back to Arizona. The car is then delivered to him on a flatbed. A technician spends an hour with him going through how to operate it. Fast forward a few months later. Technician calls and says your 12-volt battery is not functioning appropriately. We'll be there to change it.  </p><p>      So if you think about the era of big data, certainly Tesla, market focused, customer centric in what they're trying to do to penetrate state by state.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: So it's almost like they've built a customer for life given that kind of service. Hey, that's very tailored here. You can only dream of that with - with a - with a GM car or Toyota car.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Yeah. And you think about - Betty, if you think about the business models we have here, certainly Jack Nasser tried this with Ford if you remember in the '90s.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: The direct sales, right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: The direct sales. Why? Because in manufacturing as an OE, you're looking for volume to absorb your fixed overhead, right? We all as - as manufacturers would love to have the margin that you get out of parts and service and used cars. So there was always that little bit of tension to the dealer network. Certainly if you think about the dealers and their franchise agreements state by state, they are - they have tremendous legacy. They are very highly regarded in the states. It's going to be very tough. So I think --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: They're very powerful.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Very powerful. But I think the dealers are approaching this appropriately. Let's not have a massive fight and maybe lose everything. Let's compromise and see what we can get done. And don't forget, for example, Ohio just accepted. So Elon has --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: Limited, but yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Limited - has a big trump card, right? I'm going to build a battery plant somewhere and I'm going to do it in a friendly state. But if you look - last night we were talking. There's a study out that showed state by state where he's approved relative to limited show rooms. Some as long as within the MSA no one else is doing it. If you think about Carlos Ghosn at Nissan with the Leaf, he could have taken that approach. But if you look at --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: Why didn't he?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Well, I think he looked at the business model for him and said, I've got all these dealers. I don't have to recreate a service organization. I don't have to spend a lot of capital on tools and facilities and brick and mortar. And - and I will benefit my dealers because I'll draw more traffic into my dealership. So that was the business model he elected as opposed to a startup.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: Bob, but - but - but this only works though for Elon Musk and Tesla because they only sell less than 30,000 cars. If you're trying to sell 300,000 cars, you can't do that by yourself.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: The question will be if he grows to 300,000 cars, can he - can his margin cover the infrastructure that he's going to have to create to do the personal service that he's demonstrated? If he can, then he's got a very successful model. The key will be does he have enough margin in the auto to be able to cover those forward costs.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: But do the automakers - when you were at Chrysler, did you want to sell directly to customers? Is that something that - that actually automakers eventually would like? They're just beholden to this dealership network.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: I think we all think about that. If you - if you look at what Fiat did, I'm sure Sergio would like to have had a separate dealership or a separate way to go to market on the (inaudible) the 500. What the compromise was, was the dealer had to spend X millions of dollars to create a studio within the current dealership.   </p><p>      So there's always that thought about we could take care of the customers better. The dealers though have done a remarkable job. I always try to have a great working relationship with those dealers. They are in place. They've invested a lot of capital. They've got tremendous loyalty within the communities. Softball team, political relationships. So it's - it's pretty embedded, Betty.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: But on a personal front though, most people don't like going to dealerships and buying cars. Maybe on the high end it's a pleasant experience, but for most people it's a terrible experience and they feel like they're being bilked out of lots of dollars. Is there something more that should be done with regulating the dealer?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Well there's been many attempts, right? The one price, the national price, the no haggling thing. And maybe Tesla's got it right that it's going to take something as dramatic and revolutionary as what he's trying to do to try to get a compromise. I don't think it's either or. I think in today's digital world you want to have optionality to buy the car the way you want to buy the car.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: I want to bring back my guest host for the hour, Bob Nardelli, the former CEO, as we mentioned, of Chrysler and Home Depot. Bob, what's your biggest question just as a private citizen around this healthcare exchange?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Well I think - I think a couple of important points. Number one, if you ever wanted to learn how not to introduce a program, this is certainly a role model.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: This is certainly the case.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: We were talking upstairs about General Motors. Could you imagine if this was a new platform with this many problems to launch a new car here? So lessons learned here. Program management, oversight, et cetera. Point number one.   </p><p>      Point number two. There were two very important words used in your exchange. One was visits. The other was enrollment. And having at Home Depot tremendous experience in online sales, we used to track visits, which was important, but most important were orders placed when you put down your hard-earned dollars for a product. So there's a big gap.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: So you're skeptical of these numbers as well that the - that the government - that the White House is putting out?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Depends on what word you're going to use. The visits may be right, but enrollment, if you mean paid, would be another perspective. And as just a common guy, I've gone through this myself with my family.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: You're not a common guy, Bob? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: I'm very - I'm just --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: You're no average Joe, but I get it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: - Bob - Bob citizen. And I could tell you it was a harrowing experience to get insurance.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: Have you tried to sign on - wait. So you tried to sign on to the exchange or your relatives did?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Well, so we went through - first of all, we were terminated by - my - my - two of my children were terminated because the insurance company decided not to carry insurance on California. Then we went with the local provider, 30 percent increase first, another 30 percent increase. Then we were notified, two of my children, that they were canceled because the policies that they had didn't meet with the Affordable Care Act government requirements. So then we went back out in trying to find carriers that would --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: That complied.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: - that would comply. So directionally, we went from like $160 a month to $600 a month per child with $5,000 deductible. And I can't tell you how many hours we spent trying to secure this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: You were shopping around (inaudible) insurance.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: If you like your doctors - they wanted to keep their doctors. And to do that, that's what we had to go through.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: So this is - so this experience that you're talking about is exactly why the Republicans are making it a - a focal point of their - of their campaigns come election season, right? Tom Cotton, for instance, who's a Republican congressman in Arkansas, and let's pull up his website, has - when you go to this website - he's running for Senate now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: When you go to this website, he says Obamacare is so bad that Obama doesn't want it. And he - he's playing on - on - on essentially the anger among - that he believes voters have against - against Obamacare. Do you think that that is the right strategy? Are there enough Americans who are angry about this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Well let me say this. This is that old phrase politics over policy. I don't think anyone argues with trying to make sure affordable healthcare is available for all US citizens. I think that's an important thing and directionally right. I think it's the implementation. I think it's some of the controversy on how it's happened. I think some of the changing the goal posts as we went along to make sure. I just think there were a number of issues in the implementation that probably could have been better thought out.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: But how else could it have been done though, Bob? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: I think certainly - certainly more on a bipartisan basis where we got more people in the room, more than just software developers, that we actually brought people in from the business community. What's the impact? How have you implemented major software changes relative to Ernst &amp; Young does this, S&amp;P does this, and really got more insight on people that have been through this relative to the magnitude of the challenge that has taken place here.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: I want to talk more about management because your former boss Jack Welch, who I know you have a very long history with, he actually just wrote this piece that we highlighted yesterday on LinkedIn where he spoke more about management and how to cultivate talent. And he said one of the things he believes companies not - they don't do enough of is they don't pay attention enough to their HR offices. And he was arguing for elevating the HR officer, for instance, to as high a level as a CFO, to be on the senior management team. You agree with this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Yeah, absolutely. First of all, Jack's a dear friend. He's been a great mentor to me. And obviously I can't thank him enough for the lessons I've learned working for him and being around him.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: People look to him for management advice.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Yes, always. He is the guru. So I totally agree with that position. As a matter of fact, when I went to Home Depot one of the first things I did was bring in probably one of the strongest HR chief human resources and we started to put process into place.   </p><p>      You've got human capital and you got physical capital. A lot of times you'll spend an inordinate amount of analysis on - on the physical capital, and yet it is your human capital that brings that to leaf (ph). So I think the chief human resource officer needs to have an equal share at your staff's roundtable.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: Which they often don't.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Which they don't. They're kind of second tier, back room. But there's nothing more important than talent. If you look at the history of GE and the ability to continue to have extremely strong talent on the bench, as talent left talent replaced it. So I think it's very important.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: Well speaking about talent, there's so much fight for talent, right, on the West Coast. And there's a great story about how the chamber of commerce decided, hello, they're going to put an office now on the West Coast, that they're going to start transferring some of their resources there. And I imagine this is all also in - in time with the issues of the day, right? Immigration now for Silicon Valley companies, taxes, the privacy issue. And I'm assuming the chamber of commerce feels like, hey, there's a need now for our services.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Yeah. I - I think it's an excellent decision by Tom and the chamber. You have to be immersed in the markets and in the environments of the issues so you have a sensitivity and an understanding. Now Tom doesn't have a glass jaw, so as he moves to the West Coast he's going to need all - and muster all -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: I was going to say, yeah. Because some of their - you've had companies like I believe Yahoo did not renew their membership in the chamber and a couple of other big tech companies because they don't agree with some of the policies by the chamber, the environmental - environmental stance for instance by them. Are they - I'm not expecting a big red carpet rolled out for them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: No, I wouldn't. I'm sure they'll move into a facility with high security. But Tom - I think Tom's doing the right thing. I think he's balanced. He's thoughtful in his positions in representing the chamber. He works both sides of the aisle. I think it's important.   </p><p>      I think that some of these larger corporations that have elected not to participate will rethink that decision because you'd rather be at the table than not at the table. We talked about in the last segment on the Affordable Care Act. So hopefully by them moving out there they're demonstrating their willingness to engage, listen, learn before you lead.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: All right. Bob, it's been great to have you here this hour.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NARDELLI</emphasis>: Thank you. It's been great, Betty. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIU</emphasis>: Bob Nardelli, the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler and Home Depot. </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT*** THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BETTY LIU, HOST, BLOOMBERG NEWS: That's a great segue into <person><nameText>Bob Nardelli, </nameText></person>who is the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler. And Bob, by the way, you - you've been in this seat four times --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>ROBERT NARDELLI, </nameText></person>FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, CHRYSLER: Yes, I have. I have.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LIU: - on the Hill.</p><p>NARDELLI: I have. And I think Matt poses probably one of the most challenging questions that Mary will face today. You've been there over 30 years. Is it possible that this never reached your level?</p><p>LIU: Is it possible?</p><p>NARDELLI: Setting that aside though, I - I agree with Matt. I think Mary's doing a great job. And it's unfortunate that as she's trying to get her arms around the CEO job that this now will totally consume her. I can tell you preparing for four of these, you are head down, locked up in a room trying to recall and recant everything that's happened during that period. So it certainly takes her off track relative to running the company to get ready for this grilling that will go on today.</p><p>LIU: Well how do you prepare, Bob, for something like this?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well, for me when I was at Chrysler and GM, when we were going through this hearings, it really was heads down, in a conference room with a dozen or so 4 or 5-inch binders going through every document, every email, everything that was turned over to the congressional committees so that you knew you were going to get grilled. They have armies of people going through here looking for questions to try and trip you up. Certainly - and I think will Mary will prepare appropriately for this.</p><p>LIU: Well, getting back though to that - that key question which I'm sure she's going to be asked over and over again is how did you not know, and if you knew, why didn't you do anything about it.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. Again, I don't want to - it's hard for me to predict how that answer will come out. It's - there are situations where things are kept at the very lowest level to avoid disclosure and what have you. I'm not saying that's the case here, but it's possible in an organization of that site that something like this maybe didn't elevate itself to the CEO, which would be unfortunate.</p><p>I think Mary's taken a very positive forward step here in creating the vice president's office for safety. She's met with the families. She's been very forthcoming. She's been very open. You look at the number of documents that have been turned over. I think this is a critical moment for a new CEO, particularly Mary, to do what she's doing. So she - she certainly has broke with tradition, as Matt said, how maybe prior CEOs of various companies would have handled it. So I give her a lot of credit for stepping out.</p><p>LIU: She certainly broke with tradition also with the way how GM has traditionally been run and - and again, as you say, with this whole reorganization that she's going through right now as the CEO. One of the questions we - we were thinking about as we were preparing for the story is what exactly goes into a recall, Bob? You were - you did not oversee any recalls when you were at Chrysler, but - but what happens at a car company? What are the steps that take place until a car company decides, we've got to call these vehicles back?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. One of the things we did when we acquired Chrysler from - from Daimler was we installed a very senior person that has a very successful track record. We were able to recruit him away from Nissan. And we put him in place and we started weekly quality tables. We would go through our tech center. We would find those things that were causing quality problems, performance problems. Obviously if anything would endanger life, then that was escalated.</p><p>So we made it a very important part of our culture. We did about 400 improvements in the first 90 days relative to quality and performance improvements. And I think you just have to instill in the DNA, the culture of the company that market focused, customer centric is critical, particularly if it's endangering lives of your customers.</p><p>LIU: Of course. And at what point do you - as a car company, at what point do you say, you know what? We have to actually issue - issue a notice, right, to our - to our consumers? That's a big decision and it's certainly not one that sheds any positive light on the company. So it's got - there's got to be a lot of thinking obviously behind that.</p><p>NARDELLI: I hope today isn't a case of he said, she said and between General Motors and the National Transportation Safety Board. There ought to be - there ought to be some cooperative tension between those two organizations, not combative. It ought not to be --</p><p>LIU: But is there a notice given to NTSB first?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. There is a requirement that you have to notify them if you start to see fatalities or injuries of that kind. If it's a performance problem it's probably not as critical to get them involved. But obviously if it gets to the point where there are --</p><p>LIU: If we're talking seat belts or airbags or anything like that. OK.</p><p>NARDELLI: Exactly, exactly. Then you're required to notify them and then you want to work in a harmonious way with them, not in a combative way. And I hope this congressional hearing doesn't create that unnecessary tension and we don't get over regulated now. The pendulum tends to swing, as you know, when something like this happens.</p><p>LIU: It does.</p><p>NARDELI: Hopefully we can be constructive. Each of the committees will be - do their diligence and not trying to catch anything in their - in their depositions.</p><p>LIU: Well what about the relationship now between General Motors and the dealerships who now have to handle these recalls and who I'm assuming not happy with the fact that these recalls keep happening and their customers are angry with them?</p><p>NARDELLI: But again, I think Mary has really done a great job for the dealership relative to not creating angst against the brands.</p><p>LIU: Because you've got to take care of the dealerships, right?</p><p>NARDELLI: You must take care of the dealerships. And they're going to have to handle this plethora of recalls. I think it's important to say regardless of how aggressive and forward positioned she is with GM, chances are there's going to be another one. There are millions of cars in the system today. And let's be careful to say we will never have another recall because that is really going to be --</p><p>LIU: It's difficult to make that promise.</p><p>NARDELLI: When you think of the thousands parts and the tier one, tier two, tier suppliers and what goes into assembling a car, it is a huge challenge to make sure everything comes together appropriately.</p><p>LIU: I want to bring back <person><nameText>Bob Nardelli, </nameText></person>the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler. Bob, you know this issue inside and out.</p><p>NARDELLI: Very cool.</p><p>LIU: What do you think about what Elon Musk is trying to do?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well on one - in one regard I think he's brilliant. And again, I've --</p><p>LIU: Brilliant for fighting the auto dealers or brilliant for -</p><p>NARDELLI: Well brilliant in his approach. If you think about it, a good friend of mine in Arizona traveled to California.</p><p>LIU: They banned Teslas.</p><p>NARDELLI: They banned it so he couldn't buy it in Arizona. He goes to California, puts his modest $40,000 down payment to hold a slot. Goes back to Arizona. The car is then delivered to him on a flatbed. A technician spends an hour with him going through how to operate it. Fast forward a few months later. Technician calls and says your 12-volt battery is not functioning appropriately. We'll be there to change it.</p><p>So if you think about the era of big data, certainly Tesla, market focused, customer centric in what they're trying to do to penetrate state by state.</p><p>LIU: So it's almost like they've built a customer for life given that kind of service. Hey, that's very tailored here. You can only dream of that with - with a - with a GM car or Toyota car.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. And you think about - Betty, if you think about the business models we have here, certainly Jack Nasser tried this with Ford if you remember in the '90s.</p><p>LIU: The direct sales, right.</p><p>NARDELLI: The direct sales. Why? Because in manufacturing as an OE, you're looking for volume to absorb your fixed overhead, right? We all as - as manufacturers would love to have the margin that you get out of parts and service and used cars. So there was always that little bit of tension to the dealer network. Certainly if you think about the dealers and their franchise agreements state by state, they are - they have tremendous legacy. They are very highly regarded in the states. It's going to be very tough. So I think --</p><p>LIU: They're very powerful.</p><p>NARDELLI: Very powerful. But I think the dealers are approaching this appropriately. Let's not have a massive fight and maybe lose everything. Let's compromise and see what we can get done. And don't forget, for example, Ohio just accepted. So Elon has --</p><p>LIU: Limited, but yes.</p><p>NARDELLI: Limited - has a big trump card, right? I'm going to build a battery plant somewhere and I'm going to do it in a friendly state. But if you look - last night we were talking. There's a study out that showed state by state where he's approved relative to limited show rooms. Some as long as within the MSA no one else is doing it. If you think about Carlos Ghosn at Nissan with the Leaf, he could have taken that approach. But if you look at --</p><p>LIU: Why didn't he?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well, I think he looked at the business model for him and said, I've got all these dealers. I don't have to recreate a service organization. I don't have to spend a lot of capital on tools and facilities and brick and mortar. And - and I will benefit my dealers because I'll draw more traffic into my dealership. So that was the business model he elected as opposed to a startup.</p><p>LIU: Bob, but - but - but this only works though for Elon Musk and Tesla because they only sell less than 30,000 cars. If you're trying to sell 300,000 cars, you can't do that by yourself.</p><p>NARDELLI: The question will be if he grows to 300,000 cars, can he - can his margin cover the infrastructure that he's going to have to create to do the personal service that he's demonstrated? If he can, then he's got a very successful model. The key will be does he have enough margin in the auto to be able to cover those forward costs.</p><p>LIU: But do the automakers - when you were at Chrysler, did you want to sell directly to customers? Is that something that - that actually automakers eventually would like? They're just beholden to this dealership network.</p><p>NARDELLI: I think we all think about that. If you - if you look at what Fiat did, I'm sure Sergio would like to have had a separate dealership or a separate way to go to market on the (inaudible) the 500. What the compromise was, was the dealer had to spend X millions of dollars to create a studio within the current dealership.</p><p>So there's always that thought about we could take care of the customers better. The dealers though have done a remarkable job. I always try to have a great working relationship with those dealers. They are in place. They've invested a lot of capital. They've got tremendous loyalty within the communities. Softball team, political relationships. So it's - it's pretty embedded, Betty.</p><p>LIU: But on a personal front though, most people don't like going to dealerships and buying cars. Maybe on the high end it's a pleasant experience, but for most people it's a terrible experience and they feel like they're being bilked out of lots of dollars. Is there something more that should be done with regulating the dealer?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well there's been many attempts, right? The one price, the national price, the no haggling thing. And maybe Tesla's got it right that it's going to take something as dramatic and revolutionary as what he's trying to do to try to get a compromise. I don't think it's either or. I think in today's digital world you want to have optionality to buy the car the way you want to buy the car.</p><p>LIU: I want to bring back my guest host for the hour, <person><nameText>Bob Nardelli, </nameText></person>the former CEO, as we mentioned, of Chrysler and Home Depot. Bob, what's your biggest question just as a private citizen around this healthcare exchange?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well I think - I think a couple of important points. Number one, if you ever wanted to learn how not to introduce a program, this is certainly a role model.</p><p>LIU: This is certainly the case.</p><p>NARDELLI: We were talking upstairs about General Motors. Could you imagine if this was a new platform with this many problems to launch a new car here? So lessons learned here. Program management, oversight, et cetera. Point number one.</p><p>Point number two. There were two very important words used in your exchange. One was visits. The other was enrollment. And having at Home Depot tremendous experience in online sales, we used to track visits, which was important, but most important were orders placed when you put down your hard-earned dollars for a product. So there's a big gap.</p><p>LIU: So you're skeptical of these numbers as well that the - that the government - that the White House is putting out?</p><p>NARDELLI: Depends on what word you're going to use. The visits may be right, but enrollment, if you mean paid, would be another perspective. And as just a common guy, I've gone through this myself with my family.</p><p>LIU: You're not a common guy, Bob?</p><p>NARDELLI: I'm very - I'm just --</p><p>LIU: You're no average Joe, but I get it.</p><p>NARDELLI: - Bob - Bob citizen. And I could tell you it was a harrowing experience to get insurance.</p><p>LIU: Have you tried to sign on - wait. So you tried to sign on to the exchange or your relatives did?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well, so we went through - first of all, we were terminated by - my - my - two of my children were terminated because the insurance company decided not to carry insurance on California. Then we went with the local provider, 30 percent increase first, another 30 percent increase. Then we were notified, two of my children, that they were canceled because the policies that they had didn't meet with the Affordable Care Act government requirements. So then we went back out in trying to find carriers that would --</p><p>LIU: That complied.</p><p>NARDELLI: - that would comply. So directionally, we went from like $160 a month to $600 a month per child with $5,000 deductible. And I can't tell you how many hours we spent trying to secure this.</p><p>LIU: You were shopping around (inaudible) insurance.</p><p>NARDELLI: If you like your doctors - they wanted to keep their doctors. And to do that, that's what we had to go through.</p><p>LIU: So this is - so this experience that you're talking about is exactly why the Republicans are making it a - a focal point of their - of their campaigns come election season, right? Tom Cotton, for instance, who's a Republican congressman in Arkansas, and let's pull up his website, has - when you go to this website - he's running for Senate now?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes.</p><p>LIU: When you go to this website, he says Obamacare is so bad that Obama doesn't want it. And he - he's playing on - on - on essentially the anger among - that he believes voters have against - against Obamacare. Do you think that that is the right strategy? Are there enough Americans who are angry about this?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well let me say this. This is that old phrase politics over policy. I don't think anyone argues with trying to make sure affordable healthcare is available for all US citizens. I think that's an important thing and directionally right. I think it's the implementation. I think it's some of the controversy on how it's happened. I think some of the changing the goal posts as we went along to make sure. I just think there were a number of issues in the implementation that probably could have been better thought out.</p><p>LIU: But how else could it have been done though, Bob?</p><p>NARDELLI: I think certainly - certainly more on a bipartisan basis where we got more people in the room, more than just software developers, that we actually brought people in from the business community. What's the impact? How have you implemented major software changes relative to Ernst &amp; Young does this, S&amp;P does this, and really got more insight on people that have been through this relative to the magnitude of the challenge that has taken place here.</p><p>LIU: I want to talk more about management because your former boss Jack Welch, who I know you have a very long history with, he actually just wrote this piece that we highlighted yesterday on LinkedIn where he spoke more about management and how to cultivate talent. And he said one of the things he believes companies not - they don't do enough of is they don't pay attention enough to their HR offices. And he was arguing for elevating the HR officer, for instance, to as high a level as a CFO, to be on the senior management team. You agree with this?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah, absolutely. First of all, Jack's a dear friend. He's been a great mentor to me. And obviously I can't thank him enough for the lessons I've learned working for him and being around him.</p><p>LIU: People look to him for management advice.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes, always. He is the guru. So I totally agree with that position. As a matter of fact, when I went to Home Depot one of the first things I did was bring in probably one of the strongest HR chief human resources and we started to put process into place.</p><p>You've got human capital and you got physical capital. A lot of times you'll spend an inordinate amount of analysis on - on the physical capital, and yet it is your human capital that brings that to leaf (ph). So I think the chief human resource officer needs to have an equal share at your staff's roundtable.</p><p>LIU: Which they often don't.</p><p>NARDELLI: Which they don't. They're kind of second tier, back room. But there's nothing more important than talent. If you look at the history of GE and the ability to continue to have extremely strong talent on the bench, as talent left talent replaced it. So I think it's very important.</p><p>LIU: Well speaking about talent, there's so much fight for talent, right, on the West Coast. And there's a great story about how the chamber of commerce decided, hello, they're going to put an office now on the West Coast, that they're going to start transferring some of their resources there. And I imagine this is all also in - in time with the issues of the day, right? Immigration now for Silicon Valley companies, taxes, the privacy issue. And I'm assuming the chamber of commerce feels like, hey, there's a need now for our services.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. I - I think it's an excellent decision by Tom and the chamber. You have to be immersed in the markets and in the environments of the issues so you have a sensitivity and an understanding. Now Tom doesn't have a glass jaw, so as he moves to the West Coast he's going to need all - and muster all -</p><p>LIU: I was going to say, yeah. Because some of their - you've had companies like I believe Yahoo did not renew their membership in the chamber and a couple of other big tech companies because they don't agree with some of the policies by the chamber, the environmental - environmental stance for instance by them. Are they - I'm not expecting a big red carpet rolled out for them.</p><p>NARDELLI: No, I wouldn't. I'm sure they'll move into a facility with high security. But Tom - I think Tom's doing the right thing. I think he's balanced. He's thoughtful in his positions in representing the chamber. He works both sides of the aisle. I think it's important.</p><p>I think that some of these larger corporations that have elected not to participate will rethink that decision because you'd rather be at the table than not at the table. We talked about in the last segment on the Affordable Care Act. So hopefully by them moving out there they're demonstrating their willingness to engage, listen, learn before you lead.</p><p>LIU: All right. Bob, it's been great to have you here this hour.</p><p>NARDELLI: Thank you. It's been great, Betty. Thank you.</p><p>LIU: <person><nameText>Bob Nardelli, </nameText></person>the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler and Home Depot.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BETTY LIU, HOST, BLOOMBERG NEWS: That's a great segue into Bob Nardelli,  who is the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler. And Bob, by the way, you -  you've been in this seat four times --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROBERT NARDELLI, FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, CHRYSLER: Yes, I have. I have.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LIU: - on the Hill.</p><p>NARDELLI: I have. And I think Matt poses probably one of the most  challenging questions that Mary will face today. You've been there over 30  years. Is it possible that this never reached your level?</p><p>LIU: Is it possible? </p><p>NARDELLI: Setting that aside though, I - I agree with Matt. I think Mary's  doing a great job. And it's unfortunate that as she's trying to get her  arms around the CEO job that this now will totally consume her. I can tell  you preparing for four of these, you are head down, locked up in a room  trying to recall and recant everything that's happened during that period.  So it certainly takes her off track relative to running the company to get  ready for this grilling that will go on today.</p><p>LIU: Well how do you prepare, Bob, for something like this?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well, for me when I was at Chrysler and GM, when we were going  through this hearings, it really was heads down, in a conference room with  a dozen or so 4 or 5-inch binders going through every document, every  email, everything that was turned over to the congressional committees so  that you knew you were going to get grilled. They have armies of people  going through here looking for questions to try and trip you up. Certainly  - and I think will Mary will prepare appropriately for this.</p><p>LIU: Well, getting back though to that - that key question which I'm sure  she's going to be asked over and over again is how did you not know, and if  you knew, why didn't you do anything about it.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. Again, I don't want to - it's hard for me to predict how  that answer will come out. It's - there are situations where things are  kept at the very lowest level to avoid disclosure and what have you. I'm  not saying that's the case here, but it's possible in an organization of  that site that something like this maybe didn't elevate itself to the CEO,  which would be unfortunate. </p><p>I think Mary's taken a very positive forward step here in creating the vice  president's office for safety. She's met with the families. She's been very  forthcoming. She's been very open. You look at the number of documents that  have been turned over. I think this is a critical moment for a new CEO,  particularly Mary, to do what she's doing. So she - she certainly has broke  with tradition, as Matt said, how maybe prior CEOs of various companies  would have handled it. So I give her a lot of credit for stepping out.</p><p>LIU: She certainly broke with tradition also with the way how GM has  traditionally been run and - and again, as you say, with this whole  reorganization that she's going through right now as the CEO. One of the  questions we - we were thinking about as we were preparing for the story is  what exactly goes into a recall, Bob? You were - you did not oversee any  recalls when you were at Chrysler, but - but what happens at a car company?  What are the steps that take place until a car company decides, we've got  to call these vehicles back?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. One of the things we did when we acquired Chrysler from -  from Daimler was we installed a very senior person that has a very  successful track record. We were able to recruit him away from Nissan. And  we put him in place and we started weekly quality tables. We would go  through our tech center. We would find those things that were causing  quality problems, performance problems. Obviously if anything would  endanger life, then that was escalated. </p><p>So we made it a very important part of our culture. We did about 400  improvements in the first 90 days relative to quality and performance  improvements. And I think you just have to instill in the DNA, the culture  of the company that market focused, customer centric is critical,  particularly if it's endangering lives of your customers.</p><p>LIU: Of course. And at what point do you - as a car company, at what point  do you say, you know what? We have to actually issue - issue a notice,  right, to our - to our consumers? That's a big decision and it's certainly  not one that sheds any positive light on the company. So it's got - there's  got to be a lot of thinking obviously behind that.</p><p>NARDELLI: I hope today isn't a case of he said, she said and between  General Motors and the National Transportation Safety Board. There ought to  be - there ought to be some cooperative tension between those two  organizations, not combative. It ought not to be --</p><p>LIU: But is there a notice given to NTSB first? </p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. There is a requirement that you have to notify them if you  start to see fatalities or injuries of that kind. If it's a performance  problem it's probably not as critical to get them involved. But obviously  if it gets to the point where there are --</p><p>LIU: If we're talking seat belts or airbags or anything like that. OK.</p><p>NARDELLI: Exactly, exactly. Then you're required to notify them and then  you want to work in a harmonious way with them, not in a combative way. And  I hope this congressional hearing doesn't create that unnecessary tension  and we don't get over regulated now. The pendulum tends to swing, as you  know, when something like this happens.</p><p>LIU: It does.</p><p>NARDELI: Hopefully we can be constructive. Each of the committees will be -  do their diligence and not trying to catch anything in their - in their  depositions.</p><p>LIU: Well what about the relationship now between General Motors and the  dealerships who now have to handle these recalls and who I'm assuming not  happy with the fact that these recalls keep happening and their customers  are angry with them?</p><p>NARDELLI: But again, I think Mary has really done a great job for the  dealership relative to not creating angst against the brands.</p><p>LIU: Because you've got to take care of the dealerships, right?</p><p>NARDELLI: You must take care of the dealerships. And they're going to have  to handle this plethora of recalls. I think it's important to say  regardless of how aggressive and forward positioned she is with GM, chances  are there's going to be another one. There are millions of cars in the  system today. And let's be careful to say we will never have another recall  because that is really going to be --</p><p>LIU: It's difficult to make that promise.</p><p>NARDELLI: When you think of the thousands parts and the tier one, tier two,  tier suppliers and what goes into assembling a car, it is a huge challenge  to make sure everything comes together appropriately.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LIU: I want to bring back Bob Nardelli, the former chairman and CEO of  Chrysler. Bob, you know this issue inside and out. </p><p>NARDELLI: Very cool.</p><p>LIU: What do you think about what Elon Musk is trying to do?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well on one - in one regard I think he's brilliant. And again,  I've --</p><p>LIU: Brilliant for fighting the auto dealers or brilliant for - </p><p>NARDELLI: Well brilliant in his approach. If you think about it, a good  friend of mine in Arizona traveled to California.</p><p>LIU: They banned Teslas.</p><p>NARDELLI: They banned it so he couldn't buy it in Arizona. He goes to  California, puts his modest $40,000 down payment to hold a slot. Goes back  to Arizona. The car is then delivered to him on a flatbed. A technician  spends an hour with him going through how to operate it. Fast forward a few  months later. Technician calls and says your 12-volt battery is not  functioning appropriately. We'll be there to change it.</p><p>So if you think about the era of big data, certainly Tesla, market focused,  customer centric in what they're trying to do to penetrate state by state.</p><p>LIU: So it's almost like they've built a customer for life given that kind  of service. Hey, that's very tailored here. You can only dream of that with  - with a - with a GM car or Toyota car.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. And you think about - Betty, if you think about the  business models we have here, certainly Jack Nasser tried this with Ford if  you remember in the '90s.</p><p>LIU: The direct sales, right.</p><p>NARDELLI: The direct sales. Why? Because in manufacturing as an OE, you're  looking for volume to absorb your fixed overhead, right? We all as - as  manufacturers would love to have the margin that you get out of parts and  service and used cars. So there was always that little bit of tension to  the dealer network. Certainly if you think about the dealers and their  franchise agreements state by state, they are - they have tremendous  legacy. They are very highly regarded in the states. It's going to be very  tough. So I think --</p><p>LIU: They're very powerful.</p><p>NARDELLI: Very powerful. But I think the dealers are approaching this  appropriately. Let's not have a massive fight and maybe lose everything.  Let's compromise and see what we can get done. And don't forget, for  example, Ohio just accepted. So Elon has --</p><p>LIU: Limited, but yes.</p><p>NARDELLI: Limited - has a big trump card, right? I'm going to build a  battery plant somewhere and I'm going to do it in a friendly state. But if  you look - last night we were talking. There's a study out that showed  state by state where he's approved relative to limited show rooms. Some as  long as within the MSA no one else is doing it. If you think about Carlos  Ghosn at Nissan with the Leaf, he could have taken that approach. But if  you look at --</p><p>LIU: Why didn't he?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well, I think he looked at the business model for him and said,  I've got all these dealers. I don't have to recreate a service  organization. I don't have to spend a lot of capital on tools and  facilities and brick and mortar. And - and I will benefit my dealers  because I'll draw more traffic into my dealership. So that was the business  model he elected as opposed to a startup.</p><p>LIU: Bob, but - but - but this only works though for Elon Musk and Tesla  because they only sell less than 30,000 cars. If you're trying to sell  300,000 cars, you can't do that by yourself.</p><p>NARDELLI: The question will be if he grows to 300,000 cars, can he - can  his margin cover the infrastructure that he's going to have to create to do  the personal service that he's demonstrated? If he can, then he's got a  very successful model. The key will be does he have enough margin in the  auto to be able to cover those forward costs.</p><p>LIU: But do the automakers - when you were at Chrysler, did you want to  sell directly to customers? Is that something that - that actually  automakers eventually would like? They're just beholden to this dealership  network.</p><p>NARDELLI: I think we all think about that. If you - if you look at what  Fiat did, I'm sure Sergio would like to have had a separate dealership or a  separate way to go to market on the (inaudible) the 500. What the  compromise was, was the dealer had to spend X millions of dollars to create  a studio within the current dealership. </p><p>So there's always that thought about we could take care of the customers  better. The dealers though have done a remarkable job. I always try to have  a great working relationship with those dealers. They are in place. They've  invested a lot of capital. They've got tremendous loyalty within the  communities. Softball team, political relationships. So it's - it's pretty  embedded, Betty.</p><p>LIU: But on a personal front though, most people don't like going to  dealerships and buying cars. Maybe on the high end it's a pleasant  experience, but for most people it's a terrible experience and they feel  like they're being bilked out of lots of dollars. Is there something more  that should be done with regulating the dealer?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well there's been many attempts, right? The one price, the  national price, the no haggling thing. And maybe Tesla's got it right that  it's going to take something as dramatic and revolutionary as what he's  trying to do to try to get a compromise. I don't think it's either or. I  think in today's digital world you want to have optionality to buy the car  the way you want to buy the car.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LIU: I want to bring back my guest host for the hour, Bob Nardelli, the  former CEO, as we mentioned, of Chrysler and Home Depot. Bob, what's your  biggest question just as a private citizen around this healthcare exchange?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well I think - I think a couple of important points. Number one,  if you ever wanted to learn how not to introduce a program, this is  certainly a role model.</p><p>LIU: This is certainly the case.</p><p>NARDELLI: We were talking upstairs about General Motors. Could you imagine  if this was a new platform with this many problems to launch a new car  here? So lessons learned here. Program management, oversight, et cetera.  Point number one. </p><p>Point number two. There were two very important words used in your  exchange. One was visits. The other was enrollment. And having at Home  Depot tremendous experience in online sales, we used to track visits, which  was important, but most important were orders placed when you put down your  hard-earned dollars for a product. So there's a big gap.</p><p>LIU: So you're skeptical of these numbers as well that the - that the  government - that the White House is putting out?</p><p>NARDELLI: Depends on what word you're going to use. The visits may be  right, but enrollment, if you mean paid, would be another perspective. And  as just a common guy, I've gone through this myself with my family.</p><p>LIU: You're not a common guy, Bob?</p><p>NARDELLI: I'm very - I'm just --</p><p>LIU: You're no average Joe, but I get it.</p><p>NARDELLI: - Bob - Bob citizen. And I could tell you it was a harrowing  experience to get insurance.</p><p>LIU: Have you tried to sign on - wait. So you tried to sign on to the  exchange or your relatives did?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well, so we went through - first of all, we were terminated by -  my - my - two of my children were terminated because the insurance company  decided not to carry insurance on California. Then we went with the local  provider, 30 percent increase first, another 30 percent increase. Then we  were notified, two of my children, that they were canceled because the  policies that they had didn't meet with the Affordable Care Act government  requirements. So then we went back out in trying to find carriers that  would --</p><p>LIU: That complied.</p><p>NARDELLI: - that would comply. So directionally, we went from like $160 a  month to $600 a month per child with $5,000 deductible. And I can't tell  you how many hours we spent trying to secure this.</p><p>LIU: You were shopping around (inaudible) insurance.</p><p>NARDELLI: If you like your doctors - they wanted to keep their doctors. And  to do that, that's what we had to go through.</p><p>LIU: So this is - so this experience that you're talking about is exactly  why the Republicans are making it a - a focal point of their - of their  campaigns come election season, right? Tom Cotton, for instance, who's a  Republican congressman in Arkansas, and let's pull up his website, has -  when you go to this website - he's running for Senate now?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes.</p><p>LIU: When you go to this website, he says Obamacare is so bad that Obama  doesn't want it. And he - he's playing on - on - on essentially the anger  among - that he believes voters have against - against Obamacare. Do you  think that that is the right strategy? Are there enough Americans who are  angry about this?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well let me say this. This is that old phrase politics over  policy. I don't think anyone argues with trying to make sure affordable  healthcare is available for all US citizens. I think that's an important  thing and directionally right. I think it's the implementation. I think  it's some of the controversy on how it's happened. I think some of the  changing the goal posts as we went along to make sure. I just think there  were a number of issues in the implementation that probably could have been  better thought out.</p><p>LIU: But how else could it have been done though, Bob?</p><p>NARDELLI: I think certainly - certainly more on a bipartisan basis where we  got more people in the room, more than just software developers, that we  actually brought people in from the business community. What's the impact?  How have you implemented major software changes relative to Ernst &amp; Young  does this, S&amp;P does this, and really got more insight on people that have  been through this relative to the magnitude of the challenge that has taken  place here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LIU: I want to talk more about management because your former boss Jack  Welch, who I know you have a very long history with, he actually just wrote  this piece that we highlighted yesterday on LinkedIn where he spoke more  about management and how to cultivate talent. And he said one of the things  he believes companies not - they don't do enough of is they don't pay  attention enough to their HR offices. And he was arguing for elevating the  HR officer, for instance, to as high a level as a CFO, to be on the senior  management team. You agree with this?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah, absolutely. First of all, Jack's a dear friend. He's been a  great mentor to me. And obviously I can't thank him enough for the lessons  I've learned working for him and being around him.</p><p>LIU: People look to him for management advice.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes, always. He is the guru. So I totally agree with that  position. As a matter of fact, when I went to Home Depot one of the first  things I did was bring in probably one of the strongest HR chief human  resources and we started to put process into place. </p><p>You've got human capital and you got physical capital. A lot of times  you'll spend an inordinate amount of analysis on - on the physical capital,  and yet it is your human capital that brings that to leaf (ph). So I think  the chief human resource officer needs to have an equal share at your  staff's roundtable.</p><p>LIU: Which they often don't.</p><p>NARDELLI: Which they don't. They're kind of second tier, back room. But  there's nothing more important than talent. If you look at the history of  GE and the ability to continue to have extremely strong talent on the  bench, as talent left talent replaced it. So I think it's very important.</p><p>LIU: Well speaking about talent, there's so much fight for talent, right,  on the West Coast. And there's a great story about how the chamber of  commerce decided, hello, they're going to put an office now on the West  Coast, that they're going to start transferring some of their resources  there. And I imagine this is all also in - in time with the issues of the  day, right? Immigration now for Silicon Valley companies, taxes, the  privacy issue. And I'm assuming the chamber of commerce feels like, hey,  there's a need now for our services.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. I - I think it's an excellent decision by Tom and the  chamber. You have to be immersed in the markets and in the environments of  the issues so you have a sensitivity and an understanding. Now Tom doesn't  have a glass jaw, so as he moves to the West Coast he's going to need all -  and muster all -</p><p>LIU: I was going to say, yeah. Because some of their - you've had companies  like I believe Yahoo did not renew their membership in the chamber and a  couple of other big tech companies because they don't agree with some of  the policies by the chamber, the environmental - environmental stance for  instance by them. Are they - I'm not expecting a big red carpet rolled out  for them.</p><p>NARDELLI: No, I wouldn't. I'm sure they'll move into a facility with high  security. But Tom - I think Tom's doing the right thing. I think he's  balanced. He's thoughtful in his positions in representing the chamber. He  works both sides of the aisle. I think it's important. </p><p>I think that some of these larger corporations that have elected not to  participate will rethink that decision because you'd rather be at the table  than not at the table. We talked about in the last segment on the  Affordable Care Act. So hopefully by them moving out there they're  demonstrating their willingness to engage, listen, learn before you lead.</p><p>LIU: All right. Bob, it's been great to have you here this hour.</p><p>NARDELLI: Thank you. It's been great, Betty. Thank you.</p><p>LIU: Bob Nardelli, the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler and Home Depot.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BETTY LIU, HOST, BLOOMBERG NEWS: That's a great segue into <person><nameText>Bob Nardelli, </nameText></person>who is the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler. And Bob, by the way, you - you've been in this seat four times --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>ROBERT NARDELLI, </nameText></person>FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, CHRYSLER: Yes, I have. I have.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LIU: - on the Hill.</p><p>NARDELLI: I have. And I think Matt poses probably one of the most challenging questions that Mary will face today. You've been there over 30 years. Is it possible that this never reached your level?</p><p>LIU: Is it possible?</p><p>NARDELLI: Setting that aside though, I - I agree with Matt. I think Mary's doing a great job. And it's unfortunate that as she's trying to get her arms around the CEO job that this now will totally consume her. I can tell you preparing for four of these, you are head down, locked up in a room trying to recall and recant everything that's happened during that period. So it certainly takes her off track relative to running the company to get ready for this grilling that will go on today.</p><p>LIU: Well how do you prepare, Bob, for something like this?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well, for me when I was at Chrysler and GM, when we were going through this hearings, it really was heads down, in a conference room with a dozen or so 4 or 5-inch binders going through every document, every email, everything that was turned over to the congressional committees so that you knew you were going to get grilled. They have armies of people going through here looking for questions to try and trip you up. Certainly - and I think will Mary will prepare appropriately for this.</p><p>LIU: Well, getting back though to that - that key question which I'm sure she's going to be asked over and over again is how did you not know, and if you knew, why didn't you do anything about it.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. Again, I don't want to - it's hard for me to predict how that answer will come out. It's - there are situations where things are kept at the very lowest level to avoid disclosure and what have you. I'm not saying that's the case here, but it's possible in an organization of that site that something like this maybe didn't elevate itself to the CEO, which would be unfortunate.</p><p>I think Mary's taken a very positive forward step here in creating the vice president's office for safety. She's met with the families. She's been very forthcoming. She's been very open. You look at the number of documents that have been turned over. I think this is a critical moment for a new CEO, particularly Mary, to do what she's doing. So she - she certainly has broke with tradition, as Matt said, how maybe prior CEOs of various companies would have handled it. So I give her a lot of credit for stepping out.</p><p>LIU: She certainly broke with tradition also with the way how GM has traditionally been run and - and again, as you say, with this whole reorganization that she's going through right now as the CEO. One of the questions we - we were thinking about as we were preparing for the story is what exactly goes into a recall, Bob? You were - you did not oversee any recalls when you were at Chrysler, but - but what happens at a car company? What are the steps that take place until a car company decides, we've got to call these vehicles back?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. One of the things we did when we acquired Chrysler from - from Daimler was we installed a very senior person that has a very successful track record. We were able to recruit him away from Nissan. And we put him in place and we started weekly quality tables. We would go through our tech center. We would find those things that were causing quality problems, performance problems. Obviously if anything would endanger life, then that was escalated.</p><p>So we made it a very important part of our culture. We did about 400 improvements in the first 90 days relative to quality and performance improvements. And I think you just have to instill in the DNA, the culture of the company that market focused, customer centric is critical, particularly if it's endangering lives of your customers.</p><p>LIU: Of course. And at what point do you - as a car company, at what point do you say, you know what? We have to actually issue - issue a notice, right, to our - to our consumers? That's a big decision and it's certainly not one that sheds any positive light on the company. So it's got - there's got to be a lot of thinking obviously behind that.</p><p>NARDELLI: I hope today isn't a case of he said, she said and between General Motors and the National Transportation Safety Board. There ought to be - there ought to be some cooperative tension between those two organizations, not combative. It ought not to be --</p><p>LIU: But is there a notice given to NTSB first?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. There is a requirement that you have to notify them if you start to see fatalities or injuries of that kind. If it's a performance problem it's probably not as critical to get them involved. But obviously if it gets to the point where there are --</p><p>LIU: If we're talking seat belts or airbags or anything like that. OK.</p><p>NARDELLI: Exactly, exactly. Then you're required to notify them and then you want to work in a harmonious way with them, not in a combative way. And I hope this congressional hearing doesn't create that unnecessary tension and we don't get over regulated now. The pendulum tends to swing, as you know, when something like this happens.</p><p>LIU: It does.</p><p>NARDELI: Hopefully we can be constructive. Each of the committees will be - do their diligence and not trying to catch anything in their - in their depositions.</p><p>LIU: Well what about the relationship now between General Motors and the dealerships who now have to handle these recalls and who I'm assuming not happy with the fact that these recalls keep happening and their customers are angry with them?</p><p>NARDELLI: But again, I think Mary has really done a great job for the dealership relative to not creating angst against the brands.</p><p>LIU: Because you've got to take care of the dealerships, right?</p><p>NARDELLI: You must take care of the dealerships. And they're going to have to handle this plethora of recalls. I think it's important to say regardless of how aggressive and forward positioned she is with GM, chances are there's going to be another one. There are millions of cars in the system today. And let's be careful to say we will never have another recall because that is really going to be --</p><p>LIU: It's difficult to make that promise.</p><p>NARDELLI: When you think of the thousands parts and the tier one, tier two, tier suppliers and what goes into assembling a car, it is a huge challenge to make sure everything comes together appropriately.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LIU: I want to bring back <person><nameText>Bob Nardelli, </nameText></person>the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler. Bob, you know this issue inside and out.</p><p>NARDELLI: Very cool.</p><p>LIU: What do you think about what Elon Musk is trying to do?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well on one - in one regard I think he's brilliant. And again, I've --</p><p>LIU: Brilliant for fighting the auto dealers or brilliant for -</p><p>NARDELLI: Well brilliant in his approach. If you think about it, a good friend of mine in Arizona traveled to California.</p><p>LIU: They banned Teslas.</p><p>NARDELLI: They banned it so he couldn't buy it in Arizona. He goes to California, puts his modest $40,000 down payment to hold a slot. Goes back to Arizona. The car is then delivered to him on a flatbed. A technician spends an hour with him going through how to operate it. Fast forward a few months later. Technician calls and says your 12-volt battery is not functioning appropriately. We'll be there to change it.</p><p>So if you think about the era of big data, certainly Tesla, market focused, customer centric in what they're trying to do to penetrate state by state.</p><p>LIU: So it's almost like they've built a customer for life given that kind of service. Hey, that's very tailored here. You can only dream of that with - with a - with a GM car or Toyota car.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. And you think about - Betty, if you think about the business models we have here, certainly Jack Nasser tried this with Ford if you remember in the '90s.</p><p>LIU: The direct sales, right.</p><p>NARDELLI: The direct sales. Why? Because in manufacturing as an OE, you're looking for volume to absorb your fixed overhead, right? We all as - as manufacturers would love to have the margin that you get out of parts and service and used cars. So there was always that little bit of tension to the dealer network. Certainly if you think about the dealers and their franchise agreements state by state, they are - they have tremendous legacy. They are very highly regarded in the states. It's going to be very tough. So I think --</p><p>LIU: They're very powerful.</p><p>NARDELLI: Very powerful. But I think the dealers are approaching this appropriately. Let's not have a massive fight and maybe lose everything. Let's compromise and see what we can get done. And don't forget, for example, Ohio just accepted. So Elon has --</p><p>LIU: Limited, but yes.</p><p>NARDELLI: Limited - has a big trump card, right? I'm going to build a battery plant somewhere and I'm going to do it in a friendly state. But if you look - last night we were talking. There's a study out that showed state by state where he's approved relative to limited show rooms. Some as long as within the MSA no one else is doing it. If you think about Carlos Ghosn at Nissan with the Leaf, he could have taken that approach. But if you look at --</p><p>LIU: Why didn't he?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well, I think he looked at the business model for him and said, I've got all these dealers. I don't have to recreate a service organization. I don't have to spend a lot of capital on tools and facilities and brick and mortar. And - and I will benefit my dealers because I'll draw more traffic into my dealership. So that was the business model he elected as opposed to a startup.</p><p>LIU: Bob, but - but - but this only works though for Elon Musk and Tesla because they only sell less than 30,000 cars. If you're trying to sell 300,000 cars, you can't do that by yourself.</p><p>NARDELLI: The question will be if he grows to 300,000 cars, can he - can his margin cover the infrastructure that he's going to have to create to do the personal service that he's demonstrated? If he can, then he's got a very successful model. The key will be does he have enough margin in the auto to be able to cover those forward costs.</p><p>LIU: But do the automakers - when you were at Chrysler, did you want to sell directly to customers? Is that something that - that actually automakers eventually would like? They're just beholden to this dealership network.</p><p>NARDELLI: I think we all think about that. If you - if you look at what Fiat did, I'm sure Sergio would like to have had a separate dealership or a separate way to go to market on the (inaudible) the 500. What the compromise was, was the dealer had to spend X millions of dollars to create a studio within the current dealership.</p><p>So there's always that thought about we could take care of the customers better. The dealers though have done a remarkable job. I always try to have a great working relationship with those dealers. They are in place. They've invested a lot of capital. They've got tremendous loyalty within the communities. Softball team, political relationships. So it's - it's pretty embedded, Betty.</p><p>LIU: But on a personal front though, most people don't like going to dealerships and buying cars. Maybe on the high end it's a pleasant experience, but for most people it's a terrible experience and they feel like they're being bilked out of lots of dollars. Is there something more that should be done with regulating the dealer?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well there's been many attempts, right? The one price, the national price, the no haggling thing. And maybe Tesla's got it right that it's going to take something as dramatic and revolutionary as what he's trying to do to try to get a compromise. I don't think it's either or. I think in today's digital world you want to have optionality to buy the car the way you want to buy the car.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LIU: I want to bring back my guest host for the hour, <person><nameText>Bob Nardelli, </nameText></person>the former CEO, as we mentioned, of Chrysler and Home Depot. Bob, what's your biggest question just as a private citizen around this healthcare exchange?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well I think - I think a couple of important points. Number one, if you ever wanted to learn how not to introduce a program, this is certainly a role model.</p><p>LIU: This is certainly the case.</p><p>NARDELLI: We were talking upstairs about General Motors. Could you imagine if this was a new platform with this many problems to launch a new car here? So lessons learned here. Program management, oversight, et cetera. Point number one.</p><p>Point number two. There were two very important words used in your exchange. One was visits. The other was enrollment. And having at Home Depot tremendous experience in online sales, we used to track visits, which was important, but most important were orders placed when you put down your hard-earned dollars for a product. So there's a big gap.</p><p>LIU: So you're skeptical of these numbers as well that the - that the government - that the White House is putting out?</p><p>NARDELLI: Depends on what word you're going to use. The visits may be right, but enrollment, if you mean paid, would be another perspective. And as just a common guy, I've gone through this myself with my family.</p><p>LIU: You're not a common guy, Bob?</p><p>NARDELLI: I'm very - I'm just --</p><p>LIU: You're no average Joe, but I get it.</p><p>NARDELLI: - Bob - Bob citizen. And I could tell you it was a harrowing experience to get insurance.</p><p>LIU: Have you tried to sign on - wait. So you tried to sign on to the exchange or your relatives did?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well, so we went through - first of all, we were terminated by - my - my - two of my children were terminated because the insurance company decided not to carry insurance on California. Then we went with the local provider, 30 percent increase first, another 30 percent increase. Then we were notified, two of my children, that they were canceled because the policies that they had didn't meet with the Affordable Care Act government requirements. So then we went back out in trying to find carriers that would --</p><p>LIU: That complied.</p><p>NARDELLI: - that would comply. So directionally, we went from like $160 a month to $600 a month per child with $5,000 deductible. And I can't tell you how many hours we spent trying to secure this.</p><p>LIU: You were shopping around (inaudible) insurance.</p><p>NARDELLI: If you like your doctors - they wanted to keep their doctors. And to do that, that's what we had to go through.</p><p>LIU: So this is - so this experience that you're talking about is exactly why the Republicans are making it a - a focal point of their - of their campaigns come election season, right? Tom Cotton, for instance, who's a Republican congressman in Arkansas, and let's pull up his website, has - when you go to this website - he's running for Senate now?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes.</p><p>LIU: When you go to this website, he says Obamacare is so bad that Obama doesn't want it. And he - he's playing on - on - on essentially the anger among - that he believes voters have against - against Obamacare. Do you think that that is the right strategy? Are there enough Americans who are angry about this?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well let me say this. This is that old phrase politics over policy. I don't think anyone argues with trying to make sure affordable healthcare is available for all US citizens. I think that's an important thing and directionally right. I think it's the implementation. I think it's some of the controversy on how it's happened. I think some of the changing the goal posts as we went along to make sure. I just think there were a number of issues in the implementation that probably could have been better thought out.</p><p>LIU: But how else could it have been done though, Bob?</p><p>NARDELLI: I think certainly - certainly more on a bipartisan basis where we got more people in the room, more than just software developers, that we actually brought people in from the business community. What's the impact? How have you implemented major software changes relative to Ernst &amp; Young does this, S&amp;P does this, and really got more insight on people that have been through this relative to the magnitude of the challenge that has taken place here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LIU: I want to talk more about management because your former boss Jack Welch, who I know you have a very long history with, he actually just wrote this piece that we highlighted yesterday on LinkedIn where he spoke more about management and how to cultivate talent. And he said one of the things he believes companies not - they don't do enough of is they don't pay attention enough to their HR offices. And he was arguing for elevating the HR officer, for instance, to as high a level as a CFO, to be on the senior management team. You agree with this?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah, absolutely. First of all, Jack's a dear friend. He's been a great mentor to me. And obviously I can't thank him enough for the lessons I've learned working for him and being around him.</p><p>LIU: People look to him for management advice.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes, always. He is the guru. So I totally agree with that position. As a matter of fact, when I went to Home Depot one of the first things I did was bring in probably one of the strongest HR chief human resources and we started to put process into place.</p><p>You've got human capital and you got physical capital. A lot of times you'll spend an inordinate amount of analysis on - on the physical capital, and yet it is your human capital that brings that to leaf (ph). So I think the chief human resource officer needs to have an equal share at your staff's roundtable.</p><p>LIU: Which they often don't.</p><p>NARDELLI: Which they don't. They're kind of second tier, back room. But there's nothing more important than talent. If you look at the history of GE and the ability to continue to have extremely strong talent on the bench, as talent left talent replaced it. So I think it's very important.</p><p>LIU: Well speaking about talent, there's so much fight for talent, right, on the West Coast. And there's a great story about how the chamber of commerce decided, hello, they're going to put an office now on the West Coast, that they're going to start transferring some of their resources there. And I imagine this is all also in - in time with the issues of the day, right? Immigration now for Silicon Valley companies, taxes, the privacy issue. And I'm assuming the chamber of commerce feels like, hey, there's a need now for our services.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. I - I think it's an excellent decision by Tom and the chamber. You have to be immersed in the markets and in the environments of the issues so you have a sensitivity and an understanding. Now Tom doesn't have a glass jaw, so as he moves to the West Coast he's going to need all - and muster all -</p><p>LIU: I was going to say, yeah. Because some of their - you've had companies like I believe Yahoo did not renew their membership in the chamber and a couple of other big tech companies because they don't agree with some of the policies by the chamber, the environmental - environmental stance for instance by them. Are they - I'm not expecting a big red carpet rolled out for them.</p><p>NARDELLI: No, I wouldn't. I'm sure they'll move into a facility with high security. But Tom - I think Tom's doing the right thing. I think he's balanced. He's thoughtful in his positions in representing the chamber. He works both sides of the aisle. I think it's important.</p><p>I think that some of these larger corporations that have elected not to participate will rethink that decision because you'd rather be at the table than not at the table. We talked about in the last segment on the Affordable Care Act. So hopefully by them moving out there they're demonstrating their willingness to engage, listen, learn before you lead.</p><p>LIU: All right. Bob, it's been great to have you here this hour.</p><p>NARDELLI: Thank you. It's been great, Betty. Thank you.</p><p>LIU: <person><nameText>Bob Nardelli, </nameText></person>the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler and Home Depot.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

And Bob, by the way, you - you've been in this seat four times --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>ROBERT NARDELLI, </nameText></person>FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, CHRYSLER: Yes, I have. I have.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LIU: - on the Hill.</p><p>NARDELLI: I have. And I think Matt poses probably one of the most challenging questions that Mary will face today. You've been there over 30 years. Is it possible that this never reached your level?</p><p>LIU: Is it possible?</p><p>NARDELLI: Setting that aside though, I - I agree with Matt. I think Mary's doing a great job. And it's unfortunate that as she's trying to get her arms around the CEO job that this now will totally consume her. I can tell you preparing for four of these, you are head down, locked up in a room trying to recall and recant everything that's happened during that period. So it certainly takes her off track relative to running the company to get ready for this grilling that will go on today.</p><p>LIU: Well how do you prepare, Bob, for something like this?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well, for me when I was at Chrysler and GM, when we were going through this hearings, it really was heads down, in a conference room with a dozen or so 4 or 5-inch binders going through every document, every email, everything that was turned over to the congressional committees so that you knew you were going to get grilled. They have armies of people going through here looking for questions to try and trip you up. Certainly - and I think will Mary will prepare appropriately for this.</p><p>LIU: Well, getting back though to that - that key question which I'm sure she's going to be asked over and over again is how did you not know, and if you knew, why didn't you do anything about it.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. Again, I don't want to - it's hard for me to predict how that answer will come out. It's - there are situations where things are kept at the very lowest level to avoid disclosure and what have you. I'm not saying that's the case here, but it's possible in an organization of that site that something like this maybe didn't elevate itself to the CEO, which would be unfortunate.</p><p>I think Mary's taken a very positive forward step here in creating the vice president's office for safety. She's met with the families. She's been very forthcoming. She's been very open. You look at the number of documents that have been turned over. I think this is a critical moment for a new CEO, particularly Mary, to do what she's doing. So she - she certainly has broke with tradition, as Matt said, how maybe prior CEOs of various companies would have handled it. So I give her a lot of credit for stepping out.</p><p>LIU: She certainly broke with tradition also with the way how GM has traditionally been run and - and again, as you say, with this whole reorganization that she's going through right now as the CEO. One of the questions we - we were thinking about as we were preparing for the story is what exactly goes into a recall, Bob? You were - you did not oversee any recalls when you were at Chrysler, but - but what happens at a car company? What are the steps that take place until a car company decides, we've got to call these vehicles back?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. One of the things we did when we acquired Chrysler from - from Daimler was we installed a very senior person that has a very successful track record. We were able to recruit him away from Nissan. And we put him in place and we started weekly quality tables. We would go through our tech center. We would find those things that were causing quality problems, performance problems. Obviously if anything would endanger life, then that was escalated.</p><p>So we made it a very important part of our culture. We did about 400 improvements in the first 90 days relative to quality and performance improvements. And I think you just have to instill in the DNA, the culture of the company that market focused, customer centric is critical, particularly if it's endangering lives of your customers.</p><p>LIU: Of course. And at what point do you - as a car company, at what point do you say, you know what? We have to actually issue - issue a notice, right, to our - to our consumers? That's a big decision and it's certainly not one that sheds any positive light on the company. So it's got - there's got to be a lot of thinking obviously behind that.</p><p>NARDELLI: I hope today isn't a case of he said, she said and between General Motors and the National Transportation Safety Board. There ought to be - there ought to be some cooperative tension between those two organizations, not combative. It ought not to be --</p><p>LIU: But is there a notice given to NTSB first?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. There is a requirement that you have to notify them if you start to see fatalities or injuries of that kind. If it's a performance problem it's probably not as critical to get them involved. But obviously if it gets to the point where there are --</p><p>LIU: If we're talking seat belts or airbags or anything like that. OK.</p><p>NARDELLI: Exactly, exactly. Then you're required to notify them and then you want to work in a harmonious way with them, not in a combative way. And I hope this congressional hearing doesn't create that unnecessary tension and we don't get over regulated now. The pendulum tends to swing, as you know, when something like this happens.</p><p>LIU: It does.</p><p>NARDELI: Hopefully we can be constructive. Each of the committees will be - do their diligence and not trying to catch anything in their - in their depositions.</p><p>LIU: Well what about the relationship now between General Motors and the dealerships who now have to handle these recalls and who I'm assuming not happy with the fact that these recalls keep happening and their customers are angry with them?</p><p>NARDELLI: But again, I think Mary has really done a great job for the dealership relative to not creating angst against the brands.</p><p>LIU: Because you've got to take care of the dealerships, right?</p><p>NARDELLI: You must take care of the dealerships. And they're going to have to handle this plethora of recalls. I think it's important to say regardless of how aggressive and forward positioned she is with GM, chances are there's going to be another one. There are millions of cars in the system today. And let's be careful to say we will never have another recall because that is really going to be --</p><p>LIU: It's difficult to make that promise.</p><p>NARDELLI: When you think of the thousands parts and the tier one, tier two, tier suppliers and what goes into assembling a car, it is a huge challenge to make sure everything comes together appropriately.</p><p>LIU: I want to bring back <person><nameText>Bob Nardelli, </nameText></person>the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler. Bob, you know this issue inside and out.</p><p>NARDELLI: Very cool.</p><p>LIU: What do you think about what Elon Musk is trying to do?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well on one - in one regard I think he's brilliant. And again, I've --</p><p>LIU: Brilliant for fighting the auto dealers or brilliant for -</p><p>NARDELLI: Well brilliant in his approach. If you think about it, a good friend of mine in Arizona traveled to California.</p><p>LIU: They banned Teslas.</p><p>NARDELLI: They banned it so he couldn't buy it in Arizona. He goes to California, puts his modest $40,000 down payment to hold a slot. Goes back to Arizona. The car is then delivered to him on a flatbed. A technician spends an hour with him going through how to operate it. Fast forward a few months later. Technician calls and says your 12-volt battery is not functioning appropriately. We'll be there to change it.</p><p>So if you think about the era of big data, certainly Tesla, market focused, customer centric in what they're trying to do to penetrate state by state.</p><p>LIU: So it's almost like they've built a customer for life given that kind of service. Hey, that's very tailored here. You can only dream of that with - with a - with a GM car or Toyota car.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. And you think about - Betty, if you think about the business models we have here, certainly Jack Nasser tried this with Ford if you remember in the '90s.</p><p>LIU: The direct sales, right.</p><p>NARDELLI: The direct sales. Why? Because in manufacturing as an OE, you're looking for volume to absorb your fixed overhead, right? We all as - as manufacturers would love to have the margin that you get out of parts and service and used cars. So there was always that little bit of tension to the dealer network. Certainly if you think about the dealers and their franchise agreements state by state, they are - they have tremendous legacy. They are very highly regarded in the states. It's going to be very tough. So I think --</p><p>LIU: They're very powerful.</p><p>NARDELLI: Very powerful. But I think the dealers are approaching this appropriately. Let's not have a massive fight and maybe lose everything. Let's compromise and see what we can get done. And don't forget, for example, Ohio just accepted. So Elon has --</p><p>LIU: Limited, but yes.</p><p>NARDELLI: Limited - has a big trump card, right? I'm going to build a battery plant somewhere and I'm going to do it in a friendly state. But if you look - last night we were talking. There's a study out that showed state by state where he's approved relative to limited show rooms. Some as long as within the MSA no one else is doing it. If you think about Carlos Ghosn at Nissan with the Leaf, he could have taken that approach. But if you look at --</p><p>LIU: Why didn't he?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well, I think he looked at the business model for him and said, I've got all these dealers. I don't have to recreate a service organization. I don't have to spend a lot of capital on tools and facilities and brick and mortar. And - and I will benefit my dealers because I'll draw more traffic into my dealership. So that was the business model he elected as opposed to a startup.</p><p>LIU: Bob, but - but - but this only works though for Elon Musk and Tesla because they only sell less than 30,000 cars. If you're trying to sell 300,000 cars, you can't do that by yourself.</p><p>NARDELLI: The question will be if he grows to 300,000 cars, can he - can his margin cover the infrastructure that he's going to have to create to do the personal service that he's demonstrated? If he can, then he's got a very successful model. The key will be does he have enough margin in the auto to be able to cover those forward costs.</p><p>LIU: But do the automakers - when you were at Chrysler, did you want to sell directly to customers? Is that something that - that actually automakers eventually would like? They're just beholden to this dealership network.</p><p>NARDELLI: I think we all think about that. If you - if you look at what Fiat did, I'm sure Sergio would like to have had a separate dealership or a separate way to go to market on the (inaudible) the 500. What the compromise was, was the dealer had to spend X millions of dollars to create a studio within the current dealership.</p><p>So there's always that thought about we could take care of the customers better. The dealers though have done a remarkable job. I always try to have a great working relationship with those dealers. They are in place. They've invested a lot of capital. They've got tremendous loyalty within the communities. Softball team, political relationships. So it's - it's pretty embedded, Betty.</p><p>LIU: But on a personal front though, most people don't like going to dealerships and buying cars. Maybe on the high end it's a pleasant experience, but for most people it's a terrible experience and they feel like they're being bilked out of lots of dollars. Is there something more that should be done with regulating the dealer?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well there's been many attempts, right? The one price, the national price, the no haggling thing. And maybe Tesla's got it right that it's going to take something as dramatic and revolutionary as what he's trying to do to try to get a compromise. I don't think it's either or. I think in today's digital world you want to have optionality to buy the car the way you want to buy the car.</p><p>LIU: I want to bring back my guest host for the hour, <person><nameText>Bob Nardelli, </nameText></person>the former CEO, as we mentioned, of Chrysler and Home Depot. Bob, what's your biggest question just as a private citizen around this healthcare exchange?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well I think - I think a couple of important points. Number one, if you ever wanted to learn how not to introduce a program, this is certainly a role model.</p><p>LIU: This is certainly the case.</p><p>NARDELLI: We were talking upstairs about General Motors. Could you imagine if this was a new platform with this many problems to launch a new car here? So lessons learned here. Program management, oversight, et cetera. Point number one.</p><p>Point number two. There were two very important words used in your exchange. One was visits. The other was enrollment. And having at Home Depot tremendous experience in online sales, we used to track visits, which was important, but most important were orders placed when you put down your hard-earned dollars for a product. So there's a big gap.</p><p>LIU: So you're skeptical of these numbers as well that the - that the government - that the White House is putting out?</p><p>NARDELLI: Depends on what word you're going to use. The visits may be right, but enrollment, if you mean paid, would be another perspective. And as just a common guy, I've gone through this myself with my family.</p><p>LIU: You're not a common guy, Bob?</p><p>NARDELLI: I'm very - I'm just --</p><p>LIU: You're no average Joe, but I get it.</p><p>NARDELLI: - Bob - Bob citizen. And I could tell you it was a harrowing experience to get insurance.</p><p>LIU: Have you tried to sign on - wait. So you tried to sign on to the exchange or your relatives did?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well, so we went through - first of all, we were terminated by - my - my - two of my children were terminated because the insurance company decided not to carry insurance on California. Then we went with the local provider, 30 percent increase first, another 30 percent increase. Then we were notified, two of my children, that they were canceled because the policies that they had didn't meet with the Affordable Care Act government requirements. So then we went back out in trying to find carriers that would --</p><p>LIU: That complied.</p><p>NARDELLI: - that would comply. So directionally, we went from like $160 a month to $600 a month per child with $5,000 deductible. And I can't tell you how many hours we spent trying to secure this.</p><p>LIU: You were shopping around (inaudible) insurance.</p><p>NARDELLI: If you like your doctors - they wanted to keep their doctors. And to do that, that's what we had to go through.</p><p>LIU: So this is - so this experience that you're talking about is exactly why the Republicans are making it a - a focal point of their - of their campaigns come election season, right? Tom Cotton, for instance, who's a Republican congressman in Arkansas, and let's pull up his website, has - when you go to this website - he's running for Senate now?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes.</p><p>LIU: When you go to this website, he says Obamacare is so bad that Obama doesn't want it. And he - he's playing on - on - on essentially the anger among - that he believes voters have against - against Obamacare. Do you think that that is the right strategy? Are there enough Americans who are angry about this?</p><p>NARDELLI: Well let me say this. This is that old phrase politics over policy. I don't think anyone argues with trying to make sure affordable healthcare is available for all US citizens. I think that's an important thing and directionally right. I think it's the implementation. I think it's some of the controversy on how it's happened. I think some of the changing the goal posts as we went along to make sure. I just think there were a number of issues in the implementation that probably could have been better thought out.</p><p>LIU: But how else could it have been done though, Bob?</p><p>NARDELLI: I think certainly - certainly more on a bipartisan basis where we got more people in the room, more than just software developers, that we actually brought people in from the business community. What's the impact? How have you implemented major software changes relative to Ernst &amp; Young does this, S&amp;P does this, and really got more insight on people that have been through this relative to the magnitude of the challenge that has taken place here.</p><p>LIU: I want to talk more about management because your former boss Jack Welch, who I know you have a very long history with, he actually just wrote this piece that we highlighted yesterday on LinkedIn where he spoke more about management and how to cultivate talent. And he said one of the things he believes companies not - they don't do enough of is they don't pay attention enough to their HR offices. And he was arguing for elevating the HR officer, for instance, to as high a level as a CFO, to be on the senior management team. You agree with this?</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah, absolutely. First of all, Jack's a dear friend. He's been a great mentor to me. And obviously I can't thank him enough for the lessons I've learned working for him and being around him.</p><p>LIU: People look to him for management advice.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes, always. He is the guru. So I totally agree with that position. As a matter of fact, when I went to Home Depot one of the first things I did was bring in probably one of the strongest HR chief human resources and we started to put process into place.</p><p>You've got human capital and you got physical capital. A lot of times you'll spend an inordinate amount of analysis on - on the physical capital, and yet it is your human capital that brings that to leaf (ph). So I think the chief human resource officer needs to have an equal share at your staff's roundtable.</p><p>LIU: Which they often don't.</p><p>NARDELLI: Which they don't. They're kind of second tier, back room. But there's nothing more important than talent. If you look at the history of GE and the ability to continue to have extremely strong talent on the bench, as talent left talent replaced it. So I think it's very important.</p><p>LIU: Well speaking about talent, there's so much fight for talent, right, on the West Coast. And there's a great story about how the chamber of commerce decided, hello, they're going to put an office now on the West Coast, that they're going to start transferring some of their resources there. And I imagine this is all also in - in time with the issues of the day, right? Immigration now for Silicon Valley companies, taxes, the privacy issue. And I'm assuming the chamber of commerce feels like, hey, there's a need now for our services.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. I - I think it's an excellent decision by Tom and the chamber. You have to be immersed in the markets and in the environments of the issues so you have a sensitivity and an understanding. Now Tom doesn't have a glass jaw, so as he moves to the West Coast he's going to need all - and muster all -</p><p>LIU: I was going to say, yeah. Because some of their - you've had companies like I believe Yahoo did not renew their membership in the chamber and a couple of other big tech companies because they don't agree with some of the policies by the chamber, the environmental - environmental stance for instance by them. Are they - I'm not expecting a big red carpet rolled out for them.</p><p>NARDELLI: No, I wouldn't. I'm sure they'll move into a facility with high security. But Tom - I think Tom's doing the right thing. I think he's balanced. He's thoughtful in his positions in representing the chamber. He works both sides of the aisle. I think it's important.</p><p>I think that some of these larger corporations that have elected not to participate will rethink that decision because you'd rather be at the table than not at the table. We talked about in the last segment on the Affordable Care Act. So hopefully by them moving out there they're demonstrating their willingness to engage, listen, learn before you lead.</p><p>LIU: All right. Bob, it's been great to have you here this hour.</p><p>NARDELLI: Thank you. It's been great, Betty. Thank you.</p><p>LIU: <person><nameText>Bob Nardelli, </nameText></person>the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler and Home Depot.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

And Bob, by the way, you - you've been in this seat four times --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>ROBERT NARDELLI, </nameText></person>FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, CHRYSLER: Yes, I have. I have.</p><p/><p>LIU: - on the Hill.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: I have. And I think Matt poses probably one of the most challenging questions that Mary will face today. You've been there over 30 years. Is it possible that this never reached your level?</p><p/><p>LIU: Is it possible?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Setting that aside though, I - I agree with Matt. I think Mary's doing a great job. And it's unfortunate that as she's trying to get her arms around the CEO job that this now will totally consume her. I can tell you preparing for four of these, you are head down, locked up in a room trying to recall and recant everything that's happened during that period. So it certainly takes her off track relative to running the company to get ready for this grilling that will go on today.</p><p/><p>LIU: Well how do you prepare, Bob, for something like this?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Well, for me when I was at Chrysler and GM, when we were going through this hearings, it really was heads down, in a conference room with a dozen or so 4 or 5-inch binders going through every document, every email, everything that was turned over to the congressional committees so that you knew you were going to get grilled. They have armies of people going through here looking for questions to try and trip you up. Certainly - and I think will Mary will prepare appropriately for this.</p><p/><p>LIU: Well, getting back though to that - that key question which I'm sure she's going to be asked over and over again is how did you not know, and if you knew, why didn't you do anything about it.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. Again, I don't want to - it's hard for me to predict how that answer will come out. It's - there are situations where things are kept at the very lowest level to avoid disclosure and what have you. I'm not saying that's the case here, but it's possible in an organization of that site that something like this maybe didn't elevate itself to the CEO, which would be unfortunate.</p><p/><p>I think Mary's taken a very positive forward step here in creating the vice president's office for safety. She's met with the families. She's been very forthcoming. She's been very open. You look at the number of documents that have been turned over. I think this is a critical moment for a new CEO, particularly Mary, to do what she's doing. So she - she certainly has broke with tradition, as Matt said, how maybe prior CEOs of various companies would have handled it. So I give her a lot of credit for stepping out.</p><p/><p>LIU: She certainly broke with tradition also with the way how GM has traditionally been run and - and again, as you say, with this whole reorganization that she's going through right now as the CEO. One of the questions we - we were thinking about as we were preparing for the story is what exactly goes into a recall, Bob? You were - you did not oversee any recalls when you were at Chrysler, but - but what happens at a car company? What are the steps that take place until a car company decides, we've got to call these vehicles back?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. One of the things we did when we acquired Chrysler from - from Daimler was we installed a very senior person that has a very successful track record. We were able to recruit him away from Nissan. And we put him in place and we started weekly quality tables. We would go through our tech center. We would find those things that were causing quality problems, performance problems. Obviously if anything would endanger life, then that was escalated.</p><p/><p>So we made it a very important part of our culture. We did about 400 improvements in the first 90 days relative to quality and performance improvements. And I think you just have to instill in the DNA, the culture of the company that market focused, customer centric is critical, particularly if it's endangering lives of your customers.</p><p/><p>LIU: Of course. And at what point do you - as a car company, at what point do you say, you know what? We have to actually issue - issue a notice, right, to our - to our consumers? That's a big decision and it's certainly not one that sheds any positive light on the company. So it's got - there's got to be a lot of thinking obviously behind that.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: I hope today isn't a case of he said, she said and between General Motors and the National Transportation Safety Board. There ought to be - there ought to be some cooperative tension between those two organizations, not combative. It ought not to be --</p><p/><p>LIU: But is there a notice given to NTSB first?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. There is a requirement that you have to notify them if you start to see fatalities or injuries of that kind. If it's a performance problem it's probably not as critical to get them involved. But obviously if it gets to the point where there are --</p><p/><p>LIU: If we're talking seat belts or airbags or anything like that. OK.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Exactly, exactly. Then you're required to notify them and then you want to work in a harmonious way with them, not in a combative way. And I hope this congressional hearing doesn't create that unnecessary tension and we don't get over regulated now. The pendulum tends to swing, as you know, when something like this happens.</p><p/><p>LIU: It does.</p><p/><p>NARDELI: Hopefully we can be constructive. Each of the committees will be - do their diligence and not trying to catch anything in their - in their depositions.</p><p/><p>LIU: Well what about the relationship now between General Motors and the dealerships who now have to handle these recalls and who I'm assuming not happy with the fact that these recalls keep happening and their customers are angry with them?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: But again, I think Mary has really done a great job for the dealership relative to not creating angst against the brands.</p><p/><p>LIU: Because you've got to take care of the dealerships, right?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: You must take care of the dealerships. And they're going to have to handle this plethora of recalls. I think it's important to say regardless of how aggressive and forward positioned she is with GM, chances are there's going to be another one. There are millions of cars in the system today. And let's be careful to say we will never have another recall because that is really going to be --</p><p/><p>LIU: It's difficult to make that promise.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: When you think of the thousands parts and the tier one, tier two, tier suppliers and what goes into assembling a car, it is a huge challenge to make sure everything comes together appropriately.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>LIU: I want to bring back <person><nameText>Bob Nardelli, </nameText></person>the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler. Bob, you know this issue inside and out.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Very cool.</p><p/><p>LIU: What do you think about what Elon Musk is trying to do?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Well on one - in one regard I think he's brilliant. And again, I've --</p><p/><p>LIU: Brilliant for fighting the auto dealers or brilliant for -</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Well brilliant in his approach. If you think about it, a good friend of mine in Arizona traveled to California.</p><p/><p>LIU: They banned Teslas.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: They banned it so he couldn't buy it in Arizona. He goes to California, puts his modest $40,000 down payment to hold a slot. Goes back to Arizona. The car is then delivered to him on a flatbed. A technician spends an hour with him going through how to operate it. Fast forward a few months later. Technician calls and says your 12-volt battery is not functioning appropriately. We'll be there to change it.</p><p/><p>So if you think about the era of big data, certainly Tesla, market focused, customer centric in what they're trying to do to penetrate state by state.</p><p/><p>LIU: So it's almost like they've built a customer for life given that kind of service. Hey, that's very tailored here. You can only dream of that with - with a - with a GM car or Toyota car.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. And you think about - Betty, if you think about the business models we have here, certainly Jack Nasser tried this with Ford if you remember in the '90s.</p><p/><p>LIU: The direct sales, right.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: The direct sales. Why? Because in manufacturing as an OE, you're looking for volume to absorb your fixed overhead, right? We all as - as manufacturers would love to have the margin that you get out of parts and service and used cars. So there was always that little bit of tension to the dealer network. Certainly if you think about the dealers and their franchise agreements state by state, they are - they have tremendous legacy. They are very highly regarded in the states. It's going to be very tough. So I think --</p><p/><p>LIU: They're very powerful.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Very powerful. But I think the dealers are approaching this appropriately. Let's not have a massive fight and maybe lose everything. Let's compromise and see what we can get done. And don't forget, for example, Ohio just accepted. So Elon has --</p><p/><p>LIU: Limited, but yes.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Limited - has a big trump card, right? I'm going to build a battery plant somewhere and I'm going to do it in a friendly state. But if you look - last night we were talking. There's a study out that showed state by state where he's approved relative to limited show rooms. Some as long as within the MSA no one else is doing it. If you think about Carlos Ghosn at Nissan with the Leaf, he could have taken that approach. But if you look at --</p><p/><p>LIU: Why didn't he?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Well, I think he looked at the business model for him and said, I've got all these dealers. I don't have to recreate a service organization. I don't have to spend a lot of capital on tools and facilities and brick and mortar. And - and I will benefit my dealers because I'll draw more traffic into my dealership. So that was the business model he elected as opposed to a startup.</p><p/><p>LIU: Bob, but - but - but this only works though for Elon Musk and Tesla because they only sell less than 30,000 cars. If you're trying to sell 300,000 cars, you can't do that by yourself.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: The question will be if he grows to 300,000 cars, can he - can his margin cover the infrastructure that he's going to have to create to do the personal service that he's demonstrated? If he can, then he's got a very successful model. The key will be does he have enough margin in the auto to be able to cover those forward costs.</p><p/><p>LIU: But do the automakers - when you were at Chrysler, did you want to sell directly to customers? Is that something that - that actually automakers eventually would like? They're just beholden to this dealership network.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: I think we all think about that. If you - if you look at what Fiat did, I'm sure Sergio would like to have had a separate dealership or a separate way to go to market on the (inaudible) the 500. What the compromise was, was the dealer had to spend X millions of dollars to create a studio within the current dealership.</p><p/><p>So there's always that thought about we could take care of the customers better. The dealers though have done a remarkable job. I always try to have a great working relationship with those dealers. They are in place. They've invested a lot of capital. They've got tremendous loyalty within the communities. Softball team, political relationships. So it's - it's pretty embedded, Betty.</p><p/><p>LIU: But on a personal front though, most people don't like going to dealerships and buying cars. Maybe on the high end it's a pleasant experience, but for most people it's a terrible experience and they feel like they're being bilked out of lots of dollars. Is there something more that should be done with regulating the dealer?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Well there's been many attempts, right? The one price, the national price, the no haggling thing. And maybe Tesla's got it right that it's going to take something as dramatic and revolutionary as what he's trying to do to try to get a compromise. I don't think it's either or. I think in today's digital world you want to have optionality to buy the car the way you want to buy the car.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>LIU: I want to bring back my guest host for the hour, <person><nameText>Bob Nardelli, </nameText></person>the former CEO, as we mentioned, of Chrysler and Home Depot. Bob, what's your biggest question just as a private citizen around this healthcare exchange?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Well I think - I think a couple of important points. Number one, if you ever wanted to learn how not to introduce a program, this is certainly a role model.</p><p/><p>LIU: This is certainly the case.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: We were talking upstairs about General Motors. Could you imagine if this was a new platform with this many problems to launch a new car here? So lessons learned here. Program management, oversight, et cetera. Point number one.</p><p/><p>Point number two. There were two very important words used in your exchange. One was visits. The other was enrollment. And having at Home Depot tremendous experience in online sales, we used to track visits, which was important, but most important were orders placed when you put down your hard-earned dollars for a product. So there's a big gap.</p><p/><p>LIU: So you're skeptical of these numbers as well that the - that the government - that the White House is putting out?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Depends on what word you're going to use. The visits may be right, but enrollment, if you mean paid, would be another perspective. And as just a common guy, I've gone through this myself with my family.</p><p/><p>LIU: You're not a common guy, Bob?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: I'm very - I'm just --</p><p/><p>LIU: You're no average Joe, but I get it.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: - Bob - Bob citizen. And I could tell you it was a harrowing experience to get insurance.</p><p/><p>LIU: Have you tried to sign on - wait. So you tried to sign on to the exchange or your relatives did?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Well, so we went through - first of all, we were terminated by - my - my - two of my children were terminated because the insurance company decided not to carry insurance on California. Then we went with the local provider, 30 percent increase first, another 30 percent increase. Then we were notified, two of my children, that they were canceled because the policies that they had didn't meet with the Affordable Care Act government requirements. So then we went back out in trying to find carriers that would --</p><p/><p>LIU: That complied.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: - that would comply. So directionally, we went from like $160 a month to $600 a month per child with $5,000 deductible. And I can't tell you how many hours we spent trying to secure this.</p><p/><p>LIU: You were shopping around (inaudible) insurance.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: If you like your doctors - they wanted to keep their doctors. And to do that, that's what we had to go through.</p><p/><p>LIU: So this is - so this experience that you're talking about is exactly why the Republicans are making it a - a focal point of their - of their campaigns come election season, right? Tom Cotton, for instance, who's a Republican congressman in Arkansas, and let's pull up his website, has - when you go to this website - he's running for Senate now?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Yes.</p><p/><p>LIU: When you go to this website, he says Obamacare is so bad that Obama doesn't want it. And he - he's playing on - on - on essentially the anger among - that he believes voters have against - against Obamacare. Do you think that that is the right strategy? Are there enough Americans who are angry about this?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Well let me say this. This is that old phrase politics over policy. I don't think anyone argues with trying to make sure affordable healthcare is available for all US citizens. I think that's an important thing and directionally right. I think it's the implementation. I think it's some of the controversy on how it's happened. I think some of the changing the goal posts as we went along to make sure. I just think there were a number of issues in the implementation that probably could have been better thought out.</p><p/><p>LIU: But how else could it have been done though, Bob?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: I think certainly - certainly more on a bipartisan basis where we got more people in the room, more than just software developers, that we actually brought people in from the business community. What's the impact? How have you implemented major software changes relative to Ernst &amp; Young does this, S&amp;P does this, and really got more insight on people that have been through this relative to the magnitude of the challenge that has taken place here.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>LIU: I want to talk more about management because your former boss Jack Welch, who I know you have a very long history with, he actually just wrote this piece that we highlighted yesterday on LinkedIn where he spoke more about management and how to cultivate talent. And he said one of the things he believes companies not - they don't do enough of is they don't pay attention enough to their HR offices. And he was arguing for elevating the HR officer, for instance, to as high a level as a CFO, to be on the senior management team. You agree with this?</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Yeah, absolutely. First of all, Jack's a dear friend. He's been a great mentor to me. And obviously I can't thank him enough for the lessons I've learned working for him and being around him.</p><p/><p>LIU: People look to him for management advice.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Yes, always. He is the guru. So I totally agree with that position. As a matter of fact, when I went to Home Depot one of the first things I did was bring in probably one of the strongest HR chief human resources and we started to put process into place.</p><p/><p>You've got human capital and you got physical capital. A lot of times you'll spend an inordinate amount of analysis on - on the physical capital, and yet it is your human capital that brings that to leaf (ph). So I think the chief human resource officer needs to have an equal share at your staff's roundtable.</p><p/><p>LIU: Which they often don't.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Which they don't. They're kind of second tier, back room. But there's nothing more important than talent. If you look at the history of GE and the ability to continue to have extremely strong talent on the bench, as talent left talent replaced it. So I think it's very important.</p><p/><p>LIU: Well speaking about talent, there's so much fight for talent, right, on the West Coast. And there's a great story about how the chamber of commerce decided, hello, they're going to put an office now on the West Coast, that they're going to start transferring some of their resources there. And I imagine this is all also in - in time with the issues of the day, right? Immigration now for Silicon Valley companies, taxes, the privacy issue. And I'm assuming the chamber of commerce feels like, hey, there's a need now for our services.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Yeah. I - I think it's an excellent decision by Tom and the chamber. You have to be immersed in the markets and in the environments of the issues so you have a sensitivity and an understanding. Now Tom doesn't have a glass jaw, so as he moves to the West Coast he's going to need all - and muster all -</p><p/><p>LIU: I was going to say, yeah. Because some of their - you've had companies like I believe Yahoo did not renew their membership in the chamber and a couple of other big tech companies because they don't agree with some of the policies by the chamber, the environmental - environmental stance for instance by them. Are they - I'm not expecting a big red carpet rolled out for them.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: No, I wouldn't. I'm sure they'll move into a facility with high security. But Tom - I think Tom's doing the right thing. I think he's balanced. He's thoughtful in his positions in representing the chamber. He works both sides of the aisle. I think it's important.</p><p/><p>I think that some of these larger corporations that have elected not to participate will rethink that decision because you'd rather be at the table than not at the table. We talked about in the last segment on the Affordable Care Act. So hopefully by them moving out there they're demonstrating their willingness to engage, listen, learn before you lead.</p><p/><p>LIU: All right. Bob, it's been great to have you here this hour.</p><p/><p>NARDELLI: Thank you. It's been great, Betty. Thank you.</p><p/><p>LIU: <person><nameText>Bob Nardelli, </nameText></person>the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler and Home Depot.</p><p/><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p/><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BETTY LIU, HOST, BLOOMBERG NEWS: That's a great segue into Bob Nardelli,  who is the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler. And Bob, by the way, you -  you've been in this seat four times --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> ROBERT NARDELLI, FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, CHRYSLER: Yes, I have. I have.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> LIU: - on the Hill.</p><p> NARDELLI: I have. And I think Matt poses probably one of the most  challenging questions that Mary will face today. You've been there over 30  years. Is it possible that this never reached your level?</p><p> LIU: Is it possible? </p><p> NARDELLI: Setting that aside though, I - I agree with Matt. I think Mary's  doing a great job. And it's unfortunate that as she's trying to get her  arms around the CEO job that this now will totally consume her. I can tell  you preparing for four of these, you are head down, locked up in a room  trying to recall and recant everything that's happened during that period.  So it certainly takes her off track relative to running the company to get  ready for this grilling that will go on today.</p><p> LIU: Well how do you prepare, Bob, for something like this?</p><p> NARDELLI: Well, for me when I was at Chrysler and GM, when we were going  through this hearings, it really was heads down, in a conference room with  a dozen or so 4 or 5-inch binders going through every document, every  email, everything that was turned over to the congressional committees so  that you knew you were going to get grilled. They have armies of people  going through here looking for questions to try and trip you up. Certainly  - and I think will Mary will prepare appropriately for this.</p><p> LIU: Well, getting back though to that - that key question which I'm sure  she's going to be asked over and over again is how did you not know, and if  you knew, why didn't you do anything about it.</p><p> NARDELLI: Yeah. Again, I don't want to - it's hard for me to predict how  that answer will come out. It's - there are situations where things are  kept at the very lowest level to avoid disclosure and what have you. I'm  not saying that's the case here, but it's possible in an organization of  that site that something like this maybe didn't elevate itself to the CEO,  which would be unfortunate. </p><p> I think Mary's taken a very positive forward step here in creating the vice  president's office for safety. She's met with the families. She's been very  forthcoming. She's been very open. You look at the number of documents that  have been turned over. I think this is a critical moment for a new CEO,  particularly Mary, to do what she's doing. So she - she certainly has broke  with tradition, as Matt said, how maybe prior CEOs of various companies  would have handled it. So I give her a lot of credit for stepping out.</p><p> LIU: She certainly broke with tradition also with the way how GM has  traditionally been run and - and again, as you say, with this whole  reorganization that she's going through right now as the CEO. One of the  questions we - we were thinking about as we were preparing for the story is  what exactly goes into a recall, Bob? You were - you did not oversee any  recalls when you were at Chrysler, but - but what happens at a car company?  What are the steps that take place until a car company decides, we've got  to call these vehicles back?</p><p> NARDELLI: Yeah. One of the things we did when we acquired Chrysler from -  from Daimler was we installed a very senior person that has a very  successful track record. We were able to recruit him away from Nissan. And  we put him in place and we started weekly quality tables. We would go  through our tech center. We would find those things that were causing  quality problems, performance problems. Obviously if anything would  endanger life, then that was escalated. </p><p> So we made it a very important part of our culture. We did about 400  improvements in the first 90 days relative to quality and performance  improvements. And I think you just have to instill in the DNA, the culture  of the company that market focused, customer centric is critical,  particularly if it's endangering lives of your customers.</p><p> LIU: Of course. And at what point do you - as a car company, at what point  do you say, you know what? We have to actually issue - issue a notice,  right, to our - to our consumers? That's a big decision and it's certainly  not one that sheds any positive light on the company. So it's got - there's  got to be a lot of thinking obviously behind that.</p><p> NARDELLI: I hope today isn't a case of he said, she said and between  General Motors and the National Transportation Safety Board. There ought to  be - there ought to be some cooperative tension between those two  organizations, not combative. It ought not to be --</p><p> LIU: But is there a notice given to NTSB first? </p><p> NARDELLI: Yeah. There is a requirement that you have to notify them if you  start to see fatalities or injuries of that kind. If it's a performance  problem it's probably not as critical to get them involved. But obviously  if it gets to the point where there are --</p><p> LIU: If we're talking seat belts or airbags or anything like that. OK.</p><p> NARDELLI: Exactly, exactly. Then you're required to notify them and then  you want to work in a harmonious way with them, not in a combative way. And  I hope this congressional hearing doesn't create that unnecessary tension  and we don't get over regulated now. The pendulum tends to swing, as you  know, when something like this happens.</p><p> LIU: It does.</p><p> NARDELI: Hopefully we can be constructive. Each of the committees will be -  do their diligence and not trying to catch anything in their - in their  depositions.</p><p> LIU: Well what about the relationship now between General Motors and the  dealerships who now have to handle these recalls and who I'm assuming not  happy with the fact that these recalls keep happening and their customers  are angry with them?</p><p> NARDELLI: But again, I think Mary has really done a great job for the  dealership relative to not creating angst against the brands.</p><p> LIU: Because you've got to take care of the dealerships, right?</p><p> NARDELLI: You must take care of the dealerships. And they're going to have  to handle this plethora of recalls. I think it's important to say  regardless of how aggressive and forward positioned she is with GM, chances  are there's going to be another one. There are millions of cars in the  system today. And let's be careful to say we will never have another recall  because that is really going to be --</p><p> LIU: It's difficult to make that promise.</p><p> NARDELLI: When you think of the thousands parts and the tier one, tier two,  tier suppliers and what goes into assembling a car, it is a huge challenge  to make sure everything comes together appropriately.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> LIU: I want to bring back Bob Nardelli, the former chairman and CEO of  Chrysler. Bob, you know this issue inside and out. </p><p> NARDELLI: Very cool.</p><p> LIU: What do you think about what Elon Musk is trying to do?</p><p> NARDELLI: Well on one - in one regard I think he's brilliant. And again,  I've --</p><p> LIU: Brilliant for fighting the auto dealers or brilliant for - </p><p> NARDELLI: Well brilliant in his approach. If you think about it, a good  friend of mine in Arizona traveled to California.</p><p> LIU: They banned Teslas.</p><p> NARDELLI: They banned it so he couldn't buy it in Arizona. He goes to  California, puts his modest $40,000 down payment to hold a slot. Goes back  to Arizona. The car is then delivered to him on a flatbed. A technician  spends an hour with him going through how to operate it. Fast forward a few  months later. Technician calls and says your 12-volt battery is not  functioning appropriately. We'll be there to change it.</p><p> So if you think about the era of big data, certainly Tesla, market focused,  customer centric in what they're trying to do to penetrate state by state.</p><p> LIU: So it's almost like they've built a customer for life given that kind  of service. Hey, that's very tailored here. You can only dream of that with  - with a - with a GM car or Toyota car.</p><p> NARDELLI: Yeah. And you think about - Betty, if you think about the  business models we have here, certainly Jack Nasser tried this with Ford if  you remember in the '90s.</p><p> LIU: The direct sales, right.</p><p> NARDELLI: The direct sales. Why? Because in manufacturing as an OE, you're  looking for volume to absorb your fixed overhead, right? We all as - as  manufacturers would love to have the margin that you get out of parts and  service and used cars. So there was always that little bit of tension to  the dealer network. Certainly if you think about the dealers and their  franchise agreements state by state, they are - they have tremendous  legacy. They are very highly regarded in the states. It's going to be very  tough. So I think --</p><p> LIU: They're very powerful.</p><p> NARDELLI: Very powerful. But I think the dealers are approaching this  appropriately. Let's not have a massive fight and maybe lose everything.  Let's compromise and see what we can get done. And don't forget, for  example, Ohio just accepted. So Elon has --</p><p> LIU: Limited, but yes.</p><p> NARDELLI: Limited - has a big trump card, right? I'm going to build a  battery plant somewhere and I'm going to do it in a friendly state. But if  you look - last night we were talking. There's a study out that showed  state by state where he's approved relative to limited show rooms. Some as  long as within the MSA no one else is doing it. If you think about Carlos  Ghosn at Nissan with the Leaf, he could have taken that approach. But if  you look at --</p><p> LIU: Why didn't he?</p><p> NARDELLI: Well, I think he looked at the business model for him and said,  I've got all these dealers. I don't have to recreate a service  organization. I don't have to spend a lot of capital on tools and  facilities and brick and mortar. And - and I will benefit my dealers  because I'll draw more traffic into my dealership. So that was the business  model he elected as opposed to a startup.</p><p> LIU: Bob, but - but - but this only works though for Elon Musk and Tesla  because they only sell less than 30,000 cars. If you're trying to sell  300,000 cars, you can't do that by yourself.</p><p> NARDELLI: The question will be if he grows to 300,000 cars, can he - can  his margin cover the infrastructure that he's going to have to create to do  the personal service that he's demonstrated? If he can, then he's got a  very successful model. The key will be does he have enough margin in the  auto to be able to cover those forward costs.</p><p> LIU: But do the automakers - when you were at Chrysler, did you want to  sell directly to customers? Is that something that - that actually  automakers eventually would like? They're just beholden to this dealership  network.</p><p> NARDELLI: I think we all think about that. If you - if you look at what  Fiat did, I'm sure Sergio would like to have had a separate dealership or a  separate way to go to market on the (inaudible) the 500. What the  compromise was, was the dealer had to spend X millions of dollars to create  a studio within the current dealership. </p><p> So there's always that thought about we could take care of the customers  better. The dealers though have done a remarkable job. I always try to have  a great working relationship with those dealers. They are in place. They've  invested a lot of capital. They've got tremendous loyalty within the  communities. Softball team, political relationships. So it's - it's pretty  embedded, Betty.</p><p> LIU: But on a personal front though, most people don't like going to  dealerships and buying cars. Maybe on the high end it's a pleasant  experience, but for most people it's a terrible experience and they feel  like they're being bilked out of lots of dollars. Is there something more  that should be done with regulating the dealer?</p><p> NARDELLI: Well there's been many attempts, right? The one price, the  national price, the no haggling thing. And maybe Tesla's got it right that  it's going to take something as dramatic and revolutionary as what he's  trying to do to try to get a compromise. I don't think it's either or. I  think in today's digital world you want to have optionality to buy the car  the way you want to buy the car.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> LIU: I want to bring back my guest host for the hour, Bob Nardelli, the  former CEO, as we mentioned, of Chrysler and Home Depot. Bob, what's your  biggest question just as a private citizen around this healthcare exchange?</p><p> NARDELLI: Well I think - I think a couple of important points. Number one,  if you ever wanted to learn how not to introduce a program, this is  certainly a role model.</p><p> LIU: This is certainly the case.</p><p> NARDELLI: We were talking upstairs about General Motors. Could you imagine  if this was a new platform with this many problems to launch a new car  here? So lessons learned here. Program management, oversight, et cetera.  Point number one. </p><p> Point number two. There were two very important words used in your  exchange. One was visits. The other was enrollment. And having at Home  Depot tremendous experience in online sales, we used to track visits, which  was important, but most important were orders placed when you put down your  hard-earned dollars for a product. So there's a big gap.</p><p> LIU: So you're skeptical of these numbers as well that the - that the  government - that the White House is putting out?</p><p> NARDELLI: Depends on what word you're going to use. The visits may be  right, but enrollment, if you mean paid, would be another perspective. And  as just a common guy, I've gone through this myself with my family.</p><p> LIU: You're not a common guy, Bob?</p><p> NARDELLI: I'm very - I'm just --</p><p> LIU: You're no average Joe, but I get it.</p><p> NARDELLI: - Bob - Bob citizen. And I could tell you it was a harrowing  experience to get insurance.</p><p> LIU: Have you tried to sign on - wait. So you tried to sign on to the  exchange or your relatives did?</p><p> NARDELLI: Well, so we went through - first of all, we were terminated by -  my - my - two of my children were terminated because the insurance company  decided not to carry insurance on California. Then we went with the local  provider, 30 percent increase first, another 30 percent increase. Then we  were notified, two of my children, that they were canceled because the  policies that they had didn't meet with the Affordable Care Act government  requirements. So then we went back out in trying to find carriers that  would --</p><p> LIU: That complied.</p><p> NARDELLI: - that would comply. So directionally, we went from like $160 a  month to $600 a month per child with $5,000 deductible. And I can't tell  you how many hours we spent trying to secure this.</p><p> LIU: You were shopping around (inaudible) insurance.</p><p> NARDELLI: If you like your doctors - they wanted to keep their doctors. And  to do that, that's what we had to go through.</p><p> LIU: So this is - so this experience that you're talking about is exactly  why the Republicans are making it a - a focal point of their - of their  campaigns come election season, right? Tom Cotton, for instance, who's a  Republican congressman in Arkansas, and let's pull up his website, has -  when you go to this website - he's running for Senate now?</p><p> NARDELLI: Yes.</p><p> LIU: When you go to this website, he says Obamacare is so bad that Obama  doesn't want it. And he - he's playing on - on - on essentially the anger  among - that he believes voters have against - against Obamacare. Do you  think that that is the right strategy? Are there enough Americans who are  angry about this?</p><p> NARDELLI: Well let me say this. This is that old phrase politics over  policy. I don't think anyone argues with trying to make sure affordable  healthcare is available for all US citizens. I think that's an important  thing and directionally right. I think it's the implementation. I think  it's some of the controversy on how it's happened. I think some of the  changing the goal posts as we went along to make sure. I just think there  were a number of issues in the implementation that probably could have been  better thought out.</p><p> LIU: But how else could it have been done though, Bob?</p><p> NARDELLI: I think certainly - certainly more on a bipartisan basis where we  got more people in the room, more than just software developers, that we  actually brought people in from the business community. What's the impact?  How have you implemented major software changes relative to Ernst &amp; Young  does this, S&amp;P does this, and really got more insight on people that have  been through this relative to the magnitude of the challenge that has taken  place here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> LIU: I want to talk more about management because your former boss Jack  Welch, who I know you have a very long history with, he actually just wrote  this piece that we highlighted yesterday on LinkedIn where he spoke more  about management and how to cultivate talent. And he said one of the things  he believes companies not - they don't do enough of is they don't pay  attention enough to their HR offices. And he was arguing for elevating the  HR officer, for instance, to as high a level as a CFO, to be on the senior  management team. You agree with this?</p><p> NARDELLI: Yeah, absolutely. First of all, Jack's a dear friend. He's been a  great mentor to me. And obviously I can't thank him enough for the lessons  I've learned working for him and being around him.</p><p> LIU: People look to him for management advice.</p><p> NARDELLI: Yes, always. He is the guru. So I totally agree with that  position. As a matter of fact, when I went to Home Depot one of the first  things I did was bring in probably one of the strongest HR chief human  resources and we started to put process into place. </p><p> You've got human capital and you got physical capital. A lot of times  you'll spend an inordinate amount of analysis on - on the physical capital,  and yet it is your human capital that brings that to leaf (ph). So I think  the chief human resource officer needs to have an equal share at your  staff's roundtable.</p><p> LIU: Which they often don't.</p><p> NARDELLI: Which they don't. They're kind of second tier, back room. But  there's nothing more important than talent. If you look at the history of  GE and the ability to continue to have extremely strong talent on the  bench, as talent left talent replaced it. So I think it's very important.</p><p> LIU: Well speaking about talent, there's so much fight for talent, right,  on the West Coast. And there's a great story about how the chamber of  commerce decided, hello, they're going to put an office now on the West  Coast, that they're going to start transferring some of their resources  there. And I imagine this is all also in - in time with the issues of the  day, right? Immigration now for Silicon Valley companies, taxes, the  privacy issue. And I'm assuming the chamber of commerce feels like, hey,  there's a need now for our services.</p><p> NARDELLI: Yeah. I - I think it's an excellent decision by Tom and the  chamber. You have to be immersed in the markets and in the environments of  the issues so you have a sensitivity and an understanding. Now Tom doesn't  have a glass jaw, so as he moves to the West Coast he's going to need all -  and muster all -</p><p> LIU: I was going to say, yeah. Because some of their - you've had companies  like I believe Yahoo did not renew their membership in the chamber and a  couple of other big tech companies because they don't agree with some of  the policies by the chamber, the environmental - environmental stance for  instance by them. Are they - I'm not expecting a big red carpet rolled out  for them.</p><p> NARDELLI: No, I wouldn't. I'm sure they'll move into a facility with high  security. But Tom - I think Tom's doing the right thing. I think he's  balanced. He's thoughtful in his positions in representing the chamber. He  works both sides of the aisle. I think it's important. </p><p> I think that some of these larger corporations that have elected not to  participate will rethink that decision because you'd rather be at the table  than not at the table. We talked about in the last segment on the  Affordable Care Act. So hopefully by them moving out there they're  demonstrating their willingness to engage, listen, learn before you lead.</p><p> LIU: All right. Bob, it's been great to have you here this hour.</p><p> NARDELLI: Thank you. It's been great, Betty. Thank you.</p><p> LIU: Bob Nardelli, the former chairman and CEO of Chrysler and Home Depot.</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

We're going to be talking -- they're talking about China, they're talking about Europe as well.  Private equity, and private equity, that is a big, big topic for them, a big topic. Erik Schatzker is in Davos there with Roberto Quarta and David Novak, Partners at Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice.  Erik.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  Betty, thanks very much.  You said it.  They're with CD&amp;R, it's one of the oldest buy-out firms in the world, started in 1978.  It's been doing private equity for a long time.  Dave, Roberto, thank you very much.  CD&amp;R has a reputation for avoiding the excesses of the buy-out business. I'd like to know what do you see as today's excesses, and how are you avoiding them?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROBERTO QUARTA, PARTNER AND CHAIRMAN OF CD&amp;R EUROPE</emphasis>:  Dave, do you want to take that or...?  </p><p>      DAVID NOVAK, MEMBER OF INVESTMENT AND MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES, </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CD&amp;R</emphasis>:  We think it's important to be focused on what you know versus what you don't know.  Don't follow trends just because at a moment in time people think that's where you want to invest.  For almost 40 years now we've only focused on businesses that we understand well, have operating partners in house who knew how to manage those businesses better, and we're going to keep sticking with that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  So what then runs the risk of being overly fashionable today?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUARTA</emphasis>:  Well, I don't know.  I think it is changing, you know. And I think fashions come in and go out.  And I think it's difficult to -- I mean we had the big tech...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  Mm-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUARTA</emphasis>:  ...the big tech fashion, and you could (regulate) the luxury sector that was sort of changing.  What we try to do is we're very focused in how we invest.  And, and actually we're not a buy-out shop that needs to do lots of deals.  We do three to five deals a year, and, and we do, we do it in such a way where we have experience and expertise.  We do not invest in areas where we don't have that expertise, both on the financial side and on the operating side, which you know is very much the way we operate.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  One of the things that is consistently fashionable in private equity is leverage.  How much leverage do you feel comfortable putting on a transaction today?  How many turns?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOVAK</emphasis>:  In truth it varies on the, on the transaction and the company.  As you know, different companies and different industries have very different cash flow characteristics, different investment characteristics.  So we've done deals in businesses in which we had a traditional highly-leveraged package, five, six times leverage.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  Mm-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOVAK</emphasis>:  But there've been other businesses that we've invested which have been much lower, because the company and/or the deal didn't accommodate...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  But is your inclination today to be more or less levered than you might have been in the past?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOVAK</emphasis>:  Without a doubt the inclination is slightly less lever today.  But importantly it is the amount of leverage is one thing, but also the terms of that leverage.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  How easy is it to get?  We hear that, you know, we can see what's happening in the high-yield market.  We hear that bank lending is beginning to freeze up, particularly on the leverage side. What do you see?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUARTA</emphasis>:  Well, that's only the case in the U.S. at the moment, and that mostly has to do with the sort of significant reduction in fund flows coming in because of oil and gas, revenues having come down significantly.  Europe is still open and, David, I think you can comment on that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOVAK</emphasis>:  Yes, we can still get some leverage in Europe, but it's a little tighter than it was.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  I mean some firms, as you know, have had trouble.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUARTA</emphasis>:  Indeed.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  (inaudible) they've had to sell finance of the credit side of the transaction.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUARTA</emphasis>:  But if you talk to some bankers, they will tell you that actually they've got some deals in the States that they can't, you know, offload and they're going to come over to Europe because they think there is a market for (certain)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  Well, there's appetite among European investors.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUARTA</emphasis>:  For certain types of deals.  That's -- at least some of the bankers have been telling us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  Here's the thing.  We live in a world of lower returns, right?  So long as the benchmark lending rate is a quarter percentage point, and in Europe it's effectively negative.  It's harder to generate returns over time.  Does that make buying at the right price much more important?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUARTA</emphasis>:  I think we've learned that lesson over the years.  You buy it right makes it a lot easier on exit.  And if you over pay and at times, you know, people do stretch.  You know, they think, well, this is strategic, this is really going to be something that makes an awful lot of sense, let's (pay) that bit more.  But that bit more causes you to do an awful lot of work in order to get the sort of returns you're trying to get.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  Well, you're still investing a fund you raised in 2013, and we haven't really seen a lot of public market leverage buyouts over the past couple of years.  With the decline in stock prices and the reduction in valuations, is that going to get easier?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOVAK</emphasis>:  We definitely think that that's a trend that will grow. A lot of bankers are now are freshening up their analysis on what are the right premiums you need and what multiples.  And, frankly, for us who are very industry-focused, we follow lots of companies in our specific industries, both public and private.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  And what's attractive by industry right now?  Where do you feel you want to commit capital?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOVAK</emphasis>:  In Europe we continue to like the European consumer.  We think it's early days still in the European consumer recovery supported by low interest rates, low energy prices.  They have more money in their pocket for example.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  All right, gentlemen.  I thank you very much. Good to see you here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUARTA</emphasis>:  Nice to see you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  Betty, that is Roberto Quarta and David Novak of Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice, here at the World Economic Forum in Davos.       </p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Musicians, athletes, inventors, artists, entrepreneurs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Steven Ramirez went out and took a job frying hamburgers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He got around to some other meaningful undertakings, of course, but the part of his life we celebrate today started with a paper hat and a metal spatula.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ramirez's late-career move to McDonald's, for whom he operated franchises in San Diego, Mexico and Sacramento, led him to Ronald McDonald House Charities, a nonprofit with a global reach that provides temporary housing to the families of hospitalized children.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ramirez has been a global trustee for the international charity for 15 years, the last five as chairman. It's a job that has taken him around the world to several of the six continents and 64 countries where 365 RMHC-developed living quarters serve families often tottering on the precipice of financial and emotional stability.</p><p>He does it for one reason and one reason alone: the profound need.</p><p>\"People say, 'You must make a lot of money in your job,'\" Ramirez says. \"I don't make any money in this job. In fact, this job costs me money.\"</p><p>He'll pay his own freight next week, too, when he returns to Bakersfield for the unveiling of a major renovation and expansion of the local Ronald McDonald House, located at Bakersfield Memorial Hospital. The RMH is expanding from about 1,100 square feet and three bedrooms to nearly 3,000 square feet and seven bedrooms. The facility also has a common area, a kitchen and several bath/showers.</p><p>\"It looks like the Santa Barbara Biltmore,\" says Jim Darling, the Bakersfield RMHC's lead fundraiser. \"It exceeded my expectations in every way. I walked through there Friday and the guys were just touching up the paint. I didn't go in every room, but it's nice. For a family going through all the stress of a child in the hospital, it is just incredibly comfortable and soothing.\"</p><p>Some 500 people have RSVP'd in the affirmative for the grand opening of the Klassen Corp.-built addition at 10 a.m. July 11. Private donations paid 100 percent of the construction costs.</p><p>\"I have never seen a community support a House like this one. Five hundred RSVPs is amazing,\" Ramirez says. \"It really says something about Bakersfield. When I cut the ribbon for the Stanford House, it was 100, 120 people. I'm not criticizing, but the level of support in Bakersfield is phenomenal. (Local program director) Scarlett Sabin is a force of nature.\"</p><p>That level of support inspires Ramirez to wear his Bakersfield roots all the prouder, even if he spent only a portion of his youth here.</p><p>Ramirez was born at Mercy Hospital on June 30, 1949; his father and uncle owned a Golden Eagle gas station. But one gas station wasn't enough to support two growing families and, when Ramirez was 5, his father moved the family from its east Bakersfield home on Chico Street north to Sacramento, where he took an administrative position at McClellan Air Force Base.</p><p>But Bakersfield remained a part of his life.</p><p>Cousins on his grandmother's side owned two historic, old Bakersfield Mexican restaurants: Sinaloa (which closed this year, to his chagrin) and Casa Munoz.</p><p>\"I would go back every summer to live with my grandparents, and play with my cousins, until I was in high school,\" he says.</p><p>Even at his Sacramento high school, he couldn't get completely away from Bakersfield.</p><p>He attended Christian Brothers High School, a boys-only institution founded by the De La Salle Christian Brothers in 1876. His religion teacher was Brother Justin Meyer, an east Bakersfield native (known in his youth as Raymie Meyer) who later left the order and founded Silver Oak, maker of perhaps the most revered cabernet wine in the Napa Valley and, hence, the world.</p><p>\"Corporal punishment was de rigueur at Christian Brothers,\" he says. \"I always complained. But when I started looking to get into university, it was clear those four years really paid off. I was prepared.\"</p><p>Prepared enough to get into UC Berkeley on a U.S. Forest Service scholarship and then UC Davis grad school on a Ford Foundation Fellowship. He also took courses at the Defense Language Institute at the Presidio of Monterey.</p><p>Upon graduation from Davis, he worked in California state government for seven years as a Resources Agency executive fellow and as adviser to the chairman of the California Energy Commission.</p><p>The day he met Gov. Jerry Brown, in his first incarnation as governor, was memorable. Brown asked him how he would keep businesses from leaving California for destinations like Texas and the Carolinas, which was then in the midst of a big tech push. Ramirez was not immediately satisfied with his own answer, but Brown was. Brown appointed him director of the Office of Business and Industrial Development.</p><p>Ramirez also was an executive with the Southern California Gas Co. for seven years, serving variously as manager of regulatory affairs, human resources and public affairs. Later he was adviser to the president of Sempra Energy, the holding company that owns Southern California Gas.</p><p>Those duties came with an after-hours obligation: banquets rubbing elbows with corporate types from other industries.</p><p>\"I kept bumping into people from McDonald's at these rubber chicken dinners,\" he says. \"One day they said, 'How'd you like to own your own business?\"</p><p>He would, he realized.</p><p>He and Carmen opened their first McDonald's franchise in November 1988 in Galt, just south of Sacramento.</p><p>Steve trained for 2,000 hours, learning everything from hamburger garnishing to toilet cleanup.</p><p>He and Carmen were franchisees for 29 years, moving to Mexico, where they owned 14 restaurants in Tijuana, Ensenada and Acapulco, and then San Diego County, where they owned six.</p><p>All the while, Ramirez was serving on the global charity's board of trustees.</p><p>\"Carmen basically ran the restaurants while I traveled the world,\" he says.</p><p>But eventually real life beckoned them home.</p><p>\"Then our moms started to age,\" he says. \"We told McDonald's 'We have to move back to Sacramento.' They thought we were crazy for giving up San Diego, but we only had one mom.\"</p><p>So in 2007, Steve and Carmen -- also a fully accredited McDonald's licensee -- moved to Elk Grove, just south of Sacramento, where they owned and operated seven franchises in Modesto and Elk Grove until retiring at the end of 2017.</p><p>\"But the (Ronald McDonald House) board says, 'No, you're not getting out that easy,\" Ramirez says.</p><p>No, there was more work to be done.</p><p>The charity just opened RMHC chapters in Ukraine, South Africa, India, Pakistan and Jordan, and they are in talks with Greece and Egypt.</p><p>At 70, couldn't Ramirez decide he's had simply enough and go dip his feet in a nice lake somewhere with Carmen, his wife of 42 years?</p><p>\"I could, but I wouldn't have the level of satisfaction this gives me,\" he says. \"You're chairman of this iconic charity.\"</p><p>Ramirez and his wife did not have children. Or did they? Depends on how one counts.</p><p>\"I have 28 godchildren, lots of nieces and nephews, and we take care of 3.5 million children each year,\" he says. \"We don't have any children, genetically, but we have children. We have children.\"</p><p>For details about the July 11 event, or about RMHC in general, contact BRMH Director Scarlett Sabin at 661-437-4130 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ssabin@bakersfieldrmh.org\">ssabin@bakersfieldrmh.org</email></p><p>Contact The Californian's Robert Price at 661-395-7399, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rprice@bakersfield.com\">rprice@bakersfield.com</email> or on Twitter: @stubblebuzz.

Most Americans aren't passionate conservatives or liberals, Republicans or Democrats. But they have become impassioned for or against Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a result, people with different political views have stopped talking with each other. This is a huge problem because democracy depends on our capacity to deliberate together.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So what can we do\u2013all of us\u2013to begin talking across the great divide? Here are 10 suggestions:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. Don't avoid political conversations with people who are likely to disagree with you, even in your own family. To the contrary, seek them out and have those discussions.</p><p>2. Don't start by talking about Trump. Start instead with \"kitchen table\" issues like stagnant wages, shrinking benefits, the escalating costs of health care, college, pharmaceuticals, housing.</p><p>3. Make it personal. Ask them about their own experiences and stories. Share yours. Try to find common ground.</p><p>4. Ask them why they think all this has happened. Listen carefully and let them know you've heard them.</p><p>5. If they start blaming immigrants or African-Americans, or elites, or Democrats, or even Obama \u2013 stay cool. Don't tune out. Ask them about why they think these people are responsible.</p><p>6. Gradually turn the conversation into one about power \u2013 who has it, who doesn't. Ask about their own experiences at work, what's happened to their jobs, how others among their families and friends are treated.</p><p>7. Ask them about the roles of big corporations and Wall Street. For example:</p><p>\u2013Why is it that when corporations and Wall Street firms violate the law, no executive goes to jail?</p><p>\u2013Why did Wall Street get bailed out during the financial crisis but homeowners caught in the downdraft didn't get help?</p><p>\u2013Why do big oil, big agriculture, big Pharma, and Wall Street hedge-fund managers get special subsidies and tax loopholes?</p><p>8. Get a discussion going about how the system is organized, for whom, and how it's been changing. For example:</p><p>\u2013Why is it that only 4 major airlines fly today when a few years ago there were 12? Why are there only 4 Internet service providers?</p><p>\u2013How is this increasing concentration of economic power across the entire economy driving up prices?</p><p>\u2013Why are pharmaceutical companies and health insurers able to charge more and more?</p><p>\u2013Why can corporations and their top executives declare bankruptcy and have their debts forgiven, when bankruptcy isn't available to people laden with student debt or to homeowners who can't meet their payments?</p><p>\u2013Why are the biggest benefits from the tax cut going to billionaires?</p><p>9. Then get to the core issue: Do they think any of this has to do with big money in politics?</p><p>\u2013Is the system rigged?\u00a0And if so, who's doing the rigging, and why?</p><p>\u2013How can average people be heard when there's so much big money in politics? Should we try to get big money out of politics?</p><p>\u2013And if so, how do we do it?</p><p>Notice, you're not using labels. You're not talking about Democrats or Republicans, left or right, capitalism or socialism, government or free market. You're not even talking about Trump.</p><p>You're starting with the everyday experiences of most people\u2013with their wages and living expenses and experiences on the job\u2013 and from there moving to economic and political power.</p><p>10. Oh, and don't forget to use humor. Humor is the great disinfectant. For example, the Supreme Court says corporations are people. Well, you'll believe they're people when Texas executes a corporation.</p><p>Remember, the point isn't to convince them you're right and they're wrong. It's to get us thinking about what's really happening to America. It's exposing the abuses of power all around us.</p><p>If we can join together around these fundamental issues, we will all win</p><p>Saturday, August 11, 2018<br/>TRUMP AND THE ART OF THE NO DEAL</p><p>Donald Trump promised to be America's dealmaker-in-chief, touting his \"extraordinary\" ability to negotiate. But so far, Trump has shown he can't make a deal. Here's the list of biggest no-deals:</p><p>1. No deal with North Korea. Following his summit with Kim Jong Un, Trump declared on Twitter that \"there is no longer a nuclear threat\" from North Korea. But in fact, there's no deal. Kim conceded nothing on weapons and missile programs. Recent satellite imagery shows North Korea is actually improving its nuclear capability.</p><p>2. No deal with Russia. At the Helsinki summit, Russia agreed to nothing. But Trump gave away the store, even casting doubt on Russia's collusion in the 2016 election in the face of the conclusions of America's own intelligence agencies.</p><p>3.\u00a0No deal with China on trade. Instead, we're on the brink of a trade war with China, which is retaliating against U.S. tariffs.</p><p>4.\u00a0No deal with Europe on trade. Instead, Europe has merely agreed to negotiate towards a resolution of the trade war Trump provoked in the first place.</p><p>5. No deal on Iran. Trump announced America's exit from the Iran nuclear deal. Since then, no negotiations.</p><p>6.\u00a0No deal on climate change. Trump simply pulled out of the Paris accords. There have been no negotiations since.</p><p>7.\u00a0No deal with the Group of 7 leading economic powers. Instead, Trump just pulled out of the joint communique.</p><p>8.\u00a0No deal on immigration or the DREAMers.\u00a0Trump promised a new immigration bill, and a new deal from the young people brought to America as children. But since then, nothing.</p><p>9. No budget deal with Congress.\u00a0The government is still operating under a\u00a0\"continuing resolution.\"</p><p>10. No deal on replacing the Affordable Care Act. Trump promised to \"repeal and replace\" the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0But there's been no repeal, and no replacement. He and\u00a0the Republican Congress never agreed to a new plan.</p><p>11. No deal on gun control. After the Parkland shooting, Trump promised to tighten background checks for gun buyers and said he'd consider raising the age for buying certain types of guns. Instead, he bowed to the NRA.</p><p>Bottom line: Trump can't make deals. He can only pull out of deals already made, or pretend he's made deals that soon evaporate, or give away the store.</p><p>He's perfected the art of the no deal.</p><p>Where Trump Sees Foreign Danger</p><p>Monday, August 6, 2018</p><p>What's the most worrisome foreign intrusion into the United States \u2013 unauthorized immigrants, Chinese imports, or interference in our democracy?</p><p>For Trump, it's immigrants and imports. He doesn't care much about the third.</p><p>\"Border security is national security,\" Trump said last week, as he threatened a government shutdown if Congress didn't come up with money to build a wall along the Mexican border (at an estimated cost at least $25\u00a0billion).</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump has ordered his administration to consider raising tariff rates on $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting China to threaten higher tariffs on $60 billion more of American goods.</p><p>Yet Trump continues to assert that talk of Russian meddling in American elections is \"a big hoax.\" And his White House still has no coordinated plan for dealing with it.</p><p>Trump has it backwards.</p><p>Illegal immigration isn't the problem he makes it out to be. Illegal border crossings have been declining for years.</p><p>And if the Chinese want to continue to send us cheap imports that we pay for with U.S. dollars and our own IOUs, that's as much of a potential problem for them as it is for us.</p><p>But Russian attacks on our democracy are a clear and present threat aimed at the heart of America.</p><p>Facebook recently announced it uncovered a major disinformation campaign with the hallmarks of the same Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency responsible for election interference in 2016.</p><p>Trump's own Department of Homeland Security found that in that 2016 election, Russian hackers tried to breach election systems\u00a0in at least 21 states, likely scanned systems in all 50 states, stole the private information of hundreds of thousands of people, and infiltrated a company that supplies voting software across the nation. These findings led to the July indictment of 12 Russian Intelligence Officers.</p><p>Russian hackers are likely planning the same sort of intervention in this November's midterm elections. Kirstjen Nielsen, Secretary of Homeland Security, worries about Russia's ongoing \"willingness and a capability\" to hack into the American election infrastructure, including voter rolls and voting machines.</p><p>FBI Director Christopher Wray warns that \"Russia \u2026 continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day.\" Dan Coats, Director of National Intelligence, says \"Russians are looking for every opportunity \u2026 to continue their pervasive efforts to undermine our fundamental values.\"</p><p>Trump himself has admitted that his campaign aides met with Kremlin-linked Russian nationals on June 9, 2016 \"to get information on\" Hillary Clinton \u2013 even though federal law\u00a0prohibits soliciting help from foreign nationals in connection with a federal election.</p><p>Russia isn't the only foreign danger to our democracy.</p><p>The trial of Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, reveals another. It shows that Manafort hired a small army of American lawyers and lobbyists from both parties to influence U.S. lawmakers on behalf of Kremlin-connected former Ukrainian strongman, Viktor F. Yanukovych,</p><p>These were essentially laundered bribes \u2013 from Yanukovych through Washington-based influence peddlers, then on to U.S. politicians through the political action committees run by those influence peddlers.</p><p>A similar kind of laundered bribe from abroad occurred recently after the Chinese telecom giant ZTE was caught red-handed violating international sanctions on Iran. When the Commerce Department imposed penalties on the firm, ZTE hired the big Washington firm Hogan Lovells \u2013 which got Trump to lift the sanctions.</p><p>The timing was curious. Just before Trump came to ZTE's rescue, Chinese state enterprises agreed to give $500 million in loans to a project in Indonesia that included Trump-branded hotels, residences and golf courses \u2013 funneling millions of dollars into Trump's pockets.</p><p>When Congress threatened to reinstate the penalties on ZTE nonetheless, Hogan Lovells turned its sights on lawmakers. The firm's political action committee made fat donations to legislators who had the power to reduce the penalties.</p><p>The strategy paid off. Last Wednesday, the Senate passed a bill containing far weaker sanctions on ZTE than lawmakers originally intended.</p><p>The Trump administration is also ending the requirement that nonprofit groups that engage in political activity disclose the names of their large donors \u2013 another loophole through which foreign money can stream in to influence American politics.</p><p>All this raises the fundamental question of what we mean by national security.</p><p>Yes, our borders should be secure, and, yes, our trading partners should play fair.</p><p>But the essence of America \u2013 the attribute we must hold most secure because it defines who we are and what we strive for \u2013 is a system of government \"of the people, by the people, for the people,\" as Lincoln put it.</p><p>If Putin or a Kremlin-connected Ukrainian strongman or even a giant Chinese company undermines this, they rob us of our most precious legacy.</p><p>Trump cares more about unauthorized immigrants and Chinese imports than about the sanctity of our democracy. This is a tragic mistake.</p><p>Sunday, August 5, 2018<br/>THE BIGGEST THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY THAT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF<br/>The biggest threat to our democracy that nobody is talking about is the real possibility of a rogue Constitutional convention \u2013 empowering extremists to radically reshape the Constitution, our laws, and our country.</p><p>If just a few more states sign on to what's called an \"Article V convention\" for a balanced budget amendment, there's no limit to the damage they might do.</p><p>Let me explain.</p><p>There are 2 ways to amend the United States Constitution: One way \u2013 the way we've passed every amendment since the Bill of Rights \u2013 is for two-thirds of the House and two-thirds of the Senate to vote for a proposed amendment, and then have it ratified by at least three quarters of the states \u2013 now 38 in number.</p><p>But there's a second way to amend the Constitution. Two thirds of the states may demand that Congress form a constitutional convention to propose amendments.</p><p>Once such a constitutional convention is convened, there are no rules to limit or constrain what comes next.</p><p>Amendments proposed by an Article V convention are supposed to be ratified by 38 states. But convention delegates could hijack the process and change the ratification process itself, tossing out the 38 state requirement.</p><p>A balanced budget amendment would be crazy enough. But nothing would be safe. A woman's right to choose. Marriage equality. First Amendment protections for free speech and a free press. Equal protection of the laws. Checks and balances.</p><p>An Article V convention would allow delegates to write their own agenda into our Constitution.</p><p>Already 28 states have called for a constitutional convention. They only need 6 more to succeed.</p><p>Unlimited money in politics and partisan gerrymandering have already given Republicans control of a majority of state legislatures. Big money interests like the Koch Brothers and ALEC are investing heavily in the push for a constitutional convention \u2013 which means that they'd be calling the shots if one takes place.</p><p>You're\u00a0probably already overwhelmed with political actions you need to take. But, believe me, this is important. With just a few states to go, your voice is needed. Please tell your state lawmakers to reject calls for an Article V convention.</p><p>Thursday, August 2, 2018<br/>THE ROADBLOCK TO COMMON SENSE PENSION REFORM</p><p>55 million Americans \u2014 about half of the entire private-sector workforce \u2014 have no employer-sponsored retirement plan at all. Many work for small businesses in the low-wage service and hospitality sectors. If they don't save money independently, they will have nothing when they stop working.</p><p>This is very different from four decades ago when most workers retired with a company pension.</p><p>The good news is that several states \u2013 including Oregon, California, Illinois, Connecticut, and Maryland \u2014 now let such workers put money away in state-sponsored retirement plans that allow them to withdraw their accumulated savings, tax free, when they hit retirement.</p><p>The bad news is that the investment industry is aggressively seeking to block these plans, fearing the competition.</p><p>That's because the fees charged by most state retirement plans are capped at around 1 percent \u2013 much lower than the fees of similar plans operated by banks and investment companies. And state fees are expected to drop even lower as more workers enroll.</p><p>If each of America's 40 million retirees saved on average $50,000 in the state program, they'd have an additional $20 billion in the first year. That's $20 billion more in the pockets of retirees, not financial institutions.</p><p>Right now, the industry's efforts appear to be winning.</p><p>Republicans in Congress \u2013 backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a coalition of Wall Street investment firms \u2013 are seeking to block states from implementing these plans at all.</p><p>Investment and insurance companies are also spending like mad on election campaigns of friendly state legislators and threatening lawsuits. Which is why many proposed state-run retirement plans are languishing in statehouses around the country.</p><p>Folks, the anger and frustration that led to Trump continues to simmer. If we allow the moneyed interests to block common-sense reforms like this, in future years, America could face an even worse fate than Trump.</p><p>When you vote in November, vote for legislators who want to allow workers to save for retirement and against legislators who are shills for the financial sector.</p><p>Trump's\u00a0Two Kinds of Lies \u2013 and Why They're Undermining American Democracy</p><p>Wednesday, August 1, 2018</p><p>There are two kinds of Donald Trump lies. One is about facts. The other is about those who call him out on his fabrications.</p><p>An example of the first occurred Sunday, when Trump issued a tweetstorm of lies:</p><p>\"The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats, was started by a fraudulent Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. Therefore, the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam!\"</p><p>These assertions have all been contradicted by Trump's own FBI director and even by GOP congressional leaders.</p><p>It's bad enough when a president of the United States tells the public nonstop lies. It's worse when he impugns those who are pointing out he's wrong \u2014 the second type of Trump lie.</p><p>An example of this second category occurred last week when Trump was speaking to a veterans group. \"What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening,\" he said.</p><p>In other words, you should only trust me.</p><p>Trump is ramping up both kinds of lies \u2014 lies about the facts, and lies about those who are reporting the truth.</p><p>Both categories of lies are dangerous to a democracy. The first misleads the public. The second undermines the capacity of the public to discover they are being misled.</p><p>In the words of George Orwell, \"The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.\"</p><p>For those who believe both kinds of lies, Trump (backed by his Fox News propaganda machine) is the only credible source of information in America. That means he can say anything at all and remain unaccountable.</p><p>In escalating his war on the media, Trump is also blocking unfriendly reporters from covering him.</p><p>Last week, newly installed Deputy Chief of Staff Bill Shine and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told CNN correspondent Kaitlan Collins she could not attend Trump's open-media event in the Rose Garden because they objected to her questioning of Trump earlier in the day.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump's increasing attacks on the media are causing journalists to worry about their safety. New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger warned that the attacks were \"contributing to a rise in threats against journalists and will lead to violence.\"</p><p>Democracy is imperiled when a president of the United States tells bald-faced lies. It is doubly imperiled when a president convinces a portion of the public not to trust anyone who contradicts him.</p><p>As statesman and poet Vaclav Havel put it, \"If the main pillar of the system is living a lie, then it is not surprising that the fundamental threat to it is living the truth.\"</p><p>These two kinds of lies are becoming more common in Europe as well. Indeed, the central political divide in the West is no longer right or left as we've come to understand the terms since World War II \u2014 emphasizing choice between small or large government.</p><p>It is coming to be authoritarianism based on lies versus democracy based on truth.</p><p>Trump's two kinds of lies are lending legitimacy to European leaders who are actively suppressing the truth to entrench their power, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, and Poland's Law and Justice Party.</p><p>Close behind them, although not yet in power, are France's Marine Le Pen and Britain's Nigel Farage. Italy's new deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, also falls into this category.</p><p>It is tempting to attribute the public's willingness to believe lies to a growing disillusionment with global capitalism, especially the broken promise of higher standards of living.</p><p>Despite low unemployment, the median wage in the United States (adjusted for inflation) is barely higher than it was in the late 1970s, and economic insecurity is widespread. Europe still suffers high unemployment.</p><p>As in the 1930s, when global capitalism broke down, economic hardships fuel the rise of demagogues who direct anger and resentment toward scapegoats such as immigrants and minorities \u2013 lying about them with impunity.</p><p>Added to this has been a concerted effort by Russian President Vladimir Putin to attack democratic institutions across America and Europe. The aim of his cyber-warfare campaign is to confuse the public about both the truth and the reliability of truth-tellers.</p><p>The logical endpoint to both kinds of lies is fascism.</p><p>Few living today remember the birth of fascism in Europe and Soviet Russia in the 1930s. Maybe that explains why the free world seems relatively passive in the face of these current attacks on democracy and truth.</p><p>This is no time for passivity. The truth is still getting through to most people. But in sharp contrast to the 1930s, an American president is now helping lead the charge against it.</p><p>Why Wages Are Going Nowhere</p><p>Monday, July 30, 2018</p><p>The official rate of unemployment in America has plunged to a remarkably low 3.8%. The Federal Reserve forecasts that the unemployment rate will reach 3.5% by the end of the year.</p><p>But the official rate hides more troubling realities: legions of college grads overqualified for their jobs, a growing number of contract workers with no job security, and an army of part-time workers desperate for full-time jobs. Almost 80% of Americans say they live from paycheck to paycheck, many not knowing how big their next one will be.</p><p>Blanketing all of this are stagnant wages and vanishing job benefits. The typical American worker now earns around $44,500 a year, not much more than what the typical worker earned in 40 years ago, adjusted for inflation. Although the US economy continues to grow, most of the gains have been going to a relatively few top executives of large companies, financiers, and inventors and owners of digital devices.</p><p>America doesn't have a jobs crisis. It has a good jobs crisis.</p><p>When Republicans delivered their $1.5tn tax cut last December they predicted a big wage boost for American workers. Forget it. Wages actually dropped in the second quarter of this year.</p><p>Not even the current low rate of unemployment is forcing employers to raise wages. Contrast this with the late 1990s, the last time unemployment dipped close to where it is today, when the portion of national income going into wages was 3% points higher than it is today.</p><p>What's going on? Simply put, the vast majority of American workers have lost just about all their bargaining power. The erosion of that bargaining power is one of the biggest economic stories of the past four decades, yet it's less about supply and demand than about institutions and politics.</p><p>Two fundamental forces have changed the structure of the US economy, directly altering the balance of power between business and labor. The first is the increasing difficulty for workers of joining together in trade unions. The second is the growing ease by which corporations can join together in oligopolies or to form monopolies.</p><p>What happened to unions</p><p>By the mid-1950s more than a third of all private-sector workers in the United States were unionized. In subsequent decades public employees became organized, too. Employers were required by law not just to permit unions but to negotiate in good faith with them. This gave workers significant power to demand better wages, hours, benefits, and working conditions. (Agreements in unionized industries set the benchmarks for the non-unionized).</p><p>Yet starting in the 1980s and with increasing ferocity since then, private-sector employers have fought against unions. Ronald Reagan's decision to fire the nation's air-traffic controllers, who went on an illegal strike, signaled to private-sector employers that fighting unions was legitimate. A wave of hostile takeovers pushed employers to do whatever was necessary to maximize shareholder returns. Together, they ushered in an era of union-busting.</p><p>Employers have been firing workers who attempt to organize, threatening to relocate to more \"business friendly\" states if companies unionize, mounting campaigns against union votes, and summoning replacement workers when unionized workers strike. Employer groups have lobbied states to enact more so-called \"right-to-work\" laws that bar unions from requiring dues from workers they represent. A recent Supreme Court opinion delivered by the court's five Republican appointees has extended the principle of \"right-to-work\" to public employees.</p><p>Today, fewer than 7% of private-sector workers are unionized, and public-employee unions are in grave jeopardy, not least because of the Supreme Court ruling. The declining share of total US income going to the middle since the late 1960s \u2013 defined as 50% above and 50% below the median \u2013 correlates directly with that decline in unionization. (See chart below).</p><p>Perhaps even more significantly, the share of total income going to the richest 10 percent of Americans over the last century is almost exactly inversely related to the share of the nation's workers who are unionized. (See chart below). When it comes to dividing up the pie, most American workers today have little or no say. The pie is growing but they're getting only the crumbs.</p><p>What happened to antitrust</p><p>Over the same period time, antitrust enforcement has gone into remission. The US government has essentially given a green light to companies seeking to gain monopoly power over digital platforms and networks (Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook); wanting to merge into giant oligopolies (pharmaceuticals, health insurers, airlines, seed producers, food processors, military contractors, Wall Street banks, internet service providers); or intent on creating local monopolies (food distributors, waste disposal companies, hospitals).</p><p>This means workers are spending more on such goods and services than they would were these markets more competitive. It's exactly as if their paychecks were cut. Concentrated economic power has also given corporations more ability to hold down wages, because workers have less choice of whom to work for. And it has let companies impose on workers provisions that further weaken their bargaining power, such as anti-poaching and mandatory arbitration agreements.</p><p>This great shift in bargaining power, from workers to corporations, has pushed a larger portion of national income into profits and a lower portion into wages than at any time since the second world war. In recent years, most of those profits have gone into higher executive pay and higher share prices rather than into new investment or worker pay. Add to this the fact that the richest 10% of Americans own about 80% of all shares of stock (the top 1% owns about 40%), and you get a broader picture of how and why inequality has widened so dramatically.</p><p>What happened to politics</p><p>Another consequence: corporations and wealthy individuals have had more money to pour into political campaigns and lobbying, while labor unions have had far less. In 1978, for example, congressional campaign contributions by labor Political Action Committees were on par with corporate PAC contributions. But since 1980, corporate PAC giving has grown at a much faster clip, and today the gulf is huge.</p><p>It is no coincidence that all three branches of the federal government, as well as most state governments, have become more \"business-friendly\" and less \"worker-friendly\" than at any time since the 1920s. As I've noted, Congress recently slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.</p><p>Meanwhile, John Roberts' supreme court has more often sided with business interests in cases involving labor, the environment, or consumers than has any Supreme Court since the mid-1930s. Over the past year it not only ruled against public employee unions but also decided that workers cannot join together in class action suits when their employment contract calls for mandatory arbitration.</p><p>The federal minimum wage has not been increased since 2009, and is now about where it was in 1950 when adjusted for inflation. Trump's labor department is busily repealing many rules and regulations designed to protect workers.</p><p>The combination of high corporate profits and growing corporate political power has created a vicious cycle: higher profits have generated more political influence, which has altered the rules of the game through legislative, congressional, and judicial action \u2013 enabling corporations to extract even more profit. The biggest losers, from whom most profits have been extracted, have been average workers.</p><p>America's shift from farm to factory was accompanied by decades of bloody labor conflict.The shift from factory to office and other sedentary jobs created other social upheaval.</p><p>The more recent shift in bargaining power from workers to large corporations \u2013 and consequentially, the dramatic widening of inequalities of income, wealth, and political power \u2013 has had a more unfortunate and, I fear, more lasting consequence: an angry working class vulnerable to demagogues peddling authoritarianism, racism, and xenophobia.</p><p>[This article originally appeared in the July 29, 2018 edition of The Guardian, under the title \"Almost 80 Percent of Americans Live From Paycheck to Paycheck. Here's Why.\"]</p><p>Saturday, July 28, 2018<br/>6 REASONS FOR HOPE IN TRUMP TIMES</p><p>In these darkest of days, here's what gives me hope:</p><p>First, Donald Trump has been a giant wake-up call that we can't take democracy for granted. The young people of America get this. I've been teaching for 40 years and I don't recall a generation as committed to social justice, reforming this country, and making it work for all and not just a few.</p><p>Look at those kids in Parkland, Florida. Or the millions more who are getting involved in their communities and in politics. They are America's future, and they won't give up.</p><p>The second thing that makes me optimistic is occurring at the grassroots of America, where there's more activism than I remember in half a century. The #MeToo movement, Time's Up, #BlackLivesMatter, #Neveragain, the Poor People's Campaign, Indivisible.org, swingleft.org.</p><p>They and thousands of other groups and millions of Americans are united by a commitment to end abuses of power \u2013 whether by sexual predators, or the police, the National Rifle Association, or billionaires out to undermine our democracy.</p><p>Third, Fueled by Trump's election, more women are running for office than ever before. According to Emily's List, more than 36,000 women are interested in running for office in 2018 and beyond. By comparison, 920 women contacted Emily's List in the 2016 campaign.</p><p>Fourth, I'm optimistic because America's history shows that every time we've gotten off track, Americans mobilize to get our country back on track. We did this after the Gilded Age of the 1880s and 1890s, when robber barons monopolized the economy; politics was poisoned by money; and poverty, and disease, and horrendous working conditions claimed thousands of lives each year.</p><p>We did it again in the Depression decade of the 1930s, after the economy collapsed because of Wall Street's excesses. And again in the 1960s and 1970s, when we embraced civil rights and voting rights, Medicare and Medicaid, and environmental protection. If history teaches us anything, we will again reform this system.</p><p>Fifth, I'm also optimistic because these grueling years of the Trump presidency have made us all realize how fragile our democracy really is, and what we need to reform\u2013from the Electoral College and super-delegates to gerrymandering, voter ID laws, and hacker-proof voting machinery.</p><p>And most of us now know how important it is to vote.</p><p>Finally, I'm optimistic because I don't like the alternative. We must have hope.</p><p>The fate of this nation depends on every one of us becoming an activist, joining with others, and reclaiming this land from those bent on destroying it.</p><p>Monday, July 23, 2018<br/>WE'RE LIVING A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS</p><p>I keep hearing that if Trump fires Mueller, we'll face a \"constitutional crisis.\" Or if Mueller subpoenas Trump to testify and Trump defies the subpoena, it's a \"constitutional crisis\". Or if Mueller delivers substantial evidence that Trump is guilty of colluding with Russia or of obstructing justice, and the House does nothing to impeach him, we have a \"constitutional crisis.\"</p><p>Well, I have news for you. We're already in a \"constitutional crisis.\"</p><p>You see, the Constitution is a tiny document. It requires that presidents and others in positions of power be bound by norms, unwritten rules, and long-established understandings of their constitutional responsibilities.</p><p>Yet look at what's happened since January 2017:</p><p>Trump fires the head of the FBI and conjures up a plot that the FBI installed a spy in his campaign;\u00a0blames the entire Mueller investigation on a conspiratorial \"deep state\" that's out to remove him from office;\u00a0uses pardons to demonstrate to people already under investigation that they don't need to cooperate because he can pardon them, too; and\u00a0asserts that the appointment of the special counsel was unconstitutional, and that he has the power under the Constitution to end the investigation whenever he wants.</p><p>He initially denies that Russia intruded in the 2016 election, when all America's intelligence agencies show it has; and even now asserts that they are not continuing to mount a cyberattack on America, when his intelligence chiefs say otherwise.</p><p>Beyond this, he berates judges who disagree with him, and journalists and news organizations that criticize him; uses the presidency like a personal fiefdom to enrich himself and his family; unilaterally breaks treaties, starts trade wars with long-standing allies, and cozies up to some of the most murderous dictators in the world; treats Americans who didn't vote for him and disapprove of him as his enemies; and tweets and holds rallies with his followers that fuel division and hate.</p><p>There is no exact definition of a constitutional crisis. Presumably it's when the United States Constitution is in crisis.\u00a0And it is in crisis now, today, because the president of the United States is abusing it to entrench his power.</p><p>As long as he can get away with it, as long as Republicans who control Congress won't stand up to him, as long as Americans who oppose this have no capacity to stop him, even though they may be in the majority, this rogue president will do more and more damage to our system of government. And the constitutional crisis will worsen.</p><p>A malignant megalomaniac facing no countervailing power will continue to expand his terrain until he is stopped.</p><p>The best response is to vote for a Congress this November that will constrain him. And then, in November 2020, vote him and his regime out of office.</p><p>If he refuses to accept the results of that election \u2013 as he threatened to do if he lost the 2016 election \u2013 he must be removed from office.</p><p>back to the top</p><p>next page</p><p>Discuss on Facebook</p><p>Click for Town Square Videos</p><p>10 STEPS TO FINDING COMMON GROUND</p><p>Trump has intentionally cleaved America into two warring camps: pro-Trump or anti-Trump. Most Americans aren't passionate conservatives or liberals, Republicans or Democrats. But they have become impassioned for or against Trump.</p><p>As a result, people with different political views have stopped talking with each other. This is a huge problem because democracy depends on our capacity to deliberate together.</p><p>So what can we do\u2013all of us\u2013to begin talking across the great divide? Here are 10 suggestions:</p><p>1. Don't avoid political conversations with people who are likely to disagree with you, even in your own family. To the contrary, seek them out and have those discussions.</p><p>2. Don't start by talking about Trump. Start instead with \"kitchen table\" issues like stagnant wages, shrinking benefits, the escalating costs of health care, college, pharmaceuticals, housing.</p><p>3. Make it personal. Ask them about their own experiences and stories. Share yours. Try to find common ground.</p><p>4. Ask them why they think all this has happened. Listen carefully and let them know you've heard them.</p><p>5. If they start blaming immigrants or African-Americans, or elites, or Democrats, or even Obama \u2013 stay cool. Don't tune out. Ask them about why they think these people are responsible.</p><p>6. Gradually turn the conversation into one about power \u2013 who has it, who doesn't. Ask about their own experiences at work, what's happened to their jobs, how others among their families and friends are treated.</p><p>7. Ask them about the roles of big corporations and Wall Street. For example:</p><p>\u2013Why is it that when corporations and Wall Street firms violate the law, no executive goes to jail?</p><p>\u2013Why did Wall Street get bailed out during the financial crisis but homeowners caught in the downdraft didn't get help?</p><p>\u2013Why do big oil, big agriculture, big Pharma, and Wall Street hedge-fund managers get special subsidies and tax loopholes?</p><p>8. Get a discussion going about how the system is organized, for whom, and how it's been changing. For example:</p><p>\u2013Why is it that only 4 major airlines fly today when a few years ago there were 12? Why are there only 4 Internet service providers?</p><p>\u2013How is this increasing concentration of economic power across the entire economy driving up prices?</p><p>\u2013Why are pharmaceutical companies and health insurers able to charge more and more?</p><p>\u2013Why can corporations and their top executives declare bankruptcy and have their debts forgiven, when bankruptcy isn't available to people laden with student debt or to homeowners who can't meet their payments?</p><p>\u2013Why are the biggest benefits from the tax cut going to billionaires?</p><p>9. Then get to the core issue: Do they think any of this has to do with big money in politics?</p><p>\u2013Is the system rigged?\u00a0And if so, who's doing the rigging, and why?</p><p>\u2013How can average people be heard when there's so much big money in politics? Should we try to get big money out of politics?</p><p>\u2013And if so, how do we do it?</p><p>Notice, you're not using labels. You're not talking about Democrats or Republicans, left or right, capitalism or socialism, government or free market. You're not even talking about Trump.</p><p>You're starting with the everyday experiences of most people\u2013with their wages and living expenses and experiences on the job\u2013 and from there moving to economic and political power.</p><p>10. Oh, and don't forget to use humor. Humor is the great disinfectant. For example, the Supreme Court says corporations are people. Well, you'll believe they're people when Texas executes a corporation.</p><p>Remember, the point isn't to convince them you're right and they're wrong. It's to get us thinking about what's really happening to America. It's exposing the abuses of power all around us.</p><p>If we can join together around these fundamental issues, we will all win</p><p>TRUMP AND THE ART OF THE NO DEAL</p><p>Donald Trump promised to be America's dealmaker-in-chief, touting his \"extraordinary\" ability to negotiate. But so far, Trump has shown he can't make a deal. Here's the list of biggest no-deals:</p><p>1. No deal with North Korea. Following his summit with Kim Jong Un, Trump declared on Twitter that \"there is no longer a nuclear threat\" from North Korea. But in fact, there's no deal. Kim conceded nothing on weapons and missile programs. Recent satellite imagery shows North Korea is actually improving its nuclear capability.</p><p>2. No deal with Russia. At the Helsinki summit, Russia agreed to nothing. But Trump gave away the store, even casting doubt on Russia's collusion in the 2016 election in the face of the conclusions of America's own intelligence agencies.</p><p>3.\u00a0No deal with China on trade. Instead, we're on the brink of a trade war with China, which is retaliating against U.S. tariffs.</p><p>4.\u00a0No deal with Europe on trade. Instead, Europe has merely agreed to negotiate towards a resolution of the trade war Trump provoked in the first place.</p><p>5. No deal on Iran. Trump announced America's exit from the Iran nuclear deal. Since then, no negotiations.</p><p>6.\u00a0No deal on climate change. Trump simply pulled out of the Paris accords. There have been no negotiations since.</p><p>7.\u00a0No deal with the Group of 7 leading economic powers. Instead, Trump just pulled out of the joint communique.</p><p>8.\u00a0No deal on immigration or the DREAMers.\u00a0Trump promised a new immigration bill, and a new deal from the young people brought to America as children. But since then, nothing.</p><p>9. No budget deal with Congress.\u00a0The government is still operating under a\u00a0\"continuing resolution.\"</p><p>10. No deal on replacing the Affordable Care Act. Trump promised to \"repeal and replace\" the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0But there's been no repeal, and no replacement. He and\u00a0the Republican Congress never agreed to a new plan.</p><p>11. No deal on gun control. After the Parkland shooting, Trump promised to tighten background checks for gun buyers and said he'd consider raising the age for buying certain types of guns. Instead, he bowed to the NRA.</p><p>Bottom line: Trump can't make deals. He can only pull out of deals already made, or pretend he's made deals that soon evaporate, or give away the store.</p><p>He's perfected the art of the no deal.</p><p>THE BIGGEST THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY THAT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF<br/>The biggest threat to our democracy that nobody is talking about is the real possibility of a rogue Constitutional convention \u2013 empowering extremists to radically reshape the Constitution, our laws, and our country.</p><p>If just a few more states sign on to what's called an \"Article V convention\" for a balanced budget amendment, there's no limit to the damage they might do.</p><p>Let me explain.</p><p>There are 2 ways to amend the United States Constitution: One way \u2013 the way we've passed every amendment since the Bill of Rights \u2013 is for two-thirds of the House and two-thirds of the Senate to vote for a proposed amendment, and then have it ratified by at least three quarters of the states \u2013 now 38 in number.</p><p>But there's a second way to amend the Constitution. Two thirds of the states may demand that Congress form a constitutional convention to propose amendments.</p><p>Once such a constitutional convention is convened, there are no rules to limit or constrain what comes next.</p><p>Amendments proposed by an Article V convention are supposed to be ratified by 38 states. But convention delegates could hijack the process and change the ratification process itself, tossing out the 38 state requirement.</p><p>A balanced budget amendment would be crazy enough. But nothing would be safe. A woman's right to choose. Marriage equality. First Amendment protections for free speech and a free press. Equal protection of the laws. Checks and balances.</p><p>An Article V convention would allow delegates to write their own agenda into our Constitution.</p><p>Already 28 states have called for a constitutional convention. They only need 6 more to succeed.</p><p>Unlimited money in politics and partisan gerrymandering have already given Republicans control of a majority of state legislatures. Big money interests like the Koch Brothers and ALEC are investing heavily in the push for a constitutional convention \u2013 which means that they'd be calling the shots if one takes place.</p><p>You're\u00a0probably already overwhelmed with political actions you need to take. But, believe me, this is important. With just a few states to go, your voice is needed. Please tell your state lawmakers to reject calls for an Article V convention.</p><p>THE ROADBLOCK TO COMMON SENSE PENSION REFORM</p><p>55 million Americans \u2014 about half of the entire private-sector workforce \u2014 have no employer-sponsored retirement plan at all. Many work for small businesses in the low-wage service and hospitality sectors. If they don't save money independently, they will have nothing when they stop working.</p><p>This is very different from four decades ago when most workers retired with a company pension.</p><p>The good news is that several states \u2013 including Oregon, California, Illinois, Connecticut, and Maryland \u2014 now let such workers put money away in state-sponsored retirement plans that allow them to withdraw their accumulated savings, tax free, when they hit retirement.</p><p>The bad news is that the investment industry is aggressively seeking to block these plans, fearing the competition.</p><p>That's because the fees charged by most state retirement plans are capped at around 1 percent \u2013 much lower than the fees of similar plans operated by banks and investment companies. And state fees are expected to drop even lower as more workers enroll.</p><p>If each of America's 40 million retirees saved on average $50,000 in the state program, they'd have an additional $20 billion in the first year. That's $20 billion more in the pockets of retirees, not financial institutions.</p><p>Right now, the industry's efforts appear to be winning.</p><p>Republicans in Congress \u2013 backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a coalition of Wall Street investment firms \u2013 are seeking to block states from implementing these plans at all.</p><p>Investment and insurance companies are also spending like mad on election campaigns of friendly state legislators and threatening lawsuits. Which is why many proposed state-run retirement plans are languishing in statehouses around the country.</p><p>Folks, the anger and frustration that led to Trump continues to simmer. If we allow the moneyed interests to block common-sense reforms like this, in future years, America could face an even worse fate than Trump.</p><p>When you vote in November, vote for legislators who want to allow workers to save for retirement and against legislators who are shills for the financial sector.</p><p>6 REASONS FOR HOPE IN TRUMP TIMES</p><p>In these darkest of days, here's what gives me hope:</p><p>First, Donald Trump has been a giant wake-up call that we can't take democracy for granted.

Presumably it's when the United States Constitution is in crisis.\u00a0And it is in crisis now, today, because the president of the United States is abusing it to entrench his power.</p><p>As long as he can get away with it, as long as Republicans who control Congress won't stand up to him, as long as Americans who oppose this have no capacity to stop him, even though they may be in the majority, this rogue president will do more and more damage to our system of government. And the constitutional crisis will worsen.</p><p>A malignant megalomaniac facing no countervailing power will continue to expand his terrain until he is stopped.</p><p>The best response is to vote for a Congress this November that will constrain him. And then, in November 2020, vote him and his regime out of office.</p><p>If he refuses to accept the results of that election \u2013 as he threatened to do if he lost the 2016 election \u2013 he must be removed from office.</p><p>IS TRUMP A TRAITOR?</p><p>Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki was a betrayal of the nation he has a sworn duty to protect.</p><p>Under Article III Section 3 of the Constitution, the crime of\u00a0treason\u00a0is defined as \"giving aid and comfort\" to enemies of the United States. Trump has betrayed the American people in 5 ways we already know of:</p><p>1.\u00a0He ignores attacks on our democracy. According to American intelligence, there's no doubt about Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. And no doubt they're continuing to attack, and planning further attacks, on our democratic institutions and even our energy infrastructure.</p><p>Yet\u00a0Trump casts doubt about the conclusions of the intelligence community, blames past presidents, and turns a blind eye to safeguarding America from current and future attacks.</p><p>2.\u00a0He publicly undermines U.S. intelligence officials\u00a0\u2013 taking the side of Putin, a former KGB officer, when Putin claims Russia didn't interfere in the election. And Trump accuses his own government officials of being part of a so-called \"deep-state\" conspiracy out to get him.</p><p>3.\u00a0He attacks our closest allies, weakening America's standing in the world and playing into Putin's hands. During his trip to Europe, Trump insulted German Chancellor Angela Merkel, mocked British Prime Minister Theresa May, and was rebuked by the French President. His unreasonable demands on NATO \u2013 that members increase their military expenditures to 4 percent of their GDPs \u2013 have frayed our most important security alliance.</p><p>4.\u00a0His campaign knowingly sought help from a Russian agent.\u00a0In June, 2016, senior members of Trump's campaign, including Don Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort, met with a Russian lawyer who, before they met, had promised them damaging information on Clinton.</p><p>5.\u00a0Then in July 2016 Trump publicly encouraged Russia to meddle in our election,\u00a0asking Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's email server and release the emails to the public. That same day Russian operatives initiated their cyberattack, and weeks later released the emails.</p><p>Never before has a President of the United States so brazenly sided with a ruthless dictator intent on destroying American democracy.</p><p>If this is not\u00a0treason, what is it?</p><p>THE FOG OF TRUMP</p><p>Trump uses 5 tactics to create a fog of confusion and bewilderment, so we don't pay attention to the real damage he's doing \u2013\u00a0undermining our democracy; rewarding the rich and hurting the working class, middle class, and the poor; stoking hatefulness; and undercutting America's standing in the world.</p><p>1. His first tactic is to distract us \u2013 dominate the news with tweets and rants, accusations, who he's fired, who he's insulted, what he's demanded. He wants us to be so preoccupied with all this that we lose sight of the big picture.</p><p>2. His second tactic is to divide and conquer, pitting\u00a0groups against each other, riling up his base, stoking racial tensions, and vilifying opponents.\u00a0He targets transgender people in the military. Goes after athletes \u2013 mostly black \u2013 who won't stand for the anthem. Fuels fears of immigrants and foreigners, of liberals and Democrats. This way, public dialogue and discussion becomes so angry, bitter, and vitriolic that we end up shouting at each other instead of seeing the damage Trump is actually doing.</p><p>3. His third tactic is to\u00a0lie and distort. He generates a torrent of \"alternative facts\" so we become disoriented and confused. Asserting that 3 to 5 million people fraudulently voted for Hillary Clinton in the last election, with no evidence they did. That unauthorized immigrants are responsible for a disproportionate number of murders and rapes. That climate change isn't caused by people. His goal is for us to lose confidence in the truth so we can't be sure of what he's doing.</p><p>4. Fourth: conjure up conspiracies. He fuels paranoia about a \"deep state\" that's intent on removing him from office, engaged in a \"witch hunt\" to undermine him, plotting to impeach him. But he never identifies who or what this \"deep state\" actually is. The mere assertion of a conspiracy is enough to generate suspicion, erode trust in the political system and in the media, and sow doubts about anyone who criticizes him or any findings that could show he acted illegally.</p><p>5. Fifth and finally: accuse the accusers. He alleges that others are doing what he is in fact doing. When the media catch him in a lie, he accuses them of disseminating fake news. He allows corporate lobbyists to run departments and agencies, and then accuses critics of being part of the Washington swamp. He seeks to cover up whatever he and his aides did with Russian operatives, and then accuses investigators of a being involved in a coverup.</p><p>These 5 tactics are all designed to hide what Trump is actually doing so we don't mobilize against him. Be aware. Don't allow Trump's fog to cloud the truth.</p><p>7 TRUTHS ABOUT IMMIGRATION</p><p>1. A record high of 75 percent of Americans now say immigration is a \"good thing\" for the country.</p><p>2. America needs more immigrants, not fewer, because our population is rapidly aging.</p><p>3. Historically, new immigrants have contributed more to society in taxes than they have taken from society in terms of public assistance.</p><p>4. Most immigrants don't take jobs away from native-born Americans. To the contrary, their spending creates more jobs.</p><p>5. Trump's claim that undocumented immigrants generate more crime is dead wrong. Both legal and undocumented immigrants are significantly less likely to commit crimes than people born in the United States.</p><p>6. Violent crime rates in America are actually at historical lows, with the homicide rate back to its level from the early 1960s.</p><p>7. Illegal border crossings have been declining since 2014 \u2013 long before Trump's \"crackdown.\" There is no \"surge\" in illegal immigration.</p><p>Please spread the truth.</p><p>HOW TO PREVENT FUTURE TRUMPS</p><p>Why did so many working class voters choose a selfish, thin-skinned, petulant, lying, narcissistic, boastful, megalomaniac for president?</p><p>It's important to know, because we need to stop more Trumps in the future.</p><p>The answer lies in the interplay between deep-seated racism and stagnant and declining wages. Both must be addressed.</p><p>Some white working class men and women were \u2013 and still are \u2013 receptive to Trump's bigotry.\u00a0 But what made them receptive? Racism and xenophobia aren't exactly new to American life. Fears of blacks and immigrants have been with us since the founding of the Republic.</p><p>What changed was the economy. Since the 1980s, the wages and economic prospects of the typical American worker have stagnated. Nearly 80 percent now live paycheck to paycheck, and those paychecks have grown less secure.</p><p>Meanwhile, all the economy's gains have gone to the richest ten percent, mostly the top 1 percent. Wealthy individuals and big corporations have, in turn, invested some of those gains into politics.</p><p>As a result, big money now calls the shots in Washington \u2013 getting subsidies, tax breaks, tax loopholes (even Trump promised to close the \"carried interest\" loophole yet it remains), and bailouts.</p><p>The near meltdown of Wall Street in 2008 caused a recession that cost millions their jobs, homes, and savings. But the Street got bailed out and not a single Wall Street executive went to jail.</p><p>In the two years leading up to the 2016 election, I revisited many of the places I had visited when I was labor secretary in the 1990s.</p><p>People told me the system was \"rigged\" against them. A surprising number said they planned to vote either for Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump \u2013 the two anti-establishment candidates who promised to \"shake up\" Washington.</p><p>But Trump's racism and xenophobia focused the cumulative economic rage on scapegoats that had nothing to do with its causes. It was hardly the first time in history a demagogue has used this playbook.</p><p>If America doesn't respond to the calamity that's befallen the working class, we will have Trumps as far as the eye can see.</p><p>A few Democrats are getting the message \u2013 pushing ambitious ideas like government-guaranteed full employment, single-payer health care, industry-wide collective bargaining, and a universal basic income.</p><p>We also need ways to finance these things, such as a carbon tax, a tax on Wall Street trades, and a progressive tax on wealth.</p><p>To accomplish all this we have to get big money out of politics.</p><p>Even if \"Citizens United\" isn't overruled, big money's influence can be limited with generous public financing of elections, full disclosure of the source of all campaign contributions, and a clampdown on the revolving door between business and government.</p><p>Trump isn't the cause of what's happened to America. He's the consequence \u2013 the product of years of stagnant wages and big money's corruption of our democracy combined with a long legacy of racism and bigotry.</p><p>If we really want to stop Trump and prevent future Trumps, we will need to address these causes of Trump's rise.</p><p>What We Must Do Now</p><p>My friends, this is a dark hour. Intolerance, cruelty, racism, misogyny, xenophobia, and environmental destruction have been let loose across the land.</p><p>Trump controls the Republican Party, the Republican Party controls the House and Senate, and Trump may soon control the Supreme Court.</p><p>But here's the thing. Only 27 percent of Americans are Republican, according to the Gallop Poll.</p><p>Moreover, the vast majority of Americans disapprove of Trump. He lost the popular vote in 2016 by 2.8 million. Since then, his approval ratings haven't exceeded 45 percent.</p><p>The GOP itself is no longer a political party, anyway. It is now little more than Donald Trump, Fox News, a handful of billionaire funders, and rightwing Christians who oppose a woman's right to choose, gay marriage, and the Constitution's separation of church and state.</p><p>Yet Trump is about to make the second Supreme Court nomination of his presidency. And that second nominee \u2013 like Trump's first, Neil Gorsuch \u2013 is likely to be young enough to remain on the Court for the next 40 years.</p><p>If confirmed, Trump's new justice would join four other Republican-appointed justices to form a majority that will interpret the U.S. Constitution and laws in ways inimical to the values of a majority of Americans.</p><p>For example, Trump's new justice is all but certain to join the four other Republican-appointed justices in overturning Roe v. Wade, a 1973 compromise on abortion that still has the support of two-thirds of Americans.</p><p>Trump's new justice is likely to do the same in revoking same-sex marriage, also now supported by about two-thirds of Americans.</p><p>I don't have to remind you that this comes after Republicans essentially stole a Supreme Court seat by refusing to consider President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland.</p><p>In addition to everything I've noted above, Republicans also now control both chambers in 32 states (33 if you count Nebraska) and 33 governorships.</p><p>In many of these states they are entrenching their power by gerrymandering and arranging to suppress votes.</p><p>Enough. The question is what are we \u2013 the vast majority \u2013 to going to do about this?</p><p>I have six modest suggestions.</p><p>First and most importantly, do not give up. That's what they would like us to do. Then they'd have no opposition at all. Powerlessness is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Please do not succumb to it.</p><p>Second, in the short term, contact your senators and urge them to oppose Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court.</p><p>If your state has a Republican senator, you might mobilize and organize your friends and neighbors to do whatever they can to get that senator to reject Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Or, at the least, postpone consideration of that nominee until after the midterm elections, so there's a chance to change the composition of the Senate.</p><p>Third, make a ruckus. Demonstrate. Engage in non-violent civil disobedience. Fight lies with truth. Join the resistance.</p><p>Many grass-roots organizations are doing great work, and could use your help. Among them are: @IndivisibleTeam, @swingleft, @UpRiseDotOrg, @MoveOn. @Sister_District, and @flippable_org. I'm sure I've left out many others. Check with your friends, and check online.</p><p>Fourth, don't engage in divisive incrimination over \"who lost\" the 2016 election. There's no point in Hillary loyalists, Bernie supporters, Jill Stein voters, and others turning on one another again, and blaming each other for the outcome. We must be united.</p><p>Fifth, vote this November 6 for people who will stand up to the Trump Republican's rampage. Mobilize and organize others to do so, too. If you live in a \"blue\" state, contact friends and relations in \"red\" states and urge them to do the same.</p><p>Sixth, help lay the groundwork for the 2020 presidential election, so that even if Trump survives Robert Mueller's investigation and a possible impeachment proceeding, he will not be reelected.</p><p>Finally, know that this fight will be long and hard. It will require our patience, our courage, and our resolve.</p><p>The stakes could not be higher. We're talking about the future of our democracy, and the wellbeing of our children and their children's children.</p><p>The Trump Takeover of the Courts</p><p>Trump's most lasting legacy might be his impact on the federal court system. It must be stopped.</p><p>Quite apart from the Supreme Court, Trump is already having a dramatic effect on the lower federal courts.</p><p>Even though much of his legislative agenda has stalled in Congress, Trump is nominating and getting Senate confirmation of judges to the federal bench much faster than previous presidents.</p><p>Many of Trump's picks for these lifetime positions are extremists with little judicial experience. For example, Thomas Farr, his nominee for a North Carolina judgeship has ties to a group that has promoted white supremacist policies and eugenics.</p><p>Other Trump picks have openly spread conspiracy theories, defended lethal injection, and one even called a sitting Supreme Court justice a \"prostitute.\"</p><p>Fortunately, not all of them have been confirmed. But by the end of his first term Trump could end up filling over 20 percent of the judges in the federal courts.</p><p>And even if he's removed from office, these judges will be around long after he's gone. Trump has identified young candidates who could serve for decades.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mitch McConnell is greasing the wheels in the Senate to speed up the confirmation process.</p><p>Traditionally either senator from a judicial nominee's home-state was allowed to block a nomination. But McConnell has done away with this rule, even though he did everything he possibly could to block President Obama's nominees, including his pick for the Supreme Court.</p><p>This takeover of the federal bench is another assault on our democracy. The power of the courts is being placed in the hands of people who share Trump's ideology.</p><p>That's why we need to keep up the pressure, and it's another reason why we need to win back the Senate.</p><p>THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL DRAIN</p><p>As Trump stokes tensions around the world, he's adding fuel to the fire by demanding even more Pentagon spending. It's a dangerous military buildup intended to underwrite endless wars and enrich defense contractors, while draining money from investment in the American people.</p><p>President Dwight D. Eisenhower once noted, \"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.\"</p><p>Eisenhower was a Republican and a former general who helped win World War II for the allies, yet he understood America's true priorities. But Washington\u2013and especially Trump\u2013have lost sight of these basic tradeoffs.</p><p>Since 2001, the Pentagon budget has soared from $456 billion\u2013in today's dollars\u2013to $700 billion, including the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and other national security expenses. All told, when you include spending on the military and war, veterans' benefits, and homeland security, military-related spending now eats up 67 percent of all federal \u00a0discretionary spending.</p><p>According to the 2018 Military Balance report by the International Institute of Strategic Studies, the United States already spends more on the military than the next 10 nations combined. Even if the Pentagon budget were cut in half, the United States would still outspend China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea combined.</p><p>The military budget has become bloated with waste and abuse. According to the Pentagon's own internal figures, the department could save at least $125 billion by reducing operational overhead.</p><p>Out-of-control defense contractors also drive up spending. In the coming years, cost overruns alone are projected to reach an estimated $484 billion. Meanwhile, the CEOs of the top 5 defense firms took home $97.4 million in compensation last year.</p><p>Despite all this, some still argue that military spending is necessary to support good-paying jobs and economic growth. Baloney. America would be much better served by a jobs program that invested in things we really need \u2013 like modern roads and highways, better school facilities, public parks, water and sewer systems, and clean energy \u2013 not weapons systems.</p><p>The biggest reason for increases in Pentagon spending is the incredible clout of the military-industrial complex \u2013 Eisenhower's term. Every year, defense contractors spend millions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions to keep federal dollars flowing their way. More than 80 percent of top Pentagon officials have worked for the defense industry at some point in their careers, and many will go back to work in the defense industry.</p><p>Since taking office, Trump has increased military spending by more than $200 billion. Let's take a second to look at how else that $200 billion could be spent. \u00a0We could, for example:</p><p>Offer free public colleges and universities, as proposed by Bernie Sanders.</p><p>And fund the Children's Health Insurance Program.</p><p>And expand broadband Internet access to rural America.</p><p>And meet the growing needs for low-income housing, providing safe living conditions for families and the elderly.</p><p>And help repair the physical devastation in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.</p><p>Spending more on bombs and military machinery funnels money away from the American people and into wars. It's time to rein in Pentagon spending and this endless war machine, and demand investment in America.</p><p>THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL CENSUS POWER GRAB</p><p>The Trump administration's decision to alter the 2020 Census to ask people if they are American citizens is an unconstitutional\u00a0power grab that\u00a0would hurt many disadvantaged Americans. It must be stopped.</p><p>The U.S. Constitution calls for \"actual enumeration\" of the total population for an explicit purpose: \u00a0To count the residents \u2013 not just citizens, residents \u2013 of every state to properly allocate congressional representatives to the states based on population.</p><p>Asking whether someone is a citizen could cause some immigrants \u2014 not just non-citizens, but also those with family members or close friends who aren't citizens \u2014 not to respond for fear that they or their loved ones would be deported. In the current climate of fear, this isn't an irrational response.</p><p>The result would be a systemic undercounting of immigrant communities \u2013 with two grossly unfair results.</p><p>First, these communities and the states they're in would get less federal aide. Census data is used in over 132 programs nationwide to allocate over $675 billion each year.</p><p>An undercount would deprive many immigrant communities and their states of the health care, education and assistance they need and are entitled to.</p><p>Second, these communities and the states they're in would have fewer representatives in Congress.\u00a0The Census count determines the distribution of congressional seats among states. Under the Constitution, these seats depend on the total number of people residing in the state, not just citizens.</p><p>Which is the real reason for this move by the Trump administration. It's no secret that immigrants with the right to vote tend to vote for Democrats. So undercounting neighborhoods that are heavily Latino or Asian would mean fewer Democratic members of Congress.</p><p>Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says the citizenship question is necessary in order to better enforce the Voting Rights Act. Baloney. The Trump administration has shown zero interest in the Voting Rights Act. It has even defended voter suppression laws in court.</p><p>This is nothing but a Republican power grab orchestrated by the White House. Tell your members of Congress, it must be stopped.</p><p>VOTER TURNOUT IS EVERYTHING\u00a0<br/>The largest political party in America isn't the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. It's the Party of Non-Voters.<br/>94 million Americans who were eligible to vote in the 2016 election didn't vote. That's a bigger number than the number who voted either for Trump or for Clinton.</p><p>All of which means that voter turnout will determine who wins control of Congress next November, and who becomes president in 2020. Turnout is everything.</p><p>This is why it's so important for you to vote \u2013 and urge everyone you know to vote, too.</p><p>THINKING BEYOND TRUMP: WHY WE NEED A FEDERAL JOBS GUARANTEE</p><p>We must not forget the economic frustrations that helped fuel Trump's election. \u00a0For too long, too many Americans have faced lousy jobs or no jobs. One answer: A guaranteed job at a living wage.</p><p>The Republican answer won't work</p><p>Republicans continue to push for work requirements for recipients of Medicaid, food stamps, and public housing benefits. \u00a0But the real problem is there aren't enough adequately-paying jobs to go around.</p><p>Even today, with a low official unemployment rate, millions who work part-time jobs want full-time work. Millions more are too discouraged to look for work, having endured the brutalities of job discrimination for far too long, or unable to move to where the jobs are.</p><p>And a large and growing number of jobs don't pay enough to get people out of poverty.</p><p>A federal jobs guarantee would work</p><p>At the same time, a lot of work needs to be done \u2013 \"greening\" our nation's infrastructure, caring for the elderly, teaching in our public schools, adequately staffing national parks, you name it.</p><p>So why shouldn't the federal government create jobs and connect them directly to people who can't otherwise find one, with decent, predictable hours and at a living wage?</p><p>An added plus: The availability of such jobs would give more bargaining power to many low-wage workers to get better hours and wages \u2013 because if they don't get them from their employer, they'd have the option of a public job. In this way, a federal job guarantee would raise the floor for job quality nationwide.</p><p>And a job guarantee would act as a giant economic stabilizer during downturns, when the first to lose their jobs are usually the most economically marginalized.</p><p>We can afford it</p><p>Can we afford a job guarantee today? Yes. It's estimated to cost around $670 billion in its first year \u2013 $30 billion less than the defense budget.</p><p>But that tab would quickly shrink. With more people working at better wages, Americans would have more purchasing power to buy goods and services. This would lead to more hiring by the private sector, and eventually, less need for the federal job guarantee.</p><p>More people working would also generate more tax revenue, partially offsetting the direct cost of the job guarantee.</p><p>Additional savings would come from fewer people needing public assistance. The Center for Labor Research and Education at Berkeley estimates that the federal government now spends over $150 billion a year because workers aren't earning enough to get out of poverty. Doesn't it make more sense to use this money to create guaranteed jobs at a living wage?</p><p>So, let's think beyond Trump \u2013 to what Americans need. Few things are more important than a decent job. Full employment through a federal job guarantee makes sense \u2013 for workers, for the economy, for America.</p><p>HOW TO END PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING</p><p>One of the biggest challenges to our democracy occurs when states draw congressional district lines with the principal goal of helping one political party and hurting the other.\u00a0It's called \"partisan gerrymandering.\"</p><p>Unlike racial gerrymandering \u2013 drawing districts to reduce the political power of racial minorities, which the Supreme Court has found to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment \u2013 partisan gerrymandering would seem to violate the First Amendment because it punishes some voters for their political views.</p><p>In North Carolina in 2016, for example, Republicans won 10 of the state's 13 House seats with just 53 percent of the popular vote.</p><p>In the 2018 elections, because of partisan gerrymandering, Democrats will need to win the national popular vote by nearly 11 points to win a majority in the House of Representatives. No party has won this margin in decades.</p><p>So what can be done?</p><p>The Supreme Court will soon decide on the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering. Hopefully, the Court will rule against it. But regardless of its decision, here are two other ways to abolish it:</p><p>First, state courts could rule against partisan gerrymandering under their state constitutions, as happened this year in Pennsylvania \u2013 where the state court invalidated a Republican congressional map that gave Republicans 13 out of 18 congressional seats even though the state is about evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. The state court implemented its own map for the 2018 election, creating districts that are less biased in favor of Republicans.</p><p>Second, states can delegate the power to design districts to independent or bipartisan groups. Some states, like California, have already done this.</p><p>But if you want your state to end gerrymandering, you're going to have to get actively involved, and demand it.</p><p>After all, this is our democracy. It's up to us to make it work.</p><p>THE MONOPOLIZATION OF AMERICA: The Biggest Economic Problem You're Hearing Almost Nothing About</p><p>Not long ago I visited some farmers in Missouri whose profits are disappearing. Why? Monsanto alone owns the key genetic traits to more than 90 percent of the soybeans planted by farmers in the United States, and 80 percent of the corn. Which means Monsanto can charge farmers much higher prices.</p><p>Farmers are getting squeezed from the other side, too, because the food processors they sell their produce to are also consolidating into mega companies that have so much market power they can cut the prices they pay to farmers.</p><p>This doesn't mean lower food prices to you. It means more profits to the monopolists.</p><p>Monopolies All Around\u00a0</p><p>America used to have antitrust laws that stopped corporations from monopolizing markets, and often broke up the biggest culprits. No longer. It's a hidden upward redistribution of money and power from the majority of Americans to corporate executives and wealthy shareholders.</p><p>You may think you have lots of choices, but take a closer look:</p><p>1. The four largest food companies control 82 percent of beef packing, 85 percent of soybean processing, 63 percent of pork packing, and 53 percent of chicken processing.</p><p>2. There are many brands of toothpaste, but 70 percent of all of it comes from just two companies.</p><p>3. You may think you have your choice of sunglasses, but they're almost all from\u00a0one company: Luxottica \u2013 which also owns nearly all the eyeglass retail outlets.</p><p>4. Practically every plastic hanger in America is now made by one company, Mainetti.</p><p>5. What brand of cat food should you buy? Looks like lots of brands but behind them are basically just two companies.</p><p>6. What about your pharmaceuticals? Yes, you can get low-cost generic versions. But drug companies are in effect paying the makers of generic drugs to delay cheaper versions. Such \"pay for delay\" agreements are illegal in other advanced economies, but antitrust enforcement hasn't laid a finger on them in America. They cost you and me an estimated $3.5 billion a year.</p><p>7. You think your health insurance will cover the costs? Health insurers are consolidating, too. Which is one reason your health insurance premiums, copayments, and deductibles are soaring.</p><p>8. You think you have a lot of options for booking discount airline tickets and hotels online? Think again. You have only two. Expedia merged with Orbitz, so that's one company. And then there's Priceline.</p><p>9. How about your cable and Internet service? Basically just four companies (and two of them just announced they're going to merge).</p><p>Why the Monopolization of America is a Huge Problem</p><p>The problem with all this consolidation into a handful of giant firms is they don't have to compete. Which means they can \u2013 and do \u2013 jack up your prices.</p><p>Such consolidation keeps down wages. Workers with less choice of whom to work for have a harder time getting a raise. When local labor markets are dominated by one major big box retailer, or one grocery chain, for example, those firms essentially set wage rates for the area.</p><p>These massive corporations also have a lot of political clout. That's one reason they're consolidating: Power.</p><p>Antitrust laws were supposed to stop what's been going on. But today, they're almost a dead letter. This hurts you.</p><p>We've Forgotten History</p><p>The first antitrust law came in 1890 when Senator John Sherman responded to public anger about the economic and political power of the huge railroad, steel, telegraph, and oil cartels \u2013 then called \"trusts\" \u2013 that were essentially running America.</p><p>A handful of corporate chieftains known as \"robber barons\" presided over all this \u2013 collecting great riches at the expense of workers who toiled long hours often in dangerous conditions for little pay. Corporations gouged consumers and corrupted politics.</p><p>Then in 1901, progressive reformer Teddy Roosevelt became president. By this time, the American public was demanding action.</p><p>In his first message to Congress in December 1901, only two months after assuming the presidency, Roosevelt warned, \"There is a widespread conviction in the minds of the American people that the great corporations known as the trusts are in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare.\"</p><p>Roosevelt used the Sherman Antitrust Act to go after the Northern Securities Company, a giant railroad trust run by J. P. Morgan, the nation's most powerful businessman. The U.S. Supreme Court backed Roosevelt and ordered the company dismantled.</p><p>In 1911, John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust was broken up, too. But in its decision, the Supreme Court effectively altered the Sherman Act, saying that monopolistic restraints of trade were objectionable if they were \"unreasonable\" \u2013 and that determination was to be made by the courts. What was an unreasonable restraint of trade?</p><p>In the presidential election of 1912, Roosevelt, running again for president but this time as a third party candidate, said he would allow some concentration of industries where there were economic efficiencies due to large scale. He'd then he'd have experts regulate these large corporations for the public benefit.</p><p>Woodrow Wilson, who ended up winning the election, and his adviser Louis Brandeis, took a different view. They didn't think regulation would work, and thought all monopolies should be broken up.</p><p>For the next 65 years, both views dominated. We had strong antitrust enforcement along with regulations that held big corporations in check.</p><p>Most big mergers were prohibited. Even large size was thought to be a problem. In 1945, in the case of United States v. Alcoa (1945), the Supreme Court ruled that even though Alcoa hadn't pursued a monopoly, it had become one by becoming so large that it was guilty of violating the Sherman Act.</p><p>What Happened to Antitrust?</p><p>All this changed in the 1980s, after Robert Bork \u2013 who, incidentally, I studied antitrust law with at Yale Law School, and then worked for when he became Solicitor General under President Ford \u2013 wrote an influential book called The Antitrust Paradox, which argued that the sole purpose of the Sherman Act is consumer welfare.</p><p>Bork argued that mergers and large size almost always create efficiencies that bring down prices, and therefore should be legal. Bork's ideas were consistent with the conservative Chicago School of Economics, and found a ready audience in the Reagan White House.</p><p>Bork was wrong. But since then, even under Democratic administrations, antitrust has all but disappeared.</p><p>The Monopolization of High Tech</p><p>We're seeing declining competition even in cutting-edge, high-tech industries.</p><p>In the new economy, information and ideas are the most valuable forms of property. This is where the money is.</p><p>We haven't seen concentration on this scale ever before.</p><p>Google and Facebook are now the first stops for many Americans seeking news. Meanwhile, Amazon is now the first stop for more than a half of American consumers seeking to buy anything. Talk about power.</p><p>Contrary to the conventional view of an American economy bubbling with innovative small companies, the reality is quite different. The rate at which new businesses have formed in the United States has slowed markedly since the late 1970s.</p><p>Big Tech's sweeping patents, standard platforms, fleets of lawyers to litigate against potential rivals, and armies of lobbyists have created formidable barriers to new entrants. Google's search engine is so dominant, \"Google\" has become a verb.</p><p>The European Union filed formal antitrust charges against Google, accusing it of forcing search engine users into its own shopping platforms. And last June, it fined Google a record $2.7 billion.</p><p>But not in America.</p><p>It's Time to Revive Antitrust</p><p>Economic and political power cannot be separated because dominant corporations gain political influence over how markets are organized, maintained, and enforced \u2013 which enlarges their economic power further.</p><p>One of the original goals of the antitrust laws was to prevent this.</p><p>Big Tech \u2014 along with the drug, insurance, agriculture, and financial giants \u2014 is coming to dominate both our economy and our politics.</p><p>There's only one answer:\u00a0It is time to revive antitrust.</p><p>CAN TRUMP FIRE SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER?</p><p>Yes, but at a huge cost to our system, and to Trump's presidency.</p><p>Begin with the law: Justice Department regulations issued in 1999, in the wake of Kenneth Starr's investigation of Bill Clinton, say that only an Attorney General can remove a special counsel, and not just for any reason. Such a removal must be based on a finding that the special counsel was guilty of \"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of Departmental policies.\"</p><p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation, so the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, is in charge. If Trump directed Rosenstein to fire Mueller, Rosenstein would have to find \"good cause\" to remove Mueller, or repeal the Department's regulation requiring such a finding, and then fire Mueller.</p><p>If Rosenstein refused, Trump could fire Rosenstein, and direct the next official in line to fire Mueller. And he could keep firing people down the chain of command until he got someone who would fire Mueller.</p><p>Richard Nixon did something like this in what came to be known as the \"Saturday Night Massacre,\" ordering Attorney General Elliott Richardson to fire the Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox. When Richardson refused and resigned in protest, Nixon then ordered Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus to fire Cox. Ruckelshaus also refused, and resigned. Nixon then ordered the Solicitor General, Robert Bork, who was then acting head of the Department, to fire Cox. Bork did the deed.</p><p>There's an alternative open to Trump. He could simply order Attorney General Sessions to repeal the special counsel regulations, and then Trump could fire Mueller himself.</p><p>But, as the Nixon saga showed, these routes would be perilous \u2013 both for Trump's presidency and for our system of government, because they would undermine public trust in the impartiality of our system of justice and in the office of the presidency.</p><p>They would also further divide the country between Trump supporters who believe the Mueller investigation to be part of a conspiracy to undermine the Trump presidency, and the vast majority of Americans who are more likely to believe, as a result of these actions, that Trump has done something that he wants to hide at all costs.</p><p>The question is whether Trump is willing to risk it, nonetheless</p><p>A THIRD PARTY? HOW NOT TO SETTLE FOR THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS</p><p>Are you happy with the electoral choices provided you by the two major parties? If not, should you vote for a third party candidate?</p><p>Not so fast. Remember what happened in 2016, when Libertarian Gary Johnson got 3.2 percent of the popular vote and Green Party candidate Jill Stein got 1.06 percent. Enough votes that, had they gone to Hillary Clinton, she'd have won the Electoral College, and Donald Trump wouldn't be in the White House.</p><p>Oh, and anyone remember what happened in 2000, when the votes that went to Ralph Nader all but sealed the fate of Al Gore, and gave us George W. Bush.</p><p>You see the problem? In a winner-take-all system like ours, votes for third party candidates siphon away votes from the major party candidate whose views are closest to that third-party candidate. So by not voting for the lesser of two evils, if that's what you want to call them, you end up with the worse of two evils.</p><p>But here's the good news. You've got at least 2 ways to avoid the lesser of two evils other than voting for a third party candidate.</p><p>First, you could build support for your favorite primary candidate inside one of the major parties \u2013 like some of you did for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primaries.</p><p>But, you might say, look what happened to Bernie! The Democratic Party establishment rigged the game against him.</p><p>I don't want to open up this particular can of worms, but if a party establishment has a chokehold on the primaries \u2013 the answer isn't to go with a third party and end up with the worse of two evils, but to organize and mobilize inside the party to break that choke hold, as some would say the Tea Party has done in the GOP.</p><p>Never underestimate the power of grassroots activism focused like a laser on taking over a major political party that has ossified.</p><p>Another way to avoid the lesser of two evils: Get your state to institute ranked-choice voting, also known as instant-runoff voting, which allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference.</p><p>The process is simple: In the first round, only voters' first choices are counted. If a candidate gets a majority, that's the end of it: That candidate wins. If no candidate gets a majority, the candidate who received the fewest votes is eliminated, and then the second choices of voters who preferred that candidate are counted.</p><p>If that gives a majority to one candidate, that candidate wins. If there's still no one with a majority, the process continues, \u00a0until one candidate gets a majority.</p><p>Ranked-choice voting isn't perfect, but it enables you to vote your conscience \u2013even for a third-party candidate \u2013 without the worry that you're giving ground to the candidate you like least.</p><p>The idea is gaining popularity. Last year, some form of ranked-choice voting was proposed in 19 states. In 2016, citizens in Maine initiated a referendum for ranked-choice voting and won. It's already being used in statewide special elections in North Carolina, and in 10 major cities.</p><p>You don't have to settle for the lesser of two evils. But in order to get the candidates you want elected you need to get involved, now. In the primaries. And in changing your state to ranked-choice voting.</p><p>It's our democracy. Whether it works, is up to us.</p><p>5 REASONS THE NRA IS WRONG</p><p>The next time you hear someone repeating pro-gun NRA propaganda, respond with these five points:</p><p>1. Gun laws save lives. Consider the federal assault weapons ban. After it became law in 1994, gun massacres \u2013 defined as instances of gun violence in which six or more people were shot and killed \u2013 fell by 37 percent. The number of people dying from mass shootings fell by 43 percent. But when Republicans in Congress let the ban lapse in 2004, gun massacres more than doubled.</p><p>2. The Second Amendment was never intended to permit mass slaughter. When the Constitution was written more than 200 years ago, the framers' goal was permit a \"well-regulated militia,\" not to enable Americans to terrorize their communities.</p><p>3. More guns have not, and will not, make us safer. More than 30 studies show that guns are linked to an increased risk for violence and homicide. In 1996,\u00a0Australia\u00a0initiated a mandatory buyback program to reduce `the number of guns in private ownership. Their firearm homicide rate fell 42 percent in the seven years that followed.</p><p>4. The vast majority of Americans want stronger gun safety laws. According to Gallup, 96 percent of Americans support universal background checks, 75 percent support a 30-day waiting period for all gun sales, and 70 percent favor requiring all privately owned guns to be registered with the police. Even the vast majority of gun owners are in favor of common-sense gun safety laws.</p><p>5. The National Rifle Association is a special interest group with a stranglehold on the Republican Party. In 2016, the group spent a record $55 million on elections. Their real goal is to protect a few big gun manufacturers who want to enlarge their profits.</p><p>America is better than the NRA. America is the young people from Parkland, Florida, who are telling legislators to act like adults. It's time all of us listen.</p><p>April Fools</p><p>Con Mannity here. Shrink deficits! States' rights! Stand up to Russia! Free Markets! \u00a0I'm a conservative from the old school, with a capital \"Con.\"\u00a0 And I love Donald Trump because he's sticking to the time-tested conservative beliefs I've been pushing on this show for years.</p><p>For Example, if there's one thing we conservatives believe its that we've got to shrink the deficit.</p><p>[News bulletin: Trump and Republican tax cut will explode the deficit]</p><p>Huh? [agitated] Actually, a lot of people don't understand this, but I tell people all the time\u2026 if the real conservative goal is to cut the deficit, then sometimes, maybe the best way to do that is to expand the deficit \u2013 so there's more to cut!\u00a0 Just think about that. \u2026</p><p>Old school conservatives like me have other principles, too, that Trump is championing. States' Rights! We conservatives hate having big government in Washington telling the states what to do.</p><p>[News bulletin: Trump and Sessions attacking California law legalizing pot]</p><p>Ok, I'm cool! [More agitated] When something bad is going down, like hippies smoking grass, that's more important than states rights. I hate hippies, don't you?\u00a0 And hate is a basic Republican principle. \u2026</p><p>Back to Basics! You can't trust Russia.\u00a0 Which is why Republicans came out against Obama's New Start treaty with Moscow, and complained that Obama wasn't doing enough to deter Russia in Ukraine.\u00a0 We have to get those bad-guy Ruskies and teach em' whose boss!</p><p>[News bulletin: Russia helped Trump win election.]</p><p>What? Russia helped Trump? [Wildly agitated] I mean, one thing I know, Trump's the boss, so Russia helping him get elected is teaching 'em who's boss.</p><p>Finally and not the least \u2013 basic conservative principle \u2013 free trade! Government, bad! Free markets, good!</p><p>[News bulletin: Trump starts trade war.]</p><p>Okay, we're back. [He's now upside down] It appears that\u00a0 everything is upside down. But that's okay.\u00a0 As long as we stay just\u2026like\u2026this\u2026 I'm still a conservative. I'm still Con Mannity, and this is still Rox News.</p><p>America has had its share of crooks (Warren G. Harding, Richard Nixon), bigots (Andrew Jackson, James Buchanan), and incompetents (Andrew Johnson, George W. Bush). But never before Donald Trump have we had a president who combined all these\u00a0nefarious\u00a0qualities.</p><p>America's great good fortune was to begin with the opposite \u2013 a superb moral leader. By June of 1775, when congress appointed George Washington to command the nation's army, he had already \"become a moral rallying post,\" as his biographer, Douglas Southall Freeman, described him. He was,\"the embodiment of the purpose, the patience, and the determination necessary for the triumph of the revolutionary cause.\"</p><p>Washington won the war and then led the fledgling nation \"by directness, by deference, and by manifest dedication to duty.\"</p><p>A president's most fundamental legal and moral responsibility is to uphold and protect our system of government. Donald Trump has degraded that system.</p><p>When he threatens to loosen federal libel laws so he can sue news organizations that are critical of him and revoke licenses of networks critical of him, he isn't just bullying the media. He's threatening the constitutionally guaranteed freedom and integrity of the press.</p><p>When he equated Neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members with counter-demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, by blaming \"both sides\" for the violence, he wasn't being neutral. He was condoning white supremacists, thereby undermining the constitution's guarantee of equal rights.</p><p>When he pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, for a criminal contempt conviction, he wasn't just signaling it's okay for the police to engage in violations of civil rights. He was also subverting the rule of law by impairing the judiciary's power to force public officials to abide by court decisions.</p><p>When he criticized NFL players for kneeling during the national anthem, he wasn't just demanding they demonstrate their patriotism. He was disrespecting their \u2013 and, indirectly, everyone's \u2013 freedom of speech.</p><p>When he berates the intelligence agencies and the federal bureau of investigation, he isn't just questioning their competence. He's suggesting they're engaged in a giant conspiracy to remove him from office \u2013 potentially inviting his most ardent supporters to engage in a new civil war.</p><p>When he boasts that he made up information in a meeting with the prime minister of Canada, he isn't just undermining his own credibility. He's undermining the credibility of the united states in the eyes of the world.</p><p>Donald Trump is degrading the core institutions and values of our democracy.</p><p>But America is fighting back.</p><p>In Alabama, voters turned out in droves to elect a Democrat to the senate for the first time in 25 years. In Pennsylvania, Republicans lost control of a congressional district that went for Trump by nearly 20 percentage points. Since Trump took office, Democrats have flipped 39 Republican-held state legislative seats.</p><p>The 2018 midterm elections are approaching. It's up to all of us to keep up the momentum. In the face of the worst president in history, we are at our best when striving to strengthen our democracy.</p><p>THE BUYBACK BOONDOGGLE IS BEGGARING AMERICA</p><p>Trump and Republicans branded their huge corporate tax cut as a way to make American corporations more profitable so they'd invest in more and better jobs.</p><p>But they're\u00a0buying back their stock instead.\u00a0Now that the new corporate tax cut is pumping up profits, buybacks are on track to hit a record $800 billion this year.</p><p>For years, corporations have spent most of their profits on buying back their own shares of stock, instead of increasing the wages of their employees, whose hard work creates these profits.</p><p>Stock buybacks should be illegal, as they were before 1983.</p><p>Stock buybacks are artificial efforts to interfere in the so-called \"free market\" to prop up stock prices. Because they create an artificial demand, they force stock prices above their natural level. With fewer shares in circulation, each remaining share is worth more.</p><p>Buybacks don't create more or better jobs. Money spent on buybacks isn't invested in new equipment, or research and development, or factories, or wages. It doesn't build a company. Buybacks don't grow the American economy.</p><p>So why are buybacks so popular with Corporate CEOs?</p><p>Because a bigger and bigger portion of CEO pay has been in stocks and stock options, rather than cash. So when share prices go up, executives reap a bonanza. The value of their pay from previous years also rises \u2013 in what amounts to a retroactive (and off the books) pay increase on top of their already outrageous compensation.</p><p>Buybacks were illegal until Ronald Reagan made them legal in 1982, just about the same time wages stopped rising for most Americans. Before then, a bigger percentage corporate profits went into increasing workers' wages.</p><p>But since corporations were already using their profits for stock buybacks, there is no reason to believe they'll use their tax windfall on anything other than more stock buybacks.</p><p>Let's not compound the error. Make stock buybacks illegal, as they were before 1982.</p><p>TRUMP'S HUMONGOUS INFRASTRUCTURE CON</p><p>It's the biggest Trump con since he told Americans the tax cut would help them more than the rich. He's calling for a $1.5 trillion boost in infrastructure spending \u2013 but he's proposing just $200 billion in federal funding.</p><p>So where does the rest come from? Tax hikes on the middle-class and poor, and from private investors.</p><p>1. State and local governments, already starved for cash, would have to raise taxes.</p><p>2. Private investors, for their part, won't pitch in unless they're guaranteed a good return on their investment, most likely in the form of tolls and other user fees. Or worse, governments might be forced to transfer ownership of roads and bridges to private corporations.</p><p>So the public will end up paying twice: in higher taxes and higher tolls, and won't even get what's needed.</p><p>3. Projects that will be most attractive to big investors are where tolls and fees will bring in the biggest bucks: Brand new highways and bridges rather than the thousands of smaller bridges, airports, pipes, and water treatment facilities most in need of repair.</p><p>4. Trump's infrastructure plan only worsens the racial justice divide in America, by leaving disadvantaged communities behind while giving massive profits to the rich and corporations through new tolls and fees.</p><p>5. It's a double con because now that Trump and the Republicans have enacted a huge tax cut for corporations and the rich, there's no money left for infrastructure. The White House says the $200 billion of federal spending will be offset by cuts elsewhere in the federal budget, but doesn't explain how or where. Given what we know of Trump's and the GOP's priorities, that means taking money from programs that protect vulnerable Americans, not from the billions in wasted on military spending.</p><p>A real infrastructure program \u2013 as opposed to Trump's fake program \u2013 would focus on repairing existing infrastructure, doing so based on need rather than financial returns, prioritizing public transportation over private, and clean water and renewable energy over projects that generate more pollution.</p><p>And it would be paid for by closing tax loopholes used by big corporations and the rich, not by imposing higher taxes, Trump tolls and user fees on the rest of us.</p><p>To really make America great again we need more and better infrastructure that's for the public \u2013 not for big developers and investors.</p><p>TRUMP'S BRAND IS AYN RAND</p><p>Donald Trump once said he identified with Ayn Rand's character Howard Roark in \"The Fountainhead,\" an architect so upset that a housing project he designed didn't meet specifications he had it dynamited.</p><p>Others in Trump's circle were influenced by Rand. \"Atlas Shrugged\" was said to be the favorite book of Rex Tillerson, Trump's secretary of state. Rand also had a major influence on Mike Pompeo, Trump's CIA chief. Trump's first nominee for Secretary of Labor, Andrew Puzder, said he spent much of his free time reading Rand.</p><p>The Republican leader of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, required his staff to read Rand.</p><p>Uber's founder and former CEO, Travis Kalanick, has described himself as a Rand follower. Before he was sacked, he applied many of her ideas to Uber's code of values, and even used the cover art for Rand's book \"The Fountainhead\" as his Twitter avatar.</p><p>Who is Ayn Rand and why does she matter?\u00a0 Ayn Rand \u2013 best known for two highly-popular novels still widely read today \u2013 \"The Fountainhead,\" published in 1943, and \"Atlas Shrugged,\" in 1957 \u2013 didn't believe there was a common good. She wrote that selfishness is a virtue, and altruism is an evil that destroys nations.</p><p>When Rand offered these ideas they seemed quaint if not far-fetched. Anyone who lived through the prior half century witnessed our interdependence, through depression and war.</p><p>After the war we used our seemingly boundless prosperity to finance all sorts of public goods \u2013 schools and universities, a national highway system, and healthcare for the aged and poor (Medicare and Medicaid). We rebuilt war-torn Europe. We sought to guarantee the civil rights and voting rights of African-Americans. We opened doors of opportunity to women. Of course there was a common good. We were living it.</p><p>But then, starting in the late 1970s, Rand's views gained ground. She became the intellectual godmother of modern-day American conservatism.</p><p>This utter selfishness, this contempt for the public, this win-at-any-cost mentality is eroding American life.</p><p>Without adherence to a set of common notions about right and wrong, we're living in a jungle where only the strongest, cleverest, and most unscrupulous get ahead, and where everyone must be wary in order to survive. This is not a society. It's not even a civilization, because there's no civility at its core. It's a disaster.</p><p>In other words, we have to understand who Ayn Rand is so we can reject her philosophy and dedicate ourselves to rebuilding the common good.</p><p>The idea of the common good was once widely understood and accepted in America. After all, the U.S. Constitution was designed for \"We the people\" seeking to \"promote the general welfare\" \u2013 not for \"me the selfish jerk seeking as much wealth and power as possible.\"</p><p>Yet today you find growing evidence of its loss \u2013 CEOs who gouge their customers, loot their corporations and defraud investors. Lawyers and accountants who look the other way when corporate clients play fast and loose, who even collude with them to skirt the law.</p><p>Wall Street bankers who defraud customers and investors. Film producers and publicists who choose not to see that a powerful movie mogul they depend on is sexually harassing and abusing young women.</p><p>Politicians who take donations (really, bribes) from wealthy donors and corporations to enact laws their patrons want, or shutter the government when they don't get the partisan results they seek.</p><p>And a president of the United States who lies repeatedly about important issues, refuses to put his financial holdings into a blind trust and then personally profits off his office, and foments racial and ethnic conflict.</p><p>The common good consists of our shared values about what we owe one another as citizens who are bound together in the same society. A concern for the common good \u2013 keeping the common good in mind \u2013 is a moral attitude. It recognizes that we're all in it together.</p><p>If there is no common good, there is no society.</p><p>WHY WE NEED RISE-UP ECONOMICS, NOT TRICKLE-DOWN</p><p>How to build the economy? Not through trickle-down economics. Tax cuts to the rich and big corporations don't lead to more investment and jobs.</p><p>The only real way to build the economy is through \"rise-up\" economics: Investments in our people \u2013 their education and skills, their health, and the roads and bridges and public transportation that connects them.</p><p>Trickle-down doesn't work because money is global. Corporations and the rich whose taxes are cut invest the extra money wherever around the world they can get the highest return.</p><p>Rise-up economics works because American workers are the only resources uniquely American. Their productivity is the key to our future standard of living. And that productivity depends on their education, health, and infrastructure.<br/><br/>Just look at the evidence.</p><p>Research shows that public investments grow the economy.</p><p>A recent study by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth found, for example, that every dollar invested in universal pre-kindergarten delivers $8.90 in benefits to society in the form of more productive adults.</p><p>Similarly, healthier children become more productive adults. Children who became eligible for Medicaid due to expansions in the 1980s and 1990s were more likely to attend college than similar children who did not become eligible.</p><p>Investments in infrastructure \u2013 highways, bridges, and public transportation \u2013 also grow the economy. It's been estimated that every $1 invested in infrastructure generates at least $1.60 in benefits to society. Some research puts the return much higher.</p><p>In the three decades following World War II, we made huge investments in education, health, and infrastructure. The result was rising median incomes.</p><p>Since then, public investments have lagged, and median incomes have stagnated.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush's tax cuts on the top didn't raise incomes, and neither will Donald Trump's.</p><p>Trickle-down economics is a hoax. But it's a convenient hoax designed to enrich the moneyed interests. Rise-up economics is the real deal. But we must fight for it.</p><p>Why the Common Good Disappeared (And How We Get it Back)</p><p>In 1963 over 70 percent of Americans trusted government to do the right thing all or most of the time; nowadays only 16 percent do.</p><p>There has been a similar decline in trust for corporations. In the late 1970s, 32 percent trusted big business, by 2016, only 18 percent did.</p><p>Trust in banks has dropped from 60 percent to 27 percent. Trust in newspapers, from 51 percent to 20 percent. Public trust has also plummeted for nonprofits, universities, charities, and religious institutions.</p><p>Why this distrust? As economic inequality has widened, the moneyed interests have spent more and more of their ever-expanding wealth to alter the rules of the game to their own advantage.</p><p>Too many leaders in business and politics have been willing to do anything to make more money or to gain more power \u2013 regardless of the consequences for our society.</p><p>We see this everywhere \u2013 in the new tax giveaway to big corporations, in gun manufacturer's use of the NRA to block gun controls, in the Koch Brother's push to roll back environmental regulations, in Donald Trump's profiting off his presidency.</p><p>No wonder much of the public no longer believes that America's\u00a0major institutions are working for the many. Increasingly, they have become vessels for the few.</p><p>The question is whether we can restore the common good. Can the system be made to work for the good of all?</p><p>Some of you may feel such a quest to be hopeless. The era we are living in offers too many illustrations of greed, narcissism, and hatefulness. But I don't believe it hopeless.</p><p>Almost every day I witness or hear of the compassion of ordinary Americans \u2013 like the thousands who helped people displaced by the wildfires in California and floods in Louisiana; like the two men in Seattle who gave their lives trying to protect a young Muslim woman from a hate-filled assault; like the coach who lost his life in Parkland, Florida, trying to shield students from a gunman; like the teenagers who are demanding that Florida legislators take action on guns.</p><p>The challenge is to turn all this into a new public spiritedness extending to the highest reaches in the land \u2013 a public morality that strengthens our democracy, makes our economy work for everyone, and revives trust in the major institutions of America.</p><p>We have never been a perfect union; our finest moments have been when we sought to become more perfect than we had been. We can help restore the common good by striving for it and showing others it's worth the effort.</p><p>I started my career a half-century ago in the Senate office of Robert F. Kennedy,\u00a0 when the common good was well understood, and I've watched it unravel over the last half-century.</p><p>Resurrecting it may take another half century, or more. But as the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr once said, \"Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime; therefore we must be saved by hope.\"</p><p>Trump Voters: One Year in, and he's Broken\u00a020 Big Promises He Made to You</p><p>1. He told you he'd cut your taxes, and that the super-rich like him would pay more. You bought it. But his new tax law does the opposite. By 2027, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the richest 1 percent will have got 83 percent of the tax cut and the richest 0.1 percent, 60 percent of it. But more than half of all Americans \u2014 53 percent \u2014 will pay more in taxes. As Trump told his wealthy friends at Mar-a-Lago just days after the tax bill became law, \"You all just got a lot richer.\"</p><p>2. He promised to close \"special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors but unfair to American workers,\" especially the notorious \"carried interest\" loophole for private-equity, hedge fund, and real estate partners. You bought it. But the new tax law keeps the \"carried interest\" loophole.</p><p>3. He told you he'd repeal Obamacare and replace it with something \"beautiful.\" You bought it. But he didn't repeal and he didn't replace. (Just as well: His plan would have knocked at least 23 million Americans off health insurance, including many of you.) Instead, he's doing what he can to cut it back and replace it with nothing. The new tax law will result in 13 million people losing health coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p><p>4. He told you he'd invest $1 trillion in our nation's crumbling infrastructure. You bought it. But after his giant tax cut for corporations and millionaires, there's no money left for infrastructure.</p><p>5. He said he'd drain the Washington swamp. You bought it. But he's brought into his administration more billionaires, CEOs, and Wall Street moguls than in any administration in history, to make laws that will enrich their businesses, and he's filled departments and agencies with former lobbyists, lawyers and consultants who are crafting new policies for the same industries they recently worked for.</p><p>6. He said he'd use his business experience to whip the White House into shape. You bought it. But he has created the most dysfunctional, back-stabbing White House in modern history, and has already fired and replaced so many assistants (one of them hired and fired in a little more than a week) that people there barely know who's in charge of what.</p><p>7. He told you he'd \"bring down drug prices\" by making deals with drug companies. You bought it. But now the White House says that promise is \"inoperative.\"</p><p>8. He told you he'd \"stop foreign lobbyists from raising money for American elections.\"\u00a0You bought it. But foreign lobbyists are still raising money for American elections.</p><p>9. He told you \"I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.\" You bought it. But he and House Speaker Paul Ryan are already planning such cuts in order to deal with the ballooning deficit created, in part, by the new tax law for corporations and the rich.</p><p>10. He promised \"six weeks of paid maternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit.\" You bought it. But the giant tax cut for corporations and the rich doesn't leave any money for this.</p><p>11. He said that on Day One he'd label China a \"currency manipulator.\" You bought it. But then he met with China's president Xi Jinping and declared \"China is not a currency manipulator.\" Ever since then, Trump has been cozying up to Xi.</p><p>12. He said he \"won't\u00a0bomb Syria.\"\u00a0You bought it. Then he bombed Syria.</p><p>13. He said he'd build a \"wall\" across the southern border. You believed him. But chief of staff John Kelly says it is \"unlikely that we will build a wall, a physical barrier, from sea to shining sea.\"</p><p>14. He promised that the many women who accused him of sexual misconduct \"will be sued after the election is over.\" You bought it. He hasn't sued them, presumably because he doesn't want the truth to come out.</p><p>15. He said he would not be a president who took vacations, and he called Barack Obama \"the vacationer-in-Chief.\" You bought it. But since becoming President he has spent nearly 25 percent of his days at one of his golf properties for some portion of the day, according to Golf News Network, at a cost to taxpayers of over $77 million. That's already more taxpayer money on vacations than Obama cost in the first 3 years of his presidency. Not to mention all the money taxpayers are spending protecting his family, including his two sons who travel all over the world on Trump business.</p><p>16. He said he'd force companies to keep jobs in America, and that there would be \"consequences\" for companies that shipped jobs abroad. You believed him. But despite their promises, Carrier, Ford, GM, and the rest have continued to ship jobs to Mexico and China. Carrier (a division of United Technologies) has moved ahead with plans to send 1,000 jobs at its Indiana plant to Mexico. Notwithstanding, the federal government has rewarded United Technologies with\u00a015 new contracts since Trump's inauguration. GE is sending jobs to Canada. IBM is sending them to Costa Rica, Egypt, Argentina, and Brazil. There have been no \"consequences\" for sending all these jobs overseas.</p><p>17. He promised to revive the struggling coal industry and \"bring back thousands\" of lost mining jobs. You bought it. But coal jobs continue to disappear. Since Trump's victory, at least 6 plants that relied on coal have closed or announced they will close. Another 40 are projected to close during the president's four-year term. Utilities continue to switch to natural gas instead of coal, and renewable energy is cheaper than ever.</p><p>18. He promised to protect steel workers. But according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, which tracks shipments, steel imports were 19.4 percent higher in the first 10 months of 2017 than in the same period last year. That import surge has hurt American steel workers, who were already struggling against a glut of cheap Chinese steel.</p><p>19. He said he'd make America safer. You believed him. But according to Mass Shooting Tracker, there have been 377 mass shootings so far in the Trump administration, including 58 people killed and hundreds injured at a concert in Las Vegas, and 26 churchgoers killed and 20 injured at a church in Texas. Trump refuses to consider any gun control legislation.</p><p>20. He said he'd release his taxes. \"I'm under a routine audit and it'll be released, and as soon as the audit is finished it will be released,\" he promised during the campaign. He hasn't released his taxes.</p><p>THE NEXT BIG FIGHT</p><p>Fresh off passing massive tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, Trump and congressional Republicans want to use the deficit they've created to justify huge cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.</p><p>As House Speaker Paul Ryan says \"We're going to have to get\u2026 at entitlement reform, which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit.\"</p><p>Don't let them get away with it.</p><p>Social Security and Medicare are critical safety-nets for working and middle-class families.</p><p>Before they existed, Americans faced grim prospects. In 1935, the year Social Security was enacted, roughly half of America's seniors lived in poverty.\u00a0 By the 1960s poverty among seniors had dropped significantly, but medical costs were still a major financial burden and only half of Americans aged 65 and over had health insurance. Medicare fixed that, guaranteeing health care for older Americans.</p><p>Today less than 10 percent of seniors live in poverty and almost all have access to health care. According to an analysis of census data, Social Security payments keep an estimated 22 million Americans from slipping into poverty.</p><p>Medicaid is also a vital lifeline for America's elderly and the poor. Yet the Trump administration has already started whittling it away by encouraging states to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients.</p><p>Republicans like to call these programs \"entitlements,\" as if they're some kind of giveaway.\u00a0 But Americans pay into Social Security and Medicare throughout their entire working lives. It's Americans' own money they're getting back through these programs.</p><p>These vital safety nets should be strengthened, not weakened. How?</p><p>1. Lift the ceiling on income subject to the Social Security tax. Currently, top earners only pay Social Security taxes on the first $120,000 of their yearly income. So the rich end up, in effect,\u00a0 paying a lower Social Security tax rate than everyone else. Lifting the ceiling on what wealthy Americans contribute would help pay for the Baby Boomers retirements and leave Social Security in good shape for Millennials.</p><p>2. Allow Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for lower prescription drug prices. As the nation's largest insurer, Medicare has tremendous bargaining power. Why should Americans pay far more for drugs than people in any other country?</p><p>3. Finally, reduce overall health costs and create a stronger workforce by making Medicare available to all. There's no excuse for the richest nation in the world to have 28 million Americans still uninsured.</p><p>We need to not just secure, but revitalize Social Security and these other programs for our children, and for our children's children.\u00a0 Millennials just overtook Baby Boomers as our nation's largest demographic.\u00a0 For them \u2014 for all of us \u2014 we need to say loud and clear to all of our members of congress:\u00a0 Hands off Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Expand and improve these programs: don't cut them.</p><p>THE BIG PICTURE OF HOW WE GOT INTO THIS MESS (OF TRUMP) AND HOW WE GET OUT OF IT</p><p>There's too much yelling these days, so we made this a silent video. (The only casualty was my arm, which ached for days afterward.) Hope you find it helpful. Best wishes for a 2018 that's better for America than 2017 was.</p><p>TELL THE FCC NOT TO END NET NEUTRALITY!</p><p>The FCC is voting Thursday on whether to repeal the \"Net Neutrality\" rule adopted in 2015.</p><p>Since its creation, the internet has been an open exchange of ideas and information, free from corporate control and influence. But corporations could soon have tremendous power over what we can access and share online, ending the internet as we know it.</p><p>In 2015, the FCC passed a landmark rule that prevents internet service providers from favoring some sites over others \u2013 slowing down connections or charging customers a fee for streaming or other services. It gave Americans equal access to all the content that's available on the internet \u2013 videos, social media, e-commerce sites, etc \u2013 at the same speeds.</p><p>Now, though, Donald Trump's handpicked chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, wants to abolish \"Net Neutrality.\" He wants to give telecommunications giants like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T the upper hand.</p><p>Pai \u2013 himself a former Verizon executive \u2013 defends the rollback by \"Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet.\" Baloney. His plan would be a huge gift to cable companies. It would:</p><p>1. Drive up prices for internet service. Broadband providers could charge customers higher rates to access certain sites, or raise rates for internet companies to reach consumers faster speeds. Either way, these prices hikes would be passed along to you and me.</p><p>2. Give corporate executives free reign to slow down and censor news or websites that don't match their political agenda, or give preference to their own content \u2013 for any reason at all.</p><p>3. Stifle innovation. Cable companies could severely hurt their competitors by blocking certain apps or online services. Small businesses who can't afford to pay higher rates could be squeezed out altogether.</p><p>Broadband providers claim that Net Neutrality rules actually hurts consumers because it\u00a0 discourages investment in their networks.</p><p>Rubbish. Since Net Neutrality was adopted, investment has remained consistent. During calls with investors, telecom executives themselves have even admitted that Net Neutrality hasn't hurt their businesses.</p><p>In the modern age, unfettered access to the internet is essential to a vibrant democracy and strong economy.</p><p>There's still time. Please help stop this corporate power grab over what we can say and do online.</p><p>SLAPP LAWSUITS: THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THE RESISTANCE YOU NEVER HEARD OF</p><p>Have you heard of SLAPP lawsuits? You soon will.</p><p>SLAPP stands for \"Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation.\" It is a lawsuit brought by big corporations intended to censor, intimidate, and silence critics by burdening them with the overwhelming costs of a legal defense until they're forced to abandon their criticism or opposition. And it may be the biggest threat to the resistance you've never heard of.</p><p>Here's an example: Resolute Forest Products, one of Canada's largest logging and paper companies, has sued, in a U.S. court, environmental groups that have been campaigning to save Canada's boreal forest.</p><p>Resolute based its lawsuit on a U.S. conspiracy and racketeering law (RICO) intended to ensnare mobsters. Resolute alleged that the environmental groups have been illegally conspiring to extort the company's customers and to defraud their own donors.</p><p>The suit wasn't designed to win in court. It was designed to distract and silence critics. This is punishment for speaking out. Thankfully, a federal court agrees and a judge just dismissed Resolute's claims. But other corporate bullies are still trying to use this playbook.</p><p>Here's another example: Remember the indigenous led movement at Standing Rock, when hundreds of nations and their allies came together and stood up against the destructive Dakota Access Pipeline?</p><p>In August, Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind that pipeline, filed a similar RICO case against Greenpeace entities and two other defendants over Standing Rock. The suit accuses them of participating in a sprawling criminal conspiracy to disrupt business and defraud donors. The lawsuit even alleges they support eco-terrorism and engage in drug trafficking.</p><p>The lawsuit claims Greenpeace cost the company $300 million. Since RICO claims entitle plaintiffs to recover triple damages, the case potentially could cost Greenpeace $900 million. That would be the end of Greenpeace.</p><p>But, again, winning isn't necessarily the goal of SLAPP suits. Just by filing the suits, Energy Transfer Partners and Resolute are trying to drain environmental groups of time, energy, and resources they need, so they can't continue to fight to protect the environment.</p><p>Connect the dots, and consider the chilling effect SLAPP suits are having on any group seeking to protect public health, worker's rights, and even our democracy.</p><p>Who's behind all of this? Both the lawsuits I just mentioned were filed by Michael Bowe. He is also a member of Donald Trump's personal legal team. Bowe has publicly stated that he's in conversations with other corporations considering filing their own SLAPP lawsuits.</p><p>If the goal is to silence public-interest groups, the rest of us must speak out. Wealthy corporations must know\u00a0 they can't SLAPP the public into silence.</p><p>The New Poll Tax</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of Americans are being denied the right to vote because they are poor.</p><p>In nine states, Republican legislators have enacted laws that disenfranchise anyone with outstanding legal fees or court fines. For example, in Alabama more than 100,000 people who owe money \u2013 roughly 3 percent of the state's voting-age population \u2013 have been struck from voting rolls.</p><p>This is unconstitutional. In 1964, the 24th amendment abolished the poll tax, a Jim Crow tactic used to bar poor blacks from voting.</p><p>These new laws are a modern reincarnation of that unconstitutional system, disproportionately disenfranchising people of color.</p><p>Income and wealth should have no bearing on the right to vote. Many Americans are struggling to make ends meet. But they still have a constitutional right to make their voices heard.</p><p>Preventing people from voting because they owe legal fees or court fines muzzle low-income Americans at a time in our nation's history when the rich have more political power than ever.</p><p>These state laws are another form of voter suppression \u2013 like gerrymandering, voter ID requirements, and bars on anyone with felony convictions from voting.</p><p>We must not let them stand.</p><p>A YEAR WITHOUT A PRESIDENT</p><p>It seems like forever, but it was just one year ago that Donald Trump was elected president. So what have we learned about the presidency and who is running the country?</p><p>1. The first big thing we've learned is that Trump is not really the president of the United States \u2013 because he's not governing.</p><p>A president who's governing doesn't blast his Attorney General for doing his duty and recusing himself from an FBI investigation of the president.</p><p>A president who's governing doesn't leave the top echelons of departments and agencies empty for almost a year.</p><p>He doesn't publicly tell his Secretary of State he's wasting time trying to open relations with North Korea. Any president with the slightest interest in governing would already know and approve of what his Secretary of State was doing.</p><p>He doesn't fire half his key White House staff in the first nine months, creating utter chaos.</p><p>A president who is governing works with his cabinet and staff to develop policy. He doesn't just tweet new public policy out of the blue \u2013 for example, that transgender people can't serve in the military. His Secretary of Defense is likely to have some thoughts on the matter \u2013 and if not consulted might decide to ignore the tweet.</p><p>He doesn't just decide to withdraw from the Paris Accord without any reason or analysis.</p><p>A president who is governing works with Congress. He doesn't just punt to Congress hard decisions \u2013 as he did with DACA, the Iran nuclear deal, insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, and details of his tax plan.</p><p>He doesn't tell a crowd of supporters that he's ended the Clean Power Plan \u2013 \"Did you see what I did to that? Boom, gone\" \u2013 when any such repeal requires a legal process, and must then withstand court challenges.</p><p>Instead of governing, Donald Trump has been insulting, throwing tantrums, and getting even:</p><p>Equating white supremacists with people who protest against them. Questioning the patriotism of NFL players who are peacefully protesting police violence and racism.</p><p>Making nasty remarks about journalists, about his predecessor as president, his political opponent in the last election, national heroes like Congressman John Lewis and Senator John McCain, even the mayor of San Juan Puerto Rico.</p><p>Or he's busy lying and then covering up the lies. Claiming he would have won the popular vote if millions hadn't voted fraudulently for his opponent \u2013 without a shred of evidence to support his claim, and then setting up a fraudulent commission to find the evidence.</p><p>Or firing the head of the FBI who wouldn't promise to be more loyal to him than to the American public.</p><p>A president's job is to govern. Trump doesn't know how to govern, or apparently doesn't care. So, logically, he's not President.</p><p>2. The second thing we've learned is that Trump's influence is waning.\u00a0</p><p>Since he lost the popular vote, his approval ratings have dropped even further. One year in, Trump is the least popular president in history with only 37 percent of Americans behind him.</p><p>Most Republicans still approve of him, but that may not be for long.</p><p>He couldn't get his pick elected to a Senate primary in Alabama, a state bulging with Trump voters.</p><p>Republican senators refused to go along with his repeal of the Affordable Care Act. And they're taking increased interest in Russia's interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>Business leaders deserted him over his remarks over Charlottesville. They vacated his business advisory councils.</p><p>NFL owners have turned on him over his remarks about players. Tom Brady, who once called Trump \"a good friend,\" now calls him \"divisive\" and \"wrong.\"</p><p>There's no question he's violated the Constitution. There are at least three grounds for impeachment \u2013 his violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution by raking in money from foreign governments, his obstruction of justice by firing the head of the FBI, and his failure to faithfully execute the law by not implementing the Affordable Care Act. And a fourth if he or his aides colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.</p><p>But both houses of Congress would have to vote for his removal, which won't happen unless Democrats win control in 2018 or Republicans in Congress decide Trump is a political liability.</p><p>3. The third big thing we've learned is where the governing of the country is actually occurring.</p><p>Much is being done by lobbyists for big business, who now swarm over the Trump administration like honey bees over a hedgerow of hollyhocks.</p><p>But the real leadership of America is coming from outside the Trump administration.</p><p>Leadership on the environment is now coming from California \u2013 whose rules every automaker and many other corporations have to meet in order to sell in a state that's home to one out of eight Americans.</p><p>Leadership on civil rights is coming from the federal courts, which have struck down three different versions of Trump's travel ban, told states their voter ID laws are unconstitutional, and pushed police departments to stop profiling and harassing minorities.</p><p>Leadership on the economy is coming from the Federal Reserve Board, whose decisions on interest rates are more important than ever now that the country lacks a fiscal policy guided by the White House.</p><p>Most of the rest of leadership in America is now coming from the grassroots \u2013 from people all over the country who are determined to reclaim our democracy and make the economy work for the many rather than the few.</p><p>They stopped Congress from repealing the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>They're fighting Education Secretary Betsy DeVos's plan to spend taxpayer money on for-profit schools and colleges that cheat their students.</p><p>They're fighting EPA director Scott Pruitt's crusade against climate science.</p><p>And Attorney General Jeff Sessions's attempts to tear down the wall between church and state.</p><p>They're fighting against the biggest tax cut for the wealthy in American history \u2013 that will be paid for by draconian cuts in services and dangerous levels of federal debt.</p><p>They're fighting against the bigotry, racism, and xenophobia that Trump has unleashed.</p><p>And they're fighting for a Congress that, starting with next year's midterm elections, will reverse everything Trump is doing to America.</p><p>But their most important effort \u2013 your effort, our effort \u2013 is not just resisting Trump. It's laying the groundwork for a new politics in America, a new era of decency and social justice, a reassertion of the common good.</p><p>Millions are already mobilizing and organizing. It's the one good thing that's happened since Election Day last year \u2013 the silver lining on the dark Trump cloud.</p><p>If you're not yet part of it, join up.</p><p>TRUMP'S TROJAN HORSE TAX CUT</p><p>The goal of Trump and the Republican leaders is to pull off a giant redistribution of over $1 trillion from the middle-class, working-class, and poor to the rich, who are already richer than ever.</p><p>They're selling this to the public with a false claim that the middle-class will benefit from their tax cut plan. It's a gigantic Trojan horse.</p><p>For most Americans, the proposed tax cuts are tiny and temporary. That's right \u2013 temporary.\u00a0 They will shrink in just a few years.\u00a0 And some middle class Americans will actually get a tax increase.</p><p>Meanwhile, the top 1 percent will get a gigantic tax cut. The Tax Policy Center estimates that the current plan will save the bottom 80 percent between $50 and $450 in taxes per year, but that it saves each person in the top 1 percent an average of $129,000 a year. For people at the very top, like Trump himself, the tax cuts are humongous. And the corporations they own will also get a massive tax cut.</p><p>Republicans say economic \"growth\" will pay for the tax cuts, so there's no need to cut social programs like Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>But Republicans have just passed a budget that would cut nearly $1.5 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid to pay for these tax cuts.\u00a0 Pell Grants, housing assistance, and even cancer research are also on the chopping block.</p><p>Now, they say we shouldn't take their budget resolution seriously. It was just a device to get the tax bill through the Senate with 51 votes.</p><p>But once these tax cuts are passed, the budget deficit will explode. The Tax Policy Center predicts that it will cut federal revenue by $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years.</p><p>When that happens, the only way out of the crisis will be something dramatic\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 exactly the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, and maybe even Social Security \u2013 that Republicans have wanted for years.</p><p>By this time, any talk of raising taxes on the rich will be dismissed.</p><p>Using the promise of middle-class tax cuts as a Trojan horse for a tax windfall for the rich and deep spending cuts is a tactic dating back to the Reagan administration.</p><p>But the version they're aiming for now is \"YUGE.\"</p><p>We must see the strategy for what it is.\u00a0 And it must be stopped.</p><p>AMERICA NOW HAS 6 POLITICAL PARTIES</p><p>The old Democratic and Republican parties are exploding. When you take a closer look, America actually has six political parties right now:</p><p>1. Establishment Republicans, consisting of large corporations, Wall Street, and major GOP funders. Their goal is to have their taxes cut.</p><p>2. Anti-establishment Republicans, consisting of Tea Partiers, the Freedom Caucus, and libertarians. Their goal is to have a smaller government with shrinking deficits and debts. Many of them also want to get Big Money out of politics and end crony capitalism.</p><p>3. Social conservative Republicans \u2013 evangelicals and rural Southern whites. They want America to return to what they call \"Christian\" values.</p><p>4. Establishment Democrats \u2013 corporate and Wall Street executives and upper middle-class professionals. They'd also like a tax cut, but they believe in equal rights.</p><p>5. Anti-establishment Democrats \u2013 younger, grassroots movement types, and progressives who still call themselves Democrats. Their biggest issues are widening inequality, racism, sexism, and climate change. They also want to get Big Money out of politics and they reject crony capitalism.</p><p>6. The sixth party is Trump. This party consists of Donald J. Trump and his fanatical followers. Trump's goal is to get more money for himself, get more power for himself, get more attention to himself, and get even.</p><p>Whoever can put together elements of a governing coalition among these six parties will win future elections.</p><p>One possibility is a coalition of anti-establishment Democrats who want to get big money out of politics and who reject crony capitalism, and anti-establishement Republicans who want the same.</p><p>The other possible coalition is establishment Democrats who want their taxes cut and establishment Republicans who want the same.</p><p>Why We Must All Fight for the Dream Act.</p><p>By repealing DACA \u2013\u00a0Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals \u2013\u00a0Trump has endangered both these young immigrants and the economic security of America.</p><p>In 2012, the Obama\u00a0 administration created DACA as a temporary way to address the needs of young people who came to America as infants or toddlers, and know no other country.</p><p>To apply and qualify for DACA, these young people had to risk entering the system by giving their identifying information. Once approved, they were granted two years of \"deferred action\" on deportation, with the promise that they could reapply every two years indefinitely.</p><p>This allowed \"dreamers\" to go to college, get a job, and pay taxes without fear of deportation. DACA was never perfect, but for 800,000 immigrant youth it meant freedom from fear and an opportunity to fully contribute to the country they were raised in.</p><p>But now these young people are threatened with deportation.</p><p>For no reason. These young people are not taking jobs away from native-born Americans.\u00a0 Even the conservative Cato Institute has said that the economic cost of cancelling DACA would be $200 billion over ten years.\u00a0 And that's just direct costs. The Center for American Progress estimates that if we lost these young workers the U.S. gross domestic product would shrink by $433 billion over the next decade.</p><p>The moral case is even more compelling than the economic one.</p><p>These kids grew up in America. To enter the DACA program they already had to step forward and show that they were contributing\u00a0 to their communities and then prove it again every two years to stay in the program. It is immoral to now put them in the crosshairs of deportation.</p><p>This is just the latest effort by Trump to play to his base and divide us, but we must not allow that. Americans of all races and creeds must push congress to pass the Dream Act, and allow these young people to become American citizens \u2013 without the Act being a bargaining chip for more border security or anything else.</p><p>These DACA young people are our neighbors, our colleagues, and our classmates. They represent the the best of the dream that my parents and most of our ancestors had when they came to America:\u00a0 To make a better life for themselves, and for their kids.\u00a0 Trump's attempt to divide us and fuel our differences along racial and ethnic lines is an attack on the America I believe in, and we must not let it stand.</p><p>That's why the DACA fight is my fight, and why I stand with the dreamers \u2013 and I hope you will too.</p><p>WHY THE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN IS MORE FAILED TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS*</p><p>Trump and conservatives in Congress are planning a big tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. To justify it they're using the oldest song in their playbook, claiming tax cuts on the rich will trickle down to working families in the form of stronger economic growth.</p><p>Baloney. Trickle-down economics is a cruel joke. Just look at the evidence:</p><p>1. Clinton's tax increase on the rich hardly stalled the economy. In 1993, Bill Clinton raised taxes on top earners from 31 percent to 39.6 percent. Conservatives predicted economic disaster. Instead, the economy created 23 million jobs and the economy grew for 8 straight years in what was then the longest expansion in history. The federal budget went into surplus.</p><p>2. George W. Bush's big tax cuts for the rich didn't grow the economy. In 2001and 2003, George W. Bush lowered the top tax rate to 35 percent while also cutting top rates on capital gains and dividends. Conservative supply-siders predicted an economic boom. Instead, the economy barely grew at all, and then in 2008 it collapsed. Meanwhile, the federal deficit ballooned.</p><p>3. Obama's tax hike on the rich didn't slow the economy. At the end of 2012, President Obama struck a deal to restore the 39.6 percent top tax rate and raise tax rates on capital gains and dividends. Once again, supply-side conservatives predicted doom. Instead, the economy grew steadily, and the expansion is still continuing.</p><p>4. The Reagan recovery of the early 1980s wasn't driven by Reagan's tax cut. Conservative supply-siders point to Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cuts. But the so-called Reagan recovery of the early 1980s was driven by low interest rates and big increase in government spending.</p><p>5. Kansas cut taxes on the rich and is a basket case. California raised them and is thriving. In 2012, Kansas slashed taxes on top earners and business owners, while California raised taxes on top earners to the highest state rate in the nation. Since then, California has had among the strongest economic growth of any state, while Kansas has fallen behind most other states.</p><p>So don't fall for supply-side, trickle-down nonsense. Lower taxes on the rich don't generate growth and jobs. They only make the rich even richer, at a time of raging inequality, and they cause bigger budget deficits.</p><p>[*Our thanks to Alexandra Thornton and Seth Hanlon from the Center for American Progress]</p><p>WHY WE NEED SANCTUARY STATES</p><p>California lawmakers have just passed \"sanctuary state\" legislation \u2013 the first state since Oregon, which 30 years ago passed a law preventing state agencies from targeting undocumented immigrants solely because of their illegal status.</p><p>Other states should follow California's and Oregon's lead.</p><p>Since January, when Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration authorities to target \"public safety\" threats, federal arrests of undocumented immigrants have increased by over 37 percent.\u00a0California is home to an estimated 2.3 million unauthorized immigrants.</p><p>California's law limits the authority of state and local law enforcers to communicate with federal immigration authorities, and prevents officers from questioning or holding people depending on their immigration status or immigration violations. But it still allows federal immigration authorities to enter county jails to question immigrants, and allow police and sheriffs to share information on people who have been convicted of serious crimes.</p><p>This is a fair balance. Sanctuary protections like these make sense because:</p><p>1. Under them, undocumented immigrants are more likely to come forth with information about crime when doing so won't put them at risk of deportation. This improves public safety and builds trusts with law enforcement.</p><p>2. By contrast, turning state and local police into immigration agents invites more crime because it diverts limited time and resources to rounding up undocumented immigrants.</p><p>3. Undocumented immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born citizens, so it makes even less sense for local and state police to spend their precious time and resources rounding them up.</p><p>4. A dragnet aimed at finding and deporting all of America's 11 million unauthorized immigrants is cruel, costly, and contemptible. It turns this country into more of a police state, breaks up families, and hurts the economy.</p><p>We must resist Jeff Sessions and his dragnet. Help make your state a sanctuary.</p><p>Six Reasons Why American Corporations Shouldn't Get\u00a0a Tax Cut</p><p>Trump and Republicans are trying to sell you the idea that American corporations need a tax cut in order to be competitive. That's rubbish. Here are 6 reasons why:</p><p>First, American corporations don't need it in order to be competitive internationally.\u00a0After tax credits and deductions, their effective tax rate is just about the same as paid by corporations in most of our major trading partners, according to the U.S. Treasury.</p><p>Second, American corporations are making more money than ever. Their after-tax profits are a higher share of the total economy than ever. American corporations earn nearly half of all global profits, even though the U.S. economy is about a fifth the size of the world economy.</p><p>Third, the long-term competitiveness of American corporations depends far more on a well-educated and skilled workforce, modern infrastructure, and basic research than on tax rates. And the way we finance these necessary public investment is through \u2026 taxes.</p><p>Fourth, American corporations are now paying less in taxes than they have in 65 years. Corporate tax receipts are the lowest percentage of the economy since just after World War II. If corporate taxes are cut, you will have to pay even more in taxes in order to make up the difference.</p><p>Fifth, if their taxes were cut, corporations won't use the extra money to make new investments in plant, equipment, research and development, or jobs. They're already using their vast stockpiles of cash to buy back shares and thereby boost stock prices, and for extravagant bonuses and salaries to CEOs and other top executives. That's what they would do with any additional cash.</p><p>Sixth, the reason they're not investing more is because consumers don't have the purchasing power to buy more, and that's because most people's incomes have gone nowhere for decades. And why is that? Because corporations have been holding down wages by outsourcing abroad, substituting software for jobs, contracting work out to part-time workers, and fighting unions.</p><p>A corporate tax cut is the wrong solution to the wrong problem. The real problem is stagnant wages of most Americans, coupled with declining public investments in schools, roads, public transportation, and basic research \u2013 all the things average working Americans need in order to become more productive and get higher wages. To finance these we need higher corporate taxes, not lower.</p><p>How to Make the Electoral College Irrelevant</p><p>We must make sure our democracy doesn't ever again elect a candidate who loses the popular vote. That means making the Electoral College irrelevant.</p><p>Here's how: As you probably know, the Constitution assigns each state a number of electors based on the state's population. The total number of electors is 538, so any candidate who gets 270 of those Electoral College votes becomes president.</p><p>Article II of the Constitution says states can award their electors any way they want. So all that's needed in order to make the Electoral College irrelevant is for states with a total of at least 270 electors to agree to award all their electoral votes to the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote.</p><p>If they do that, then automatically the winner of the popular vote gets the 270 electoral college votes he or she needs to become president.</p><p>Already 10 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws to do this \u2013 awarding all their electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote, as soon as the 270 elector goal is met. Together, these states total 165 electoral votes.</p><p>So all we need now is some additional states with 105 electors to pass the same law, agreeing to reward all their electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote \u2013 and it's done. We'll never again elect a president who loses the popular vote.</p><p>The effort is known as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. If your state hasn't yet joined on, make sure it does.</p><p>TRUMP'S OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE</p><p>Steve Bannon recently called Trump's firing of James Comey the biggest political mistake in modern political history. But it was more than that. It was outright obstruction of justice \u2013 another impeachable offense to add to the impeachable offenses Trump has already committed (violation of the Constitution's \"emolument's clause,\" failure to faithfully execute the laws, and abuse of power).</p><p>Obstruction of justice was among the articles of impeachment drafted against both Presidents Nixon and Clinton. The parallel between Nixon and Trump is almost exact. White House tapes revealed Nixon giving instructions to pressure the acting FBI director into halting the Watergate investigation.</p><p>It's worth recalling that two weeks after Trump told Comey privately \"I need loyalty. I expect loyalty,\" he had another private meeting with Comey in the Oval Office. After shooing out his advisers \u2013 all of whom had top security clearance \u2013 Trump said to Comey, according to Comey's memo written shortly after the meeting,\"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\"</p><p>Then on May 9, Trump fired Comey. In a subsequent interview with NBC Trump said he planned to fire Comey \"regardless of [the] recommendation\" of the Attorney and Deputy Attorney General, partly because of \"this Russia thing.\" Trump also revealed in the interview that he had had several conversations with Comey about the Russia investigation, and had asked Comey if he was under investigation.</p><p>The federal crime of obstruction of justice applies to \"[w]hoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law\" in a proceeding or investigation by a government department or agency or Congress.</p><p>As in Nixon's case, a decision to support an \"inquiry of impeachment\" resolution in the House\u2014to start an impeachment investigation\u2014doesn't depend on sufficient evidence to convict a person of obstruction of justice, but simply probable cause to believe a president may have obstructed justice.</p><p>There's already more than enough evidence of probable cause to begin that impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump.</p><p>WHY WE SHOULD ABOLISH THE DEBT CEILING\u00a0</p><p>Congressional Democrats have pulled a fast one on Republicans by striking a deal with Trump to raise the federal debt ceiling only until the end of the year. This will give them bargaining leverage in December to strike a bigger bargain with Republicans: Democrats will agree to\u00a0raise the debt ceiling then in return for Republican cooperation on legalizing Dreamers (unauthorized immigrants brought into the U.S. as children), making small but necessary fixes in the Affordable Care act, and other things Democrats seek.</p><p>Raising the debt ceiling is always a political football, used by whichever party is in the minority to extract concessions from the majority party or from the majority party's president.</p><p>The debt ceiling is how much the government is allowed to borrow. It shouldn't be a political football.\u00a0It should be abolished. It serves absolutely no purpose.</p><p>When the debt ceiling was first adopted in 1917, it might have been a useful way to prevent a president from spending however much he wanted. But since 1974, Congress has had a formal budget process to control spending and the taxes needed to finance it.</p><p>There's no reason for Congress to authorize borrowing for spending that Congress has already approved, especially when a failure to lift the debt ceiling would be so horrific.</p><p>Having a debt ceiling doesn't discipline government, anyway. The national debt is obligations government has already made to those who lent it money. Discipline has to do with setting spending limits and legislating tax increases, not penalizing the lenders.</p><p>Which is why most modern democracies don't have debt ceilings. Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia \u2013 they do just fine without explicit borrowing limits.</p><p>Even more basically, the nation's debt is a meaningless figure without reference to the size of the overall economy and the pace of economic growth.</p><p>After World War II, America's debt was larger than our entire Gross Domestic Product, but we grew so much so fast in the 1950s and 1960s that the debt kept shrinking in proportion.</p><p>Today's debt is about 77 percent of our total national product. The reason it's a problem is it's growing faster than the economy is growing, so it's on the way to becoming larger and larger in proportion.</p><p>This is what we ought to be focusing on. Fighting over whether or not to raise the debt ceiling is a meaningless and dangerous distraction. So abolish it.</p><p>What Do Democrats Stand For?</p><p>The Democratic Party can lead the country in a new direction, but will it?</p><p>Millions of Americans who are politically engaged for the first time in their lives are crying out for a bold alternative to bigoted and destructive policies.</p><p>But Democrats can't just be anti-Trump or move to the middle.</p><p>To be successful Democrats must address the forces that created Trump: The toxic combination of widening inequality and racism.</p><p>The richest one percent now own more than the bottom 90 percent. Corporations and the rich are running our politics.</p><p>The resulting economic stresses have made many people vulnerable to Trump's politics of hate and bigotry.</p><p>If Democrats stand for one thing, it must be overcoming this unprecedented economic imbalance and creating a multi-racial, multi-ethnic coalition of the bottom 90 percent, to take back our economy and politics.</p><p>This requires, at the least:</p><p>1. Public investments in world-class schools and infrastructure for all.</p><p>2. Free public universities and first-class technical training for all;</p><p>3. Single-payer Medicare-for-All;</p><p>4. Higher taxes on the wealthy to pay for this;</p><p>5. Using antitrust to break up powerful monopolies on Wall Street, Big Tech, Big Pharma, and Big Agriculture.</p><p>6. Getting big money out of our politics.</p><p>Together, these steps form an agenda to reclaim our economy and democracy for all. Will Democrats lead the way?</p><p>DEAR TRUMP VOTER</p><p>If you voted for Donald Trump, I get it. Maybe you feel you've been so badly shafted by the system that you didn't want to go back to politics as usual, and Trump seemed like he'd topple that corrupt system.</p><p>You voted to change our country's power base \u2013 to get rid of crony capitalism and give our government back to the people who are working, paying taxes, and spending more just to survive. Lots of Americans agree with you.</p><p>But now, the president is turning his back on that idea and the many changes he promised.</p><p>He did not drain the swamp. After telling voters how he would take control away from special interests, he has surrounded himself with the very Wall Street players he decried. Now, those who gamed politicians for tax loopholes and laws that reward the rich don't even have to sneak around with backroom deals.</p><p>Steve Mnuchin, Gary Cohn, Dina Powell and others from Wall Street, as well as corporate lobbyists by the dozens, are now inside the Trump administration rigging the system for the extremely wealthy from the inside.</p><p>They want to make it easier for banks to once again gamble with your money and repeat our financial crisis. They want to cut health care for millions of you. They want to lower taxes on corporations and the rich. They want to get rid of rules that stop corporations from harming your health or safety.</p><p>That's not the change you were promised.</p><p>Make America Great Again? The Trump administration wants to expand on policies that have kept American wages stagnant for almost four decades. Huge corporations and billionaires get the breaks, and hard working Americans once again get left waiting for the crumbs. That's not the change you were promised.</p><p>Bringing back fiscal responsibility? The Secret Service budget is skyrocketing to protect his family on international business trips, ski vacations, and separate New York City living quarters.</p><p>At the same time, the president still refuses to untangle himself from his businesses and prove he's not leveraging our government for his financial gain. You're paying for his lifestyle while he's doing nothing to help yours.</p><p>That's not the change you were promised.</p><p>A SUMMER SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR THE TRUMP ERA</p><p>Here's a summer survival guide, 10 ways to relax during the era of Trump.</p><p>1.\u00a0 Take a day off from the news, one day a week.</p><p>2.\u00a0 Don't get into an argument with a Trump supporter, especially if it's a member of your family. Remember, there are more independents and non-voters than Trump Republicans. And the 2018 midterm election will be won on the basis of turnout.</p><p>3.\u00a0 Pay no attention to Trump's tweets. They're becoming increasingly bizarre and irrelevant.</p><p>4.\u00a0 Watch an old movie of biting political satire, like \"Wag the Dog.\"</p><p>5.\u00a0 But don't watch \"Doctor Strangelove.\"</p><p>6.\u00a0 Join an Indivisible group near you and take action with them, attending a congressional town meeting and organizing others to contact your members of congress. It's having an effect. Plus, it's therapeutic.</p><p>7.\u00a0 Drink lots of water and get plenty of exercise. Helps with the anger.</p><p>8. \u00a0Read good books of fiction, like Harry Potter. Don't read George Orwell's \"1984\" or Sinclair Lewis's \"It Can't Happen Here\" or Philip Roth's \"The Plot Against America.\"</p><p>9.\u00a0 Go to a county fair with your kids, and watch the pigs.</p><p>10. Have a cookout with your neighbors and see what resources you yourselves can offer to your community. Start a tool collective or teach a class in a library or out of someone's house. Tangible change can come from your hands, not only your votes. Remember, resistance works best when people come together and work together.</p><p>Have a great summer!</p><p>THE ART OF THE (TRUMP AND PUTIN) DEAL</p><p>Say you're Vladimir Putin, and you did a deal with Trump last year. Whether there was such a deal is\u00a0being investigated.\u00a0But if you are Putin and you did do a deal, what might Trump have agreed to do for you?</p><p>1. Repudiate NATO. NATO is the biggest thorn in your side \u2013 the alliance that both humiliates you and stymies your ambitions. Trump seemed intent to deliver on this during his recent European trip by bullying members about payments and seemingly not reaffirming Article 5 of the pact, which states that any attack on one NATO ally is an attack on all. (He's backtracked on this since then, under pressure from Congress.)</p><p>2. Antagonize Europe, especially Angela Merkel. She's the strongest leader in the West other than Trump, and you'd love to drive a wedge between the United States and Germany. Your larger goal is for Europe to no longer depend on the United States, so you can increase your influence in Europe. Trump has almost delivered on this, too. Merkel is already saying Europe can no longer depend on America.</p><p>3. Take the United States out of the Paris accord on the environment. This will anger America's other allies around the world and produce a wave of anti-Americanism \u2013 all to your advantage. You'd also love for the whole Paris accord to unravel because you want the world to remain dependent on fossil fuels. Russia is the world's second-largest exporter of oil after Saudi Arabia, and biggest exporter of natural gas. And the oil and gas industry contributes about half the revenues to your domestic budget. And, hey, there's also all those Arctic ports that are opening up now that the earth is warming.\u00a0Trump has delivered on this.</p><p>4. Embark on a new era of protectionism. Or at least anti-trade rhetoric. This will threaten the West's economic interdependence and loosen America's economic grip on the rest of the world. Trump is on the way to delivering on this one.</p><p>5. End the economic sanctions on Russia, imposed by the United States in 2014. Oil production on land is falling so you want to tap the vast petroleum and gas reserves offshore in the Arctic. In 2011, you and ExxonMobil's Rex Tillerson, signed a $500 billion deal to do this. But the sanctions stopped it cold. Trump has promised to lift them, but he hasn't delivered on this yet, because he has got to cope with all the suspicions in America about his deal with you. Once it dies down, he'll end the sanctions. In the meantime, he'll give you back the two compounds that were seized by the Obama administration when the U.S. intelligence discovered you'd interfered in the election.</p><p>And what might you have agreed to do for Trump in return?</p><p>Two things: First, you'd help him win the presidency, by hacking into Democratic Party servers, leaking the results, sending millions of fake news stories about Hillary to targeted voters, and tapping into voter lists.</p><p>Second, after he was elected, you'd shut up about your help so Trump wouldn't be impeached and convicted of treason.</p><p>In other words, if you did a deal, you both still have every incentive to fulfill your side of it. That's the art of the deal.</p><p>POLITICAL JUJITSU: NOW'S THE TIME FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL</p><p>As Republicans in Congress move to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Democrats are moving toward Medicare for All \u2013 a single-payer plan that builds on Medicare and would cover everyone at far lower cost.</p><p>Most House Democrats are already supporting a Medicare for All bill.</p><p>With health care emerging as the public's top concern, according to recent polls, the choice between repeal of the Affordable Care Act and Medicare for All is likely to be the major domestic issue in the presidential campaign of 2020 (other than getting Trump out of office, if he lasts that long).</p><p>And the better choice is clear. Private for-profit insurers spend a fortune trying to attract healthy people while avoiding the sick and needy, filling out paperwork from hospitals and providers, paying top executives, and rewarding shareholders.</p><p>And for-profit insurers are merging like mad, in order to make even more money.</p><p>These are among the major reasons why health insurance is becoming so expensive, and why almost every other advanced nation \u2013 including our neighbor to the north \u2013 has adopted a single-payer system at less cost per person and with better health outcomes.</p><p>Most Americans support Medicare for All. According to a Gallup poll conducted in May, a majority would like to see a single-payer system implemented. An April survey from the Economist/YouGov showed 60 percent of Americans in favor of \"expanding Medicare to provide health insurance to every American.\"</p><p>That includes nearly half of people who identify themselves as Republican.</p><p>If Republicans gut the Affordable Care Act, the American public will be presented with the real choice ahead: Either expensive health care for the few, or affordable health care for the many.</p><p>NOW'S THE TIME FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL</p><p>As Republicans in Congress move to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Democrats are moving in the opposite direction, toward Medicare for All \u2013 a single-payer plan that builds on Medicare and would cover everyone at far lower cost.</p><p>Most House Democrats are already supporting a Medicare for All bill. Senator Bernie Sanders is preparing to introduce it in the Senate.

Cross-posted from Alternet[1]. The combined wealth of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Google's Sergey Brin, and Larry Page is larger than the combined wealth of the bottom half of the American population. They are the leaders of a second Gilded Age - ushered in by semiconductors, software and the internet - which has spawned a handful of hi-tech behemoths and crushed competition. Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft now have the highest market values for all public corporations in America[2]. As of today, only three countries in the world have a GDP higher than these companies' combined market value of approximately 4 trillion dollars[3]. America's first Gilded Age began in the late nineteenth century with a raft of innovations - railroads, steel production, oil extraction - that culminated in mammoth trusts run by 'robber barons' like J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, and William Vanderbilt[4]. The answer then was to break up the railroad, oil, and steel monopolies.The answer today is the same: Break Up Big Tech. </p><p>First: They have a stranglehold on the economy. Nearly 90 percent of all internet searches now go through Google[5]. Facebook and Google together will account for nearly 60 percent of all digital ad spending[6]in 2019 (where most ad money goes these days[7]). They're also the first stops for many Americans seeking news (93 percent of Americans say they receive at least some news online[8]). Amazon is now the first stop for almost half of all American consumers[9] seeking to buy anything online. With such size comes the power to stifle innovation. Google uses its search engine to promote its own products[10]and content over those of its competitors, like Yelp[11]. Facebook's purchases of WhatsApp[12] and Instagram[13] killed off two potential rivals. Apple stifles competition in its App Store. Partly because of this economic concentration, the rate that new job-creating businesses have formed in the United States has almost halved since 2004, according to the Census Bureau[14]. Second: Such size also gives these giant corporations political power to get whatever they want, undermining our democracy. In 2018, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft spent 70.9 million dollars[15] on lobbying and supporting candidates. As a result, Amazon - the richest corporation in America[16]- paid nothing in federal taxes last year[17]. Meanwhile, it held a bidding war to extort billions from states and cities eager to have its second headquarters[18]. Not to mention, these companies have tremendous influence over how Americans receive information. And as we've seen, Facebook and Google have enabled the manipulation of our elections. Third: Giant tech companies also hurt the environment[19].  Many are failing to reduce greenhouse emissions, as they promised, and are unwilling to commit fully to renewable energy.[20] Finally: Their huge wealth isn't being shared with most of their workers. [21] Nine in 10 workers in Silicon Valley make less now than they did in 1997, adjusted for inflation[22]. And many are part of the 'working homeless.' That is, people who work full time and yet are still homeless[23]. The answer is to break them up. That way, information would be distributed through a large number of independent channels instead of a centralized platform. And more startups could flourish. Even one of Facebook's founders has called for the social media behemoth to be broken up. Senator Elizabeth Warren has introduced a proposal to do just that.[24] It would force tech giants to open up their platforms to more competition or break up into smaller companies. Other countries are already taking on Big Tech. The European Union fined Google nearly 3 billion dollars for antitrust violations[25] in 2017. Let's be clear: Monopolies aren't good for anyone except for the monopolists, especially when they can influence our elections and control how Americans receive information. In this new Gilded Age, we need to respond to them as forcefully as we did to the monopolies of the first Gilded Age and break them up.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/06/robert-reich-heres-why-we-need-to-break-up-big-tech.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/06/robert-reich-heres-why-we-need-to-break-up-big-tech.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Corporate governance[26], Free markets and their discontents[27], Guest Post[28], Income disparity[29], Market inefficiencies[30], Regulations and regulators[31] on June 27, 2019[32] by Lambert Strether[33].  About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

It all comes down to power: who has it, and who doesn't.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big corporations have become so dominant that workers and consumers have fewer options and have to accept the wages and prices these giant corporations offer. This has become even worse now that thousands of small businesses have had to close as a result of the pandemic, while mammoth corporations are being bailed out. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the same time, worker bargaining power has declined as fewer workers are unionized and technologies have made outsourcing easy, allowing corporations to get the labor they need for cheap.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These two changes in bargaining power didn't happen by accident. As corporations have gained power, they've been able to gut anti-monopoly laws, allowing them to grow even more dominant. At the same time, fewer workers have joined unions because corporations have undermined the nation's labor laws, and many state legislatures \u2013 under intense corporate lobbying \u2013 have enacted laws making it harder to form unions.</p><p>Because of these deliberate power shifts, even before the pandemic, a steadily larger portion of corporate revenues have been siphoned off to profits, and a shrinking portion allocated to wages.</p><p>Once the economy tanked, the stock market retained much of its value while millions of workers lost jobs and the unemployment rate soared to Great Depression-era levels.</p><p>To understand the current concentration of corporate power we need to go back in time.</p><p>In the late nineteenth century, corporate power was a central concern. \"Robber barons,\" like John D. Rockefeller and Cornelius Vanderbilt, amassed unprecedented wealth for themselves by crushing labor unions, driving competitors out of business, and making their employees work long hours in dangerous conditions for low wages.</p><p>As wealth accumulated at the top, so too did power: Politicians of the era put corporate interests ahead of workers, even sending state militias to violently suppress striking workers. By 1890, public anger at the unchecked greed of the robber barons culminated in the creation of America's first anti-monopoly law, the Sherman Antitrust Act.</p><p>In the following years, antitrust enforcement waxed or waned depending on the administration in office; but after 1980, it virtually disappeared. The new view was that large corporations produced economies of scale, which were good for consumers, and anything that was good for consumers was good for America. Power, the argument went, was no longer at issue. America's emerging corporate oligarchy used this faulty academic analysis to justify killing off antitrust.<br/><br/>As the federal government all but abandoned antitrust enforcement in the 1980s, American industry grew more and more concentrated. The government green-lighted Wall Street's consolidation into five giant banks. It okayed airline mergers, bringing the total number of American carriers down from twelve in 1980 to just four today. Three giant cable companies came to dominate broadband. A handful of drug companies control the pharmaceutical industry.<br/><br/>Today, just five giant corporations preside over key, high-tech platforms, together comprising more than a quarter of the value of the entire U.S. stock market. Facebook and Google are the first stops for many Americans seeking news. Apple dominates smartphones and laptop computers. Amazon is now the first stop for a third of all American consumers seeking to buy anything.<br/><br/>The monopolies of yesteryear are back with a vengeance.<br/><br/>Thanks to the abandonment of antitrust, we're now living in a new Gilded Age, as consolidation has inflated corporate profits, suppressed worker pay, supercharged economic inequality, and stifled innovation.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, big investors have made bundles of money off the growing concentration of American industry. Warren Buffett, one of America's wealthiest men, has been considered the conscience of American capitalism because he wants the rich to pay higher taxes. But Buffett has made his fortune by investing in monopolies that keep out competitors.<br/><br/>\u2013 The sky-high profits at Wall Street banks have come from their being too big to fail and their political power to keep regulators at bay.<br/><br/>\u2013 The high profits the four remaining airlines enjoyed before the pandemic came from inflated prices, overcrowded planes, overbooked flights, and weak unions.<br/><br/>\u2013 High profits of Big Tech have come from wanton invasions of personal privacy, the weaponizing of false information, and disproportionate power that prevents innovative startups from entering the market.<br/><br/>If Buffett really wanted to be the conscience of American capitalism, he'd be a crusader for breaking up large concentrations of economic power and creating incentives for startups to enter the marketplace and increase competition.<br/><br/>This mega-concentration of American industry has also made the entire economy more fragile \u2013 and susceptible to deep downturns. Even before the coronavirus, it was harder for newer firms to gain footholds. The rate at which new businesses formed had already been halved from the pace in 1980. And the coronavirus has exacerbated this trend even more, bringing new business formations to a standstill with no rescue plan in sight.<br/><br/>And it's brought workers to their knees. There's no way an economy can fully recover unless working people have enough money in their pockets to spend. Consumer spending is two-thirds of this economy.<br/><br/>Perhaps the worst consequence of monopolization is that as wealth accumulates at the top, so too does political power.<br/><br/>These massive corporations provide significant campaign contributions; they have platoons of lobbyists and lawyers and directly employ many voters. So items they want included in legislation are inserted; those they don't want are scrapped.</p><p>They get tax cuts, tax loopholes, subsidies, bailouts, and regulatory exemptions. When the government is handing out money to stimulate the economy, these giant corporations are first in line. When they've gone so deep into debt to buy back their shares of stock that they might not be able to repay their creditors, what happens? They get bailed out. It's the same old story.<br/><br/>The financial returns on their political investments are sky-high.<br/><br/>Take Amazon \u2013 the richest corporation in America. It paid nothing in federal taxes in 2018. Meanwhile, it held a national auction to extort billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies from cities eager to house its second headquarters. It also forced Seattle, its home headquarters, to back away from a tax on big corporations, like Amazon, to pay for homeless shelters for a growing population that can't afford the city's sky-high rents, caused in part by Amazon!</p><p>And throughout this pandemic, Amazon has raked in record profits thanks to its monopoly of online marketplaces, even as it refuses to provide its essential workers with robust paid sick leave and has fired multiple workers for speaking out against the company's safety issues.<br/><br/>While corporations are monopolizing, power has shifted in exactly the opposite direction for workers.</p><p>In the mid-1950s, 35 percent of all private-sector workers in the United States were unionized. Today, 6.2 percent of them are.<br/><br/>Since the 1980s, corporations have fought to bust unions and keep workers' wages low. They've campaigned against union votes, warning workers that unions will make them less \"competitive\" and threaten their jobs. They fired workers who try to organize, a move that's illegal under the National Labor Relations Act but happens all the time because the penalty for doing so is minor compared to the profits that come from discouraging unionization.</p><p>Corporations have replaced striking workers with non-union workers. Under shareholder capitalism, striking workers often lose their jobs forever. You can guess the kind of chilling effect that has on workers' incentives to take a stand against poor conditions.<br/><br/>As a result of this power shift, workers have less choice of whom to work for. This also keeps their wages low. Corporations have imposed non-compete, anti-poaching, and mandatory arbitration agreements, further narrowing workers' alternatives.</p><p>Corporations have used their increased power to move jobs overseas if workers don't agree to pay cuts. In 1988, General Electric threatened to close a factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana that made electrical motors and to relocate it abroad unless workers agreed to a 12 percent pay cut. The Fort Wayne workers eventually agreed to the cut. One of the factory's union leaders remarked, \"It used to be that companies had an allegiance to the worker and the country. Today, companies have an allegiance to the corporate shareholder. Period.\"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, as unions have shrunk, so too has their political power. In 2009, even with a Democratic president and Democrats in control of Congress, unions could not muster enough votes to enact a simple reform that would have made it easier for workplaces to unionize.<br/><br/>All the while, corporations have been getting states to enact so-called \"right-to-work\" laws barring unions from requiring dues from workers they represent. Since worker representation costs money, these laws effectively gut the unions by not requiring workers to pay dues. In 2018, the Supreme Court, in an opinion delivered by the court's five Republican appointees, extended \"right-to-work\" to public employees.<br/><br/>This great shift in bargaining power from workers to corporate shareholders has created an increasingly angry working class vulnerable to demagogues peddling authoritarianism, racism, and xenophobia. Trump took full advantage.<br/><br/>All of this has pushed a larger portion of national income into profits and a lower portion into wages than at any time since World War II.</p><p>That's true even during a severe downturn. For the last decade, most profits have been going into stock buybacks and higher executive pay rather than new investment.<br/><br/>The declining share of total U.S. income going to the bottom 90 percent over the last four decades correlates directly with the decline in unionization. Most of the increasing value of the stock market has come directly out of the pockets of American workers. Shareholders have gained because workers stopped sharing the gains.<br/><br/>So, what can be done to restore bargaining power to workers and narrow the widening gap between corporate profits and wages?<br/><br/>For one, make stock buybacks illegal,\u00a0as they were before the SEC legalized them under Ronald Reagan. This would prevent corporate juggernauts from siphoning profits into buybacks, and instead direct profits towards economic investment.<br/><br/>Another solution: Enact a national ban on \"right-to-work\" laws,\u00a0thereby restoring power to unions and the workers they represent.<br/><br/>Require greater worker representation on corporate boards, as Germany has done through its \"employee co-determination\" system.<br/><br/>Break up monopolies. Break up any bank that's \"too big to fail\", and expand the Federal Trade Commission's ability to find monopolies and review and halt anti-competitive mergers. Designate large technology platforms as \"utilities\" whose prices are regulated in the public interest and require that services like Amazon Marketplace and Google Search be spun off from their respective companies.<br/><br/>Above all, antitrust laws must stop mergers that harm workers, stifle competition, or result in unfair pricing.<br/><br/>This is all about power. The good news is that rebalancing the power of workers and corporations can create an economy and a democracy that works for all, not just a privileged few.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwyvjvZO5Ls\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwyvjvZO5Ls</url></p><p>The article Robert Reich: Monopoly Mayhem Corporations Win, Workers Lose - OpEd appeared first on Eurasia Review.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-179031715</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609J-C6T1-F11P-X4VJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1947\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 8, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Rockefeller, and William H.(\"the public be damned\") Vanderbilt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The answer then was to bust up the railroad, oil, and steel monopolies.</p><p>We're<br/>now in a second Gilded Age \u2013 ushered in by semiconductors, software and<br/>the internet \u2013 which has spawned a handful of hi-tech behemoths and a <br/>new set of barons like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, <br/>and Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page.</p><p>The answer now is the same: Bust up the monopolies.</p><p>The<br/>current move is bipartisan. At a Senate hearing I testified at last <br/>week, arch-conservative Republican Josh Hawley asked me, rhetorically, <br/>\"Is there really any wonder that there is increased pressure for <br/>antitrust enforcement activity, for privacy activity when these <br/>companies behave in the way that they do?\"</p><p>Hawley added, \"Every <br/>day brings some creepy new revelation about these companies' behaviors. <br/>Of course the public is going to want there to be action to defend their<br/>rights. It's only natural.\"</p><p>Natural indeed. Nearly 90 percent of <br/>all internet searches now go through Google. Facebook and Google<br/>together account for 58 percent of all digital ads (where most ad money <br/>goes these days).</p><p>They're also the first stops for many Americans<br/>seeking news (93 percent of Americans receive news online). Amazon is <br/>now the first stop for a third of all American consumers seeking to buy anything.</p><p>With<br/>such size comes the power to stifle innovation. Amazon won't let any <br/>business that sells through it to sell any item at a lower price <br/>anywhere else. It's even using its control over book sales to give books<br/>published by Amazon priority over rival publishers.</p><p>Google uses <br/>the world's most widely used search engine to promote its own services <br/>and Google-generated content over those of competitors, like Yelp. <br/>Facebook's purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram killed off two potential <br/>rivals.</p><p>Contrary to the conventional view of America as a hotbed <br/>of entrepreneurship, the rate new job-creating businesses have formed in<br/>the United States has been halved since 2004, according to the Census <br/>Bureau. Part of the reason: gargantuan entry barriers put up by Big <br/>Tech. </p><p>Such size also confers political power to get whatever these companies and their top executives want.</p><p>Amazon<br/>\u2013 the richest corporation in America \u2013 paid nothing in federal taxes <br/>last year. Meanwhile, it's holding an auction to extort billions from <br/>states and cities eager to have its second headquarters.</p><p>It also <br/>forced Seattle, it's home headquarters, to back down on a plan to tax <br/>big corporations like itself to pay for homeless shelters for a growing <br/>population that can't afford the sky-high rents caused in part by <br/>Amazon.</p><p>Facebook withheld evidence of Russian activity on its <br/>platform far longer than previously disclosed. When the news came to <br/>light, it employed a political opposition research firm to discredit <br/>critics.</p><p>Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, who holds the world's speed <br/>record for falling from one of the most admired to the most reviled <br/>people on the planet, just unveiled a plan to \"encrypt\" personal <br/>information from all his platforms.</p><p>The new plan is likely to <br/>give Facebook even more comprehensive data about everyone. If you <br/>believe it will better guard privacy, you don't remember Zuckerberg's <br/>last seven promises to protect privacy.</p><p>Google forced the New <br/>America Foundation, an influential think tank it helped fund, to fire <br/>researchers who were urging antitrust officials to take on Google.</p><p>And it's been quietly financed hundreds of university professors to write research papers justifying Google's market dominance.</p><p>What<br/>to do? Some argue the tech mammoths should be regulated like utilities <br/>or common carriers, but this would put government into the impossible <br/>position of policing content and overseeing new products and services.</p><p>A<br/>better alternative is to break them up. That way, information would be <br/>distributed through a large number of independent channels without a <br/>centralized platform giving all content apparent legitimacy and <br/>extraordinary reach. And more startups could flourish.</p><p>Like the <br/>robber barons of the first Gilded Age, those of the second have amassed <br/>fortunes because of their monopolies \u2013 fortunes that give them <br/>unparalleled leverage over politicians and the economy. </p><p>The <br/>combined wealth of Zuckerberg ($62.3 billion), Bezos ($131 billion), <br/>Brin ($49.8 billion) and Page ($50.8 billion) is larger than the <br/>combined wealth of the bottom half of the American population.</p><p>A wealth tax (also proposed by Warren) would help.</p><p>Some<br/>of the robber barons of the first Gilded Age were generous <br/>philanthropists, as are today's. That didn't excuse the damage they did <br/>to America.</p><p>Let's be clear: Monopolies aren't good for anyone except for the monopolists.</p><p>In<br/>this new Gilded Age, we need to respond to them as forcefully as we did<br/>the first time around. Warren's ideas are a good start.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-140005989</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMB-N7X1-JDJN-648S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Current rules are less onerous as they require courts and regulators to only consider existing competitors.</p><p>The Business Council of Australia (BCA) has argued in a submission to Treasury that there \"does not appear to be a strong case\" for changes to the current merger rules. The BCA has more than 100 business members including BHP, Rio Tinto, Coles, Wesfarmers, AGL, Facebook, Google, Uber, Seek, Telstra, Mirvac, Qantas and the major banks.</p><p>The BCA criticised the recommendation as a \"signalling exercise\" that, along with proposed changes to privacy, contracts and trading practices, goes \"beyond the core issues in the inquiry and will have significant economy-wide impacts\". The submission also argues that companies \"may not have even had a chance to consider and respond to the recommendations and may not even be aware of them\".</p><p>The BCA is concerned the ACCC recommendation is not limited to the tech titans and would affect all businesses wanting to do a deal. The ACCC has not won a contested merger case in a court or tribunal in 20 years, a situation Mr Sims has previously described as a \"problem\".</p><p>Mr Sims responded to the BCA criticism by denying the merger recommendations were included to solve his court woes. He told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age the idea emerged from discussions with international competition regulators about Facebook and Google's controversial acquisitions of YouTube, Instagram, Whatsapp and Double Click.</p><p>\"The dominant view by 99 per cent of the population and most business organisations I go to, though not the BCA, is that we don't block enough,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>The change would also formalise a closer analysis of the type of assets a company has, such as data, intellectual property and technology.</p><p>The ACCC is waiting for an outcome from the Federal Court after Vodafone Hutchison Australia and TPG Telecom fought the competition regulator's decision to oppose their $15 billion merger. The regulator failed to stop rail group Aurizon selling its Queensland rail business to competitor Pacific National in the Federal Court in May. The decision has since been appealed.</p><p>\"There's no right answer and it depends on a philosophical position ... I think there's a certain group who would rather no mergers were blocked and there are groups who would prefer more,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>He did not dispute that what was proposed for the big tech firms would apply to other sectors but said the law should be \"general not sector-specific\".</p><p>King &amp; Wood Mallesons head of competition Sharon Henrick said the ACCC already considered future competition when deciding whether or not to oppose a merger and this would merely formalise the rules.</p><p>\"I believe the recommendations are part of a bigger agenda where the Commission is assessing its track record in contested merger cases and considering whether that law needs to be changed,\" Ms Henrick said.</p><p>Corrs Chambers Westgarth partner Mark McGowan said it was a \"fair\" assessment that the ACCC was pushing a broader agenda of lowering the bar to challenge mergers.</p><p>\"The ACCC has repeatedly failed in challenging mergers before courts and tribunals and they clearly have a view those decision-makers are placing too much emphasis on the self-interested evidence of corporate executives and not enough on market structure,\" Mr McGowan said.</p><p>\"This issue is broader than the [digital platform inquiry] - the ACCC has never attempted to block an acquisition by Google or Facebook,\" he said.</p><p>However, he said digital deals present unique challenges and gave the regulator a \"useful opportunity to push for reform in this area\" so he did not consider it to be overstepping.</p><p>A prominent banker who declined to be named said the change was unnecessary and could create uncertainty for businesses.</p><p>\"It is muddying the waters at a time when the velocity of change, the pace of technology, is so rapid that there's little chance on an evidentiary basis that anyone can reliably predict the markets in five years time,\" the source said.</p><p>Frontier Economics Australia and Asia economist Warwick Davis said the recommendation was \"unnecessary\" as the current list of merger factors that needed to be considered was substantial.</p><p>\"It's hard to see how adding to that list will improve clarity,\" he said. Frontier Economics has been an adviser to TPG and Vodafone during their merger case.</p><p>\"I don't think that losing cases means the law is wrong,\" he said.</p><p>Despite this, he agreed Google and Facebook's actions to acquire early-stage businesses was a legitimate concern and that any changes should be applied across all industries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520191653</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X87-M651-JBJ7-N3R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"861\"/><timeReceived>11:34 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

They are private companies worth $1 billion or more, based on fund-raising. And they include companies such as Uber, Airbnb and Fitbit. Well there are 25 unicorns this year, bringing the total to more than 100. Uber is perhaps the most well know, with an estimated $50 billion valuation.  </p><p>      So are all unicorns created equal? Roger McNamee is a successful veteran technology investor, and Co-Founder of Elevation Partners. And he joins me now to share his insights. Roger, thank you so much for being here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNAMEE</emphasis>:  Pimm, it's a great pleasure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PIMM</emphasis>:  Let's start off just talking about this idea of these billion-dollar or more private companies, but that's based on fund- raising. That's not maybe real money, in some people's eyes. Tell me.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNAMEE</emphasis>:  Well it's real money...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PIMM</emphasis>:  Yes?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNAMEE</emphasis>:  ... because they are -- people are writing checks...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PIMM</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNAMEE</emphasis>:  ... based on getting whatever percentage of the company you get at those valuations. So clearly there is something going on here that we have never seen before. There have been private companies with billion-dollar valuations, Facebook was there. LinkedIn was there. Twitter was there. But now there are more than 100. And that is clearly without precedent.  </p><p>      And here's the good news. When -- at some level it is a speculative mania by venture capitalists, but the other side of the coin is every great industry in America was built on the back of a speculative mania, starting with the railroads in the 1830s and 1840s. And so to me the great thing about American culture it when we decide we like something, we just we throw out all the rules. We pretend like it really is different this time. And we put all this money into it.  </p><p>      And the good news is after the market corrects, or crashes or whatever comes later, you have this great new industry. And I do think that what's going on now is, from an American economic point of view, a really exciting thing. Now, personally, I look at it as an investor and I go, now hang on just a sec, this doesn't feel like the sort of thing that's going to go on without interruption. I think we are going to see a correction here. And when it comes it could be really brutal.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOX</emphasis>:  When someone comes to Roger McNamee and says, you know what? There is this company and we would love you to participate,...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNAMEE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOX</emphasis>:  ... what are some of the things in the checklist that would make you say, yes, $1 billion, that makes sense?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNAMEE</emphasis>:  Well the way I look at this is there are some that are easy. I look at Uber and I think to myself that notwithstanding the, shall we say, unusual personality of the CEO, the service is universally loved, and it has plowed through regulatory barriers and political barriers very, very easily. And I don't know what -- I don't know how to value Uber. $50 billion seems like a big number, but who knows? It could -- I can imagine a scenario where it's worth that much.  </p><p>      Within that list of 100, there are bound to be a few which we look back on and go, wow, where was the sock puppet, right? And some of these are not going to work out well. And but the way I look at it is I think on balance we're better off seeing investors get too excited, because at least we wind up with a new industry.  </p><p>      And so when they're coming to me now, I'm looking at them all and going, you know, I think I'm going to wait. And it's not because I don't think they're great companies. It's because my 33 years as an investor in technology tells me there will be a day when the good ones will be available in the public market at a lower valuation. It's just markets go up and they go down. And I don't know whether that's a year from now, two years from now or five years from now, but the opportunity will come along. Things don't grow to the sky usually.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOX</emphasis>:  Let me -- let me give you a name. All right let's talk Fitbit.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNAMEE</emphasis>:  Well there you go. So Fitbit is a company that, if I understand the forecast properly, is going to do over $1 billion in revenue this year. And it has carved a position beneath Apple in the wellness market. And the problem with the product is that the data it gives you is not accurate. The good news of the product is the social experience is marvelous.  </p><p>      And people really do use it and they really do love it. Now how do you value a situation like that, because they're always going to have to be cheaper than Apple. And they're going to have to watch out for Apple coming down and essentially grabbing their price point. I'm personally a shareholder victim. I'd -- I'd like to see what they can do with it.  </p><p>      How is it going to turn out? I haven't a clue. And am I going to get a chance to own it cheaper? Well once it's public the answer is inevitably, because things are going to go up and down, but they may go up before they go down, and that would be better for me, but I don't know that that's what's going to happen.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOX</emphasis>:  Is there a unicorn out there that you don't want to play leapfrog with?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNAMEE</emphasis>:  Well the funny thing is I don't see it today, but I'm sure the answer is yes. What's exciting now is that the technology of smartphones for the last six or seven years was about making phones themselves. Now it's about applying that technology to changing other sectors of the economy, and creating use cases where people get benefit or enjoyment from things they never had before.  </p><p>      Think about Uber, I mean what a transformation of transportation. And that wave is going to last 10, 15 years fundamentally. So some of these things are going to emerge and wind up not only in the S&amp;P 500, but if they do a great job, maybe in the Dow that you really do get a few things that do break through. The chances that we're going to have 100 of them that all do that in lockstep I think round to zero.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOX</emphasis>:  AOL and Verizon, what do you think of the deal?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNAMEE</emphasis>:  So I look at it, and I go if I'm Tim Armstrong this is a great outcome. I mean AOL, their best case from here was just to keep hammering away. From Verizon's point of view, there is an opportunity for them to get some technology mojo that they haven't had. I find it highly unlikely that they will get that, simply because they have been so successful in their core markets that culturally the notion that they're going to adopt \"Huffington Post\" style, TechCrunch-style culture at Verizon, I wouldn't count on it. Most big tech deals don't work out for the buyer, but it's a great day for the AOL shareholder and for the team there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOX</emphasis>:  I want to thank you very much, Roger McNamee of Elevation Partners, much appreciated.    </p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

In 2004, along with Bono and others, he co-founded Elevation Partners, a private equity firm. He has recently published <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/07/zucked-waking-up-to-facebook-catastrophe\">Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                     What is your history with Facebook?                     I've been a technology investor since 1982, and a tech optimist until very recently. I first met Mark Zuckerberg in 2006, when he was 22 years old and I was 50. Even at that time it was already obvious to me that Facebook would be as successful eventually as Google was at that time, which was to say spectacularly successful. He had broken the code on the two things that historically had undermined all network-based companies: he had required authenticated identity, and he had provided genuine control of privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I thought that represented a staggering success. So I met him, and before he said anything I told him that I was afraid somebody was going to try to buy the company, they were going to pay a billion dollars and everybody was going to tell him to take the money. And I said, look, if you believe in your dream, I hope you'll tell them no.</p><p>It turned out that the reason he was coming to see me was that a company had offered a billion dollars for Facebook and everyone had told him to accept it.</p><p>He wanted a chief operating officer and I suggested Sheryl Sandberg, and persuaded her to meet with Mark. He sold her on the company and they became a team.</p><p>                     When did you first realise                     that things had taken a turn for the worse?                     In January 2016 I saw things coming out of Facebook groups ostensibly associated with the Bernie Sanders campaign. The stuff they were spreading was uniformly inappropriate, it was misogynistic, it was disinformation.</p><p>And then a month later, I saw a report that Facebook had expelled a company that was using its advertising tools to gather information about people interested in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/07/zucked-waking-up-to-facebook-catastrophe\">Black Lives Matter</url> and selling that data to police departments. That was a massive violation of civil rights and just completely horrible.</p><p>Finally, I reached out to Mark and Sheryl with an opinion piece I'd written, in which I suggested that there was a systemic problem with the algorithms and the business model that was allowing bad actors to harm innocent people. They very politely replied to me, but suggested that in their view what I'd seen was isolated and they had taken care of it.</p><p>So that's when I decided I'd better figure out exactly what happened. I met <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/07/zucked-waking-up-to-facebook-catastrophe\">Tristan Harris</url>, a design ethicist from Google, who talked about what he called \"brain hacking\", a term that he invented to describe the persuasive technologies used by internet platforms that enable them to develop habits in the minds of the people who use the products. Those habits evolve into addictions, and that situation makes [users] vulnerable to manipulation.</p><p>Like a stroke of lightning, it made me see what it was that had potentially influenced the election in the US, and had potentially influenced Brexit.</p><p>                     Is this book the culmination of th                     ose efforts?                     No, this is just the next step. We kept at this for a while and then, kaboom, the Observer and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/07/zucked-waking-up-to-facebook-catastrophe\">Carole Cadwalladr</url> come out with the story about       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/07/zucked-waking-up-to-facebook-catastrophe\">Cambridge Analytica</url> and that changed everything.</p><p>We'd been banging the drum [but] the privacy angle was the first one that really [hit] home, with everyone, and it transformed everything.</p><p>That's when I began working on the book, and the notion was very simple: there's only so much you can do in a tiny team of people going around and meeting small groups. So we needed to find a way of broadening the message. What I was really trying to do was to use my personal narrative to help people understand what matters, so that as new news came along, they could interpret it for themselves.</p><p>My thought process was that this isn't a tech story. It's not a business story. This is an everybody story. This is a catastrophe that we're all facing, and we don't necessarily have a vocabulary for it, because the business model that Facebook and Google have created is something we've never seen before.</p><p>They were very much in the business of manipulating attention in order to get you to spend more time on [their services]. And that is a very dangerous business model for society. It's bad for the mental health of the people who use it. It's terrible for democracy. It's completely destroyed any sense of privacy, and it's undermined entrepreneurship in the United States, because these companies essentially pick off one industry at a time and disrupt it in a way that destroys the old without replacing it with something of equal value.</p><p>                     What's the reaction been inside Facebook to this book?                     One of the things that has been most surprising to me is that no one at Facebook has communicated with me since February 2017. I have known Sheryl since 2000 and she is one of the most politically savvy, exceptionally capable executives you could possibly meet. And the notion that they would not reach out to critics is astonishing. It's so harmful to them to be so closed-minded about criticism.</p><p>The problems are not isolated. They are systemic. They're related to a business model that has worked extraordinarily well for investors and horrifically for everyone else. The failure to recognise that moderation would've been a better long-term strategy for the company is ultimately going to be very costly, because they are leaving governments around the world no choice but to bring the hammer down.</p><p>                     Is this a Facebook problem                      or                      a Mark Zuckerberg problem?                     It's bigger than Facebook. This is a problem with the entire internet platform industry, and Mark is just one of the two most successful practitioners of it.</p><p>This is a cultural model that infected Silicon Valley around 2003 - so, exactly at the time that Facebook and LinkedIn were being started - and it comes from a specific route.</p><p>Silicon Valley spent the period from 1950 to 2003 first with the space programme, and then with personal computers and the internet. The cultures of those things were very idealistic: make the world a better place through technology. Empower the people who use technology to be their best selves. Steve Jobs famously characterised his computers as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/07/zucked-waking-up-to-facebook-catastrophe\">bicycles for the mind</url>.</p><p>The problem with Google and Facebook is that their goal is to replace humans in many of the core activities of life. If you think about what they're doing with artificial intelligence, there are three markets that have proven to be incredibly lucrative: getting rid of white-collar work; telling people what to think with filter bubbles - that's what Facebook does; and recommendation engines that tell people what to enjoy or consume.</p><p>Any list of the things that make us who we are is going include those three characteristics. Our work, the things we believe, and the things we enjoy are part of what makes us human. And to take those away and give those over to a computer instead strikes me as the opposite of bicycles for the mind.</p><p>                     Do you think there's a version of history in which we don't end up in this situation?                     The culture into which Facebook was born was this deeply libertarian philosophy that was espoused by their first investor, Peter Thiel, and the other members of the so-called \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/07/zucked-waking-up-to-facebook-catastrophe\">PayPal</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/07/zucked-waking-up-to-facebook-catastrophe\">mafia</url> \".</p><p>They were almost single-handedly responsible for creating the social generation of companies. And their insights were brilliant. Their ideas about how to grow companies were revolutionary and extraordinarily successful. The challenge was that they also had a very different philosophy from the prior generations of Silicon Valley. Their notion was that disruption was perfectly reasonable because you weren't actually responsible for anybody but yourself, so you weren't responsible for the consequences of your actions.</p><p>That philosophy got baked into their companies in this idea that you could have a goal - in Facebook's case, connecting the whole world on one network - and that goal would be so important that it justified whatever means were necessary to get there.</p><p>                     You said Brexit was a wake-up call. Why was that?                     It never occurred to me that there would be an asymmetry in the way that advertising works. That in order to command attention, you want to appeal to what [Tristan Harris] calls \"the lizard brain\", the things that provoke outrage and fear. Things that essentially create a perception of reward. Those things, when you put them into advertising, can really be bad for democracy. Suddenly a neutral centrist idea gets very little traction on Facebook, where really extreme, emotionally charged ideas are viral.</p><p>There's evidence that in the US, the messages of the Trump campaign got 17 times the effective reach per dollar spent as Clinton's messages, and that's just a staggering advantage.</p><p>With Brexit, because of the shocking outcome, I had to ask myself: had Facebook played a role? Because clearly Facebook had been part of the promotional strategies of the campaigns. And it was equally clear that in one case you had a very emotionally charged message, and in the other a very neutral message. So it was a pretty good test of that question. I didn't have the data so I didn't know. But the hypothesis occurred to me and in the context of the other things I had seen, raised more alarms.</p><p>                     Can you see Facebook changing on issues like this without being forced to?                     Tristan and I have worked very hard to share our message with people at Facebook in a way that they could accept. After two years of this, I am sceptical about the ability of anyone to get Facebook to make these changes internally.</p><p>So I fear that we're now at the point where external stimuli are the only way this will happen, which is why I emphasise the role that the people who use these products need to play by withdrawing some or all of their attention and by making their voices heard with policymakers in government to force regulatory change.</p><p>                     Zuckerberg argued that the downsides of Facebook are the same as the downsides of the internet. Do you think that's true?                     No. There was an old definition of chutzpah: a child who kills the parents and then begs the mercy of the court because now he's an orphan. That's what we're talking about here. The internet is the way it is because Google and Facebook have made it this way. To Mark's credit, Facebook has been a spectacular success on its own terms, but we should not forget that these are Facebook's terms.</p><p> Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe by Roger McNamee is published by HarperCollins (\u00a316.99).

Facebook 'has a huge impact on politics and social welfare,' he claims, and 'has done things that are truly horrible.' Facebook, he says, is 'terrible for America[2].' McNamee suggests his 'history with the company made me a credible voice.' From 2005 to 2015, McNamee was one of a half dozen managing directors of Elevation Partners, an $1.9 billion private equity firm that bought and sold shares in eight companies, including such oldies as Forbes[3] and Palm. </p><p>U2 singer Bono was a co-founder. Other partners included two former executives from Apple and one from Yahoo. Another is married to the sister of Facebook's COO. Such investors are not necessarily disinterested observers, much less policy experts. Between November 2009[4] and June 2010 Elevation Partners invested $210 million for 1% of Facebook. That was early, but two years after Microsoft made a larger investment. Back then, McNamee and other investors had facetime with Zuckerberg. McNamee supposedly became alarmed while perusing 'Bay Area for Bernie' on Facebook and finding suspicious memes critical of Hillary. Later, he imagined the Brexit vote must be due to misleading Facebook posts (as if British tabloids and TV were silent). 'Brexit happens in June,' he says[5], 'and then I think, Oh my god, what if it's possible that in a campaign setting, the candidate that has the more inflammatory message gets a structural advantage from Facebook? And then in August, we hear about Manafort, so we need to introduce the Russians into the equation.' He suggests goofy Facebook ads by Russian trolls[6] stole the U.S. election from Clinton. Actually, the Mueller indictment said the Internet Research Agency 'allegedly used social media and other internet platforms to address a wide variety of topics[7]' to inflame political debates, frequently taking both sides of divisive issues. Such political trolling for fun and profit (clicks generate advertising money) is commonplace in Russia, and also at home[8] in the USA.McNamee's political agenda is partly a matter of endorsing aggressive discretionary use of antitrust prosecution, which I have analyzed[9] at length in Regulation[10]. But he goes much further than that. He would empower politicians to both dismantle and constrict McNamee's suspiciously selective list of disfavored firms (which absolves Apple[11], Microsoft and others). He also wants government to coddle, bankroll and subsidize the sort of start-ups he'd probably like to invest in - after they're subsidized and protected. And he wants 'public health services to counter internet addiction.' 'We can create a political movement,' says McNamee; 'We can insist on government intervention.' He wants 'to set limits on the markets in which monopoly-class [?] players like Facebook, Google and Amazon can operate.' 'The economy would benefit from breaking them up I favor regulation as way to reduce harmful behavior.'  There is no coherent argument for 'limits on markets,' however, since McNamee doesn't try to explain (nobody could) how Amazon owning a newspaper or grocery store, or Google buying DoubleClick[12], or Microsoft acquiring GitHub[13] could reduce competition in those markets. Facebook owns one of many photo-sharing services (Instagram) that has to compete with email, and Facebook owns one two of many messaging services (WhatsApp and Messenger), among others from Apple and many others, that struggles to compete with texting. Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat compete with others for mobile photo sharing, and with YouTube for video sharing, but they aren't really comparable to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Google Plus for sharing opinions, news and links. 'Breaking-up' Facebook by forcing the sale of Instagram and WhatsApp to different owners (e.g., private equity firms) would make no discernable difference to consumer choices or competition.  McNamee's proposed regulation of 'harmful behavior' would invite political censorship and propaganda. So too would his proposed subsidies and protection from competition for new firms deemed 'civically responsible' by politicians and bureaucrats. 'In exchange for adopting a benign business model, perhaps based on subscriptions, startups would receive protection from the giants. Given that social media is practically a public utility,' he claims, 'I think it is worth considering more aggressive strategies, including government subsidies [because] civically responsible social media may be essential to the future of the country. The subsidies might come in the form of research funding, capital for startups, tax breaks and the like.' McNamee's scheme for inviting ambitious political operatives to force Facebook to submit to being micro-managed as a regulated public utility is because he is confident that most common folk (unlike himself) are easily duped. It is his noblesse oblige to launch a political movement to protect the lumpenproletariat from their childish foolishness. The trouble, as he sees it, is that people friend people they agree with, 'so each persons' News Feed becomes a unique reality, a filter bubble that creates the illusion that most people the user knows believe the same thing. Showing users only posts they agree with was good for Facebook's bottom line,' he claims, 'but some research showed it also increased polarization.' Such sharing of news and opinion among Facebook friends, says McNamee, has 'aggravated the flaws in our democracy while leaving citizens ever less capable of thinking for themselves.' Why is the tendency of like-minded people friend or follow each other any more of a 'threat to democracy' (as McNamee calls it) than conservative Republicans watching Fox News and leftist Democrats watching MSNBC? Should that be banned too? And how is McNamee's proposed Social Media Czar supposed to ban liberals or conservatives (who are said to be increasingly incapable of thinking) from using social media to befriend or follow like-minded people? After all, the FCC and FTC can't even control robocalls and spam texts. Many uses of the Internet involve some personal data about identity, contacts, sometimes politics. Many 'likes' might a strong clue of which party a Facebook user will vote for - but that is easier to find from public voter registration and campaign donation. Google[14] and Apple[15] collect and share data that may reveal your interests, though that can be largely thwarted by deleting your browser and search history. Sites like Facebook or Instagram don't acquire sensitive data about banking, health or criminal offenses. In the case of Facebook, McNamee's feigned hysteria about privacy and data-mining algorithms[16] is mainly about tracking our online shopping and searches to guess what we want to buy. Personally, I find some targeted ads useful but most are easy to ignore. If you hate commercials on TV, cut the cable cord. If you hate commercials on Facebook, close your account. Yet most Facebook users apparently find the social benefits still exceed the privacy costs. That is their choice to make. After a year of criticism from regulators, politicians and professional 'privacy advocates,' Facebook's fourth quarter earnings were up 30%[17] from a year earlier and the number of active monthly users was up 9%. Facebook and Google, like other enormously valuable internet services, are free because of advertising. McNamee's vague vision of 'human-driven social networks' would apparently be 'based on subscriptions' and taxpayer subsidies, including some sort of federal protection from 'giant' domestic and foreign competitors (which at least implies banning takeovers, even though the chance of a big buyout is precisely what motivates many start-ups).  Very few Facebook alternatives[18] have attracted more than a few million users and survived with no ads and no fees. Vero, for example, lured three million users by offering 'access to Vero free for life[19] until further notice' while adding that they 'will confirm the start date and pricing of Vero subscriptions soon.' That business plan begins with early freeloaders then hopes for later suckers. Any subscription-based social medium could work only if everyone we wanted to reach was also willing to pay the fee, which is statistically unlikely. That's why McNamee lobbies to force taxpayers to provide 'human-driven social networks' like Vero with socialist start-up capital and endless subsidies. An author's political agenda often drives the arguments, which explains why extreme rhetoric about hypothetical 'crises' in the future are typically abused to excuse extreme proposals for government meddling in the present. McNamee turns out to be just another missionary for paternalistic big government to throttle successful big tech firms, subsidize less-promising firms, and protect the gullible masses from being persuaded by Facebook posts to make what he regards as politically undesirable choices.

Other partners included two former executives from Apple and one from Yahoo. \u00a0Another is married to the sister of Facebook's COO. Such investors are not necessarily disinterested observers, much less policy experts.<br/>Between November 2009 and June 2010 Elevation Partners invested $210 million for 1% of Facebook. \u00a0That was early, but two years after Microsoft made a larger investment. Back then, McNamee and other investors had facetime with Zuckerberg.<br/>McNamee supposedly became alarmed while perusing \"Bay Area for Bernie\" on Facebook and finding suspicious memes critical of Hillary. \u00a0Later, he imagined the Brexit vote must be due to misleading Facebook posts (as if British tabloids and TV were silent). \"Brexit happens in June,\" he says, \"and then I think, Oh my god, what if it's possible that in a campaign setting, the candidate that has the more inflammatory message gets a structural advantage from Facebook? And then in August, we hear about Manafort, so we need to introduce the Russians into the equation.\"<br/>He suggests goofy Facebook ads by Russian trolls stole the U.S. election from Clinton. Actually, the Mueller indictment said the Internet Research Agency \"allegedly used social media and other internet platforms to address a wide variety of topics\" to inflame political debates, frequently taking both sides of divisive issues. \u00a0Such political trolling for fun and profit (clicks generate advertising money) is commonplace in Russia, and also at home in the USA.<br/>McNamee's political agenda is partly a matter of endorsing aggressive discretionary use of antitrust prosecution, which I have analyzed at length in Regulation. \u00a0But he goes much further than that. \u00a0\u00a0He would empower politicians to both dismantle and constrict McNamee's suspiciously selective list of disfavored firms (which absolves Apple, Microsoft and others). \u00a0He also wants government to coddle, bankroll and subsidize the sort of start-ups he'd probably like to invest in - after they're subsidized and protected. \u00a0And he wants \"public health services to counter internet addiction.\"<br/>\"We can create a political movement,\" says McNamee; \"We can insist on government intervention.\" \u00a0He wants \"to set limits on the markets in which monopoly-class [?] players like Facebook, Google and Amazon can operate.\" \"The economy would benefit from breaking them up... I favor regulation as way to reduce harmful behavior.\"<br/>There is no coherent argument for \"limits on markets,\" however, since McNamee doesn't try to explain (nobody could) how Amazon owning a newspaper or grocery store, or Google buying DoubleClick, or Microsoft acquiring GitHub could reduce competition in those markets.<br/>Facebook owns one of many photo-sharing services (Instagram) that has to compete with email, and Facebook owns one of many messaging services (WhatsApp and Messenger), among others from Apple and many others, that struggles to compete with texting.<br/>Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat compete with others for mobile photo sharing, and with YouTube for video sharing, but they aren't really comparable to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Google Plus for sharing opinions, news and links. \u00a0\"Breaking-up\" Facebook by forcing the sale of Instagram and WhatsApp to different owners (e.g., private equity firms) would make no discernable difference to consumer choices or competition.<br/>McNamee's proposed regulation of \"harmful behavior\" would invite political censorship and propaganda. \u00a0So too would his proposed subsidies and protection from competition for new firms deemed \"civically responsible\" by politicians and bureaucrats. \"In exchange for adopting a benign business model, perhaps based on subscriptions, startups would receive protection from the giants. Given that social media is practically a public utility,\" he claims, \"I think it is worth considering more aggressive strategies, including government subsidies ... [because] civically responsible social media may be essential to the future of the country. The subsidies might come in the form of research funding, capital for startups, tax breaks and the like.\"<br/>McNamee's scheme for inviting ambitious political operatives to force Facebook to submit to being micro-managed as a regulated public utility is because he is confident that most common folk (unlike himself) are easily duped. \u00a0It is his noblesse oblige to launch a political movement to protect the lumpenproletariat from their childish foolishness.<br/>The trouble, as he sees it, is that people friend people they agree with, \"so each persons' News Feed becomes a unique reality, a filter bubble that creates the illusion that most people the user knows believe the same thing. Showing users only posts they agree with was good for Facebook's bottom line,\" he claims, \"but some research showed it also increased polarization.\" \u00a0Such sharing of news and opinion among Facebook friends, says McNamee, has \"aggravated the flaws in our democracy while leaving citizens ever less capable of thinking for themselves.\"<br/>Why is the tendency of like-minded people friend or follow each other any more of a \"threat to democracy\" (as McNamee calls it) than conservative Republicans watching Fox News and leftist Democrats watching MSNBC? Should that be banned too? And how is McNamee's proposed Social Media Czar supposed to ban liberals or conservatives (who are said to be increasingly incapable of thinking) from using social media to befriend or follow like-minded people? After all, the FCC and FTC can't even control robocalls and spam texts.<br/>Many uses of the Internet involve some personal data about identity, contacts, sometimes politics. Many \"likes\" might a strong clue of which party a Facebook user will vote for - but that is easier to find from public voter registration and campaign donation. \u00a0Google and Apple collect and share data that may reveal your interests, though that can be largely thwarted by deleting your browser and search history. Sites like Facebook or Instagram don't acquire sensitive data about banking, health or criminal offenses. \u00a0In the case of Facebook, McNamee's feigned hysteria about privacy and data-mining algorithms is mainly about tracking our online shopping and searches to guess what we want to buy. \u00a0Personally, I find some targeted ads useful but most are easy to ignore.<br/>If you hate commercials on TV, cut the cable cord. If you hate commercials on Facebook, close your account. \u00a0Yet most Facebook users apparently find the social benefits still exceed the privacy costs. That is their choice to make. After a year of criticism from regulators, politicians and professional \"privacy advocates,\" Facebook's fourth quarter earnings were up 30% from a year earlier and the number of active monthly users was up 9%.<br/>Facebook and Google, like other enormously valuable internet services, are free because of advertising. McNamee's vague vision of \"human-driven social networks\" would apparently be \"based on subscriptions\" and taxpayer subsidies, including some sort of federal protection from \"giant\" domestic and foreign competitors (which at least implies banning takeovers, even though the chance of a big buyout is precisely what motivates many start-ups). \u00a0<br/>Very few Facebook alternatives have attracted more than a few million users and survived with no ads and no fees. \u00a0Vero, for example, lured three million users by offering \"access to Vero free for life... until further notice\" while adding that they \"will confirm the start date and pricing of Vero subscriptions soon.\" \u00a0That business plan begins with early freeloaders then hopes for later suckers. Any subscription-based social medium could work only if everyone we wanted to reach was also willing to pay the fee, which is statistically unlikely. \u00a0That's why McNamee lobbies to force taxpayers to provide \"human-driven social networks\" like Vero with socialist start-up capital and endless subsidies.<br/>An author's political agenda often drives the arguments, which explains why extreme rhetoric about hypothetical \"crises\" in the future are typically abused to excuse extreme proposals for government meddling in the present. \u00a0McNamee turns out to be just another missionary for paternalistic big government to throttle successful big tech firms, subsidize less-promising firms, and protect the gullible masses from being persuaded by Facebook posts to make what he regards as politically undesirable choices.<br/>\u00a0<br/>This article was originally published by Cato at Liberty.

Facebook \"has a huge impact on politics and social welfare,\" he claims, and \"has done things that are truly horrible.\" Facebook, he says, is \"terrible for America.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">McNamee suggests his \"history with the company made me a credible voice.\" From 2005 to 2015, McNamee was one of a half dozen managing directors of Elevation Partners, an $1.9 billion private equity firm that bought and sold shares in eight companies, including such oldies as Forbes and Palm. U2 singer Bono was a co-founder. Other partners included two former executives from Apple and one from Yahoo. Another is married to the sister of Facebook's COO. Such investors are not necessarily disinterested observers, much less policy experts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Between November 2009 and June 2010 Elevation Partners invested $210 million for 1% of Facebook. That was early, but two years after Microsoft made a larger investment. Back then, McNamee and other investors had facetime with Zuckerberg.</p><p>McNamee supposedly became alarmed while perusing \"Bay Area for Bernie\" on Facebook and finding suspicious memes critical of Hillary. Later, he imagined the Brexit vote must be due to misleading Facebook posts (as if British tabloids and TV were silent). \"Brexit happens in June,\" he says, \"and then I think, Oh my god, what if it's possible that in a campaign setting, the candidate that has the more inflammatory message gets a structural advantage from Facebook? And then in August, we hear about Manafort, so we need to introduce the Russians into the equation.\"</p><p>He suggests goofy Facebook ads by Russian trolls stole the U.S. election from Clinton. Actually, the Mueller indictment said the Internet Research Agency \"allegedly used social media and other internet platforms to address a wide variety of topics\" to inflame political debates, frequently taking both sides of divisive issues. Such political trolling for fun and profit (clicks generate advertising money) is commonplace in Russia, and also at home in the USA.</p><p>McNamee's political agenda is partly a matter of endorsing aggressive discretionary use of antitrust prosecution, which I have analyzed at length in Regulation. But he goes much further than that. He would empower politicians to both dismantle and constrict McNamee's suspiciously selective list of disfavored firms (which absolves Apple, Microsoft and others). He also wants government to coddle, bankroll and subsidize the sort of start-ups he'd probably like to invest in after they're subsidized and protected. And he wants \"public health services to counter internet addiction.\"</p><p>\"We can create a political movement,\" says McNamee; \"We can insist on government intervention.\" He wants \"to set limits on the markets in which monopoly-class [?] players like Facebook, Google and Amazon can operate.\" \"The economy would benefit from breaking them up I favor regulation as way to reduce harmful behavior.\"</p><p>There is no coherent argument for \"limits on markets,\" however, since McNamee doesn't try to explain (nobody could) how Amazon owning a newspaper or grocery store, or Google buying DoubleClick, or Microsoft acquiring GitHub could reduce competition in those markets.</p><p>Facebook owns one of many photo-sharing services (Instagram) that has to compete with email, and Facebook owns one</p><p>two of many messaging services (WhatsApp and Messenger), among others from Apple and many others, that struggles to compete with texting.</p><p>Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat compete with others for mobile photo sharing, and with YouTube for video sharing, but they aren't really comparable to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Google Plus for sharing opinions, news and links. \"Breaking-up\" Facebook by forcing the sale of Instagram and WhatsApp to different owners (e.g., private equity firms) would make no discernable difference to consumer choices or competition.</p><p>McNamee's proposed regulation of \"harmful behavior\" would invite political censorship and propaganda. So too would his proposed subsidies and protection from competition for new firms deemed \"civically responsible\" by politicians and bureaucrats. \"In exchange for adopting a benign business model, perhaps based on subscriptions, startups would receive protection from the giants. Given that social media is practically a public utility,\" he claims, \"I think it is worth considering more aggressive strategies, including government subsidies [because] civically responsible social media may be essential to the future of the country. The subsidies might come in the form of research funding, capital for startups, tax breaks and the like.\"</p><p>McNamee's scheme for inviting ambitious political operatives to force Facebook to submit to being micro-managed as a regulated public utility is because he is confident that most common folk (unlike himself) are easily duped. It is his noblesse oblige to launch a political movement to protect the lumpenproletariat from their childish foolishness.</p><p>The trouble, as he sees it, is that people friend people they agree with, \"so each persons' News Feed becomes a unique reality, a filter bubble that creates the illusion that most people the user knows believe the same thing. Showing users only posts they agree with was good for Facebook's bottom line,\" he claims, \"but some research showed it also increased polarization.\" Such sharing of news and opinion among Facebook friends, says McNamee, has \"aggravated the flaws in our democracy while leaving citizens ever less capable of thinking for themselves.\"</p><p>Why is the tendency of like-minded people friend or follow each other any more of a \"threat to democracy\" (as McNamee calls it) than conservative Republicans watching Fox News and leftist Democrats watching MSNBC? Should that be banned too? And how is McNamee's proposed Social Media Czar supposed to ban liberals or conservatives (who are said to be increasingly incapable of thinking) from using social media to befriend or follow like-minded people? After all, the FCC and FTC can't even control robocalls and spam texts.</p><p>Many uses of the Internet involve some personal data about identity, contacts, sometimes politics. Many \"likes\" might a strong clue of which party a Facebook user will vote for but that is easier to find from public voter registration and campaign donation. Google and Apple collect and share data that may reveal your interests, though that can be largely thwarted by deleting your browser and search history. Sites like Facebook or Instagram don't acquire sensitive data about banking, health or criminal offenses. In the case of Facebook, McNamee's feigned hysteria about privacy and data-mining algorithms is mainly about tracking our online shopping and searches to guess what we want to buy. Personally, I find some targeted ads useful but most are easy to ignore.</p><p>If you hate commercials on TV, cut the cable cord. If you hate commercials on Facebook, close your account. Yet most Facebook users apparently find the social benefits still exceed the privacy costs. That is their choice to make. After a year of criticism from regulators, politicians and professional \"privacy advocates,\" Facebook's fourth quarter earnings were up 30% from a year earlier and the number of active monthly users was up 9%.</p><p>Facebook and Google, like other enormously valuable internet services, are free because of advertising. McNamee's vague vision of \"human-driven social networks\" would apparently be \"based on subscriptions\" and taxpayer subsidies, including some sort of federal protection from \"giant\" domestic and foreign competitors (which at least implies banning takeovers, even though the chance of a big buyout is precisely what motivates many start-ups).</p><p>Very few Facebook alternatives have attracted more than a few million users and survived with no ads and no fees. Vero, for example, lured three million users by offering \"access to Vero free for life until further notice\" while adding that they \"will confirm the start date and pricing of Vero subscriptions soon.\" That business plan begins with early freeloaders then hopes for later suckers. Any subscription-based social medium could work only if everyone we wanted to reach was also willing to pay the fee, which is statistically unlikely. That's why McNamee lobbies to force taxpayers to provide \"human-driven social networks\" like Vero with socialist start-up capital and endless subsidies.</p><p>An author's political agenda often drives the arguments, which explains why extreme rhetoric about hypothetical \"crises\" in the future are typically abused to excuse extreme proposals for government meddling in the present. McNamee turns out to be just another missionary for paternalistic big government to throttle successful big tech firms, subsidize less-promising firms, and protect the gullible masses from being persuaded by Facebook posts to make what he regards as politically undesirable choices.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122725276</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VG5-CB51-DYTH-G1HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1512\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It has been sold for over $17 million by Irvine\u2019s man on the ground in Florida, Julian Johnston, who tells me that it\u2019s a sale price that equates to $2,300 a square foot.</p><p>It\u2019s not quite the $20 million Irvine was hoping for when it went on the market but it\u2019s still close to treble what a company controlled by him bought it for in 2015, which was just under $6 million.</p><p>In the last three years, Johnston has flogged about $60 million-worth of beach-front property in this area of San Marino, one of a chain of man-made islands in the Biscayne Bay called the Venetians, an area which is a particular favourite of Irvine\u2019s.</p><p>Speaking of islands, Irvine lives on a private island in the Bahamas that he developed from scratch, sometimes taking to a digger himself, to build a luxury retreat in the location where some of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies were filmed.</p><p>In less palm-fringed property development news, Irvine recently told Property Week that he is ramping up his interests in his native North, now that prices are inching up there.</p><p>[caption id=\"attachment_417910\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"] Paul Tweed: kept busy with social media work Pic: Stephen Davison/Pacemaker[/caption]</p><p>A Zambia-based business family has launched a High Court action in Dublin against Facebook in what is likely to be part of a growing trend.</p><p>The Yousuf family, who have investments in mining, energy and consumer goods in Africa and the Middle East, are seeking the removal of material on Facebook that they say is defamatory and are also considering seeking damages.</p><p>\u201cFacebook has been repeatedly requested to take down untrue and highly defamatory material but has failed to do so, leaving our client no alternative but to seek the assistance of the courts,\u201d their lawyer, Paul Tweed, tells me. (Facebook\u2019s legal team acknowledged the case, but didn\u2019t want to comment further.)</p><p>Best known for pursuing print publications like the National Enquirer on behalf of Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez, Tweed has pivoted now to focus more on defamation actions against Facebook, Twitter and other social giants. Last week, he told the New York Times that he thinks the sites should be treated in a similar way to publishers of newspapers and other traditional media in libel matters.</p><p>Social media behemoths are increasingly finding themselves caught in the crosshairs of regulators in relation to defamation and privacy issues for which they don\u2019t have to answer to press complaints or advertising bodies in the way that traditional publications do. That means that often the only resort for those affected is the courts. If the social media companies don\u2019t react faster to complaints, they could start getting legally clobbered.</p><p>In a similar move to the Yousufs, Liam McCaffrey, a director of a company formerly owned by Cavan businessman Sean Quinn, unleashed his own High Court action against Facebook last week. He is seeking to have taken down material posted on a Facebook page set up by supporters of the Quinn family that he thinks is libellous.</p><p>The problem is that, once the material is taken down by Facebook, similar pages simply crop up again in another guise, and the people behind them are difficult to trace. McCaffrey, whose company Quinn Industrial Holdings has previously taken Facebook to task on similar matters, took this High Court case after his lawyers wrote to Facebook several times, but made little progress in having the issue tackled, sources said.</p><p>Also being shaken out of its sleepy norms is the credit union movement.</p><p>While there is a long-held ambition to enter the mortgage and banking fields, and a more recent one to get involved in backing social housing, the Central Bank is seeking better governance, systems and attention to regulatory matters from the movement.</p><p>Patrick Casey, the Central Bank\u2019s credit union registrar, is bypassing boards and even the main umbrella group, the Irish League of Credit Unions, and seeking to engage directly with the chief executives of the country\u2019s biggest branches about setting up a chief executive steering committee that would drive future direction in a focused way.</p><p>Casey wrote to the chief executives of the country\u2019s biggest credit unions recently and requested a response from them with their insights by this coming Tuesday.</p><p>Close observers see this as a sidelining of a rather sleepy League and the boards of directors of local credit unions in favour of a more dynamic way of getting things done.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>A well-known Dublin business name was on the receiving end of a Nama legal suit recently.</p><p>For some time now, Nama has been pursuing cinema tycoon Tom Anderson over monies in a case dating back to 2015.Now Nama offshoot NALM has obtained a judgment against Anderson in the amount of \u20ac776,727, which I understand relates to a personal guarantee. Anderson denied owing the money at all when contacted, though clearly Nama disagrees.</p><p>The Andersons are a very well-known Dublin business dynasty who run cinemas north and south of the border, as well as having other private investments.</p><p>Another well known business family are the Beshoffs, since their ancestor Ivan Beshoff, the last known survivor of the Battleship Potemkin mutiny, arrived here in the early 20th century.</p><p>Jeremy Beshoff i a scion of the family best known for their legendary fish and chip shops.Nama initiated a High Court case against Beshoff Motors and Jeremy, a businessman with a luxury second-hand car dealership company in Howth.</p><p>Nama owns the dealership site, which is part of two sites assembled during the boom by Ray Grehan, just before the property market apocalypse in 2007.</p><p>Grehan paid a cool \u20ac62 million for the adjoining Techrete and Teeling sites. He had form for such zinging top-of-the-market deals, having already famously bought the former UCD veterinary college for a record price at the top of the market, though it soon slumped spectacularly.</p><p>The former Techrete plant is where Beshoff Motors is renting, which suited it fine during the years when you wouldn\u2019t have had a hope in hell of selling the place. Now, though, I understand that Nama wants to sell this lucrative property on but is in dispute with Beshoff about the move.</p><p>The matter was due to go to mediation, but subsequently appeared before the courts.

As we've also been pointing out[2], the cable industry has been throwing an absolutely epic hissy fit about this plan, given it would destroy the $21 billion in annual revenues cable operators make off of cable box rental fees. Since it can't just admit this is all about protecting set top rental fees, the cable industry has been pushing an endless wave[3] of editorials in newspapers and websites nationwide, claiming more set top box competition will hurt consumer privacy, increase piracy, harm diversity[4], and rip the very planet from its orbital axis.Most of these editorials are being penned by the usual assortment of entertainment industry and telecom hand-wringers, the majority of whom have a vested financial interest in the status quo and as such have been happy to repeat the talking point that the FCC's well-intentioned plan is just a secret plan by \"big Tech\" (aka Google) to treat the noble and ultra-innovative cable industry unfairly.Back in March we noted that despite the fact that such rules would obviously help streaming set top vendors, Roku had come out in defense[5] of the cable industry, rather timidly saying it wouldn't be supporting the FCC's plan because it has been trying to secure new, semi-exclusive deals with cable providers: \"We have not been advocating for a rule making in this area at this time,' Tricia Mifsud, a Roku spokeswoman, told IBD. </p><p>'While we are known for selling streaming players, it is only one area of our business. Customers also access our platform through smart TVs and streaming players that operators deploy.\"Roku's opposition to the FCC's plan became a little clearer last week, when Comcast (trying to preempt the FCC's plan), announced it was launching an initiative to let some Comcast customers access cable content via Comcast apps[6] on third party devices. Comcast's partners in this new initiative? Samsung and Roku, who'll be offering the Comcast Xfinity app on smart TVs and streaming devices. And while Comcast's plan is certainly a step in the right direction, Comcast being Comcast you can be fairly certain that there will be caveats when the program launches to ensure the impact to set top box revenue is minimized. Comcast's plan obviously also doesn't impact other pay TV operators, so it doesn't really change things for the overall industry.Trying to defend the company's self-immolating position, Roku CEO Anothony Wood decided last week to write an editorial over at the Wall Street Journal[7], breathlessly insisting the FCC's plan would hurt consumers. And, as with every editorial of this type, Google is trotted out as the bogeyman pulling the FCC's strings in a plan to somehow treat cable companies unfairly:\"...With prodding from Google and TiVo, the FCC is proposing new 'set-top-box' rules that would force cable companies to make their video services available as an 'open' set of streams. In other words, companies like Comcast or DirecTV would be required to provide their video, guide data and encryption for use by other companies who could then create their own hardware and software to deliver cable content. As Google argued in an FCC filing last year, the intent is to 'unleash competition in the retail navigation-device market' and drive down costs.This might seem like a great deal for consumers and companies like mine, but once you start peeling back the layers, the picture changes. The proposed regulation would\u2014as we say in the industry\u2014'decouple the user interface' from the video and data itself. This would allow a company like Google to do to the TV what it did on the Web\u2014build an interface without the 'inconvenience' of licensing content or entering into business agreements with content companies such as ABC, FOX, HBO, or video distributors like pay TV operators. The unintended consequences of circumventing these kinds of arrangements are likely to include increased costs for consumers, reduced choices and less innovation.\"But if you actually read the FCC's proposal so far[8] (pdf), you'll notice the plan does nothing of the sort. In short, customers will still have to pay their cable provider to access cable content, it will just be delivered to additional hardware platforms -- using copyright protection standards determined by the cable industry. The content can't just be repackaged without cable companies getting compensation. How letting consumers have access to more, better and cheaper methods to access the same content results in \"reduced choice and less innovation\" is a logical leap that makes no coherent sense whatsoever. Similarly, this repeated claim that this is some secret cabal by Google -- when the quest for clunky cable set top box reform is decades old -- remains a bizarre narrative unsupported by reason. Would Google benefit from open set top boxes? Yes. So would countless other hardware vendors and developers.Woods also tries to argue that regulation isn't necessary, because we're already seeing innovation in the streaming set top box market:\"Regulating the set-top box is unnecessary in the modern age of Internet streaming. Consumers now have tremendous choice for their TV operating system and interface. Robust competition among companies like Roku, Apple, Amazon and Google is already driving rapid innovation and pushing costs down.Right, but we're not talking about streaming players and services, we're talking about the traditional cable set top box. You know, the cable boxes that consumers, on average, pay $231 to rent annually (and thousands of dollars for over the life of the hardware) despite most boxes being worth a fraction of that? And while we have seen some innovation in recent years on the set top box front (voice search, marginally less archaic GUIs), by and large the cable box remains a clunky relic of a bygone era and a cornerstone of the cable industry's antiquated and uncompetitive walled garden approach to customer services.The thing is that if anybody should know better, it's Roku. The company had to file a complaint with the FCC[9] (pdf) after Comcast spent years refusing to let its customers access HBO Go on Roku devices (in order, of course, to push those users toward Comcast's own Xfinity set top boxes and apps). Roku also expressed concerns in net neutrality filings with the FCC[10] that Comcast was using TV Anywhere authentication as yet another way to inhibit Internet video competitors; Roku included:\"A large and powerful MVPD may use this leverage in negotiations with content providers or operators of streaming platforms, ultimately favoring parties that can either afford to pay for the privilege of authentication, or have other business leverage that can be used as a counterweight to discriminatory authentication. Additionally, MVPDs with affiliated ISPs can abuse their power over authentication by choosing to authenticate only their own or affiliated offerings.\"Yet here we are, with Roku's CEO now playing kissy face with that same company because they've struck a new deal that will give Roku its own, special advantage in the pay TV market.It should be noted that Woods wasn't entirely willing to pledge unwavering fealty to Comcast. Nor is his editorial entirely devoid of good points. Though Woods isn't willing to mention his new BFF by name, he does make some vague references to Comcast's decision to give its own content an unfair advantage[11] via usage caps and zero rating:\"...the FCC proposal is distracting from the leading risk to the continued evolution of TV\u2014open and fair broadband Internet access for all consumers. In particular, cable companies often control their customers' broadband access and can take measures against competing streaming services and devices to give their own streaming services and devices an advantage. FCC regulations banning the discriminatory use of data caps and 'zero-rating' schemes that selectively exempt certain content from data limits are far more important to the future of TV than 'opening' the cable box.If broadband Internet services are accessible and affordable to consumers and there is a level playing field for content providers and devices makers, then consumers will benefit from a revolutionized television experience. Let's not bog down the revolution with an unnecessary government intervention in a dynamic marketplace.In other words, while Woods is perfectly happy to blow a few kisses to protect his new business relationship with the Philadelphia-based cable giant, he's not willing to entirely sell himself and his company down river by ignoring the problems Comcast is causing on the net neutrality and zero rating fronts. And this is actually the one area I don't disagree with Woods on. With Internet video disrupting traditional cable anyway, it might make more sense for the FCC to focus its efforts on improving broadband competition. And, more specifically, the telecom industry's use of usage caps and zero rating[12] to protect legacy TV from Internet video.By the FCC's logic however, the glacial pace of cord cutting means that traditional cable and ye olde cable box will still be a dominant force for much of the next decade -- and consumers could still benefit from increased cable set top box competition during that period. The problem is that the cable industry clearly intends to fight this proposal tooth and nail, by dragging the FCC's effort out via lawsuit[13], and funding a major PR offensive in the hopes of convincing the public the FCC's gone power mad. With so many efforts on its plate (from municipal broadband[14] to new broadband privacy rules[15]), the FCC may have to seriously consider just which battles are truly worth fighting, and which problems, like the cable box, may be resolved organically by the market.All of that said, it remains more than a little embarrassing that Woods and Roku are so eager to sell their longer-term success -- and the overall viability of the broader streaming industry -- downriver just to snuggle up a little closer to one of the most anti-competitive companies in the television industry.Permalink[16] |

Investors taking some profits after yesterday's big rallies.</p><p>KEENAN: That is right, and today's move is expanding the Nasdaq's losses on the week.  It's already down about 1 1/2 percent since Monday morning.</p><p>TUCKER: Yes, Wall street digesting specific earning news this morning, and let's take a look at what's happening.  Hewlett-Packard, the biggest loser on the Dow side of the ledger here.  Hewlett-Packard down more than nine.  That after Agilent, its spin-off, announced that it would be missing quarterly expectations by, oh, half of what analysts had expected.  Agilent also taking a big hit on the Street today as well.</p><p>Technology stocks on the Dow now under pressure.  IBM down 2. Intel down 2.  You can see the pressure being reflected in the technology sector in the Nasdaq, which is down 74 1/4 points.</p><p>KEENAN: That is right.  And, as Bill mentioned, shares of Agilent reeling after a warning that it will not meet analysts' expectations for its third quarter.  Let's get all the gory details from Christine Romans at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>And this stock is active and down hard?</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is very active and it is down very hard, Terry, a big crowd around that post from the get-go earlier today after the company, the Hewlett-Packard spin-off that makes testing and measurement equipment, it said its third-quarter earnings would be 18-22 cents a share and sales also to be disappointing.  The First Call consensus estimate was for 35 cents a share.  So, wow, investors really selling off shares of Agilent.</p><p>Now, as I said, Agilent is a spin-off of Hewlett-Packard, and you are seeing some sympathy selling in Hewlett-Packard as well.  It is one of a handful of big tech losers in the Dow Jones industrial average.  Hewlett-Packard stock hurt by those Agilent losses.  Merrill Lynch says that Hewlett is also seeing some weakness in its printer business.  However, the company maintains that other areas of the business will offset that weakness.</p><p>Another stock that we are watching, Lexmark International.  LXK is the ticker symbol.  This company misses its second quarter, warns about its third quarter.  These are all earnings-related stories here today.  It said its second quarter profit rose about 13 percent, but that misses the Street's estimates of 64 cents a share.</p><p>So this is what we're watching here today.  It is really a tech story.  Financials, interestingly enough, are holding up.  Lots of folks have been saying, if we are going to see a resumption or a continuation of the summertime rally, you got to have financials and techs maybe moving higher together.  So while the techs are faltering here today, Terry and Bill, we are seeing some stability at least in the financial sector.</p><p>Back to you guys.</p><p>KEENAN: And Chris, maybe you can just clarify for our viewers that Agilent quote, because we had that on the screen as down 5. Though when business wrapped up there yesterday, the stock was trading a lot higher; right?</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, definitely.  I mean, when you look at from the way it was trading from the New York Stock Exchange close, the stock was off more than $20 in the early going.  Big losses there for Agilent shares.  It's interesting too, SalomonSmith Barney cutting its price target on the stock from $120 a share to $50 a share.  There you go.</p><p>KEENAN: Ouch, OK, thanks Chris, Christine Romans.</p><p>TUCKER: All right, it doesn't look any better on the technology side either.  Mr. Softy, otherwise known as Microsoft, looking softer again today, down a buck and a half.  Charles Molineaux is following the action on the Nasdaq for us.</p><p>Good morning, Charles.</p><p>CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Bill. Well, yes, we are sliding down, and actually not too far from our session low.  We hit a new one, down 83 points, at 4101, within the last half hour, Earnings is of course the big story today, and most of the earnings news is more or less good and so the selling continue. Right now, we are off by 74 point.</p><p>Check out Ericsson for one, which is off by 10 percent, almost 11, at 2 7/16 loss, that is at $20 a share.  Now, Ericsson reportedly made more than $1 billion in the second quarter, $1.1 billion.  That is better than the analysts' forecast, but the company also says its third-quarter profits are going to fall.  Ericsson's mobile phone division is still suffering losses and it is now launching some changes.  For one thing, it will be outsourcing both its design and production of its low-end phones for the first time ever.  Prudential is reiterating a rousing accumulate rating on Ericsson.</p><p>Sun Microsystems is the happy story of the day for the Nasdaq. This is one of our biggest big caps, up by 6.50, or 6 1/2 percent. at 104 a share.  It made 39 cents a share.  It beat the analysts' forecasts by six cents a share.  For the first time its sales came in at more five billion dollars and the analysts coming out positive on the stock.  Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, Merrill Lynch, and Credit Suisse First Boston, are all raising their targets for a stock price. SalomonSmith Barney is calling this a core tech holding.</p><p>Xilinx, however, is off $13 or 15 1/2 percent after rolling out its earnings, 27 cents a share on the first quarter.  That's two cents above the projections.  But after yesterday's run-up, some analysts figured it was going to sell off today.  Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown says this kind of selling is a buying opportunity, because Xilinx is showing good growth.</p><p>And Ventro, here we go again, down by six dollars or 30 percent on the day.  Yes, its bottom line beat the Street.  But its sales don't look so hot.  Ventro is a business-to-business e-commerce company.  It lost 74 cents a share in the second quarter.  That is a smaller loss than the market had expected.  But its revenues fell below some of the analysts' expectations, US Bancorp, Piper Jaffray, Credit Suisse First Boston, and Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, as well as Prudential have all cut their ratings on this stock.  And down it goes, a 30 percent loss.</p><p>One of the worst performers on the Nasdaq today, while the composite continues to look down, down 74 points at the moment at 4109.  And again we're looking at bad breadth on this market, too. The number of stocks going down outnumber those going up by two to one -- Bill, Terry.</p><p>TUCKER: All right, let's hope for a rally.  Hate to end the week on a down note, thanks, Charles.</p><p>KEENAN: Well, Verizon Communications is guiding the Street about its upcoming earnings.  The company, recently formed by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE, says that it will announce second-quarter earnings next month when it will talk about its post-merger financial outlook.  Now Verizon says it's confident to meet each of the company's earnings estimates.  It's going to be a nice boost to its shares today.  The stock initially shot up on June 30, when the merger was completed.  But it's dropped 13 percent ever since.  And currently, that stock trading up 3 7/8.</p><p>TUCKER: And there is a reason for that.  And Andy Serwer of \"Fortune\" magazine has been taking a look at Verizon, VZ, the ticker.</p><p>Andy, what's going on here?</p><p>ANDY SERWER, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, \"FORTUNE\": Yes, well, first of all, I promise to call it Verizon and not \"Varizon,\" Terry.  Remember I did that the other day.</p><p>KEENAN: You called it \"Horizon.\"</p><p>SERWER: Yes, right, Horizon, Verizon.</p><p>Anyway, the stock, as you mentioned, was a nice one when it came out on June 30.  It got up to 57 bucks and promptly fell down as low as 43, I believe.  Real questions about post-merger charges, that's the problem here.  And you know, a bunch of issues surrounding this story, very complicated.  Again, they spun off Genuity, and so a real difficult situation.  We'll get back to that, more maybe later.</p><p>TUCKER: Andy? yes, I was going to say, I'm sorry we have to cut into you.  We need to go down to Bill Hemmer in Atlanta.  There are some developments at Camp David we need to be brought up to speed on -- Bill.</p><p>BILL HEMMER, CNN ANCHOR: Terry and Bill, thank you.</p><p>Quickly, to our viewers, up to Camp David, Richard Boucher, now, before the microphone there.</p><p>We'll listen.</p><p>(JOINED IN PROGRESS)</p><p>RICHARD BOUCHER, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: \u2026 people sat together.  Both Chairman Arafat and Prime Minister Barak came to dinner, and they sat at a table with the secretary, one on one side of the secretary and the other on the other side of the secretary.</p><p>After dinner, negotiators began meeting to discuss the issues involved in the settlement in a permanent status, and they met well into the night.</p><p>Negotiators are resuming their discussions this morning and will continue throughout the day.</p><p>The secretary expects to meet with some of the negotiators to start off, and I expect she'll see the leaders during the course of the day as well.</p><p>As far as briefings here go, just take this opportunity to announce that this evening and tomorrow we'll treat Shabbat the way we did last weekend, so we'll do a briefing here this afternoon, in the late afternoon.  We'll give you the final update before sundown tonight.  And then we won't brief here again until Sunday morning.</p><p>With those updates, I'd be glad to take any questions you have.</p><p>QUESTION: Glad that religion has crept into the State Department.</p><p>The president, there are reports, which seem to be credible, that he's going to come back a few, maybe several hours early.  So as we look ahead to Sunday, without a briefing for a while, what's your best advice?</p><p>BOUCHER: My best advice is to wait and see.</p><p>QUESTION: Will he come back -- will he come back early?  He's already canceled one meeting out in Japan.</p><p>BOUCHER: Yes.  I think most of those reports, Barry, are based on the statement that Mr. Lockhart made traveling with the president. I checked with Okinawa about an hour or so ago.  They do not have a new schedule yet.  But as they said, they are looking to compress the schedule in Japan and see when the president can return here.  So we'll look forward to seeing them back.</p><p>QUESTION: How are we going to work that out, Richard, if the president -- if there is even -- and based on the guidance Joe is giving, there's some indication that the president may be back before a Sunday morning briefing.  So how will we work that?</p><p>BOUCHER: If there is such news, obviously, we'll give it to you. And then we'll plan on doing a Sunday morning briefing to tell you what happens when he gets back.  I expect that the Okinawa -- the traveling party with the president will put out the word on his exact travel plans.</p><p>QUESTION: How would you -- the meeting, the only meeting yesterday between the three people who are now leaders of their delegations, was that dinner, right?</p><p>BOUCHER: That was dinner, yes.</p><p>QUESTION: And you expect that -- you said that you expect that the secretary will see them again today, but separately, is that the\u2026</p><p>BOUCHER: I don't know, probably separately.  There's always the possibility of a three-way meeting, but I'm not aware of anything scheduled like that at this point.  So I would expect to follow the pattern we followed in recent days.</p><p>QUESTION: Can you describe the mood at the top table at dinner?</p><p>BOUCHER: The mood at the top table.  You know, it wasn't a working dinner.  It wasn't a dinner to delve deeply into the issues. They discussed a variety of things, some involving Camp David talks, but also, you might say, the outside world.  They talked about other things going on outside the confines as well.</p><p>QUESTION: There is something to life more than Camp David?</p><p>BOUCHER: Yes.</p><p>QUESTION: Without going into substance, is Madam Secretary dealing with negotiators -- dealing with the negotiators on every subject or is there one or two subjects are being put back until the president comes?</p><p>BOUCHER: There are discussions of all the core issues going on.</p><p>QUESTION: Can I follow up on the dinner?  Were the two leaders engaging with each other?  Were they talking?  What was the dynamic between them?</p><p>BOUCHER: It was a dinner conversation.  Sometimes people were talking, you know, the three of them, sometimes to others, sometimes individually to the secretary, sometimes to each other.  So it was, you know, it was a normal discussion involving, you know, issues of the world as well as some of the Camp David things as well as everything else.</p><p>Not a -- not a working dinner.  I don't want to try to claim that the\u2026</p><p>QUESTION: Do you agree with Joe's old appraisal of the batting average of reports from outside here as about four out of 10?  Four hundred is good enough for the Hall of Fame, but not good enough for journalists.</p><p>BOUCHER: Well, I think you're probably still in the Hall of Fame, but I don't think -- I don't think all those reports out there are accurate, and I wouldn't want to lead you in one direction or the other.</p><p>QUESTION: Any comment on the report this morning -- it was reported by AP, I guess it came out of Jerusalem, that Barak is ready and willing to allow some kind of self-governance in parts of East Jerusalem?</p><p>BOUCHER: I'm not going to get in to any particular position of any particular leader on the issues.  I know there's a lot of reports out there.  And all I can tell you is some of them may be right and some of them are wrong.</p><p>HEMMER: Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman there at Camp David, briefing reporters who have gathered there.  Precious little new information that we have learned.  Although he does indicate the discussions do continue on, quote, \"all of the core issues.\"</p><p>The summit has been tight-lipped regarding news leaks throughout the 11 days there meeting in Camp David, Today is no exception.</p><p>There have been reports, though, that President Clinton, now in Okinawa for that G-8 summit, may cut his trip to Japan early and come back to Camp David and continue talks there.  But again, according to Richard Boucher anyway, that is on a wait-and-see basis.  And we will wait and see.</p><p>IN THE MONEY continues from New York in two minutes, Quick break here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: Well, time now to check some other stories making news this morning.  And for that we go back to Bill in Atlanta -- Bill.</p><p>HEMMER: OK, Bill and Terry, thanks again.  Good morning, once again as well.</p><p>A wildfire racing across tinder dry canyons and mesas drives a thousand tourists from a national park, this is southwestern Colorado.</p><p>Rosa Linda Roman, of our affiliate KOAT, now with the latest from Mesa Verde National Park.  Hello.</p><p>ROSA LINDA ROMAN, KOAT REPORTER: Hi, Bill.</p><p>There are a lot of very disappointed tourists heading up this road, just like these folks from Washington State.  They thought they would spend the day at Mesa Verde National Park, but they were wrong, the park is completely closed, and it is closed for good reason.</p><p>A fire that began yesterday afternoon quickly spread from 50 acres to about 500 acres.  As a precaution, they closed the park and evacuated some 1500 park visitors.  So far, no structures have been destroyed by the fire.  And right now, the only resource threatened is the campground itself.</p><p>Of course, the biggest concern was protecting the ancient cliff dwelling ruins, but we spoke to a Park Service archaeologist just a few minutes ago, and he tells us no major historical sites are threatened at this time.  Still, they are not taking any chances. Some 500 firefighters and support personnel will be out here today to tackle this blaze.</p><p>Now, the good news this morning is that overnight they did make some progress fighting this fire, but the bad news is they were hoping to get it contained today.  It looks like that is not going to happen for another couple of days.</p><p>Reporting live from Mesa Verde National Park, I Rosa Linda Roman.</p><p>HEMMER: Quickly here, before we let you go, wasn't it just a few years ago that national park, that same area, suffered another blaze?</p><p>ROMAN: That's right, and a lot of firefighters headed out here to make sure that those ruins weren't affected then, and they were not.  And they are hoping -- crossing their fingers that it doesn't happen this time.</p><p>HEMMER: All right, we will as well.  Rosa Linda Roman, of our affiliate KOAT there in Mesa Verde, thanks.</p><p>Now to Washington.  On Capitol Hill, a bill giving tax relief to married Americans is now headed to President Clinton.  The Senate, just a short time ago, gave its endorsement to the so-called \"marriage penalty\" bill.  The measure already was passed by the House.  It would cut taxes for almost all married couples beginning this year at a cost of nearly $300 billion over a 10-year period.  President Clinton says he will veto that bill, though, in its current form.  He is favoring more provisions for prescription medication.</p><p>Also, the House has taken a couple of major steps towards easing some long-standing U.S. sanctions against Cuba by convincing margins too.  The House members voted to lift rules that would limit food and drug sales to Cuba, as well as those that restrict travel to the communist country.</p><p>That vote followed some emotional debate on the floor as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ROBERT MENENDEZ (D), NEW JERSEY: The last thing you would want to do is to give subsidies to a dictatorship that rations, uses food and rations its people as a form of control, which is exactly what Castro does.  He uses rationing as a form of control over his people.  So this isn't about selling to the average Cuban, which I probably would be for, this is about selling to the regime!</p><p>REP. CAL DOOLEY (D), CALIFORNIA: A policy of isolation has done nothing to advance democracy over the past 40 years.  It is time for us to adopt a policy that will let us flood Cuba with U.S.-produced rice, with U.S.-produced wheat, with U.S.-produced cattle product, beef products.  That is going to do more to achieve our objectives.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEMMER: Now, despite their victories in the House, supporters of legislation to lift those sanctions against Cuba say they are unsure exactly what will get through Congress this year.  Many lawmakers favor keeping those sanctions in place.</p><p>On a related matter, a Cuban baseball player with a promising career is with his family in Miami today getting phone calls from a number of Major League baseball teams.  Andy Morales released from a detention center in Miami yesterday.  It's the second time the former Cuban baseball team member has tried to defect in six weeks.</p><p>Under immigration policy, Cubans who reach U.S. soil are allowed to stay in the U.S.  Morales caught the eye of baseball fans and teams when his team played against the Baltimore Orioles.</p><p>At Georgia's State Capitol, here in Atlanta, mourners saying goodbye to Senator Paul Coverdell, who died this past week of a brain hemorrhage.  The body of the late Georgia senior senator lying in state today.  Thousands expected to turn out to pay their respects to Coverdell. A memorial service for the 61-year-old Republican senator will be held in Atlanta tomorrow, followed by a private ceremony.  Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, and other political leaders expected to attend tomorrow's memorial service, 61 years of age.</p><p>That does it from me here, back to New York now, more with Bill and Terry.</p><p>TUCKER: All right, terrific.  Thanks, Bill.</p><p>Well, lets get back to Andy.</p><p>Andy, you were talking before we went away to get the developments at Camp David about Verizon.</p><p>SERWER: Right, Verizon.  Yes, I know Camp David took a little precedence there.</p><p>Well, back to Verizon.  This, of course, is the combination of GTE and Bell Atlantic we're talking about, issuing a statement this morning at exactly 7:32 a.m., suggesting that it' numbers are on target, its business is on target, saying we'll be more explicit about this on August 8 when it announces earnings.</p><p>But I was sort of surprised and I think the Street was, Terry and Bill, by the strength of this message, saying that, you know, things really are OK.  And the stock is on the move: Verizon is risin' -- love that one.  And, you know, because essentially they're saying we're going to meet our numbers on that day.</p><p>KEENAN: And you also want to look at an interesting development with Palm and 3Com.  One's going out of the S&amp;P, one's going in.</p><p>SERWER: This has got to be a first, guys.  I mean, I have never heard of a company doing a spinoff, and that spunoff company replacing it in the S&amp;P 500.  Is that fratricide?  No, it's patricide or matricide, right?</p><p>TUCKER: Exactly.  It's one or -- parenticide, whatever it is.</p><p>KEENAN: Oedipal, whatever it is.</p><p>SERWER: Right, it's Oedipal.  We'll just call it that.</p><p>Now, of course -- not of course, but I'll just tell you that 3Com is being added to the S&amp;P Mid Cap 400 index, but that's small consolation because that's not traded the way the S&amp;P 500 is.</p><p>TUCKER: Yes, but, you know, both of those stocks -- because I was curious to see if COMS was down.  In fact, it's trading higher.</p><p>SERWER: Yes, it's trading higher.  That's a bit of a mystery. Maybe I find out about that.  Of course, Palm is up nicely.</p><p>KEENAN: Yes, OK. TUCKER: All right, Andy, thanks.</p><p>SERWER: OK, see you guys.</p><p>KEENAN: And coming up next on IN THE MONEY: It's a 52-week low around $28 a share.  Well, today, it's trading $400 above that.  In a moment, we will talk with the CEO of SDL.</p><p>TUCKER: Plus, the world's third-largest cell phone maker continues to struggle.  Should we take a chance and add it to our portfolio?  You decide.  Ericsson is our \"Stock of the Day.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TUCKER: All right, in today's \"Stock of the Day\" segment, we're looking a this morning's surprise from Swedish wireless giant Ericsson.  The world's third-largest cell phone maker said its handset division lost $200 million in the second quarter.  The company blames supply shortages and vowed to return to profitability within 12 months.  Otherwise, Ericsson showed stellar results.  We decided to make Ericsson our \"Stock of the Day.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(voice-over): Ericsson began its life as a telegraph repair shop in Stockholm in 1876, the same year Alexander Graham Bell applied for a U.S. patent on the telephone.  Ericsson's now the world's third- largest maker of cell phones, behind Nokia and Motorola.</p><p>Ericsson and Nokia are locked in a high-stakes race to become the leader in wireless infrastructure equipment.  Back in May, Ericsson bought Qualcomm's CDMA infrastructure business, and more recently it teamed up with Microsoft to market and deliver mobile e-mail solutions over wireless networks.</p><p>But Ericsson's bid for dominance in mobile networks has come at a price.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have seen this switch from high-end to entry-level phones, and our program has not been matching that moment very well.  So that has been a problem that we have been addressing.</p><p>TUCKER: Sales of its cell phones have been disappointing for several quarters, leading many analysts to speculate that the business could be sold.  Ericsson could then concentrate exclusively on the fast-growing networks unit.  Overall, the company has pledged 25 percent sales growth this year and operating margins of 10 percent.</p><p>In May, Ericsson split its shares four for one, but Ericsson's stock stalled in March after a gain of 300 percent over the previous 12 months.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TUCKER: And shares of Ericsson down 2 7/16 at 20 1/8.</p><p>KEENAN: Well, let's bring in an analyst to discuss the Ericsson conference call that just ended a short while ago.</p><p>TUCKER: Yes, Wojtek Uzdelewicz is Bear Stearns' wireless analyst and his rating on the stock is a mild attractive.</p><p>And, Wojteck, thanks for being on IN THE MONEY.</p><p>WOJTEK UZDELEWICZ, BEAR STEARNS: Thank you.</p><p>TUCKER: Can they find their way back?</p><p>UZDELEWICZ: On the infrastructure, certainly yes.  We're a little bit more cautious on the handset business.  I mean, there are a few things going on there.  It's not only just Ericsson.  I think it's good to step back and look what happened.  Just Qualcomm had disappointing results in terms of a demand fro CDMA handsets. Motorola had a little bit light numbers in terms of handset revenues.</p><p>So Ericsson is just one of the several companies recently reporting somewhat disappointing results in the handset business, and we think this is a combination.  The market is slowing down versus expectations a little bit.  And at the same time, what we have here is also some execution issues within Ericsson.</p><p>It's a great story from the infrastructure perspective.  They're doing very well gaining market share.  But on the handset side, it's going to be pretty tough going forward for them.</p><p>KEENAN: The company seems to now be taking the strategy of moving into the cheaper phones.  Is that the right move, in your opinion?</p><p>UZDELEWICZ: Well, they are looking into limiting their exposure on the low-end handset side by -- they're in the process of finding a partner that could -- and probably a Japanese or Korean partner, or maybe Taiwanese, to help them with out-sourcing in manufacturing and even design of the low-end phones while they will focus on manufacturing and design of the high- and mid-range phones.</p><p>That probably makes some sense, but we're a little bit concerned. It's usually difficult with this type of joint ventures to manage the entire process.  So we're a little bit skeptical how effective they can address the handset issue.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thanks a lot, Wojtek.</p><p>UZDELEWICZ: Thank you.</p><p>KEENAN: And now that you have heard about Ericsson, you will go to the bottom of our CNNfn Web page and vote on whether we should add the stock to our IN THE MONEY portfolio.</p><p>And you told us what you thought about Colgate-Palmolive.  The household and care products giant was yesterday's \"Stock of the Day.\" Fifty-five percent of you voted to buy Colgate shares, but not enough to make it into the portfolio, so it gets a red light.  We're not going to buy any shares.  Colgate-Palmolive, by the way, up 1 3/16 today at 56 and change.</p><p>Well, if you recall, we made JDS Uniphase our Stock of the Day\" 10 days ago on its announcement to buy SDL for $41 billion in stock. SDL, a fiber-optics component maker has certainly been on a roll. Look at this: up 1,217 percent since January along.  That's a tenfold increase.  It also jumped 19 percent yesterday.  This on the announcement that JDS Uniphase will be added to the S&amp;P 500.  That happens next Wednesday.</p><p>TUCKER: And for a closer look at SDL, we're joined now by its CFO, Don Scifres.</p><p>And welcome, sir, to IN THE MONEY.</p><p>DON SCIFRES, CEO, SDL: Thank you.  Good morning.</p><p>TUCKER: Nice to see you.  Congratulations on your results. They're really nice looking results.  I want to focus on the demand side of this, though, at the beginning of the interview.  You're experiencing tremendous demand.  You're going to have to increase your capacity, I believe, by something like five times in order to meet all the people that want your product.  That's good on one side, but doesn't that mean you've got the potential of cutting into earnings by having to do a lot of capital spending here?</p><p>SCIFRES: Well, we will be doing capital spending, but we've been able to do that capital spending along the way.  We -- this year, we grew by 240 percent in our fiber-optics product line.  So we've been spending along the way and actually increased our earnings along the way over the past 12 months.</p><p>KEENAN: All right, we just want to apologize, you are, of course, the CEO of the company.  Let me ask you about the deal with JDS Uniphase because your stock is still trading at a significant discount to where it would trade if, indeed, this deal was closed. And there is some concern that you might run into some antitrust opposition to the combination.  What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>SCIFRES: Well, we believe we have a very complementary product line to JDS Uniphase, and the combination is a very much positive for our customer base.  We believe that we can manufacture more products, which are in short supply right now, as well as creating the next generation of product to add more and more bandwidth to the fiber- optic network.</p><p>TUCKER: Do you think you can sell the regulators on that?  Wall Street would seem very hesitant, as Terry noted, we are still at a discount to the takeover?</p><p>SCIFRES: Yes, we believe that we will be able to reach a closure on the merger.  We think that that will probably be by the end of the year.  So we believe that we have very complementary product lines and it will be good for our customer base.</p><p>KEENAN: You have an incredible triple-digit percentage gain in revenues year-over-year in the latest quarter.  Are you going to be able to maintain that sort of pace?</p><p>SCIFRES: Well, we think we are early in the game here in terms of supplying the bandwidth demand.  We had a record level of orders. Our book-to-bills were one of the highest I've seen in a long time here.  And we think that we are projecting for the third quarter a revenue increase, a sequential increase of greater than 25 percent.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thanks for joining us, congratulations on those results.</p><p>SCIFRES: Thank you.</p><p>KEENAN: Don Scifres, CEO of SDL.</p><p>TUCKER: All right, ahead on IN THE MONEY: severe storms pound parts of the South.  Bill Hemmer will have more on that a bit later.</p><p>KEENAN: And inside this grammar school, students are learning the lessons of microeconomics.  Meet some kids who are having a blast, running a business.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TUCKER: All right.  You are looking at a shot of the Big Board. We have the Dow down 110 points, trading at its lows of the session. Nasdaq a little better, it has bounced back up off its lows, but still down 71 1/2 points nonetheless.</p><p>Welcome back to IN THE MONEY.  I'm Bill Tucker.</p><p>KEENAN: And hello from me as well.  I'm Terry Keenan.</p><p>Now for a look at some of the stories that is making business headlines this morning: A very different story for another telecom company, VoiceStream Wirless.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TUCKER: All right, you're looking at a shot of the Big Board. We have the Dow down 110 points, trading at its lows of the session. Nasdaq, looking a little better.  It's bounced back up off its lows, but still down 71 1/2 points nonetheless.</p><p>Welcome back to IN THE MONEY, I'm Bill Tucker.</p><p>KEENAN: And hello from me as well, I'm Terry Keenan.</p><p>And now for a look at some of the stories that's making business headlines this morning.  A very different story for another telecom company, VoiceStream Wireless.  Shares of the Washington state-based company, currently trading down 4 5/8 at 148 3/8.  Deutsche Telekom, down a dollar and a half.  The boards of VoiceStream and Deutsche Telekom will reportedly meet this weekend to consider a possible merger.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says that the 50-plus-billion- dollar deal may involve giving VoiceStream cash up front so it can bid for telecom licenses.  The companies have no comment. TUCKER: Well, should -- a pair of high-tech giants today reported better than expected earnings late yesterday.  America Online coming out and beating estimates by two cents.  Sun Microsystems beating estimates by six cents.  Before the bell today, Dow component Eastman Kodak reported a profit that equaled the predictions, while former Dow component Sears, Roebuck beat an upwardly-revised estimate of six cents.  Let's take a quick check on how those shares are trading on the market today.</p><p>Sun trading nicely higher, it's among the most actives on the Nasdaq, up five.  America Online, despite some positive comments from analysts, notably over at Merrill Lynch, the stock is trading down, as is Eastman Kodak and Sears.</p><p>Well, if you have a great idea for an Internet company but happen to live outside Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley or a couple of other dot.com centers, Village Ventures could help.</p><p>KEENAN: They offer money to startups in areas that are usually off the map for a lot of investors.</p><p>Joining us now are two former college roommates-turned-venture capitalists, Bo Peabody and Matt Harris.</p><p>And gentlemen, welcome, good to have you with us.</p><p>BO PEABODY, CHAIRMAN, VILLAGE VENTURES: Thanks.</p><p>MATT HARRIS, CEO, VILLAGE VENTURES: Thanks.</p><p>KEENAN: Bo, let me start with you.  What was the idea behind your venture capital company?</p><p>PEABODY: Well, idea behind Village Ventures is that last year 77 percent of venture capital was invested in areas where only 17 percent of the population lives.  There's a huge disconnect between where intellectual capital is and where venture capital is focused.  And we want to take advantage of that opportunity.</p><p>TUCKER: But typically I would think that venture capital is going into areas that are dense.  What you are doing with the venture capital at Village Ventures is you're moving it out to less densely populated areas.</p><p>HARRIS: Well, many of them are less dense.  But, for instance, we'll be opening a fund in Nashville, Tennessee, which is certainly a metropolitan area.  It just hasn't been historically a venture center.</p><p>KEENAN: Are certain things that you look for in the community before you decide to invest in the individual company?</p><p>HARRIS: Yes, we look for four things.  We look for the absence of competitors, the absence of existing venture capital.  We look for lots of intellectual capital, smart people.</p><p>KEENAN: University town. HARRIS: And a high quality -- Universities are great, high quality of life and a low cost of living and doing business.</p><p>TUCKER: Do you like to be actively involved venture capitalists or are you hands-off kinds of guys?</p><p>PEABODY: In fact, what differentiates our model is that we are very active.  When you are doing seed stage, early stage investing, you have to be active.  The entrepreneurs need a lot of help and we have a whole services arm that provides that help to them.</p><p>KEENAN: What kind of returns are you looking for in your funds?</p><p>PEABODY: High.</p><p>HARRIS: Positive.</p><p>TUCKER: You what thousands want.</p><p>HARRIS: Yes, well, we -- I've been doing venture capital for five years, the last three of which was my own fund in western Massachusetts.  And the returns have been about, to date, two times the national average.  So we're looking for above average returns.  We think we've set up a structure to deliver those.</p><p>TUCKER: Boy, it's interesting combination, in fact, and we should mention the pedigrees here.</p><p>You've been doing venture capital for a while.  Bo was involved in co-founding Tripod, a successful company which was sold, I think, to Terra, right?</p><p>PEABODY: Sold to Lycos.</p><p>TUCKER: Lycos sold recently to Terra.</p><p>PEABODY: They recently sold to Terra, that's right.</p><p>TUCKER: So congratulations on both fronts for those.</p><p>PEABODY: Thanks very much.</p><p>TUCKER: In addition to which, Terry, he likes Albany.</p><p>KEENAN: Yes,</p><p>HARRIS: We live in New York.</p><p>KEENAN: Near where you have a big office.</p><p>PEABODY: That's right, that's right, that's right.</p><p>KEENAN: I'm just wondering, would you only invest in high-tech companies or are you looking at other ventures as well?</p><p>PEABODY: We're really trying to stay focused on technology companies.  And that really is where we see a lot of value.  But technology encompasses the Internet, software, biotech, things that are driven by technology is our focus.</p><p>TUCKER: So it's a diverse collection of technology?</p><p>HARRIS: It is, we pay attention to where we are.  For instance, in Ithaca, New York, they have tremendous life sciences intellectual capital.  And so our fund there will have a real competency in life sciences.  In Albany, there's more information technology and so when we are there we are focused on IT.</p><p>TUCKER: All right.</p><p>KEENAN: Interesting, thanks, gentlemen.</p><p>HARRIS: Thank you.</p><p>PEABODY: Thanks.</p><p>KEENAN: And coming up next on IN THE MONEY: Apparently George W. Bush is only days away from naming his choice for a running mate. Bill Hemmer will have the latest on the veep-stakes.</p><p>TUCKER: And do you despise financial planning, or do you detest financial planning? how about loath financial planning?  Well, there's a Web site for you.  Coming up, we'll talk to its founder.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: Time now to check some other stories making news this morning.</p><p>TUCKER: And let's go down to Bill Hemmer for the latest on those headlines.  Hello, again, Bill.</p><p>HEMMER: Hey, Bill and Terry.  Happy Friday once again.</p><p>As George W. Bush and Al Gore get closer to picking their running mates, Gore is also trying to build his support among labor unions.</p><p>Moments ago, in Washington, the vice president addressed Teamsters, machinist and bus drivers, in a speech before the AFL-CIO.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VICE PRES. AL GORE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Defending unions and protecting the right to organization is good for the economy of the United States of America.  It works to lift up those who most need to be lifted up.  I want you to know I am pro-union and pro-working family, always have been, and I always will be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEMMER: Democrats trying to rally political report that has slowly seeped away.  The Teamsters and the UAW have withheld endorsement of Gore to display their anger at what they see as unfriendly trade policies around the world.</p><p>Texas Governor George W. Bush says he has not chosen a running mate, but will do so before the Republican National Convention, in Philadelphia, that begins in 10 days time in Philly.</p><p>In an interview yesterday on CNN's \"LARRY KING LIVE,\" Bush described the selection process and said he is looking for a vice president who is cooperative.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \"LARRY KING LIVE\")</p><p>GOV. GEORGE W. BUSH (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But I think it's so important for people to know that the main criterion is can the person be the president? and can we get along? and can the person be added value?  In other words, can we work together?  I will tell you there's been some great examples of people being able to work together in recent history.  I think President Clinton and Vice President Gore have had a good relationship.  I know my dad and President Reagan did, and Vice President Quayle and my dad did.  It all started really with Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale redefining the relationship.</p><p>LARRY KING, HOST: He boosted that office.</p><p>BUSH: He did.  I will have that same spirit of not only cooperation, but counting on the vice president to bring some -- an interesting dimension to an administration.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEMMER: Names mentioned as potential running mates include the Oklahoma governor, Frank Keating, Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel, and Dick Cheney, the man heading Bush's search for a VP.</p><p>Republican Senator John McCain, of Arizona, says he would be willing to serve, if asked to do so.  However, McCain says, he would prefer not to be asked.  Republican sources say McCain picked up a call on Tuesday from Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, who inquired about McCain's willingness to run.  McCain said he doubts Bush is considering him at this time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: I told Governor Bush when we discussed this issue that there are far more qualified candidates that can serve the country better than I.  In our discussions in Pittsburgh, I asked not to be considered.  And so I believe that I am not in the process.  I have not been vetted, nor asked for my tax returns or anything like that.  So I don't believe that I'm in the mix.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEMMER: Some may wonder.  The relationship between the two men, based on their primary run together.  McCain says there is no animosity there.  He says he and the Texas governor have established a friendly relationship.</p><p>You can keep up with all of our political coverage any time, any day checking out our Web site.

That will giving you the very latest news and a sneak preview of the Republican and Democratic conventions.</p><p>Thunderstorms in the South have brought some relief from the heat wave, but at a price.  Damage reported heavy in parts of Alabama and Georgia, less so in the state of Tennessee.  As for the rain, officials say much more is needed though to overcome the extreme drought in the South, and that continues here.  So too do the hot temperatures.  We'll see this weekend if we get more relief from that.</p><p>Now back to New York.  It is a bit cooler up there.  Here is Bill and Terry once again.</p><p>TUCKER: It is.  Unseasonably cool as a matter of fact.</p><p>HEMMER: Have a good weekend.</p><p>TUCKER: Thank you, Bill, you do too.  And you might want to listen to this because if you are like most Americans, you don't have a financial plan, you don't understand the numbers, and you really hate thinking about money, and I definitely am in that category.  So much so that most of us would rather do anything but financial planning.</p><p>Well, these are the not-so-surprising results of a survey conducted by a new Web site that is trying to change some of that attitude.  The name of the Web site, Ihatefinancialplanning.com -- nicely enough -- offers some simplified advice, along with a little humor, including a financial planning soap opera.</p><p>Joining us now is Jan Holeman, of Ihatefinancialplanning.com.  I can't even say that financial thing there.</p><p>And welcome, Jan.</p><p>JAN HOLEMAN, IHATEFINANCIALPLANNING.COM: Thanks for having me.</p><p>TUCKER: One of the things that really did surprise me is that you did a survey, 77 percent of the people hate it.  That wasn't what surprised me, 23 percent apparently do like doing it.</p><p>HOLEMAN: So do you think they are lying?</p><p>TUCKER: Yes.</p><p>HOLEMAN: Really.  Well, you use those words \"despise,\" \"detest\" and \"loathe.\"</p><p>TUCKER: Right.</p><p>HOLEMAN: Those are pretty strong words, aren't they?  That's how we feel about it.  And you know why we feel that way is because we don't have confidence about our finances, we don't know what we are doing relative to the dollars and cents of it, and we feel that we may not have enough money to do financial planning.  So we avoid it.</p><p>KEENAN: So how does the Web site help? give you the confidence to go ahead and start planning?</p><p>HOLEMAN: Well, first of all, when you get into the Web site, what you are going to see is, this is different, the name itself is different, it's the truth that all of us believe.  So you get into the Web site and you will see something there called a panic button.  When you push on that button you are going to hear somebody scream.  And so you have that as a support for you during your entire stay, but you are not going to need it much.</p><p>This is worded in such a way that it makes financial planning subject accessible to all of us, it's wonderful.</p><p>TUCKER: What are the kinds of things that you do when you go there?  Is this one of those deals where I got to fill out endless forms to figure out what is going on and that kind of stuff, Jan?</p><p>HOLEMAN: Well, only if you want to.  That is a part of financial planning is getting everything in order, and sometimes getting it organized and in order is one of the best things we can do.  So getting it in order is an opportunity.  We, for example, have a financial plan for $49 called \"The Works.\" And I don't know if you've checked into financial plans, Bill, but $49 is very reasonable.</p><p>TUCKER: Very reasonable.</p><p>KEENAN: It is.  And you also have some tips and guidelines to help people get control of their finances.</p><p>HOLEMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>KEENAN: Which include tracking your daily spending.  It is sometimes better not to know how much you spend, I think.</p><p>HOLEMAN: Well, if you don't know, then you will never be able to see where you have money that you could allocate elsewhere.</p><p>TUCKER: But this is why we hate financial planning.</p><p>HOLEMAN: We do hate it.  But think about it, If we don't do financial planning, we won't have the life we want.  Financial planning is the thing, the tool that gives us the future that we envision.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, great Web site, great name.</p><p>HOLEMAN: Thanks.</p><p>KEENAN: Thanks a lot, Jan, Jan Holeman.</p><p>TUCKER: All right, coming up on IN THE MONEY: From grade school to the school of hard knocks, coming up, we'll show you some kids learning the fundamentals of making money.</p><p>KEENAN: And Andy Serwer will be back.</p><p>Andy, what are you working on this half-hour.</p><p>SERWER: A couple of stocks, Terry, we are looking at here. Xilinx is on the move.  Sun Micro an incredible story.  And Macromedia getting killed.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: OK, shares of Macromedia you were just checking, those really hit hard this morning.</p><p>And our Andy Serwer has been tracking that saga for us and he joins us now with the latest.</p><p>SERWER: Yes, yes, Terry, it's just coming in right now: It is down about $30 to 78.  Macromedia is -- does Photoshop and other multimedia software, has -- it's been around for a long time.  And just, you know, again, another story about a company not hitting its numbers.</p><p>We wanted to talk about Sun a little bit here.  Sun was up, I think, about six bucks to 104.  Is that a 52-week high?  I think that would have been close.</p><p>KEENAN: Close -- $2 higher.</p><p>TUCKER: Yes, 106 I think is the all-time high.</p><p>SERWER: Right, all-time.  Right, an all-time high.  And, you know, I want to sort of put that in context.  We talked about those numbers just being unbelievable.  And for a company of that size, that's what you really have to focus in on.  Sun and EMC are the two big, clear, big-stock, tech winners -- that's a lot of adjectives -- for this earnings season.</p><p>You might want to throw IBM in there, but I will not because -- and the reason is because that IBM is a complicated story without the same kind of growth.  EMC and Sun's growth, Terry, is stunning.</p><p>KEENAN: Yes, exactly.  I mean, IBM's revenues are flat.</p><p>SERWER: Flat.</p><p>KEENAN: Flat to down on the first half.  That stock, by the way, is down $3 today -- IBM.</p><p>SERWER: IBM, yes.</p><p>TUCKER: Yes, well, Steve Milanovic over at Merrill Lynch -- I was reading some notes of his before the show.  He called Sun the next IBM.</p><p>SERWER: Yes, I mean -- and, listen, that stock has been an incredible performer for the past 24 months.  I mean, it's -- apparently there's still room to go -- one of these very expensive stocks and, you know, I'm sort of thinking that, you know, is this going to be a stock going forward that you keep wishing you had bought?  Same thing with EMC: always expensive.  I know you feel that way, Terry -- always expensive: I should have bought it, could have bought it.</p><p>KEENAN: Sore spot.</p><p>SERWER: Another one kind of getting killed today, though, is Xilinx, the chip maker.  The chip maker's not having a great day.  I think the book/bill ratio for the chip equipment makers was off, and of course that's all part of the same change.  But Xilinx doing some numbers today.  They're down about 12 bucks to 74.  So A-MAD (ph), I noticed, was off a little bit too.</p><p>KEENAN: Yes, down three.</p><p>SERWER: So, you know, but these guys are enjoying it, really.</p><p>You know, I think the book/bill ratio was down marginally from June to May, and, I mean, that could just be a blip.  So that's a really good business right now.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thanks, Andy.  Have a good weekend.</p><p>SERWER: OK, see you later.  You too.</p><p>KEENAN: Andy Serwer.</p><p>TUCKER: And finally, most kids are enjoying their summer vacation, but students at year-round elementary school in Nevada are still in class and allegedly having fun.</p><p>KEENAN: Well, they are studying more than the three Rs.  They're learning about how to make money and run their own businesses.</p><p>Gayla Hope reports from Las Vegas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GAYLA HOPE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Students at Garehime Heights are serenading a group of educators from Houston, Texas.  The 2-year-old school quickly has become a national model in teaching life skills.</p><p>FRANCIE SUMMER, PRINCIPAL, GAREHIME HEIGHTS: We wanted to make sure that our students understood and were knowledgeable of basic skills -- basic skills that they're going to need for the 21st century, which are different from basic skills of the 1950s.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK, mail call.</p><p>HOPE: Students' guiding principle is to be a concerned citizen. Each child becomes part of Garehime's microsociety, complete with student-run agencies and businesses.</p><p>JO CARCEDO, SR. V.P., NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERS, INC.: I think they're really understanding about how -- what kinds of activities produce wealth, what types of activities support an economy?  Money is a mechanism by which business is transacted.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: \u2026 equals 256.</p><p>HOPE: The Environmental Protection Agency collects cans and students are paid for turning them in.  The payoff isn't just financial.</p><p>(on camera): Why are you doing all of this?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To help the Earth.  To make the Earth a better place.</p><p>HOPE (voice-over): The school bank prints Garehime gold, school currency worth 10 cents a bill.</p><p>SUMMER: It's really the backbone of our whole program because we have an economy system here.  And the students earn Garehime gold for the jobs that they do in their classrooms, and also for businesses that they set up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everyone has a job, whether it be a data entry clerk, a loan officer, a greeter, a teller, a manager or a president.</p><p>HOPE: Each Garehime student has a savings account.  Children that work at the bank learn about payroll, granting loans and customer service.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The most difficult part of the job is handling the people because they want to take out too much Garehime gold and we -- and they're only allowed to take out 200 Garehime gold at a time.</p><p>HOPE: And for those who cause too much trouble, they may end up in court.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I advise them in some things whether to plead guilty or not guilty.</p><p>HOPE: The kindergarteners run a farm.  There's the TV station, Garehime 1, and the \"Garehime Gazette\" newspaper.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At the end when you have all this paper, it's cool to look at it.</p><p>HOPE (on camera): Why?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because you, like, have all these papers and you, like, feel good about doing it.</p><p>HOPE: The school is transformed into a shopping mall full of students and classroom-run business about four or five times a year. It's called \"Going to Town Day.\"</p><p>(voice-over): Students compare the excitement of these shopping days to Christmas.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They sold out in five minutes.</p><p>HOPE (on camera): Were you surprised?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.  They all came in and rushing in to get all the bags and they were holding out money.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hello, my name's Beal (ph).  This is my business, Vito-Rama (ph).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'll buy that one.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, 20 Garehime gold.</p><p>HOPE (voice-over): Who would have thought that learning business skills at such a young age could be so much fun.</p><p>Gayla Hope, CNN Financial News, Las Vegas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TUCKER: They did look happy.</p><p>KEENAN: They certainly did.</p><p>And that's going to do it for IN THE MONEY.  I'm Terry Keenan.</p><p>TUCKER: And I'm Bill Tucker.  Remember, I hate financial planning.

Besides the very consistent antitrust, mergers and acquisitions, state aid and regulatory portfolio, the NCA has been contributing to political and legislative developments taking place at the EU level, under the six-months rotating chairmanship. In terms of legislation, the Authority has been involved in promoting more transparency and fairness for the online platforms environment, while the policy debates related to the role of competition rules for both digital markets and industrial policy.    </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Besides the EU-wide policy implications of its work, the Authority has been effective in enforcing its traditional mandate of protecting domestic consumers; the past months count for some of the highest fines delivered by the NCA in its history ie totaling \u20ac53 million for nine insurance companies and the representative trade association. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I. The Presidency of the Council of the EU </p><p>1. The Legislative Dimension \u2013 A Digital Affair </p><p>The start of the six months period came with a joint task for the NCA, namely to consolidate a team of governmental bodies (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Economy) in negotiating within and for the Council of the EU (the Council), what at that time was the European Commission Proposal for a Regulation promoting fairness and transparency for business users of online intermediation services.<sup>1</sup> The negotiations took place between early January and mid-February, ending with an agreement between the two co-legislators.<sup>2</sup> This whole process amounted to approximatively 25 meetings in different formats:  working groups and COREPER meetings, technical or political trilogues. Also, during these months, stakeholders from all areas of interest have been in contact with the Authority leadership, with a view to an informed and fit-for-purpose policymaking. </p><p>In more substantive terms, the NCA (through the Permanent Representation of Romania to the EU) has been involved in handling and reaching a compromise in relation to specific or complementary competition policy issues. The range of covered topics includes: the way platforms use their ranking system, the employment of self-preferencing by vertically integrated companies, data access rules, business strategies involving parity clauses and sector-specific unfair trading practices. Given the fact that the Regulation is of horizontal impact and gathers in its scope of application almost all online intermediation services and search engines, the main regulatory outcome relates to transparency.  </p><p>The high standard of transparency prescribed by the two legislators comes in line with the European Commission\u2019s (the Commission) initial proposal<sup>3</sup>  and with the mandates given by the majority of the Member States during the working party/COREPER negotiations<sup>4</sup>, for which the Council Presidency acted as an honest broker. To this extent, it was for the members of the European Parliament to try and stretch the boundaries of the Regulation by proposing substantive obligations or bans in relation to specific practices eg disclosure of all ranking parameters, a ban on wide parity clauses, a so-called \u2018black-list\u2019 of unfair trading practices (UTPs), consent for the usage of business data or restrictions for any platform which would consider employing self-preferencing as a commercial strategy.<sup>5</sup></p><p>Even though most of these practices could amount to harmful market behaviour, the fact that the Commission\u2019s proposal has been designed as horizontal, no-threshold model, allowed it to accommodate, to a large extent, only  transparency requirements; in terms of mechanism design, competition law remains the main instrument to address situations in which such practices, when employed by dominant undertakings, become (or not) anticompetitive. </p><p>As a consequence, even though the transparency criteria might seem as the \u2018lowest hanging fruit\u2019 to be picked by the co-legislators in a very short and pressuring negotiations context (the end of term for the European Parliament), this comes to complement the current antitrust instruments by better opening up business models and practices.  </p><p>Having an absolute approach, ie without considering market power and other relevant criteria, could amount to a situation in which SMEs might be deprived by perfectly legitimate business conduct options and, on the other hand, welcome in some aspects a per se<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>type of analysis, without using a balance of the pro and anticompetitive effects of a business conduct against each other (ie substantive regulation may not take into consideration criteria like the ones in Article 101(3) TFEU / CJEU-allowed efficiencies in Article 102 TFEU). </p><p>Leaving aside the doctrinal debates incumbent upon the past negotiations, there are some main takeaways which will help NCAs become better enforcers when addressing \u2018102\u2019 cases. For example, in the circumstances of favouring their own products, vertically integrated online intermediary service providers must indicate, according to the new law, the main commercial, economic and legal grounds for this practice; moreover, compliance with the same criteria is binding when using broad or narrow parity clauses. Opening the data debate in relation to intra-group or third-party data transfer, the online intermediary service providers will, in specific cases, disclose these operations and will detail both the destination of the data and the possibility for some users to activate an opt-out clause. Touching upon the UTPs debate, commercial practices such as the imposition of retroactive clauses at the expense of users shall be banned in platform-to-business contractual relationships (this being the only substantive ban when it comes to specific trading practices). At the same time, both online intermediary service providers and search engines will reveal the main search parameters and in some cases the reasons for their use. </p><p>Furthermore, these regulatory prescriptions will aid policy makers\u2019 and enforcers\u2019 understanding of the business models and incentives driving the platform economy. </p><p>A year and a half after the date of applicability, it will be for the next Commission to assess whether the Regulation is still fit for purpose. Even though for the moment this particular piece of legislation comes as complementary to competition law, the review clause might open up the debate about a more substantive regulatory regime. If this is the case, these new proposals should follow a thorough and complete impact analysis, without excluding the competition law framework and the enforcement efforts carried within the European Competition Network (ECN) community.    </p><p>2. Policy Debates \u2013 On Tech Giants and EU Industrial Champions</p><p>Besides the above-mentioned Regulation, which has been negotiated in the Competitiveness and Growth Council (Internal Market) format, the Authority had been guiding the work of the Competition Working Party.</p><p>Even though there was no legislative file on the table, as the Council Regulation (EU) 2018/1911 on the application of Articles 107 and 108 of the TFEU to certain categories of horizontal State aid (the Enabling Regulation) was agreed during the Austrian Presidency of the Council, there were different policy matters to be addressed. </p><p>The political positions surrounding the need for a new industrial policy and the debate fostered by the Commission in regard to competition in the digital era, created the premises for the two working group meetings, chaired by the Romanian Presidency.</p><p>With a view to the first matter, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Friends of industry declaration</emphasis><sup>6</sup> and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Franco-German Manifesto</emphasis><sup>7</sup> opened up a new forum of competition debate, besides the ECN given the fact that policy instruments such as the merger review or State aid control were found to be discussed in different political forums (within or outside the Council). DG COMP presented its place in the industrial policy \u2018constellation\u2019 debate by relating to the tools it uses in fostering competitiveness within the internal market. As it can be inferred from the Member States\u2019 position which followed - codified in the Council conclusions on an EU Industrial Policy Strategy<sup>8</sup> - there is currently no appetite to mandate the next Commission with a view of making major changes in merger control (ie only 7 acquisitions out of 3,000 mergers have been prohibited in last 10 years)<sup>9</sup> and to the State aid regime. The Member States have pleaded for a rather holistic regime where competition policy should be complemented by targeted tools addressing market distortions in/by foreign economies, an advanced EU internal market integration or more initiatives like the Important Projects of Common European Interest. On the other hand, distinct intergovernmental positions might keep the debate open and bring it to different levels of the EU decision-making process.</p><p>One such very recent position<sup>10</sup> aligns Poland with France and Germany, and aims at a targeted measure for recalibrating EU competition rules. A new approach towards the merger control is being envisaged, eg reviewed focus on efficiencies, higher scrutiny on foreign State-owned undertakings or strengthened political input in merger cases. The document also promotes joint ventures that would foster the development of EU global capacities. In the same line of action, with regard to big tech, matters such as predatory acquisitions, systemic actors and data sharing are at the forefront of the enforcement and regulatory endeavor.<sup>11</sup></p><p>Another very important topic debated during the Working Party on Competition related to the digital age and the implications it brings for the antitrust community. The most important developments which have been discussed related to the outcomes from DG COMP\u2019s continuous interest in digital-related policy matters, especially the special advisers\u2019 report 'Competition policy for the digital era\u2019.<sup>12</sup>  Also, the Commission has been contributing with centralised data regarding the state of play<sup>13</sup> in areas where it applies competition law.</p><p>II. Law Enforcement \u2013 We All Need Insurances</p><p>Following an investigation formally initiated in 2015, the Romanian Competition Council has revealed an anticompetitive exchange of information carried by several undertakings active in the car insurances market (ie compulsory motor third party liability insurances), and which had the direction of rising the prices for their services, at the expense of lower consumer costs. The association has been also held liable for infringing the law as a result of facilitating the coordination of the members\u2019 unlawful conduct. The anticompetitive practice at stake led to a reduction in competition on the relevant market from October 2012 to November 2016 (more the four years), as insurance companies ceased to follow independent business strategies and involved themselves in a collusive setup, under the umbrella of the industry association. </p><p>The fine (ie approximatively \u20ac53 million) amounted to the second largest in the history of the NCA, after the one imposed on six oil companies in 2011, which totalled a bit over \u20ac200 million. </p><p>From the very first days of the investigation (the dawn raids), the suspicions related to an extended form of information sharing, eg sales, prices, products and customer types. This alleged exchange took place between the undertakings, without having set safeguards (eg clean-team strategy) to avoid the sharing of sensitive information.  </p><p>During the antitrust procedures, one of the nine undertakings involved opted to cooperate with the Authority through the leniency procedure. Thus, besides admitting its participation in the illegal exchange of information, the undertaking provided the case-handlers with relevant evidence for proving the facts of the infringement. </p><p>Complementing its line of enforcement, the Romanian NCA together with the national Financial Supervisory Authority, involved in analysing other structural factors which lead to market imbalances, made a number of recommendations most of which were introduced into primary and secondary legislation.<sup>14</sup> The NCA has had a preliminary structural approach towards the market in 2016 when it delivered the results of a market inquiry and proposed specific solutions for the different issues. This has been a decisive incentive for the legislative changes that were made in Romania in 2016 and 2017. For example, one of the main findings of the market inquiry was that dissimilar conditions apply to equivalent transactions depending on who pays the repair costs - the owner or the insurance companies (higher in the second scenario). Moreover, in order to decrease the prices, the NCA argues that it is necessary to proportionally increase the number vehicles in circulation that have a valid insurance. For the moment, many cars do not have a valid insurance because owners have only concluded short-term contracts without renewing them. The Authority showed regulatory preference for a system in which individuals should not be allowed to conclude one-month insurance contracts, but instead have  minimum period set at six months.<sup>15</sup></p><p>One major issue<sup>16</sup> that was not tackled is the misalignment of incentives resulting from the unrestrained choice of the car owners to perform the repairs, which are then covered through payment by the insurer. This misalignment of interests ie ease in dealing with the price parameter by consumers v. insurance companies\u2019 need to lower costs, frustrates any efficiency gaining efforts on behalf of the undertaking due to the inflated prices which occur. </p><p>III. Concluding Remarks </p><p>The past months have been a great opportunity for the NCA to broaden the scope of its activity, and, correspondently, its expertise. The Authority has been engaged in discussions relating to big picture political matters, such as the future of digital markets and industrial policy. This path-dependent narrative process is to be continued during the next Council Presidencies and by the new European Commission. </p><p>Now calibrating back to subsidiarity, the NCA will continue its efforts to better understand digital markets; this exercise has already been carried out during the tech mergers the NCA previously analysed<sup>17</sup> and through the attendance in the relevant ECN working parties. Furthermore, the recent inquiry into the sharing economy sector<sup>18</sup> is meant to better grasp the market specificities and the different regulatory burdens that confront undertakings. The Authority is also formally investigating eMAG, the regional e-commerce market player, for a possible breach of its special responsibility duties.  </p><p>Summing up, it can be said that in terms of digital issues, the trend started with the ECN Plus Directive<sup>19</sup> (ie enabling NCAs to be better enforcers)  ended in the right place. The transparency obligations imposed by the Platform-to-Business Regulation will give NCAs better standing in documenting and proving antitrust infringements specific to the digital age. At the same time, it seems that the industrial policy debate at the Council level has more of an inclusive than coercive approach when addressing the competition chapter. However, this does not prevent like-minded groups of Member States from fostering the debate further. Finally, on the national enforcement side, the Romanian NCA is aiming at investigating novel types of infringements.

Showed a group of folks techniques during a track and field clinic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Suzanne Malveaux. This hour in the CNN NEWSROOM, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>lays out his world vision in a major foreign policy speech. And a daredevil dares to jump from the edge of space to earth. I want to get right to it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>gaining some ground here, the Republican presidential candidate. He has now narrowed the gap after his decisive win in last week's debate with the President. Here's the new poll, here a new Gallop poll. Registered voters choice for president now evenly split in a poll taken after Wednesday night's debate. Three days before the debate, <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>had a five percent point edge among registered voters. Hoping to build on the momentum, Romney, this morning, attacked the president's leadership when it comes to foreign policy.</p><p>Romney delivered his first major foreign policy speech at Virginia Military Institute in Lexington. It is the country's oldest military academy. He came out swinging. He condemned the president for what he says is leading from behind, declaring it is time to change course in the Middle East. I want to bring in our Foreign Affairs Correspondent Jill Dougherty at the State Department. So, first of all, the first criticism was that he said the president didn't have this overall strategy that would be successful in the Middle East. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>MITT ROMNEY </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know the president hopes for a safer, freer, and more prosperous Middle East allied with us. I share this hope, but hope is not a strategy. We can't support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALVEAUX: Jill, I want to ask you this because is this about a failed strategy on the part of the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>or are these factors that are basically playing out in the Middle East out of the White House's control?</p><p>JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: You know, I would say a lot of those are factors that really are out of the White House control. Now, you can say certainly on the Middle East, let's say the peace process, the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>really has not done very much. Pretty much kind of stuck where it was and with no progress. So, you could argue there. But on a lot of these Arab Spring countries, there are a lot of internal dynamics that are going on that the U.S. can, you know, kind of stand by and look, especially on Syria right now. But the question really would be what concretely --</p><p>MALVEAUX: Yes.</p><p>DOUGHERTY: -- would <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>do that would be very different from what the president would do, and I think that, you know, right now, I don't see any glaring differences. In fact, you know, even on that point of Benghazi, and the attack on the U.S. ambassador that killed the U.S. Ambassador and three other Americans, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>originally, it appears from the statements we saw, was going to link directly the group that carried that out to Al Qaeda, but then that was softened to Al Qaeda linked groups. So, even there, you know, you just have to kind of, you know, dig down and try to get very specific, and I still don't think there are a lot of specifics at this point -- Suzanne.</p><p>MALVEAUX: And, Jill, one of the things -- you bring up that point there is that the Romney campaign has tried to capitalize off of the questions around Benghazi, around that attack. Romney, earlier today, making the case that he believed it was deception on the part of the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>to initially say that this was a random response to a film that insulted the prophet, Mohammed, instead of a terrorist group. I want you to listen to his case he made.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMNEY: These attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others, especially women and girls, who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today and who seek to wage perpetual war on the west.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALVEAUX: Jill, which side actually plays out as the one that gives a convincing argument? Because we know the Romney team also -- they essentially got it wrong in the beginning as well when they were talking about the response from the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>apologizing for this video when, in fact, that was not the case.</p><p>DOUGHERTY: Right. I think that the Romney administration is answering what the -- I should say the Romney presidential bid, or their -- his team, is answering what the administration was saying early on right after it happened, but they have since moved on from there. They are no longer saying that it was, you know, some type of reaction directly linked to the video, the angry -- the anger over the video. So, as more facts have come out, you've now have three investigations, and I think that's where the difficulty is. MALVEAUX: Yes.</p><p>DOUGHERTY: As these three investigations are carried out, more and more information comes out. More and more but nothing definitive, and we really won't know, I think, until those reports, the FBI, the State Department, and Congressional investigations are complete, and the entire picture is clear. That's why you've got this kind of back and forth.</p><p>MALVEAUX: And, Jill, do we think any of that information is going to come out before the election or essentially people will take a look at the final debate between these two and make up their minds about foreign policy based on that?</p><p>DOUGHERTY: You know, when you look -- I think if you get out of Washington and you look at people, you know, in the country side, I am not quite sure that all of these fine details are going to make that much difference. I think the overarching thing that could is this charge by <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>that the administration has been weak, it didn't, you know, define what should be going on in the world. If you accept that, then perhaps that argument does hold weight, but that, I think, is the -- is the overarching. If you take the whole speech and look at it, it's really, has Obama been weak, standing back and not really leading? And that's what <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>is saying.</p><p>MALVEAUX: All right. Jill Dougherty, good to see you. Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>of course, he is reaching out to celebrity backers in Hollywood. He is hosting a series of star-studded concerts, big dollar diner -- dinners, rather. The goal is to raise $9.5 million in the next two days. Dan Lothian is with the president in Keen, California. And, Dan, first of all, we'll talk about some of the big name stars, I know there's, like, quite a few of them there. But I'm curious if the Obama campaign or the president has any response so far to this big policy speech that was laid out by Romney earlier this morning?</p><p>DAN LOTHIAN, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, the president himself has not weighed in on yet -- on it yet, but his campaign spokesman, Ben LaBolt, also former secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, did hold a conference call a short time ago where they really attacked <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>saying that he is not fit to be commander in chief. They said that his policies are what he would put in place are really unclear. That he's been shifting a lot of his positions, and, again, saying that he doesn't -- he's not really on the same level as the president. It was really sort of a fierce attack from the very beginning, going detail by detail, whether it comes to the U.S. relationship with Israel, whether it comes to what Romney pointed out on Libya, or even on South America. They said that it's simply lacking and, again, that he is not fit to be commander in chief. So, that coming from the Obama campaign but nothing yet from the president himself.</p><p>MALVEAUX: And we've also -- we've also heard, Dan, the <person><nameText>vice president, Joe Biden, </nameText></person>say, you know, Bin Laden is dead, GM is alive. Do they think that that line is something that really resonates with voters?</p><p>LOTHIAN: They do. And, you know, it's interesting that you point that out because even last night as the president was at that big fundraising event, you were talking about a concert with some 6,000 people in Los Angeles. He ticked off what he said were his accomplishments during thinks first term, and normally he will start with, you know, health care or don't ask don't tell or some other of the issues that he says are his accomplishments, but he started off with foreign policy. Ticking off, he said how he promised how he would end the war in Iraq, and he did that. How he would wind down the conflict in Afghanistan, how that is underway right now. And then, he said how he went after Osama Bin Laden and got him. So, they do believe that this is something, when it comes to foreign policy, that resonates with voters out there. So, you hear that not only from the vice president but the president himself.</p><p>MALVEAUX: And, Dan, finally, give us the fun stuff. Who is there? Who are the big stars here?</p><p>LOTHIAN: Well, this event -- you know, yesterday what you saw was, you know, Earth, Wind, and Fire for the old school. Also, George Clooney was there. Katy Perry for the new school, as the president pointed out. John legend will be at one of the big fundraisers. Another big concert, 6,000 expected in northern California. Where we're at right now is the Cesar Chavez Memorial. The President will be unveiling it as a national monument. This is slated as an official event, but in the context of an election year, this is important at least for the Obama campaign as the president is trying to reach out to Hispanic voters which will be critical to his re-election bid.</p><p>MALVEAUX: All right. Dan Lothian, good to see you, as always. Thanks, Dan.</p><p>While the presidential contenders are busy raising money, of course, talking foreign policy as well, <person><nameText>Joe Biden, </nameText></person><person><nameText>Paul Ryan, </nameText></person>they are practicing for their big moment. The vice presidential debate, that is on Thursday. The hot topic, of course, on the Sunday talk shows. Let's watch.</p><p>( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REINCE PREIBUS, CHAIRMAN, RNC: People enjoy these debates. I would expect a lot of people to be watching. I think Paul is going to do a great job, but I also think that <person><nameText>Joe Biden </nameText></person>is incredibly gifted when it comes to debating and understanding policy. He is a good orator.</p><p>ROBERT GIBBS, SENIOR ADVISER, OBAMA CAMPAIGN: Look, I think that he just has to go out there and prosecute the same case the president was prosecuting. I hope that the opponent that he gets to debate, though, doesn't walk away from the very record and platform that have so been a part of the Romney-Ryan campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALVEAUX: So, the pressure on both candidates after last week's debate, however, what many saw as <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>lackluster performance. The <person><nameText>vice president, Joe Biden, </nameText></person>really feeling the heat now, at least that's how the folks at SNL see it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SETH MEYERS, ACTOR, \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\": Is there anything more exciting than <person><nameText>Joe Biden </nameText></person>thinking it's up to him to get the lead back? It's TiVo time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALVEAUX: And this reminder, can you watch the vice presidential debate right here on CNN. <person><nameText>Joe Biden </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>go at it Thursday, our coverage beginning at 7:00 Eastern.</p><p>Here's what we're working on for this hour.</p><p>(voice-over): More people have come down with a dangerous form of meningitis all because of contaminated steroid shots. It turns out the FDA does not regulate the company that supplied the drug and many others like it. We'll explain why.</p><p>A Congressional report warns two Chinese telecommunications companies operating in the U.S. pose a threat to national security.</p><p>And a daredevil sky diver is getting ready to break world records with a freefall from space. We'll have a live report on his wild mission.</p><p>MALVEAUX: The fungal meningitis outbreak is now getting worse. The outbreak has hit nine states, tainted steroid injections are believed to be the link. And the maker has now announced a recall of all its products. I want to bring Elizabeth Cohen to explain how is this happening? Can you explain what's going here?</p><p>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, first, I want to tell you about some new numbers that we have. We just got new numbers from the Centers for Disease Control, and there's an increase in just one day.</p><p>MALVEAUX: Wow.</p><p>COHEN: In just one day, we're seeing more cases, one more death. So, let's take a look at the numbers, 105 cases of people who have fungal meningitis believed to be linked to these contaminated steroid shots that people got for back pain, eight deaths, and there was only seven yesterday, and still, this has occurred in nine states. It's suspected that these numbers are going to go up and up and up, because you could have gotten these shots even back in May and just now be getting sick. It can take a long time for this disease to fester, as it would.</p><p>MALVEAUX: If you think that you did get one of those shots, what should you do?</p><p>COHEN: Well, you may be getting a phone call from the hospital or the facility that treated you. They're trying to reach out to people and say, hey, Mrs. Smith, you got a steroid shot here, you know, three months ago, and we want you to make sure look out for things. Headache. Look out for nausea. Look out for any symptoms. But, be proactive. Be an empowered patient. If you got a steroids shot, of course you don't know what company made this shot, right?</p><p>MALVEAUX: Right. True.</p><p>COHEN: I mean who asks that question? So you should call your doctor and say, hey, doctor, what company made the shot that you gave me?</p><p>MALVEAUX: Is this the first time something like this has happened, or has it happened in the past?</p><p>COHEN: Sadly, it's not. There have been problems with these compounding pharmacies, which we've been talking so much about. In Alabama, nine people died last year because of contamination of a product from a compounding pharmacy.</p><p>MALVEAUX: So when you say a compounding pharmacy, what does that mean?</p><p>COHEN: Yes, define that. OK, usually we think of pharmacies as just the place where the guy kind of counts up the pills.</p><p>MALVEAUX: Right.</p><p>COHEN: A compounding pharmacy is where they actually put medicine together. For -- you know, take a medicine, put it in a vial, and so they're not quite a regular old pharmacy, but they're not quite a big pharmaceutical company either. So pharmaceutical companies are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. A compounding pharmacy is regulated, for the most part, by the state. And states can be very uneven about how they do their regulating. There's been a lot of complaints that these are not regulated enough, and you just have to point to this, what happened in Alabama, nine people dying.</p><p>MALVEAUX: Right. Sure.</p><p>COHEN: Florida. There were eye infections because of solutions that were prepared at a compounding pharmacy. A lot of pressure over the years to be stricter on these pharmacies, but it hasn't quite happened the way these advocates would like.</p><p>MALVEAUX: If you get this kind of meningitis, is it fatal? Is it automatically fatal?</p><p>COHEN: It can be fatal, and it has a very high mortality rate. I mean it can be treated. The key is you want to catch it quickly. And that's why hospitals and doctors' offices are supposed to be calling their patients and saying, hey, we gave you something that might have fungus in it, and they're supposed to have you, you know, talk with you about what you should do. Some people might say, well, I feel fine now, but I want to come in and get a spinal tap to see if I've got any fungus in there.</p><p>MALVEAUX: Sure.</p><p>COHEN: Because it could just be sitting around in your body, but it won't actually get you sick for a while.</p><p>MALVEAUX: Is that -- is that how you find out, you have to get a spinal tap?</p><p>COHEN: Yes, that's -- I mean that's one of the primary ways that they do it. So it's not --</p><p>MALVEAUX: They do it. I hear that's a painful process.</p><p>COHEN: Wait, it's not fun, but it's better than having fungal meningitis, which can kill you.</p><p>MALVEAUX: All right. Thank you, Elizabeth. Appreciate the warning.</p><p>COHEN: Great. Thanks.</p><p>MALVEAUX: And for more on the outbreak, including a list of the hospitals that might have given patients this tainted steroid, first visit cnn.com/empoweredpatient.</p><p>A sky diver hoping practice makes perfect when he jumps from the edge of space to earth tomorrow. We're going to look at how he's been training for this big moment.</p><p>MALVEAUX: A SpaceX rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral last night launching the first commercial flight in the International Space Station.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Liftoff. Liftoff of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Launching Dragon to the International Space Station and returning cargo --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALVEAUX: The unmanned capsule called Dragon is on its way to the Space Station after separating from its rocket. Now, Dragon is carrying 1,000 pounds of cargo. The company has been contracted by NASA to fly a dozen flights to re-supply the Space Station.</p><p>His nickname, Fearless Felix. He's also known as Felix Baumgartner, and he has gotten to be pretty fearless. He actually -- to jump out of a balloon. This is 23 miles above the earth. This is exactly what he plans to do. The idea is to set a world record for a free-fall. He has already tried it from a lower altitude. Brian Todd is live in Roswell, New Mexico.</p><p>Wow, that's pretty cool. He was supposed to try it today, but it didn't happen because of the weather. What's the plan?</p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Suzanne, the plan is for them to launch this mission very early tomorrow morning. Probably about 8:30 Eastern Time is when the balloon and the capsule will go up. That's going to take about three hours to ascend. And then by about 11:30 Eastern Time, he is slated to basically step out of that capsule and do his jump, 120,000 feet above sea level, and that will set a free-fall record. He's going to be actually free-falling roughly 115,000 feet. His parachute will open about 5,000 feet above the earth.</p><p>But in the process of doing that, Suzanne, he is also going to break a speed record. No one has gone above the speed of sound outside of a capsule. Outside of a vehicle. He's going to be doing it with just a high pressure suit, a helmet, and a parachute. So that is the plan for tomorrow. Hopefully 24 hours from now we will be celebrating a successful mission with a healthy and intact Felix Baumgartner on the ground. They did have to delay it for a day because of high winds here in Roswell. That system is supposed to move through by this evening. And they say, as of now, it's a go tomorrow morning.</p><p>MALVEAUX: That's pretty cool. Tell us a little bit about the risk, first of all. And we're watching -- we're sealing some of this equipment that we saw. This little thin space suit and his helmet that's supposed to protect him here. What is that supposed to do?</p><p>TODD: This high pressure suit, Suzanne, is key. If this thing fails in any way, then you could have some really bad circumstances on your hands. The suit is supposed to protect him from the lack of pressure at that altitude, but there are other risks. I mean he could get decompression sickness on the way up. They call that the bends (ph). Deep sea divers often get it. He could get that on the way up. That's one risk.</p><p>Once he steps off the capsule, everything is reliant on that high pressure suit. If it gets compromised in any way, he could freeze severely because the temperatures get about 70 degrees below zero, we're told, up there. But if it's compromised even more, we're told that if the suit gets breached somehow at that altitude, the air could get sucked out of his lungs and his blood could boil. So that suit is key. If that suit fails, then there's going to be something pretty bad happening very high above the earth.</p><p>MALVEAUX: Why is he doing this? Do you know?</p><p>TODD: Well, I mean, he's a dare devil. That's one key reason. He space jumped from the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur. He has space jumped from the Christ the Redeemer Statue in Rio de Janeiro. He does things like this. But, really, what they're saying is, this is going to advance science. This is going to be able -- this is going to enable them to develop the next generation of space suit. The next generation of high pressure suit.</p><p>The gentleman whose record he's going to break, Joe Kittinger, he did this 52 years ago, and they base the space suits for the Apollo and Mercury missions on his space suit, on his high pressure suit.</p><p>MALVEAUX: Wow.</p><p>TODD: So with Felix -- with the suit that Felix is using, if it's going to work, they're going to be able to develop other space missions with astronauts wearing a very similar kind of suit. MALVEAUX: He really is fearless. We wish him all the best. Thank you, Brian. We'll be watching.</p><p>The president's poll numbers, they've dropped after the debate last week. We're going to look at how these numbers break down in the swing states.</p><p>And, don't forget, can you watch CNN live on your computer while you're at work. Head to cnn.com/TV.</p><p>MALVEAUX: In Arizona today, slain Border Patrol Agent Nicholas Ivie is being laid to rest. Ivie was killed last week in a shooting in southern Arizona. The FBI says they think it was a case of friendly fire with Ivie and other agents mistakenly shooting at each other. One other agent was wounded. Now, Ivie leaves behind a wife and two small daughters.</p><p>Overseas now. More fears that Syria's civil war is going to escalate into a regional fight. For the fifth day in a row, Syrian army forces are exchanging fire with Turkish troops on the border. And then there's this. Syrian troops are pushing to retake the key cities of Homs and Aleppo. Opposition activists say at least 76 people have died across Syria so far today. This is a suburb of Aleppo in northern Syria. Now, one person who posted the video on YouTube says it shows regime war planes attacking buses there and killing civilians. CNN has no way to independently verify the video.</p><p>And back to politics. We have heard of all kinds of reasons, rationale for the president's debate performance last week. And even if you thought he did a good job, you probably could admit he seemed a little distracted. Well, once again, the folks at \"SNL,\" They figured out why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JASON SUDEIKIS, \"<person><nameText>MITT ROMNEY</nameText></person>\", \"SNL\": Number 20 --</p><p>CHRIS PARNELL, ACTOR, \"SNL\": Excuse me, Governor. Mr. President?</p><p>JAY PHAROAH, \"<person><nameText>PRESIDENT OBAMA</nameText></person>\", \"SNL\": I'm sorry.

I can't believe I forgot the anniversary gift. This is bad. This is very -- okay. I was distracted by the mess I inherited from Bush, but, still, I should have remembered our anniversary. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALVEAUX: All jokes aside, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>gain some ground after beating <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>in last week's debate. Joining us to talk a bit about the numbers, our political editor, Paul Steinhauser. That's pretty funny stuff at \"SNL.\" They know how to go there. Are we talking about much of a balance here after the debate?</p><p>PAUL STEINHAUSER, CNN POLITICAL EDITOR: Well, one poll, we'll go to the first out of the gate, does indicate a small bounce. Take a look at this, Suzanne. This is from Gallop. They do that daily tracking poll. The seven-day poll. But look what they did. They split it up in two. On the left column, those are the three days prior to last week's debate in Denver. And you see, according to Gallup, among registered voters nationwide, the president, a five point advantage, within the sampling error. Look on the right. Those are October 4th through 6th, the three days after the debate in Denver. And Gallup indicates it's all tied up there.</p><p>Yes, I mean, this one poll does indicate that <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>did get a bounce. Of course, we're going to see a lot more national polls, a lot more polls, most importantly in the battle ground states later today, tomorrow, and Wednesday ask Thursday. Keep your eyes on those state polls. They're really the most telling -- Suzanne?</p><p>MALVEAUX: Also more debates. Tell us about the expectation of Thursdays. This is the vice president and <person><nameText>Paul Ryan.</nameText></person></p><p>STEINHAUSER: Yes. I think there's more at stake now than there would have been beforehand, but the president's lackluster performance last Wednesday makes this debate between Ryan and Biden a little more important. Both candidates talking about how they're getting ready for it. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>JOE BIDEN, </nameText></person>VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm looking forward to it. I really am. The thing about Congressman Ryan is he has been straight forward up until now about everything. He is -- all the significant changes he wants to make. We have a fundamentally different view on a whole range of issues.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. PAUL RYAN, </nameText></person>(R), WISCONSIN &amp; VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He is fast on the cuff. He is a witty guy. He knows who he is. He has been doing this for 40 years.

Maybe he'll bring up the 47 percent and Bain Capital. Stay tuned -- Suzanne?</p><p>MALVEAUX: Tell us a little bit about that debate that happened not with the real guys --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>-- but FOX News's Bill O'Reilly and Comedy Central's <person><nameText>Jon Stewart </nameText></person>facing off over the weekend.</p><p>STEINHAUSER: Yes. I think this was a little more entertaining than the one we saw last Wednesday. These guys dent have the burden of running for president, but enough of me. Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mike is here in the audience and he asked this question. If you could see any American elected president, who would you choose and why?</p><p>BILL O'REILLY, HOST, THE O'REILLY FACTOR: I would say Clint Eastwood have to be my guy.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p><person><nameText>JON STEWART, </nameText></person>HOST, THE DAILY SHOW: Well, why don't we ask him?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>So, um --</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>STEWART: What? Tell them to do what?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>STEINHAUSER: That was one of the lighter moments. You know, there was some serious parts to this debate. Both gentlemen talked policy. And I think, though, the American viewers were the winners in that debate -- Suzanne?</p><p>MALVEAUX: Absolutely.</p><p>Thank you, Paul.</p><p>This reminder, you can watch the vice presidential debate right here on CNN. <person><nameText>Joe Biden </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Paul Ryan, </nameText></person>they're going at it on Thursday. Our coverage begins at 7:00 eastern.</p><p>A fight to get voters registered in time for the election, it's kind of going badly in some places. We're going to take a look at voter apathy.</p><p>MALVEAUX: With the deadline a day away, volunteers feel the urgency to get voters registered in Florida. One door, one citizen at a time, they're encouraging folks just go out and vote.</p><p>But as our John Zarrella tells us, some have no interest in going to the polls.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JESSINIA FERNANDEZ, VOLUNTEER, FLORIDA IMMIGRANT COALITION: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>JOHN ZARRELLA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Jessinia Fernandez and Caryn Garcia go door to door. The question they ask is simple, but one of democracy's most important.</p><p>CARYN GARCIA, VOLUNTEER, FLORIDA IMMIGRANT COALITION: Are you registered to vote yet?</p><p>ZARRELLA: In Florida the deadline is Tuesday. If you're not registered by then, you can't vote in the presidential election.</p><p>FERNANDEZ: Sometimes I get sad because people tell me, you know, I don't want to vote. I don't like voting. You know, it's kind of like frustrating sometimes that they do have the right and they can vote. They just don't want to vote.</p><p>ZARRELLA: They work for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, one of a plethora of organizations, some partisan, some not, engaged in a last- minute swing state signing race to register voters.</p><p>Since the state's August primary, more than 133,000 people have registered at Nova Southeastern University Law School in Broward County.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you registered to vote.</p><p>ZARRELLA: At Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hey, are you registered to vote this year?</p><p>ZARRELLA: Outside the courthouse in Plantation, there's no mistaking which candidate Alan Ehrlich supports, but he says --</p><p>ALAN EHRLICH, VOLUNTEER: We register anyone that comes along that wants to register.</p><p>ZARRELLA (on camera): But you would prefer they register Democrat since --</p><p>EHRLICH: Of course. I work for the Obama campaign.</p><p>ZARRELLA (voice-over): When he enrolled, Jonathan Colon registered.</p><p>JONATHAN COLON, NEW VOTER: I'm looking in the future ten years down the line. Whatever they can do to make their four years count is what I really want.</p><p>ZARRELLA: With so much at stake in Florida, there can be a darker side to voter registration. Palm Beach County supervisor of elections, Susan Bucher, discovered discrepancies, signatures that looked the same, addresses that didn't appear right, on more than 100 voter registration forms.</p><p>SUSAN BUCHER, SUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS, BROWARD COUNTY: We just haven't ever experienced this kind of issue with the registration forms, and so that's got us a little disconcerted.</p><p>ZARRELLA: the company at the center of what is now a statewide investigation, Strategic Allied Consulting, hired by the Republican Party to register voters, was fired. Strategic insists the problem was with one individual and that it maintains rigorous quality control measures.</p><p>Back in Fort Lauderdale, not a good day for Jessinia and Caryn. Only a handful of new registers. That hurts, they say. You see, neither one is a U.S. citizen. Both are part of the group called Dreamers, whose parents brought them here illegally when they were children. And here they are trying to encourage people to exercise a right they only wish they had.</p><p>FERNANDEZ: Have a nice day.</p><p>ZARRELLA: John Zarrella, CNN, Ft. Lauderdale.</p><p>FERNANDEZ: Bye.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALVEAUX: A threat to American national security. That is what a congressional court is now calling two Chinese companies operating here in the United States. We're going to explain why.</p><p>MALVEAUX: The House Intelligence Committee reports that two of the biggest telecom companies could pose a threat to U.S. national security because of their ties to the Chinese government. These companies have been trying to expand operations here in the United States, but this report suggests that using Chinese equipment could make us vulnerable to cyber attack and open our telecommunications to military and commercial spying.</p><p>Felicia Taylor is in New York to explain what is going on.</p><p>These two companies, the focus of the report. One is called Huawei and one called ZTE. What do they suspect these companies are able to do?</p><p>FELICIA TAYLOR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Suzanne, it sounds pretty scary, frankly. But, of course, naturally, the Chinese companies are not agreeing with the report. It was prepared by House Intelligence Committee over the past year. And basically Huawei and ZTE are two of the largest Chinese telecom companies, and they want to expand here in the United States, but both are big tech companies that make products like routers and other Internet gear. The report says that China has the means, opportunity and motive to use telecom companies for malicious purposes, like espionage. Nothing has been proven though.</p><p>They say the equipment they use does pose a national security threat. The report is especially critical of Huawei, pointing to intellectual property violations, alleged ties to Iran, and what the committee calls, quote, \"a pattern and practice of potentially illegal behavior in the U.S.\"</p><p>Both companies are disputing the findings. Huawei says in its statement that, \"The committee's report not only ignored our proven track record of network security in the U.S. and globally, but also paid no attention to the large amount of facts that we have provided,\" end quote. ZTE says that it's, \"Set an unprecedented standard for cooperation by any Chinese company with a congressional investigation.\"</p><p>So it's very important to note that the report doesn't indicate any proof of wrong doing by the companies as of yet. This is a warning, however, that companies should be careful if they are going to engage in any kind of business with Huawei and ZTE -- Suzanne?</p><p>MALVEAUX: Tell us how the market is doing today.</p><p>TAYLOR: Well, not so great. It started out down about 30 points. It's not a disaster. \"CNN Money\" did a survey of economists and fund managers. Most of them believe that the rally, unfortunately, has come to an end. You know, you have a lot of concerns still out there. Stocks are posting double-digit gains for the year right now, and that's pretty darn good. The major averages are up between about 11 percent and 19 percent across the board. The survey says that that's right where experts think the market will finish out this year.</p><p>A few reasons for the expected stall? The upcoming presidential election. It's an unknown. We don't know who is going to run the country for the next four years. Stocks may remain in a holding pattern until investors have that answer. Of course, there's also the fiscal cliff. That's when a variety of those spending cuts and tax increases kicking in in the new year. Congress has been non-committal about how it's going to handle that, and that's really what's upsetting most of the trade others wall street because, again, it's an unanswered question. It's unpredictable headlines out of Europe are also expected to factor in, so for today the Dow is just slightly lower. Again, not a disaster. 30 points, it's OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MALVEAUX: We look for the silver lining. We're looking for it.</p><p>TAYLOR: We try.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MALVEAUX: Thank you, Felicia. The unemployment rate fell in September. More people returned to the labor force, and hiring was steady. In this week's \"Smart is the New Rich,\" we see a guy that took a big risk to make a career change in a brightening job market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Olatunde Kamson wanted to switch careers from operations in I.T. to marketing and big data. In a slow jobs market, that takes training and risks.</p><p>OLATUNDE KAMSON, WENT BACK TO GRADUATE SCHOOL: I decided to go back to business school. And I went part-time and realized that I needed even more training. So I left my full-time position, and gained an internship at CBS, and that was a great gateway. So the internship, plus the MBA, I was able to fortunately land the job by looking at the data more on the marketing end and helping with making strategic decisions.</p><p>ROMANS: The switch took time and money, $80,000 in student loans.</p><p>(on camera): Is it worth the investment to re-train in your career, and take on all of the student loans?</p><p>KAMSON: Yes, it is worth the investment.</p><p>ROMANS (voice-over): The degree loan doesn't open doors. He also worked with a job coach.</p><p>CAROLINE CENIZA-LEVINE, CAREER COACH, SIXFIGURESTART: We really worked with him on interviewing and network, because, let's face it, as a career changer, his resume speaks to what he did before. In order to get people to think of him in a different way, he had to talk to people and tell them his story.</p><p>ROMANS: Not all career switches require an MBA and 80 grand in debt. Consider community colleges or free online courses in the new field.</p><p>CENIZA-LEVINE: Counter-intuitively, a career-changer can't seem like a career changer. People will ask about experience if you're not demonstrating enough expertise or a skill set. You have to show the people who are already in that job, in that industry, that I can do this, too. And it is just a question of getting hired.</p><p>ROMANS: Remember, an employer typically scans a resume for 10 seconds or less.</p><p>CENIZA-LEVINE: Too many people will suspend the rest of their search, hoping for the perfect resume that gets noticed. It's irrelevant. What really matters is networking and interviewing. You want to get in front of as many people and tell them your story. In his case, he was interested in strategy. He talked to people who had those jobs. He didn't know them, but he reached out.</p><p>KAMSON: It was a two and a half year journey to get the job I wanted. But it is definitely worth it and paying off now. This is my dream job.</p><p>ROMANS: Christine Romans, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALVEAUX: Good for him.</p><p>It's a chilly day for most of the country. We're going to take a look at where the temperatures actually set some records.</p><p>MALVEAUX: All right, the folks in New Orleans, they don't need reason to celebrate. But they have one today, including my family. New Orleans Saints, quarterback, Drew Brees, set a record last night. Brees' 48th game in a row with a touchdown pass. He broke the record set 52 years ago by Colts quarterback, Johnny Unitas. And head coach, Sean Payton, got to watch. He's suspended this year because of the Saints alleged bounty program. But Brees asked the NFL commissioner for a special permission to allow Payton to be at the game.</p><p>It is getting pretty chilly in parts of the country. So cold, in fact, we're seeing some records that are broken today.</p><p>Chad, tell us what's going on.</p><p>CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Oh, my, 31 in Tulsa. I'm sure what's going on there.</p><p>MALVEAUX: Really?</p><p>MYERS: Wisdom, Montana, the winner or the loser, depending on your point of view, five degrees over the weekend.</p><p>MALVEAUX: That's freezing.</p><p>MYERS: That's 27 below freezing. Yes, so I think that's the end of tomato season. If you have some --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MYERS: -- just cut them up and make fried green tomatoes because that's all we have.</p><p>Wisdom, Montana, 5 degrees above zero on Sunday. Laramie, 6. We had some records today, not just like we're seeing now. In the 20s and 30s, not single digits like the weekend. Even Oregon, St. Joseph, Missouri, 22. I know you had things out there in the garden, but not anymore.</p><p>Freeze threat moves to upstate New York, back to Buffalo, down to Chautauqua County, the Poconos and Alleghenies. I'm not seeing temperatures that are below freezing in the big cities, like Scranton or for Pittsburgh, but you get out toward Dubois, Williamsport, you get out to those areas that are away from cities and away from the city heat, you will definitely be below 32. The best thing to do, if you want to try to save the tomatoes, cover them up with something cloth. Don't put a plastic tarp over the top, because the plastic touches the leaves, the plastic can put the heat in the cold right through and your plants are dead anyway.</p><p>Here you go. If you're going to be there, lows tonight across the country, 45, Denver. Denver was great example of what a cold front is. On Thursday, you were 83. On Friday morning, you were at 32. That's just, wow, 51 degree swings here. And that's just what happens in the fall. 67 for tomorrow in Kansas City.</p><p>Yes, it does warm up. This is not the end of the beginning of fall. This is not where winter starts. Although there was some snow and temperatures like this do look more like winter than anything else. This is just kind of a first cold front that comes through, gives you the shock.</p><p>I remember living in Buffalo, we had a saying, if there was snow on the pumpkin or jack-o-lantern by the 31st, it would be a cold winter. There is a lot of snow in some spots. Some spots have 12 inches of snow. If that's any indication, it could be a cold winter. It is a 50/50 chance.</p><p>MALVEAUX: Have to make sure my mom covers her tomato plants. She's always planting tomatoes. Yes, last night not a good night for the tomatoes.</p><p>Do you have an update about el Nino? I understand it might not be coming. Is that right?</p><p>MYERS: That's the old thing about -- we had la Nina. That makes a big change for hurricane season. El Nino can really come in and slam California and make a bunch of things different across the country when it comes to weather changes. All of a sudden, el Nino kind of changed its mind and now it is neutral, which means that things should be normal for the rest of the season. Not one big swing one way or the other. What normal means now compared to what it meant when you and I were kids, I'm not sure, but at least normal is what we're going to get.</p><p>MALVEAUX: OK. Thank you, Chad. Good to see you.</p><p>CHAD: You've got it.</p><p>MALVEAUX: If your next trip takes you through New York's Liberty International Airport, take note. According to the \"Star Ledger\" newspaper, TSA agents there are getting low marks for security checks. The paper says that agents carried out standard passenger pat-downs correctly only about 17 percent of the time. The agents never told passengers they could choose pat-down over full-body scans.</p><p>A statue of Christopher Columbus hovering over Columbus Circle in New York city -- is a major land mark -- now an artist has created an unusual way for people to see it face to face. It is not sitting well with some folks.</p><p>MALVEAUX: One of New York's most iconic statues is now indoors. Christopher Columbus has his own apartment. You can visit. And so is everybody happy about it? Well, not really.</p><p>Richard Roth has got the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD ROTH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Christopher Columbus has stood tall in New York's Columbus Circle since 1892. One big problem, though --</p><p>MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, MAYOR OF NEW YORK: I've been living in the city since 1966, Columbus Circle has always been there. But you don't look up. You can't see it. It is so high.</p><p>ROTH: Faster than you can see Nina, Pinta and the Santa Maria, the city and a public art group set sail to bring the people to Columbus. Now New Yorkers and tourists enter another new world to rediscover Columbus. Columbus appears to have time travelled into the future, standing on a coffee table in living room Americana -- couch, cable tv, and wallpaper starring Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe.</p><p>NICHOLAS BAUME, DIRECTOR, PUBLIC ART FUND: Columbus stayed exactly where he was and this all took shape around him.</p><p>ROTH: Only Columbus has seen these views before of major New York avenues.</p><p>BAUME: I like to think of it as Christopher Columbus finally getting a piece of the American dream. His own home, front row, dress circle in New York City.</p><p>ROTH: Japanese artist, Tatsu Nishi, who specializes in transforming public spaces. Brought Columbus out of the cold.</p><p>TATZU NISHI, ARTIST: I am so happy to have my work in New York City.</p><p>ROTH: Some people are not happy an Italian icon is hidden away in a living room.</p><p>ROSARIO IACONIS, ITALIC INSTITUTE OF AMERICA: If they wanted to exalt the admiral of the open sea, they wouldn't have encased him in this boxy frame that is buffoonery masquerading as art.</p><p>ROTH: I walked up new steps to Italy's New York consulate to discuss what was done to an Italian sea captain by a Japanese artist in Manhattan.</p><p>NATALIE QUINTIVALLE, ITALIAN CONSUL GENERAL OF NEW YORK: Ours is a language which is supposed to unify people and different cultures.</p><p>ROTH (on camera): I ordered Chinese take-out. Will the delivery man be able to come up here to the living room so I can watch some TV along with Chris?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROTH: You can explore this exhibit until November 18th. Then the ancient Mariner, freed from New York pigeons, gets major cleaning and repairs.</p><p>Richard Roth, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALVEAUX: Pretty bizarre.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CNN NEWSROOM continues now with Brooke Baldwin.</p><p>Hi, Brooke.</p><p>BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN ANCHOR: I wondered what all the scaffolding was there at Columbus Circle. Now we know.</p><p>Suzanne, thank you very much.</p><p>Good to see all of you. I'm Brooke Baldwin.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Their murder led to the trial of the century in which O.J. Simpson was ultimately acquitted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Simpson joined Twitter this week and has already issued some curious messages.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">O.J. SIMPSON, ACQUITTED OF THE MURDERS OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND RON GOLDMAN: This should be a lot of fun. I got a little getting even to do. So, God bless and take care.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: Joining us now to talk about this and more is Kim Goldman, Ron Goldman's sister. Good morning, Kim.</p><p>KIM GOLDMAN, RON GOLDMAN'S SISTER, HOST, \"CONFRONTING O.J. SIMPSON\" PODCAST: Good morning.</p><p>CAMEROTA: When O.J. says, \"I've got a little getting even to do\" how did you and your family interpret that?</p><p>GOLDMAN: I giggled. You know, I -- it's par the course. I mean, I think he hates not having his voice heard, you know.</p><p>He'll take any opportunity he can, so this is just the newest form for him and we'll see what that means. I love the mystery behind it but I think it's all a bunch of B.S.</p><p>CAMEROTA: And what do you -- what do you think of him watching his new Twitter habit on the 25-year anniversary of the -- of the double murder?</p><p>GOLDMAN: You know, one of his attorneys said that it wasn't a coincidence. I think it's kind of disgusting. I think the fact that he didn't even pay attention to that.</p><p>He did an interview saying that he's in a no-negative zone. They don't even talk about it in his house. We're pretty proud in our house to always be talking about my brother and we're really sensitive to special moments in our family. So the fact that he chose to make this his introduction to the world, I think it's pretty disrespectful to Ron and Nicole, actually.</p><p>CAMEROTA: So many millions of us, Kim, just remember 25 years ago vividly. I mean, I remember so well the night of the murders or certainly, the hours afterwards and hearing about them and being so struck. And then, the days that followed and all of the drama and everything that happened.</p><p>And I'm just wondering how you and your dad feel 25 years later? What's happening in your lives? How do you all mark this moment?</p><p>GOLDMAN: You know, we do our best every day to mark moments that are about my brother and about our family. The 5-year, 10-year, 20, 17 -- whatever year it is that we're acknowledging that my brother has been gone is hard. Every day is hard. It just happens to be more public on the bigger dates.</p><p>But we really just try to -- try to hug each other a lot and tell each other how much we love each other, and try to continue to do good work in the community. And that's how we're going to be honoring Ron's legacy.</p><p>CAMEROTA: You have a new podcast and it's called \"Confronting: O.J. Simpson.\" And you go back to the main players -- even jurors who were involved in this trial and in this case.</p><p>And we have a little snippet from your sit-down with Kato Kaelin that we just want to play a portion of. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOLDMAN: Did you ever talk to Simpson after the murders?</p><p>KATO KAELIN, WITNESS IN O.J. SIMPSON MURDER CASE: O.J. pulled me into the kitchen by myself and said, \"You know I was here with you.\" And I said, \"No, I don't.\"</p><p>GOLDMAN: Oh.</p><p>KAELIN: He just kind of shook it off. And then I was like, is he trying to use me --</p><p>[07:35:00] GOLDMAN: Yes.</p><p>KAELIN: -- for something that I think he could have done? I think he's guilty. I wanted to move out immediately.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK. I don't think I've heard that before. That was a fascinating insight from Kato Kaelin.</p><p>GOLDMAN: Yes. I -- you know, I was really lucky that everybody that participated in the podcast was really forthcoming and candid. I'm grateful for the honesty.</p><p>Kato was really, you know, very willing to share and talk and expose his heart. I was interested to hear from him because I think he's been made out to be this goofball for all of these years. But it's really impacted him and it's really affected his life. And I think people will learn a lot about him and how it impacted him emotionally, too.</p><p>CAMEROTA: And all of these years later, why did you want to go back and revisit all of this?</p><p>GOLDMAN: You know, speaking of the killer wanting to be heard, it's been important for my family and I to make sure that Ron's memory is visible and for me personally, that I get to reclaim some control in my life.</p><p>This case has been completely out of control and it was important for me to lead the questions -- to ask questions from a place of compassion and from a place that I think people are really interested to hear, which is what really went into your mindset. Not highlighting moments that failed or were successful, but really understanding what went into each decision, why some decisions were made and why some weren't, why witnesses were called and why some didn't get on the witness stand.</p><p>These are people that have an integral part of my life and I really just wanted to get deeper into what was going on and how impacted all of us.</p><p>CAMEROTA: And to that end, you interviewed some jurors and you say that they basically confessed that, in some ways, their process was a scam. What did they tell you?</p><p>GOLDMAN: Yes. I have to tell you, the jurors were the -- probably the more difficult conversations that I had throughout this process.</p><p>They confirmed what my father and I always believed, which is that the jury didn't do their job. That they stopped listening, they wanted to go home. They were angry that they were sequestered for so long.</p><p>And that 3 1/2 hour farce of a deliberation time period was just that. And one of the jurors admitted to me that they just pulled a random piece of testimony so that it could look like they were actually doing something in the room.</p><p>CAMEROTA: That is remarkable. It is remarkable that 25 years later you got them to tell you that and it confirmed your suspicion.</p><p>Well, Kim, we are thinking of --</p><p>GOLDMAN: Yes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: -- your family this week.</p><p>And again, the podcast is \"Confronting: O.J. Simpson\" and it is out tomorrow. It looks fascinating. You've gotten lots of really interesting revelations from people. So, thanks so much for sharing it with us today.</p><p>GOLDMAN: Thank you, Alisyn -- thank you.</p><p>CAMEROTA: John --</p><p>JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: They work so hard to keep the memory alive and it's hard work.</p><p>All right, severe turbulence caught on video. A flight attendant slamming into the ceiling. A beverage cart crashes into passengers. Oh -- we'll tell you how this all ended, next.</p><p>[07:42:16] BERMAN: \"Jasper Jaws\" (ph) meets the news.</p><p>This morning, we have a CNN special report in a weeklong series on America's crumbling infrastructure. The Society of Civil Engineers says our roads, bridges, and airports, and schools are in such a state of disrepair it will take trillions of dollars over the next decade to fix them.</p><p>Tom Foreman is live in Washington with the kick-off of this special report -- Tom.</p><p>TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, John, you could go to anywhere you want in this town and find Democrats and Republicans, progressives and conservatives all agreeing the infrastructure needs fixing. The roads need to be repaired, the bridges need to be repaired, the power grid needs to be strengthened. But that's where the agreement ends because they cannot agree on how to get the job done.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FOREMAN (voice-over): Airports overloaded and outdated, roadways overburdened and buckling --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Holy (bleep).</p><p>FOREMAN (voice-over): -- power grids, parks, schools, broadband service, public transit, and water systems.</p><p>According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, which grades all those categories, the aging infrastructure has been crumbling for years, slowing travel, stifling business, endangering Americans.</p><p>CASEY DINGES, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS: Fifteen thousand dam structure in the United States are considered high-hazard. We still have 55,000 structurally-deficient bridges in the United States.</p><p>FOREMAN (on camera): And this is costing America real money in terms of jobs, and lost productivity, and lost private time.</p><p>DINGES: The average commuter loses 42 hours a year sitting in traffic. That's like losing a week's vacation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The President of the United States.</p><p>FOREMAN (voice-over): President Trump has promised huge improvements from the start.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: New roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and railways. Safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure. This is not an option, this is a necessity.</p><p>FOREMAN (voice-over): And, Democrats say they want it, too.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): It's clear that both the White House and all of us want to get something done on infrastructure in a big and bold way.</p><p>FOREMAN (voice-over): The result, however, has been a big, bold, bipartisan failure.</p><p>TRUMP: This is what it takes to get something approved.</p><p>FOREMAN (voice-over): Part of the problem is each time Trump has announced an infrastructure initiative, it has been derailed by an unrelated controversy.</p><p>But there is more.</p><p>RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: You have a governing party and an opposition party, and the goal of the opposition party is not to reach deals with the majority party. It's to discredit their ideas, beat them, and become the majority party themselves.</p><p>FOREMAN (voice-over): Democrats balk at the idea of a blank check without assurances their constituents will get a share of the jobs, and that improvements will respect and protect the environment. Republicans recoil from the idea of regulations holding too much sway and would like to privatize many of these public projects. And both sides are nervous about the price.</p><p>[07:45:09] FOREMAN (on camera): Just to catch up to all these deficiencies, the American Society of Civil Engineers say it will take $2 trillion over 10 years and then, $200 billion annually to keep up.</p><p>FOREMAN (voice-over): There has been talk of a higher federal gas tax, prioritized spending of tax money already in the bank, and more fees for everyone everywhere.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We stand at a pivotal place in terms of building infrastructure for the future.</p><p>FOREMAN (voice-over): Yes, there has been talk, but not much else.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FOREMAN: Make no mistake about it, this is a monumental task that would take a lot of money. But every time you hit a pothole in the road, every time you run into an unexplained delay at the airport because it's overtaxed, when the power goes off for big areas, when a dam fails, and all of that happens, that does belong at the doorstep of both parties who refuse to start by doing the one thing they must do first -- build a compromise, which is a dirty word here in Washington -- Alisyn.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yes, the crumbling bridge is a metaphor, Tom -- I agree.</p><p>FOREMAN: It is.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I mean, the one thing that both sides agree on, they can't even do.</p><p>BERMAN: No, they can't even do what they agree on.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Thank you very much, Tom, for that report.</p><p>Meanwhile, after what Russia did to the U.S. elections in 2016, passing legislation to beef up our election security would also seem to be a layup, but it is not.</p><p>John Avlon explains in our reality check -- John.</p><p>JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Speaking of things people should be able to agree on, there should be some things that transcend petty partisan politics and at the top of that list is stopping foreign powers from interfering in our elections.</p><p>Remember this?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT MUELLER, SPECIAL COUNSEL, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE: There were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election, and that allegation deserves the attention of every American.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AVLON: That's every American, regardless of party. But, Robert Mueller's warning is, again, falling on willfully deaf ears.</p><p>We know that foreign powers continue to try to meddle in our elections. Trump's own FBI director and director of National Intelligence have made that crystal clear.</p><p>But when Trump's former Homeland Security secretary tried to discuss plans to protect our elections with the president, she was waved off by his chief of staff. And now, we have an even clearer indication of why, because President Trump just said he'd entertain foreign offers of assistance in our elections, a comment his campaign has said it would take as a directive.</p><p>At the same time, there are reports that election security task forces within DHS have been scaled back, all while President Trump has repeatedly floated the absurd idea that we should have a joint cyber command with Russia to safeguard -- wait for it -- our election security.</p><p>But surely Congress will step up and act responsibly to secure our elections, right? Just kidding.</p><p>Instead, a key group of Republican lawmakers are doing everything they can to block these efforts and the ringmaster of this circus of denial, Sen. Mitch McConnell.</p><p>Now, he's been careful to say that \"These threats and challenges are real. Our responsibility to strengthen America is serious.\" He's just not going to actually allow the Senate to do anything about it.</p><p>Remember, it was McConnell who stopped any bipartisan statement condemning Russian interference in 2016, according to former DNI James Clapper. And now, the man who calls himself the \"Grim Reaper\" has killed common-sense legislation from every side of the aisle on election security.</p><p>This list includes efforts to report imposed mandatory sanctions on anyone who attacks an American election. A billion dollars to state and local authorities to strengthen election security. The Honest Ads Act, which would require big tech platforms like Facebook to disclose who is buying political ads.</p><p>Bills that would require backup paper ballots, and duty to report legislation that would require campaigns to report foreign interference.</p><p>Now, the last effort was blocked singlehandedly by Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, who said that no one wants foreign interference of any type in our government, but then said that that bill was overbroad and should be done in a bipartisan way.</p><p>Well, the unanimous consent effort she killed was bipartisan and her Heisman was immediately hailed by President Trump. Now, she's being joined by Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski.</p><p>But make no mistake, this Senate inaction is a dereliction of duty. It has the effect of empowering our enemies at a time when FBI director Chris Wray says that more countries like China are getting into the game and what we've experienced in the past is just a \"dress rehearsal\" for what's coming next.</p><p>Any senator who is blocking election security efforts is playing short-term politics with the integrity of our elections and they're betting you won't notice or remember until at least after the next election. At that point, it may be too late.</p><p>Bottom line, there can be no political excuse for failing to defend our democracy, period.</p><p>And that's your reality check.</p><p>BERMAN: John, you say surely Congress will take action on election security. To that, I say no -- and don't call me Shirley.</p><p>CAMEROTA: And stop calling him Shirley.</p><p>[07:50:00] BERMAN: All right, John.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Thank you, John.</p><p>BERMAN: A terrifying midair scare --</p><p>CAMEROTA: I'm already scared.</p><p>BERMAN: -- caught on camera. This is really awful.</p><p>Severe turbulence --</p><p>CAMEROTA: Oh my gosh.</p><p>BERMAN: -- hit a flight --</p><p>CAMEROTA: Oh.</p><p>BERMAN: You can see what it did. A flight attendant crashing into the ceiling, the beverage cart falling onto screaming passengers. This happened on a flight from Kosovo to Switzerland.</p><p>Ten people on this flight were sent to the hospital with minor injuries.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Oh my gosh, this is terrifying.</p><p>BERMAN: Right.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I was on a flight yesterday that I also thought had bad turbulence for about four minutes, but everybody else was sleeping and reading their papers.</p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: So I don't know what they weren't feeling that I was feeling.</p><p>BERMAN: You weren't on this flight.</p><p>CAMEROTA: It felt to me like that.</p><p>BERMAN: You weren't on this flight.</p><p>CAMEROTA: It felt like that but it didn't have the same effect on anyone around me.</p><p>BERMAN: I'm so glad you made it through.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Thank you.</p><p>All right, massacre averted. A masked gunman attempted to shoot up a federal courthouse in Dallas. What do police know about why he wanted to do this?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Holy crap.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[07:55:00] BERMAN: We're getting new details this morning into what could have been a massacre in downtown Dallas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(Gunshots)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN: Right now, the FBI is scouring the social media and military history of a 22-year-old masked gunman who opened fire outside a federal courthouse before he was shot dead by police.</p><p>I want to bring in Josh Campbell, CNN law enforcement analyst and former FBI supervisory special agent.</p><p>Josh, there are 200 FBI agents now working on this case. If you were one of them, what questions would you be asking?</p><p>JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST, FORMER SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT, FBI: Well, so many questions. And let me say at the outset John, if I can, that we herald the work of law enforcement in this country. We hold their feet to the fire whenever required.</p><p>This is one of those days that all of us should be honoring the work of a federal agency that most of us have never heard of -- the Federal Protective Service. They're charged with protecting federal buildings in Washington, D.C. and around the country. And but for their quick actions in engaging the shooter, we may be talking about a mass murder right now.</p><p>As you mentioned, the FBI special agent in charge indicating over 200 agents assigned to this case. Essentially, the entire Dallas field office is being told this is their top priority. They're going through this subject's social media.</p><p>Questions I would have, obviously, is to get to motivation. Did he signal in advance his intentions to attack this target? Were there people that were in his orbit that may have known about him?</p><p>A lot of questions for law enforcement and we can be assured that they worked throughout the night and this investigation will be continuing.</p><p>BERMAN: You say that this looks like what law enforcement might consider an injustice collector. What do you mean by that?</p><p>CAMPBELL: Yes, exactly.</p><p>So when you think about what the subject could have done -- and again, it's chilling to think about, but he was well-armed -- a high-powered rifle, hundreds of rounds of ammunition on his waistband that we saw in these photos and these images. He could have caused mass loss of life if his goal was to indiscriminately kill people.</p><p>There's a lot we don't know at this point but I think one thing that we can take away is that his goal wasn't just to cause mass loss of life because you wouldn't go after a federal building. Think about what this institution represents -- power, authority. Sure, law enforcement in this country enforces the law, but it's in these courthouses where justice is ultimately handed down.</p><p>So, I think what we're probably going to learn with this subject is he had some kind of grievance with law enforcement. Again, a lot of that will come from his background, looking into details of his life. But there was something that motivated him to come after this and we've seen those instances in the past where someone feels slighted, they collected these injustices, and sadly, some of them actually act on them with violence.</p><p>BERMAN: But this is a hard target. As you say, this is a federal courthouse here. This person had to know it would be heavily guarded. And even if he had 150 rounds of ammunition and wanted to make a lot of noise, he wasn't going to get very far.</p><p>CAMPBELL: Yes, exactly. Anyone who has been in these federal buildings, they know that they're highly protected. There are armed guards in and around the building.</p><p>I don't think that there's any way -- again, we can't get into the mind --</p><p>BERMAN: Right.</p><p>CAMPBELL: -- of the shooter, but there's no way he would have made his way past these layers of security, up the elevators, into a judge's chamber or courtroom, for example. And so, again, his main grievance may have been just to attack this institution -- to attack this building.</p><p>We know the FBI is currently working with the Department of Defense, again, to go back through his life. He's a 22-year-old former Army infantryman. So there will be a lot of possible clues that they'll be able to develop as far as what happened in this person's past. Did he have run-ins with law enforcement --</p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>CAMPBELL: -- or some type of authority figures? Again, all of that will be part of this investigation.</p><p>BERMAN: Very quickly, you bring up this man's military history. He was an infantryman in the Army from 2015 to 2017. So what kind of information would the military be able to provide here?</p><p>CAMPBELL: So, inside the military, they do these analyses of members of personnel, fitness reports. There are supervisors, again, who will file reports about their observations of these people. So again, they want to talk to his superior to try to figure out was he someone who was in trouble?</p><p>We know that he served two years, which isn't a lot of time, so I would want to know what caused him to be discharged. And again, all of that will come from talking to his last employer, which would have been the Department of Defense -- and again, to gather those clues.</p><p>What was this person like? What -- how did he act around others, around authority figures? Again, to get to that motive. Why did he decide to conduct an attack on the U.S. government?</p><p>BERMAN: An important thing I think you say today is to give thanks to the Federal Protective Services, preventing what might have been a massacre there. Terrifying images.</p><p>Josh Campbell, thank you so much for being with us.</p><p>CAMPBELL: Thanks, John.</p><p>BERMAN: Alisyn --</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK, John.</p><p>As you know, all morning we've been pressing the White House to give us some response to the president's latest threat via Twitter to deport a million -- well, actually, millions, he said, undocumented immigrants. So we have some answers now. Let's get to it.</p><p>All right, good morning, everyone. Welcome to your NEW DAY.

In particular, he highlights two key reasons why we shouldn't do it: (1) It would lock in the most powerful companies like Facebook and Google (even as misguided critics seem to think taking away Section 230 protections will harm them), and (2) It will enable the Trump administration to increase online censorship of marginalized voices. On the first point, the argument is the one I made regarding Facebook's new stance, though Wyden expresses it succinctly:Some have argued that repealing Section 230 would punish Facebook and Google for their failures. That's simply not true. </p><p>The biggest tech companies have enough lawyers and lobbyists to survive virtually any regulation Congress can concoct. It's the start-ups seeking to displace Big Tech that would be hammered by the constant threat of lawsuits.He notes, as we have in the past, that most of the lobbying to gut 230 is being lead by industries that failed to adapt[3] to the internet, and are now using 230 as a hammer to try to stay relevant. The argument about speech is equally as important:I'm certain this administration would use power to regulate speech to punish its enemies and protect its allies. It would threaten Facebook or YouTube for taking down white supremacist content. It would label Black Lives Matter activists as purveyors of hate.Again, this is exactly what we've warned about[4]. Section 230 has created spaces online for the most marginalized to speak out -- and they will be the first to be silenced. Indeed, that's exactly what we've already seen post SESTA. The law that was passed in the name of \"protecting sex trafficking victims\" has actually put sex workers at risk[5]. Wyden points out that the law appears to have done the opposite of what its backers promised:Backpage was shut down before SESTA even went into effect. And sex workers have been driven to the dark Web or the streets, where sex trafficking has increased dramatically[6]. The most vulnerable group bore the brunt of this law.And the same is likely for any other attempt to attack 230 as well. What's really incredible in all of this is how little those looking to modify or remove 230 seem to even understand 230. They seem to blame all sorts of societal problems on 230, even though all 230 has done is allow people to express themselves. And from there, the complaints against 230 are often contradictory. Some are worried that two much speech is silenced through moderation, while others complain that not enough speech is silenced. But neither is a 230 problem. They are all just representations of the impossibility of pleasing everyone[7] when it comes to moderation policies. But taking away 230 or even modifying it won't change any of that. All it will do is lead to much greater censorship, and much more power for the biggest internet companies. As is often the case, it would be nice if others in Congress actually listened to Ron Wyden on this -- as he's been right since the very beginning, and every time people ignore him, they end up looking foolish. Unfortunately, I fear that they will end up looking foolish yet again.Permalink[8] | Comments[9] | Email This Story[10] [ 1]: <url
