(Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.</p><p>I would now turn the conference over to your host, Brad Burke, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Mr. Burke, you may begin.</p><p>BRADLEY KENNETH BURKE, HEAD OF IR, CBRE GROUP, INC.: Thank you, and welcome to CBRE's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, and it is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.</p><p>Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our second quarter results and 2019 outlook in more detail. After these comments, we'll open up the call for your questions.</p><p>Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth momentum, operations, market share, business outlook, capital deployment, acquisition, integration and financial performance, including our 2019 outlook, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings press release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively.</p><p>We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck.</p><p>Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the second quarter of 2019.</p><p>Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 11% over the prior year driven by our 2 services segments, Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions, which together logged 12% fee revenue growth and 18% adjusted EBITDA growth.</p><p>Revenue growth in the quarter was broad-based as every line of business within both of these segments increased over the prior year.</p><p>In addition, adjusted EBITDA margins on fee revenue increased solidly in both our Advisory and Global Workplace Solutions segments, expanding by 90 basis points on a combined basis. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment declined as expected from the prior year due to the timing of development dispositions and, to a lesser extent, the costs associated with starting up Hana, our flexible space offering. Gains from our development business can vary due to the timing of a project disposition. And last year, we harvested gains from several significant projects during the second quarter.</p><p>Now for an update on our business fundamentals, I will turn the call over to Bob.</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, CBRE GROUP, INC.: Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As Brad just noted, we reported another quarter of strong growth for CBRE with double-digit revenue increases in our leasing, occupier outsourcing and U.S. capital markets businesses. In addition, the impact of our reorganization, which we announced last year, is driving margin improvement in our Advisory Services and Outsourcing businesses. Cost efficiency was one of the key objectives of this change.</p><p>The continued strength in our leasing business is notable as lease revenue growth has averaged 20% over the past 5 quarters. While we have benefited from a healthy leasing market, our strong performance also reflects our increasingly differentiated capabilities. This is demonstrated by our success in winning new account-based business because of our ability to integrate Advisory and Transaction solutions in a single offering and to execute at a high level across markets.</p><p>During the quarter, U.S. account-based leasing revenue increased 31% from the prior year. Large and sophisticated occupiers are asking CBRE for consultation in workplace design, deep expertise in industry sectors and a full suite of digital capabilities, and they want us to bring it all together with the top brokerage talent in the market.</p><p>No firm in our industry is able to match the scale and capabilities of CBRE's leasing business. As a result, when CBRE competes for new account-based leasing mandates, more often than not, we win that business.</p><p>Now I'd like to welcome Leah Stearns to her first earnings call as our Chief Financial Officer. We're extremely excited about the deep financial and operational background she brings to CBRE. Leah has already had a positive impact, and we know she will be a valued contributor to our senior leadership team.</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS, CFO, CBRE GROUP, INC.: Thank you, Bob. I'm thrilled to join the team at CBRE at such an exciting time in commercial real estate. I can say with confidence that I'm joining a company with incredible momentum and our competitive and financial position appear to be stronger than ever. The evidence of this is clear. Over the last 5 years, CBRE has generated 13% annualized growth in adjusted EBITDA, 18% annualized growth in adjusted EPS and about 70% total shareholder return. This has all been achieved while simultaneously diversifying the business and strengthening the balance sheet.</p><p>These financial results have been supported by favorable secular trends, which we believe provide a solid foundation to the earnings our business generates. It's important to recognize that these catalysts show no signs of fatigue.</p><p>The owners and occupiers of commercial real estate continue to become larger and they're increasingly sophisticated and they want to work with large sophisticated service providers. Within our sector, CBRE has a powerful competitive position to address this customer demand, and I think that's underappreciated. Our group's scale, the breadth of our services we can offer and our ability to invest in digital capabilities are allowing us to pull away from the competition and it's showing up in our financial performance.</p><p>Further, real estate continues to show signs of strength. Institutional capital allocations to real estate continue to rise. Simultaneously, debt costs are declining while underwriting standards, loan-to-value ratios and cap rates all remain largely stable. We see few signs of overbuilding as supply growth is meeting strong occupier demand. Bottom line, given our resilient and diversified business mix and strong balance sheet, CBRE is operating from a position of strength. As a result, we see tremendous opportunities ahead of us. And we'll remain opportunistic as we deploy capital into our business to maximize total shareholder return in the future.</p><p>And with that, let's discuss our financial performance during the second quarter.</p><p>Turning to Slide 5, our Advisory Services segment generated 15% growth in adjusted EBITDA, which was driven by an 11% increase in fee revenue and a 60 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin over the prior year period. Margins in the quarter benefited from both business mix and solid cost discipline as operating expenses rose just 2% on an adjusted basis.</p><p>As Bob noted, leasing within our advisory business was once again particularly strong, increasing 19%. This was paced by the Americas, which generated 70% of our advisory fee revenue and grew 26%. During the quarter, co-working companies comprised about 3% of our Americas advisory leasing revenue across all property types contributing approximately 1 percentage point to growth.</p><p>Outside the Americas, advisory leasing was less robust, declining by 1% in U.S. dollars but increasing 5% in local currency.</p><p>Our combined capital markets business, comprising property sales and commercial mortgage origination, grew by 5% in Q2, up from a slight decline in Q1. Americas property sales increased 8%, reflecting market share gains and an increase in commercial real estate transaction volumes as investors returned to the market after a tumultuous end to 2018.</p><p>Outside the Americas, property sales declined by 8% or 3% in local currency. The decline was primarily due to our residential business in APAC, where fundamentals remained weak. Excluding residential, commercial property sales revenue outside the Americas actually increased by 8% in local currency against a backdrop of generally soft sales volumes.</p><p>Global commercial mortgage origination revenue grew 16% over the prior year and continues to support growth in our loan servicing portfolio. Debt markets globally remained very liquid with credit available from a variety of sources including banks, life insurance companies, debt funds, CMBS and both Fannie and Freddie Mac.</p><p>Turning next to our Global Workplace Solutions segment on Slide 6. Momentum for our outsourcing offering remained strong and results for the quarter were supported by several large new client engagement. In fact in April, we onboarded 100 million square feet of facilities for several clients in a single day, our largest go-live day in history.</p><p>During the quarter, fee revenue increased 14% despite a 5 percentage point headwind from FX.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA increased by over 30% and our GWS adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 180 basis points. Driving the strong performance in GWS was our Americas team, which generates approximately 70% of the segment's adjusted EBITDA and had an outstanding quarter with nearly 24% fee revenue and nearly 48% adjusted EBITDA growth. We expect that demand in GWS will likely be more balanced across our global footprint in the second half of 2019.</p><p>Within GWS, we are further penetrating key sectors like life sciences and retail, the latter of which is being aided by the FacilitySource capabilities we acquired last year. We are seeing particular success with clients that utilize multiple GWS services. In fact, multiservice clients have represented an increasing percentage of our pipeline for sixth consecutive quarter. In Canada, for example, we just won a long-term contract to manage all of their facilities in real estate-related projects for the province of British Columbia, a portfolio spanning 17 million square feet. Along with Ontario, this is the second Canadian province in our portfolio. We were able to unsee a long-term incumbent service provider and prevail over a field of competitors due to our strong track record in Ontario and the strength of our digital technology tool.</p><p>A key part of the client pursuit win was our digital platform and our ability to substantially overhaul and upgrade the province's existing facility's technology to drive operating cost savings, improved reporting and enhanced business performance for our clients.</p><p>Our margin growth in the quarter was supported by handful of discrete items, such as a decrease in health insurance reserves, which contributed approximately 100 basis points to GWS's margin expansion as well as our efforts to manage operating costs, leverage our scale and increase our selectivity in client pursuit. The GWS business has strong momentum and a record pursuit pipeline, which gives us confidence that double-digit fee revenue growth will continue.</p><p>Turning to our Real Estate Investments segment on Slide 7. This segment's business fundamentals remain solid, including progress with our initial investments in Hana, our flexible space offering and our in-process development portfolio, which reached a new record level during the quarter.</p><p>During the quarter, the Real Estate Investments segment saw a $39 million decline in adjusted EBITDA, which was mostly attributable to our development business. We had anticipated this decline given the very strong comparable period and our expectation that the timing of development gains this year will be heavily weighted into the first and fourth quarters.</p><p>This quarter-to-quarter variability in our development business largely goes away when assessing the business over a longer period of time. For example, over the last 5 years, our development business generated nearly $600 million of adjusted EBITDA, while requiring very little capital commitment from CBRE. Based on the quality of our development pipeline and our Trammel Crow Company franchise, we expect even stronger financial performance over the next 5 years assuming market conditions remain supportive and no economic downturn occurs.</p><p>During the quarter, Investment Management performance improved from the prior year with adjusted EBITDA up $4 million or 32% in local currency. This growth is supported by the increase in our assets under management, which are up $5 billion versus the prior year to nearly $107 billion.</p><p>Finally, the launch of Hana, our flexible space solutions business, incurred modest costs, which were consistent with our expectations. We continue to be pleased with the market response to Hana as our landlord clients are keenly interested in flexible space opportunities and the rising demands from occupiers. Further, we are excited about the upcoming opening of our first Hana location, a 67,000 square-foot first-class space at PWC Tower in Dallas.</p><p>Turning to Slide 8, simply put, CBRE is in a solid financial position. Our balance sheet is strong with net leverage of about 0.8 turns of adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2. CBRE remains poised to allocate capital opportunistically with an intense focus on maximizing total shareholder return. Taking into account our planned acquisitions, we expect that we can invest about $1 billion for the remainder of the year, while maintaining net debt at around 1x trailing adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>In light of our performance in the first half and the trajectory of our business, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year to a range of $3.70 to $3.80 per share. The $3.75 midpoint reflects a $0.15 increase from our initial outlook provided in March and a 14% gain over 2018 adjusted earnings per share. If achieved, this would be our 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings growth.</p><p>I'd like to note that we do expect adjusted EPS to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter than in 2018 due to the expected timing of development dispositions. Specifically, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment to approximate the level attained in the second quarter of this year.</p><p>And with that, I will now turn the call over to Bob for his closing remarks.</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Thanks, Leah. As you can see from our revised earnings outlook, we are in a strong strategic position with excellent momentum in our business, particularly in the Americas, where we generate the majority of our revenue in earnings. As important, CBRE is well positioned, thanks to our ongoing investments in people, integrated solutions and technology and our recent reorganization to drive both great client outcomes and continued strong growth.</p><p>Before we conclude, I want to briefly touch on our plans to acquire Telford Homes, which we announced early last month. If approved by Telford's shareholders and government regulators, the Telford transaction will enable us to strategically expand our Trammel Crow Company development business internationally and into a market which is in the early stages of a secular shift toward institutionally owned urban rental housing. Telford's shareholders will vote on our buyout offer on August 6.</p><p>With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Anthony Paolone, JPMorgan.</p><p>ANTHONY PAOLONE, SENIOR ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: My first question is on leasing and the strength there despite a tough comp in 2Q '18. Can you talk a little bit more about what's happening there particularly? And how much of this you think is really market share gains versus the market itself?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Tony, it's both. The market was strong, particularly here in the Americas, and I think we performed quite well. What's going on with our business is, we've built a capability to serve our clients really well when they need account-based services with lots of advisory capability connected across markets both here in the U.S. and around the world. We saw 33% growth in our account-based leasing revenues, very reflective of the machine we've built to serve those clients. And yes, we did benefit from a healthy market circumstance.</p><p>ANTHONY PAOLONE: Okay. And so do you think that this higher level of growth will be present in the second half of the year because the comps remain pretty high?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Yes. Well, we've had 5 straight quarters of 20% leasing growth, so the comps were high this quarter, you already alluded to that at the start of your question. Look, I don't think anybody could expect that kind of continued growth indefinitely, but we just raised our guidance. We think we're going to have a very good second half. And as the prominent users of space in the marketplace continue to buy on an increasingly account-based approach, we think we're going to perform really well into that model. And by the way, we think we're going to perform particularly well when we couple that with our other occupier services in GWS business, Project Management, Facilities Management. All of that is working really well together.</p><p>ANTHONY PAOLONE: Okay. And then second item on capital markets. It seems like there are some mix signals between some of the data and performance there. Can you talk a little bit more about just what's happening on the ground as it relates to investment sales activity and also just mortgage side in light of lower interest rates?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: So Anthony, it's Leah. I'll talk to the capital markets piece first. I guess what we saw happen in the second quarter is that we really believe now it's clear that the decline in the first quarter was a reflection of investors taking a bit of a step back to assess the market in light of the volatility that they saw in Q4 of '18. At this point, we think that given the level of activity and the Americas was strong in Q2, that supports our view that the fundamentals around commercial real estate services remain solidly intact, and so that includes capital allocations to real estate and how they continue to rise; debt costs are declining, to your point; and we're also seeing discipline throughout the industry, that includes the underwriting process as well as valuations. So all in all, we think these fundamentals are very supportive of the attractiveness of real estate, particularly on a relative basis to other asset classes. And so from our perspective, we feel pretty good about where we came out in the second quarter from a capital markets perspective in the Americas. And I think it's actually interesting to note, given the fact that we did see that contraction in Q1, our Advisory segment during that quarter still increased by over 20%. So it just shows the diversification that we've built into that -- into our business and particularly our Advisory segment.</p><p>ANTHONY PAOLONE: Got it. And then last question. If we just think about combined principal business EBITDA for this year for the full year versus '18, any guide posts on that given updated guidance and potential acquisitions and so forth?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: I'd really just say, in terms of the Real Estate Investments segment, we're expecting the seasonality to be quite different from 2018. But all in all, given the fact that we're not updating outlook at a detailed level, we do believe we're tracking ahead of guidance but we do expect that seasonality to be in the first and fourth quarter in 2019 compared to what we saw in '18, which was the second and third quarter strength.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from Jason Green, Evercore ISI.</p><p>JASON DANIEL GREEN, ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a question on the strength of leasing, specifically U.S. being dominated by any specific industry or is it a widespread growth across all industries?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: We are seeing that widespread across most industries. I mean we did see some benefits from recruiting, we saw some M&amp;A. But overall, we did have a really strong diverse set of demand coming to the leasing set.</p><p>JASON DANIEL GREEN: Okay. And then maybe on the Telford acquisition, just as you guys think about acquisitions generally, should we expect more of a focus on growing the business outside of the United States? Or was this just the right opportunity to grow the portfolio in an area that you saw?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: We are not biased U.S. versus Europe versus Asia in where we put our dollars. We have a very clear view as to what we want to do when we do acquire -- or what we want to get done when we acquire companies. We want to buy businesses that add to our capabilities to deliver outcomes for clients. We're not about bulking up. So if you look last year, for instance, in that FacilitySource acquisition, which we think was one of the really good ones we've done, it gave us capability to serve distributed outsourcing clients in retail, branch banks, et cetera. Telford gave us the ability to do something to leverage our Trammell Crow brand beyond the United States, but in an arena where we think there's going to be real secular growth, something different, something better than we've done before.</p><p>Another thing we're looking for when we do acquisitions is businesses that we think, when we bring them on to our platform, we can do more with them than they were able to do themselves and we can do more with them than our competitors can do if they were to buy them. That's what allows us to pay for acquisitions, that's what allows them to be accretive. So that's our model, and it's not geographically biased.</p><p>JASON DANIEL GREEN: Got it. And then last one for me, you mentioned the percentage of clients utilizing multiple GWS services has increased. What is that percentage today? And where do you think ultimately that could be?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: So we're seeing the pipeline certainly increase. We've seen 6 consecutive quarters of our pipeline attributable to clients who are looking for, what we call, 3x, all 3 lines of business or full service. And so today, we're actually at nearly 30% of our current client base using that level.</p><p>JASON DANIEL GREEN: And long term, kind of, where you guys think that level could be?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Certainly, we're seeing a pickup in demand as indicated from the 6 consecutive quarters of increase through our pipeline. I think it just goes to show that there is a opportunity for us to expand client services within GWS, not just from a service line but also geographically. And so when we take on a new client through our pursuit, sometimes it starts out on a regional basis, and we're able to grow that organically as we provide services both across their real estate footprint, both from geographic perspective as well as a service line.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from Josh Lamers, William Blair.</p><p>JOSHUA KAPLER LAMERS, ASSOCIATE, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just want to follow up actually with Anthony's -- one of Anthony's question. Does the Fed's announcement yesterday in your opinion create somewhat of a tailwind for the capital markets business? Or does this end up causing a bit of a more pause and some uncertainty going forward?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: So I think just going back to my comments around the fundamentals of commercial real estate, I mean, we see those as really what's driving the opportunities within our capital markets business. And so -- and I would point more to just overall enthusiasm and the relative value opportunity for real estate as it presents itself today for investors as opposed to more of the macro trends that you're alluding to.</p><p>JOSHUA KAPLER LAMERS: Got it. Okay. And then it has been brought up a number of times, but could you touch on the advisory personnel initiative that was started a few years ago? Just wondering essentially how many are in that role now globally today? And if you could expand a bit more on how much of an effect that's having you -- having on you guys winning these larger national contracts?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Josh, I want to ask for clarity, are you talking about broker recruiting or you talking about the professionals we have that provide advisory capability to support our transactional capability?</p><p>JOSHUA KAPLER LAMERS: Yes. Yes. The latter, the advisory personnel that are...</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: The latter. We have over 1,000 -- yes. We have invested heavily in that capability not just in terms of that advisory capability but in terms of technology digital capability to support, and we have over 1,000 people today around the world as part of what we call our Advisory and Transaction Services team supporting occupiers that are advisory-oriented as opposed to transaction oriented. And of course, we put them on teams with transaction professionals and our transaction -- base of great transaction professionals is continuing to grow through that recruiting effort. That's the other side of the equation.</p><p>JOSHUA KAPLER LAMERS: Okay. Right. And then I guess last one for me just given the recent election in the U.K., curious to get your outlook for expected activity in the U.K., and whether it's sort of a downturn has already phased through and now there's a bit more certainty? Or whether this gives a reason for another pause in activity in the U.K. in the upcoming quarters?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Well, we've kind of given up on trying to prognosticate what Brexit means. It's just been a seesaw ride for 3 years. But what I will tell you is, in the second quarter, both our leasing and our capital markets business grew in the U.K. It's a big important business for us but yet it's less than 10% of our company. And one thing that I think we all need to keep in mind is that London is going to be, no matter what happens, one of the most important property markets in the world on an enduring basis. There's just no doubt about that. And so we expect to see some choppiness. We expect to see company stand on the sideline both in leasing and capital markets a bit until it all sorts out. But we don't think it's going to have a big impact on our company's overall performance. And we are going to continue to have a prominent and very capable offering there, and we think that's a good thing.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from Jason Weaver, Compass Point.</p><p>JASON PRICE WEAVER, MD &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, COMPASS POINT RESEARCH &amp; TRADING, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just another follow up on Anthony's question on capital markets. Can you comment on the pace of America's property sales transactions within the quarter, whether that was, sort of, level or more backloaded?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: It certainly was up. In terms of the pace, it was back-end loaded.</p><p>JASON PRICE WEAVER: Okay. And then can you give us some more clarity into the GWS wins you've seen, either year-to-date or within the last 12 months, what the service revenue mix looks like? Whether that's facility management or project development services driven?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Sure. And maybe just to touch on GWS for a second. I mean I think, we see broad-based strength in that business, not just from the service lines, but also given that we're providing that service across broad geographies. And so as a result, I think while FM is our largest part of that business, transactions were up significantly year-over-year. And so that's a great opportunity for us to show that we're leveraging the strength between GWS and our transactions team. But maybe just to give you a little bit more color on GWS. We're seeing an expansion of not just geographies and lines of business but, as I mentioned earlier, there's a clear expansion of our customer relationships. And now we have about half of our growth coming from those existing clients, and that is allowing us to expand, obviously, the services that we provide. And that is supported by increasing strong NPS scores around customer satisfaction.</p><p>I think it also goes to show that we have capabilities that are differentiated, and that we are investing in technology that brings unparalleled service to our customers and that includes FacilitySource, and it also includes capabilities like our Data Center Solutions business. So I think those set us apart from the competition. It's resulting in the record client pursuit pipeline that I talked to before as well as that 6 consecutive quarters of increased multiple service contract as a percent of the pursuit pipeline.</p><p>So all in all, we're really pleased with how GWS performed for the quarter, and it's allowing us to become more selective in our pursuits. We're aligning our interests with our clients, and that's allowing us to develop deeper capabilities. And I think long term, that's going to lead to stronger profitability of that segment and really unmatched outcomes that we're providing to our clients that they cannot find elsewhere.</p><p>JASON PRICE WEAVER: Okay. And just finally, I think you touched on it in your prepared remarks, but can you give us some kind of idea into what your forward visibility is on the pipeline for future development disposition?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: I'm sorry, can you repeat that question?</p><p>JASON PRICE WEAVER: I'm just looking for some sort of commentary on what your visibility is for future dispositions in Development Services activity?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Oh, sure. In terms of -- and you're talking about 2019, in particular?</p><p>JASON PRICE WEAVER: Yes. Yes.</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Okay. Yes. No, I think that, that component of our business we do expect to be fourth quarter-weighted. And given the strengths last year, that will certainly be an easier comp than the third quarter.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from Jade Rahmani, KBW.</p><p>JADE JOSEPH RAHMANI, DIRECTOR, KEEFE, BRUYETTE, &amp; WOODS, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: In terms of the capital available for investment through the rest of the year, how would you look at prioritizing that?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Yes. And so in terms of the capital we have available, we do believe that we have a very strong pipeline in terms of opportunities. Certainly, we look at M&amp;A, and then we consider our share repurchase program. We'll be disciplined in our approach to both of those. And we've bought back about $45 million of shares this year, and we clearly have some large M&amp;A on our plate to absorb in the second half. But I think it was just important to demonstrate the scale of the capacity that we have and the strength of our balance sheet to be able to be opportunistic to the extent that we find unique opportunities in the market, again, both from an M&amp;A as well as a share repurchase perspective.</p><p>JADE JOSEPH RAHMANI: Turning to market share, do you have an estimate of CBRE's current market share in both -- in each of capital markets and leasing? And how that compared with a year ago?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: We think our market share went up in both. It's very hard to get good numbers. As you know, Jade, there's just not good third-party numbers around the world for the business we're in for either capital markets or for leasing, especially for leasing. But we believe based on our own research, and we have very extensive research and based on our CA data that's available that we took significant market share around the world in capital markets. And we think we took market share around the world in leasing. There's less data available. But it's very, very hard to get good third-party data on what that market share is.</p><p>JADE JOSEPH RAHMANI: In terms of the capital markets outlook, could you talk to maybe give some metrics around the health of the environment? In the past, you've commented on a number of bidders, for example, time lines for deals to close and the potential bid gap that's been commented in the market.</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: So I would just say in terms of the capital markets environment in the Americas, in particular, we did see velocity increase, so the pace of transactions pick up. I don't have specifics to the statistics that you're pointing to from prior quarters. But all in all, we think that we're seeing strong dynamics and trends around investors' appetite within the capital markets business. We did see the average marketing time fall in the second quarter. So that goes to my velocity comment that it's picking up.</p><p>JADE JOSEPH RAHMANI: And on the leasing front, can you comment on what percentage of leasing growth was driven by the tech sector and perhaps also new construction deliveries? I think 2019 is anticipated to be a peak in terms of new office completions.</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Yes. For the last few years, the tech sector has contributed about 20% of our leasing. In the second quarter this year, it was up from that. It was a little over 30%. And it goes to a point we talked about earlier that tech companies, these big tech companies are buying leasing services on an account basis. They are more inclined that way than the traditional big leasing companies. But we also think the second quarter was a bit anomalistic. We don't have any reason to believe that over an extended period of time that, that things are going to shift meaningfully away from where we've been historically or be like the second quarter where tech was particularly strong though in the second quarter.</p><p>JADE JOSEPH RAHMANI: And so that 30% this quarter versus historically 20% that would suggest about 50% of the growth was from tech?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: I don't know that 50% of the growth was from tech. Those statistics don't play out exactly the way you think they should in terms of growth.</p><p>JADE JOSEPH RAHMANI: Okay. In terms of the restructuring, and its impact on margins, can you comment on what you think the main drivers of that improved efficiency are?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Sure. I think the -- one of the key components of the reorg was to remove as much redundancy as possible throughout the management layer of the organization. And so we're seeing that happen, and it's playing out in terms of supporting that stronger operating leverage for the business. In addition, we have put leadership roles in place, like our COO, who are clearly focused and directly focused on cost reductions and making sure that our business is very focused on transparency and accountability across the organization. And so we believe that those specific steps that were carried out through the reorg are having direct impacts on our margins today and will continue.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Mitch Germain, JMP Securities.</p><p>MITCHELL BRADLEY GERMAIN, MD AND SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Telford, is this a model that you think can be replicated outside of the U.K?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Mitch, when you say replicated, in other words, can we buy businesses like this outside of the U.K?</p><p>MITCHELL BRADLEY GERMAIN: Can you take the Telford business and expand it across other countries and regions?</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Well, we'll have to see when we bring that business on board and integrate it. But we believe that business model plays very well to trends across Europe in terms of a movement toward institutionally owned multi-tenant housing, professionally managed where the continent and the U.K. are behind the U.S. in that regard. So it may be an opportunity. But our -- again, we got to wait and get this thing done, and our focus is getting through next week when the shareholders vote, and we get approval from regulatory authorities.</p><p>MITCHELL BRADLEY GERMAIN: Great. And then maybe just circling back to FacilitySource, obviously, a deal that you closed last year, maybe based on what your underwriting was in terms of how it was going to integrate, and I know that you're making a pretty big capital investment. How has the performance been there versus what your expectations were?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Yes. We're seeing really nice performance coming out of that business. It's tracking in line with our underwriting, and we think we're seeing really strong momentum. I spoke about that in my prepared remarks, particularly around the retail segment. So our clients are excited about the expanded capability, and we believe it's helping us win new business. It's helping us provide additional services to our customers, and I think that certainly goes to those key trends that I've reiterated around GWS.</p><p>MITCHELL BRADLEY GERMAIN: Great. Last one for me. Are there any specific -- I guess, back in March when you laid out guidance, you provided some specific assumptions and clearly you're tracking ahead. But maybe just provide some perspective, what specifically is changed versus kind of what your original assumptions were?</p><p>LEAH C. STEARNS: Sure. I think that's just an indication or an acknowledgment of the strength we've seen in the business in the first half of the year. We're not updating outlook to the level that we provided in March, but the key drivers of our confidence behind the $0.15 increase, so really the fact that our segments are tracking ahead of our expectations and that we're seeing really strong margin growth in Advisory and GWS. So given the fact that from an Advisory perspective, we're seeing leasing continue to be the standout. We continue to expect to see strength across our segment line.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call back over to Bob Sulentic for closing remarks.</p><p>ROBERT E. SULENTIC: Well, thanks, everyone, for being with us, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of the third quarter.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes today's conference.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC.: Thank you, operator. We welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments before we open the call to Q&amp;A.</p><p>Results for the second quarter of 2019 exceeded our expectations with core FFO per share growing 6.1% compared to the second quarter of 2018. We are pleased to raise our full year core FFO guidance by $0.20 at the midpoint, which is attributable to strong operations and improving cost of capital and solid execution from the Essex team. Angela will provide more details about the quarter and the increase to our full year guidance in her remarks.</p><p>2019 is playing out mostly as expected, with market rents for the Essex metros remaining unchanged at 3.1% as detailed on S-16 of the supplemental. Generally, the tech markets continue to outperform, led by San Francisco and Seattle, while Southern California has lagged expectation.</p><p>Looking at job growth on Page S-16, San Francisco's estimated job growth was revised upward from 1.7% to 2.6% pushing its estimated 2019 rent growth to 3.5%.</p><p>As noted last quarter, Southern California job growth had a slow start to the year and has since experienced a modest acceleration.</p><p>June trailing 3-month job growth in Southern California was 1.3% equal to our forecast on Page S-16. We will briefly comment on several indicators that support our expectation for continued job growth and housing demand, all of which are consistent with our belief that the West Coast vibrant economies remain well positioned for future growth.</p><p>Beginning with office development, which continues to perform at a healthy pace and is required for job growth. For the nation, under construction office properties represent 2.1% of existing office stock. Within the Essex footprint all counties, except Orange and Ventura, are producing new office space at a greater pace than the national average.</p><p>The Bay Area leads the West Coast in office development with over 16 million square feet or 4.9% of stock currently under construction.</p><p>In Seattle, nearly 5 million square feet of office was under production or 3.3% of stock, not including the planned expansion of the Microsoft campus with an estimated 3 million square feet of office space. We also track the job openings at the top 10 public tech companies, all of which are headquartered in an Essex market.</p><p>As of June 30, these job openings were up 19% year-over-year and remain near all-time high since we began tracking the data several years ago.</p><p>It's worth note mentioning that Amazon continues to actively hire in Washington state, where it has approximately 11,500 job openings.</p><p>Venture capital financing remains at record levels in the Bay Area this past year, with about $60 billion committed and the Essex markets accounted for 62% of all U.S. venture capital funding. San Francisco led all U.S. markets in VC funding the past year with almost $42 billion invested followed by Silicon Valley with almost $19 billion invested, the highest levels recorded over the past 20 years.</p><p>Unparalleled access to skilled workers and growth capital continued to attract entrepreneurs to the West Coast. Recent IPOs of Uber, Lyft, Slack and Pinterest should catalyze growth giving greater access to capital and improved liquidity. They join other publicly traded tech companies, many of which continue to expand in the Bay Area.</p><p>Google, for example, was actively buying or leasing additional office space in San Francisco and the Silicon Valley communities of Mountain View, Sunnyvale and San Jose.</p><p>In San Mateo County, Facebook and YouTube expanded to San Bruno, Burlingame and Menlo Park. We believe that a stronger IPO market will likely drive other long-term benefits to the local economies. By one estimate, several recent IPOs should have created 6,000 millionaires, which will ultimately unlock previously illiquid equity positions. At some point, some of that wealth will likely be redeployed, which will increase consumption and set the stage for new startups down the road.</p><p>A strong labor market, shortages in skilled workers and low unemployment rates continue to push incomes higher. Essex weighted average unemployment rate was 2.9% as of May, and the median household income grew an average of 5.3% in the second quarter. With market rents growing in the 3% range, rental affordability continues to improve in all of our markets.</p><p>Turning briefly to apartment supply, our delay-adjusted estimate of around 36,000 apartment deliveries in the Essex markets in 2019 has not changed, and we expect a similar level of deliveries in 2020, albeit with some meaningful regional variation.</p><p>Turning to the investment markets, our outlook is much improved relative to conditions experienced in 2018. Significantly lower interest rates and strong equity markets have substantially improved our cost of capital. In 2018, we were a net seller of apartments using the proceeds to reinvest in development, preferred equity and to fund stock repurchases. We are now mostly focused on acquisitions and preferred equity investments. We are pleased to announce another accretive acquisition this quarter, which was a high-quality property in a market we know well.</p><p>At this point, we hope to exceed the high end of our acquisition guidance range of $400 million. Overall, market conditions for acquisition have not changed much this year despite the dramatic reduction in interest rates. Apartment buyers continue to target value-add opportunities, which results in greater competition for these deals and leads to compression in cap rate spreads between value-add in core properties. Even newer properties are being marketed with a claim of a value-add component. In this environment, we remain focused on our disciplined underwriting process, with market selection and timing our primary concern. Our disposition activity on the other hand will likely end up below the low end of our $300 million to $500 million guidance range, given our improved cost of capital.</p><p>Finally, we note that shortages in the construction labor force continue to cause development delays, both in the Essex pipeline and more broadly. As noted on our prior calls, the combination of long entitlement processes in the coastal markets at a time when construction costs are growing significantly faster than NOI compresses development yields. For these reasons, we continued to believe that preferred equity investments in apartment development deals generally offer superior risk-adjusted returns over direct development.</p><p>That concludes my comments. Overall, we are very pleased with our company's progress year-to-date and wish to thank all the Essex employees for their hard work.</p><p>I'll now turn the call over to John.</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART, SENIOR EVP OF ASSET MANAGEMENT, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC.: Thank you, Mike. We are starting the second half of the year with strong momentum, achieving 3.5% revenue growth in the second quarter. Financial occupancy for the same-store portfolio was 96.6%, 10 basis points below the prior year's period and 30 basis points less than the first quarter, while market rents were up in Q2 an average of 3.4% over the prior year's period setting us in a favorable position as we lock down peak market rents.</p><p>Our turnover in Q2 2019 was 46.4% on a trailing 12-month basis, which is down 3.2% in the comparable period ending Q2 2018. Although there are some pockets of weakness as supply enters the local market offering large concessions, the West Coast markets overall are performing above our original expectations, largely driven by better employment growth in the Bay Area. As a result, we are raising our same-store gross revenue guidance for the full year by 25 basis points to a midpoint of 3.3%.</p><p>I'll now -- I'll note that third-party economic research estimates for Essex market rent growth continues to be inaccurate. For example, one vendor stated that our June 2019 rents were up only 40 basis points over the prior year when in reality, they were up 3.8%. Strategically, we will continue to favor achieving market rents over higher occupancy, taking advantage of the strong market conditions to lock-in higher rents.</p><p>Regarding new multifamily supply, pace of deliveries in Essex markets remained in line with the delay-adjusted forecast we introduced last fall, and we're maintaining our estimate of roughly 36,000 apartment units this year, which is consistent with 2018 volume. Our estimates remain below third-party projections, but we expect additional construction delays in the back half of the year to bring third-party figures down closer to our forecast.</p><p>Construction remains concentrated in a handful of urban core submarkets, led this year by downtown -- by the downtowns of Los Angeles and Oakland. Deliveries also remain elevated in Seattle, but strong job growth is supporting the rapid absorption of new units, and we are encouraged that the pace of new deliveries in Seattle is poised to decelerate in 2020.</p><p>Beyond 2020, we would highlight that new multifamily permits in the Essex market are down 11% over the past year on a trailing 12-month basis, suggesting that the near-term pace of deliveries represents a plateau followed by a gradual deceleration of new supply growth.</p><p>Moving on to a market update. In Seattle, employment growth continues to outpace the U.S. and other major East Coast markets posting year-over-year growth of 2.9% for the second quarter of 2019. Amazon job openings remain at peak levels, while office absorption soared in the second quarter as large deals were delivered and occupied. Each of our 4 submarkets: north, south, Seattle CBD and east side performed well, growing revenues between 3.2% and 4.5%.</p><p>Moving down to Northern California. Job growth in the San Francisco Bay Area averaged 2.5% year-over-year in Q2, led by San Francisco at 3.7% growth. As Mike mentioned, the continued expansion in the Bay Area is evident in the recent IPOs that sustained highs in VC funding.</p><p>In the second quarter, we started 2 lease-ups: Mylo a 476-unit property in Santa Clara is now 22% preleased offering 1 month free rent. Station Park Green Phase 2 with 199 units in San Mateo is 24% leased, offering concessions up to 6 weeks.</p><p>Last, we started preleasing 500 Folsom with 537 units in downtown San Francisco scheduled for initial occupancy in the third quarter.</p><p>Year-over-year same-store revenue growth in the second quarter was strong on the Peninsula submarkets with San Francisco achieving 5.9%, San Mateo achieving 4.4% followed by San Jose at 3.9% and Fremont with 3.6%.</p><p>San Ramon and open CBD came in at 2.4% and 2% growth, respectively, compared to the prior year's quarter.</p><p>Continuing South. Southern California continues to perform at the lower end of our market, largely due to lower employment growth. The region and L.A. County each achieved 1.3% year-over-year job growth, which is in line with our jobs forecast on Page S-16. Revenue growth in Q2 was led by Woodland Hills with 5.2%, Long Beach with 4.7%, West L.A. at 4.4% and Tri-Cities with 2.1%. Our L.A. CBD revenues were down 2.2% due to the impacts of the supply with downtown lease-ups offering 6 to 8 weeks free rent plus other incentives, such as free parking.</p><p>In Orange County, jobs in the second quarter ticked up to 1.2% year-over-year. Revenue growth in North Orange submarket achieved 3.3% growth, while the South Orange submarket achieved 1.8% growth over the prior year's quarter.</p><p>Finally, in San Diego, year-over-year job growth in the second quarter was 1.6%, 10 basis points higher than the U.S. The Oceanside submarket continues to lead the San Diego market in year-over-year revenues achieving 4.8% growth in Q2 followed by North City and Chula Vista submarkets with 3.6% and 2.6% growth, respectively. Currently, our portfolio is at 96.2% occupancy and our availability 30 days out is 5.2%.</p><p>Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC.: Thank you, John. I'll start with a brief review of our second quarter results then focus on the increase to our full year guidance. Beginning with the second quarter performance, I'm pleased to report that we have achieved a core FFO per share of $3.33, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 6.1%. This result exceeded the high end of our guidance and represents an $0.11 beat to the midpoint. The key components of this outperformance are as follows: $0.03 from same-property revenue; $0.03 from lower interest expense, non-same-store revenue and other miscellaneous items; and $0.05 from property tax savings and refunds, primarily from lower Seattle millage rates for 2019. This is contrary to our experience from the past several years where our Seattle property tax increase has been in the mid-double digits range.</p><p>Favorable year-to-date results enabled us to increase the midpoint of our same-property revenues by 25 basis points, while the benefit from tax savings and refunds enabled us to lower the midpoint of our same-property expenses by 80 points -- 80 basis points. The combination of these revisions result in a full year same-property NOI growth of 3.7% at the midpoint, which is 65 basis points higher than our initial outlook and near the high end of our original guidance range.</p><p>In addition, we are raising our core FFO per share guidance for the second time this year. For the full year, we are raising core FFO per share by $0.20 to $13.28 at the midpoint. Approximately $0.13 of this raise relate to improved NOI expectations and the remaining $0.07 come from a combination of lower interest expense, acquisitions and preferred equity investments made to date. On to preferred equity investments. We have exceeded the high end of our guidance of $100 million, and this is primarily a result of larger deal size in this year's transaction. Lastly, onto the balance sheet.</p><p>In the second half of the year, we have around $100 million of debt maturities, and we have the ability to prepay $290 million of debt, which matures in 2020 without incurring any prepayment penalty. We will continue to be opportunistic as we consider our refinancing alternatives to optimize our cost of capital. Currently, we have approximately $1 billion available to us in our $1.2 billion lines of credit and our leverage level remains conservative at 5.5x debt to EBITDA.</p><p>I will now turn the call back to the operator for Q&amp;A.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>Our next question comes from the line of Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank.</p><p>TRENT NATHAN TRUJILLO, ANALYST, SCOTIABANK GLOBAL BANKING AND MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: So the same-store revenue guidance range was very nice to see. You brought up the low end of the range. So Mike, with the positive market conditions you cited, how much consideration did you give to adjusting the top end of the range?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: I'll start with that and then maybe Angela will have a comment. Obviously, we hit the top end of the range in Northern California, but we were pretty close to the midpoint or a little bit above the midpoint in the other markets, and so we thought there was plenty of room within the range, so we didn't need to move it. We cannot move rents super quickly because we have to turn the leases. And in the second half of the year, we turned fewer leases than we do in the first half of the year, so I think the guidance range is appropriate where it is now. Angela, do you have anything to add?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: We had guided to a tougher first half and a lighter second half originally with the midpoint at 3. And given where the first half came in, certainly, we are comfortable with where our guidance range is at this point. But having said that, keep in mind that the second half now will contemplate heavier supply, and so in that environment, it didn't make sense for us to raise the high end of the guidance range.</p><p>TRENT NATHAN TRUJILLO: Okay. I appreciate the commentary there. John, you mentioned turnover keeps improving on a year-over-year basis? How long is that sustainable and is there a level of turnover at which point you say you'll start implementing larger wage increases?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Well, as far as the rental increases, we are very focused on our customers being fair and -- in their entire experience, which of course, includes what they pay. So we typically will not raise rents above the marketplace. That's effectively set in the marketplace. As far as how low can turnover go, I would love to see it continue to go lower. I think what's driving the lower turnover at this point in time are a combination of factors, one of them being the fact that our assets are well located, of course, they always have been. So that hasn't changed but what does change is the quality of life in many of the metros. The traffic continues to increase and as it increases, it makes our assets better relatively than other options. So that is one angle.</p><p>Another angle is we continue to focus on customer experience at the site, and we do have room to continue to improve that. We will continue to work on making all of our customers have the best experience possible. And finally, affordability overall, in all of our markets continues to improve, as incomes grows significantly faster than rents and so it's putting a lot less pressure on people to move for financial reasons, whether it's further away from their jobs or it's other areas. So I do think there's some continued room to run. I think it works best for both our customers and ourselves to have lower turnover. So we're pretty pleased with it.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.</p><p>NICHOLAS GREGORY JOSEPH, DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It sounds as if we're seeing more attractive acquisition opportunities than we've seen versus the recent past. You mentioned you may exceed the high end of acquisition guidance. So how large is the acquisition pipeline today?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Nick, it's Mike. The acquisition pipeline is - it is pretty decent, I would say that the fact that we're going to exceed the high end of the range is more a function of not having a real aggressive high end of the range given conditions at the beginning of the year, which we had a much higher cost to capital. And as we fast-forward to today, interest rates have declined pretty dramatically, and there's a lot more interest in property. So I think it's more a function of there's enough deals out there and our pipeline is a few hundred million, but there's no guarantee we're going to close all or even some of those deals. But we are much more in the hunt this year. Again, if you go back to last year, we were unable -- to make the numbers work, we were selling property. We're a net seller of property. Selling property at 8th &amp; Hope in downtown L.A., for example, for a sub-4 cap rate and buying stock back, the conditions are so much different. So we are back much more interested in the acquisition market.</p><p>NICHOLAS GREGORY JOSEPH: And then just maybe on the funding side. Historically, you've been pretty active on issuing or repurchasing shares, it makes sense. Looks like for most of the second quarter you are trading above consensus NAV, so given that acquisition pipeline and kind of, say, uses for net capital, so I think you're issuing the ATM equities in the second quarter?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Angela will have an answer to this, but I'll start. I mean the simple answer is, that we're -- debt to market cap is about 22%. So we just don't need to deleverage the balance sheet. In fact, we don't have any interest at all in deleveraging the balance sheet further. And we feel like we've managed it to where we want to be sort of late in a economic cycle. And so we're perfectly comfortable with where it is now and in fact could increase leverage a little bit. Not that we're necessarily planning to do that, but we feel comfortable doing that. Angela, do you want to add to that?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: Sure thing. Nick, in terms of the equity issuance activities, if you look at our acquisitions to date, we really didn't have a need because that was acquired via a down structure and the preferred equity investments, they fund over time inevitably and so the funding need is very small. But generally speaking, in addition to Mike's comment on our leverage level, we do vote to match fund our investments relative to the cost of capital to optimize that yield. And so even though our stock may, at any given point in time, be trading at above consensus NAV, we will still look for ways to make sure that, that funding is the most attractive. And we have, as you know, several alternatives to how we can fund an investment. And so it may or may not be the common equity issuance as the first thing.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.</p><p>AUSTIN TODD WURSCHMIDT, VP, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Mike, you mentioned you view preferred equity today as a more attractive risk-adjusted return versus development, so I'm just curious what it would take for you to restart the development pipeline? Or what spread maybe you'd need between cap rates to justify the risks you see today?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, Austin, it's a good question. And again, the driving dynamic there is that construction costs are growing faster than rents, in general, and with entitlement processes in California stretching out 3 to 5 years in many cases, you end up in a potential for lower yields on development than you otherwise have. I contrast that with the preferred equity where we're coming in just before the start of construction. So that all of that predevelopment period is in the past, and we're coming in starting construction in the next day. And so the risk-reward equation is much different.</p><p>Having said that, we looked at a lot of development transactions, and so it's not for not trying to make them work. We just have been pretty selective given where we are -- our perception where we are in the economic cycle and the risk-reward equation. And to get us interested in direct development, we would like to see between 100 to 150 basis point cap rate premium to stabilize yields, which were A quality property, let's say, around 4% right now. So we'll be looking for that, and again, looking at the risk profile of what the entitlement process looks like, how long it's going to be and some of those other considerations in terms of our direct development appetite.</p><p>AUSTIN TODD WURSCHMIDT: Okay. Appreciate the thoughts there. And then just second for me. You discussed 2020 supply is going to be -- or is projected at this point to be at similar level as 2019, but you did mention there's some variations in where that supply is concentrated. Could you just give us a little more detail of some of the moving parts by region?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Sure, of course. Our research team goes and drives all -- most of these sites, and so we have really good intelligence. And as John mentioned, some of the data vendors have much different numbers for multifamily supply projections, and we think our numbers have proven pretty accurate. So really kudos to the economic research team for that. But -- so as you point out, yes, we have about 36,000 units in 2019 and about the same number in 2020. The big movers are number one, in Orange County, which goes down about 40%. And actually, San Jose goes up about 40%. It's not a tremendous number. Units goes from 2,700 units to 3,800 units. And Oakland will go up about that same percentage, and then we will -- and then Seattle goes down about 1/3 2,900 units. So those are the driving forces and again, it nets out to about 0 increase.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Shirley Wu with Bank of America.</p><p>SHIRLEY WU, RESEARCH ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: So John, earlier in your call you -- and even previously, you mentioned that this year you've been emphasizing more of a rate growth drive rather than occupancy and occupancy actually was down 10 basis points compared to what you would have imagined with the 20 basis points you mentioned earlier this year. So I was wondering what's going on there in terms of the strong demand that you're seeing? And is that going to continue into the rest of the year? Or do you just continue to expect that occupancy to come down to that 20 basis points that you mentioned previously?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Sure. So the simple answer is yes for the year I expect it to tick down 20 basis points to somewhere it was last year but within that a little bit more detail. So yes, as I've mentioned earlier, the supply picture, there's more supply that is coming onto the market in the second half. It's about an increase of about 25%. And it is my expectation because seasonally, demand goes down just a normal aspect of our market. So as the supply increases and demand slightly decreases just because of seasonal factors, I think there'll be an increase in concessions and that will cause us, at the end of the day, to compete harder by either offering concessions at some of the stabilized assets or increasing what we're doing or allowing some things to go vacant longer. At the end of the day, I expect that there'll just be a little bit more pressure. And that's part of the answer as to why we increased guidance where we did, and we're comfortable with it.</p><p>SHIRLEY WU: Great. And moving on to the CapEx side, I noticed that in 2Q it was slightly higher than your usual run rate and I was wondering if that -- if I can get a little bit more color and if that was a onetime thing and how we should expect CapEx to trend for the rest of the year?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Sure. Yes, the original guidance anticipated an increase to -- in the 1,600-unit range and I expect that to be closer to a run rate than where we were. There is numerous factors that have -- that drive this. The same factors that drive the increase in development cost that we talk about on a regular basis: increased labor and materials cost. So that's the big factor and then, of course, some of the newer buildings with the systems and other things that we have that we bought and built, they also typically run higher in CapEx as on a per-unit basis, not a percentage, but a per-unit basis.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.</p><p>RICHARD ALLEN HIGHTOWER, MD &amp; RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I've got a two-parter on affordability here. So I heard the stat, Mike that you put out in terms of affordability in rent growth and income growth. I'm wondering if you're actually seeing affordability improve empirically in terms of the new leases that you're signing? If you're noticing that in sort of the screening mechanism? And then separately from that, we've started to see home values and home prices in the Bay Area maybe roll over a little bit, maybe in other West Coast markets as well. Is there any readthrough on affordability related to that or is that sort of a separate issue?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. Those are all great questions. It's hard to get down to a very granular level on this affordability issue. Yes, we've been tracking this for the better part of 30 years now. And it's one of those market indicators, they are kind of bigger-picture indicators that we know is really important. And by that, I would say, let me give you a couple of statistics. So between 2010 and 2015, we had 20% higher rent growth versus household income growth. So we had rent growth that dramatically exceeded household income growth, and I think that caused some of the concerns that we've had, and we've been talking about this affordability issue for the last couple of years largely because of that, that statistic. And then from -- if I look at it from 2010 to now that 20% higher rent growth and household incomes is now 13%. So we've actually moved the needle pretty significantly as it relates to that rent-to-income ratio. So I think that is incredibly important and I think it's one of the things that we would put on the top couple of considerations for these markets.</p><p>We have grown rents very substantially over long periods of time. I think between 2012 to 2017 our same-store revenue has gone up by about -- by an average of 7% per year. So that's a lot of growth and as we know, incomes were pretty stagnant coming out of the financial crisis. And so we, again, think that is a really important issue.</p><p>As it relates to home prices, which as you point out, I think they are down 6% in San Jose and up about 3% in San Francisco and everything else -- all of our other metrics are between those 2 numbers. And I guess what I would say is the year before was exactly the opposite, we had exceptional home price growth, and I think there's a lagging indicator here with respect to interest rates. So I don't think you have seen home prices recover given pretty significantly lower interest rates. So I would expect these home price numbers to get better from this point on just given mortgage rates.</p><p>RICHARD ALLEN HIGHTOWER: Okay. I think that's helpful color. My second one here maybe is a follow-on topic. You care to opine at this point in the calendar on the Rental Affordability Act that is, I think, currently gathering signatures as far as the ballot initiative for next year?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. We keep track of it. And for those that don't know what that is, it's essentially the industry is calling it Prop. 10 2.0, and where there's a potential for a ballot proposition that would amend Costa-Hawkins in -- on the 2020 ballot, and there's been a certain amount of money that has being contributed by Michael Weinstein to support a signature-gathering effort. It's, I think, too early to tell exactly where that's going, Rich. We obviously track it pretty carefully, and we kept our entity California's for Responsible Housing alive and well and organized in case of this. So we'll wait and see what happens and because there's also the Assembly Bill 1482, which is the state-wide rent control law, which started out as an anti-gouging type of proposal, and it's currently in the Senate. And it would cap rents at CPI plus 7, at least that's the current proposal. Again, it's in the Senate, it could still be modified from here.</p><p>But I think that, that is pretty indicative of a better balance with respect to the discussion on housing on the need for housing in California, again, going back to the governor's campaign, campaigning on producing 3.5 million homes in California by 2025. That's about 600,000 a year. By way of background, we produced about 80,000 a year for the last 10 years on average. And so he has recognized the need for more housing and at the same time, trying to balance that with the protection of the tenant base as well. So think it's a more balance discussion. And I think that we will have to see where these things come. You're going to see action on AB 1482 long before you see -- get an update on what might happen with respect to Prop. 10 2.0.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR REIT ANALYST, SANDLER O'NEILL + PARTNERS, L.P., RESEARCH DIVISION: Mike, maybe just following up that last question on the whole rent control and discussion on California, are you seeing any seepage of what happened here in New York where the restrictions in -- the regulation that was passed when they renewed rent control are still onerous but it actually discourages landlords and housing. Are you seeing any of that creep into the California political landscape where California wouldn't want to be outmaneuvered by New York? Or is it -- or is Sacramento is sort of being led by Governor Newsom that wants to promote housing and is more cognizant of factors or legislation that would inhibit that?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: It's a good question, Alex, and thank you for that. I guess in New York, my perception is that all happened very suddenly. And there was a proposal and it was passed almost before people could have time to properly react to it and understand the unintended consequences of it. Whereas, I think it's different in California because we've had this dialogue going back to the Prop. 10 discussion a year ago. And in so doing, this dialogue of -- regarding rent control in general has been ongoing. And again, this is why I think the governor, his comments are so important noting -- another thing he noted was that there's a perverse incentive not to produce housing in California for a variety of reasons. And again, he's recognizing the need for balance in that equation. And so I think we have a better discussion here, and I think that it's been fought through at a greater level than probably it has in some of the other states around the countries.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB: Okay. And then moving to Seattle or actually Bellevue, specifically, with all the investment that Amazon is doing in Bellevue and focusing their office development there, are you guys sort of reassessing how you want to play the Seattle market? Do you think that we would see you guys do more investment in Bellevue, or maybe your existing footprint, you're happy with where it is based on the growth that Amazon is looking at for Bellevue?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: It all depends on yields and risk. We love Bellevue, we love Downtown Seattle. I'd say, in general, we're becoming more suburban focused than urban focused because of a number of issues. There's more supply in the urban core. I'd say actually both with respect to office development, but also with respect to apartment development. And so trying to avoid the cities that are having these large concessions because you got 3, 4, 5 lease-ups competing with one another at the same time. So it's difficult to project forward that far. These concessions literally change on a weekly basis. And so I think our strategy is evolving to, hey, let's just try to avoid the areas that have massive development given that the rent growth in those areas has been suppressed for pretty long periods of time now. So we will continue to monitor and I can't predict whether Bellevue or Seattle is going to -- which one's going to outperform until we're a lot closer to looking at a deal.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott.</p><p>ROBERT CHAPMAN STEVENSON, MD, HEAD OF REAL ESTATE RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: John, you talked about the development pipeline and concessions earlier. When you layer on new supply and stuff that was completed a year ago that might be having it's first renewal, the 5 developments that you either currently have in lease-up or will in the next quarter or so, are any of those of a concern in terms of concessions that you guys think that you're going to need to lease them up? I think you said Mylo was currently 1 month free, and then I think it was Station Green, the first phase was 6 weeks, anything that's going to be outside of that sort of range?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Well, let me give a broad answer there. So when we are a delivered vacant unit, we're greatly incented, and this is really why it's logical, why many of the developers are doing what they're doing as far as free rent. It's not a matter that the market is weak. It's a matter that they're trying to drive a significant amount of absorption fast because your option 1 is vacant unit, option 2 is a lower net effective with a qualified resident and getting cash flow. So we have the same economics there, and of course, it's different when we own the asset. I mean when we have -- for same-store assets right, but we are one of those players on the development. So what we try to do is look for what works best in the marketplace and what the consumers are looking for and react to that. So I expect we'll increase our concessions over time. It's within our plan to do that because it usually happens as we get into the fourth quarter. But we make these decisions literally daily and definitely we do it intensely weekly. So we'll just follow it. But all of our -- you can tell by the pre-leasing performance the markets are strong, and we feel very good about all of our developments where they're at.</p><p>ROBERT CHAPMAN STEVENSON: Any of them facing extreme new supplies, Mike was alluding to before?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: No, we're not in -- at this point, we're not in situations where we have extreme combat.</p><p>ROBERT CHAPMAN STEVENSON: Okay. And then Angela, if I look at the same-store expense growth year-to-date, 2.9%, sort of implies the low 1s for the back half of '19. Is that all on property taxes, or is there something else that's going to drive same-store expenses down to the low 1% range for the back half of 2019?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: Yes. You're right. It's actually mostly driven by property taxes. So between the millage rate coming in lower than expected and we, of course, have some refunds that we're recognizing in the second half. Those are the key -- 2 key drivers.</p><p>ROBERT CHAPMAN STEVENSON: Okay. And if I could squeeze one more in. Maybe other than market concentration, what's keeping you guys at a BBB+ from the rating agencies versus an A-, like Avalon and Equity?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: Believe it or not, it's really market concentration. That's the key driver. Yes, I think the rating agencies are so focused on the number of states versus the relevance and -- of the actual state. I mean California as we all know has -- is like the third-largest GDP and incredibly diverse and large. Having said that, I think just the fact that it's one state is what's tough for the rating agencies to underwrite.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.</p><p>KARIN ANN FORD, SENIOR REAL ESTATE ANALYST, MUFG SECURITIES AMERICAS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Google announced it was looking to develop about $15 billion of real estate in the Bay Area with lend lease. Sounds like a significant chunk of that is earmarked for residential. Do you see this as a significant medium- to long-term supply threat that could be large enough to potentially affect rent growth -- market rent growth in the region?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, this is Mike. There are -- they're not alone. Microsoft has a program. I think Stanford University has some discussions about mainly student housing, but there are some other proposals of corporations getting involved in housing. It remains difficult to figure out exactly what's going to happen in the short term. I don't think there'll be any actually short-term impact. These are mostly over longer periods of time. And I think a lot of the corporate housing is probably strategically important to them in their hiring given that one of the key reasons not to come to the Bay Area is concern over housing and housing price. So if you can assure someone that's relocating to the Bay Area that they have a home I think that's a major positive in the hiring process. Overall, I don't think that any of this given the cost of housing and the size of these programs, I don't think it's going to have a material impact on the markets, but again, we'll face that down the road a ways.</p><p>KARIN ANN FORD: Got it. And my second question is going back to your development pipeline, you've got an extraordinary amount of lease-up development coming in the Bay Area in the next 6 quarters, including 500 Folsom, and you talked today a lot about the strong environment of those markets. Do you think your yields on those could outperform your underwriting? And can you share where the deals are penciling today?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: I think that we've talked about stabilized yields a little bit and maybe I'll echo those comments. Stabilizing somewhere in the 5.5 range and this is not today. This -- and it won't be next year, but it will be a couple years out. As you can imagine, development deals have, for example, retail components and the retail components are important because you don't want to have -- a lot of people don't want to move into a construction project. So you want all of that construction to be done. So that yield is a few years out. And so I think that for the next year or so you'll see some positive increment, but not dramatic.</p><p>KARIN ANN FORD: And is that 5.5 yield number on trended rents or on rents today?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: No. On stabilized rents.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin with Baird.</p><p>ANDREW T. BABIN, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: A quick follow-on question on the lease-up properties coming in getting delayed. Did that explicitly cause an increase to the FFO guidance where some of these properties you might have some initial drag obviously taking on new expenses mid-lease-up that might now occur early next year? Is there any kind of dynamic there in '19 versus '20 with those development projects getting pushed up?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: Yes. Drew, on the FFO guidance, the delay impact, which ultimately I think you're looking at the higher capitalized interest on our S-14. It's a couple of pennies, let's say $0.02. And -- for this year. So what that means is, of course, some of that dilution is going to get pushed next year as we continue the lease-up. But I think the one positive is that this dilution instead of being as concentrated as we thought that would occur this year, it'll be more moderated and it'll just occur over time similar to the impact of supply delivery that if they all come at once, it's obviously much tougher to digest. If they happen more ratably over time, it's much more manageable.</p><p>ANDREW T. BABIN: Okay. And I guess one more topic kind of related to the corporate housing question. Should some of these projects really, the rubber meet the road and some of them get entitled, some of them proceed, would Essex under the right economic conditions ever consider partnering with one of the corporations in some kind of project? And I guess what would you need to see for that to make sense for Essex?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Drew, this is Mike. A lot of these corporate housing entities have -- or proposals have included an RFP-type process, and so there might be some opportunity to work with some of these companies. And there'll be -- they'll be exposed more broadly to the development communities. So it probably isn't going to be just us, and it will be several projects over periods of time. So I'd say too early to tell exactly what it means. And again, we track pretty closely, as you know, the total amount of competing properties that's going to be entering the rental pool down the road. So if we saw the huge impact, I think during the construction period, it gives us time to react as well. So what exactly would those terms be, we work in a joint venture on many development deals and their -- the markets for those terms, depending upon what side you're on, change over time. And we're looking actually at some joint venture development deals as we speak.</p><p>They're complicated enough that I don't think I can reduce them to magnitude. We're going to look more broadly at the yield premiums that -- to acquisitions and measure today with market rents today that I talked about a little while ago. And whether we do it as a joint venture or ourselves, really is a function of how much risk is there upfront in the deal, how much money do we have to spec and how long a period of time do we have to spec it in the predevelopment period before we begin construction and every deal is a bit different.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY, ASSOCIATE, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: John, looking at that slide you put in last quarter, you had one about the permits falling quite a bit. I'm trying to use that slide to have good supply data. I'm wondering if you guys can give us some insight on when you think peak supply will be in your markets. It looks like next year will be comparable, but is it going to be the same thing in 2022 as well -- in 2021?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes. No, this is John. Our expectation is it starts to tick down. So as I mentioned, we're really at a plateau right now, and we expect it slowly starts to tick down going after next year. So yes, to put it that way, we're at peak supply right now.</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY: Okay. Fantastic. And then when we looked at those permits, I mean, they're falling quite a bit. Construction was to start probably the middle of last year. Is that mainly due to the cost that you cite where the rents are not growing fast enough? Or do you think the political uncertainty is also having a big factor in that?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: I think...</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Both. Yes, Both.</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes, Yes, I mean...</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: It's all the above. It's how much risk do you take and what types of yield are you expecting, how you're getting compensated for that risk. And I'd say, maybe adding to that is the project sizes are getting bigger and bigger and the cost per unit is -- has increased pretty dramatically. So you need more equity in a lot of these deals. And as we see this in the preferred equity environment where in that predevelopment period, costs are going up faster than rents and when we come in with preferred equity sometimes these deals are short of equity given cost increases. And that's causing some delays there. So it's all this. But, yes, it all involves the relationship between construction cost and development yields.</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY: Okay. And one final one if I may. Do you have the new and renewal leasing for the quarter and your most -- your loss to lease?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Sure. I can give that to you. So the new leases for the quarter -- second quarter were up 3.4% year-over-year or prior year's quarter and the renewals in Q2 came in at 4.4% year-over-prior year. And loss to lease you asked, we're at 3.5%, which at this point in time because of seasonality, it's going to be the high point, so I'll compare it to last June. So last June, we're at 3.3%. So it's about 20 basis points better than last year. And within that, SoCal has ticked down some, so it's a 2% loss to lease and NorCal and Seattle have gone up. So NorCal is 4.6% and Seattle is up 5%, all average rate is 3.5% for June.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.</p><p>RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON, RESEARCH ANALYST, SMBC NIKKO SECURITIES INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So I recall many years ago, you guys were kind enough to offer a 10% cap on annual rent increases. And I'm wondering obviously that's a moot point today. And Mike, I'm asking is that situation of excessive rent growth fundamentally over in your opinion in your markets, or is it simply supply and that has to kind of readjust where you could get there, or is there the political side that if you dare to go there, again, that you get -- you reignite sort of the rent control conversation to a higher level?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, Rich, it's a good question. I think where we are in the cycle is probably a key consideration there. You tend to get more rent growth when you go through a recessionary period, there's very little development, and so jobs start growing and you end up with a supply-demand imbalance for housing and you can push rents more aggressively than we can now. Now being constrained primarily by income growth and affordability-type issues. So as it relates to the 10%, you're exactly correct. We internally capped our renewals at 10% for many years while when we had much more robust rent growth. And we would do it, again. I think it's number one, the right thing to do, but I also am always concerned about -- we are always concerned about the impact on local regulators, et cetera. For example, when residents get a very large rent increase, they often go into the City Hall and tell the local officials about these huge rent increases, and we get phone calls and pushback almost immediately. And in fact, in some cases, in connection with CAA and some of the rental groups, we take part in trying to mediate some of these situations. So I think, it's just a good practice to cap renewal rents at 10% and it's something that we've done and we would do again.</p><p>RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON: Okay. Great. And then on your earlier comments on office development, we found interesting as I usually do, but wondering if you guys also track preleasing of that office development, which is really where the rubber meets the road as it relates to future demand for multifamily, there could be some stupid development in there?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes. Rich, it for sure will -- can change, but eventually, I think those office buildings we would all agree, will be completed. So yes, you're right. In the short term, absorption really matters. In the longer term, the fact that the property exists is probably what matters more. John, do you want to comment?</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes, and I'll just add in. The developments on the West Coast overall that Mike was referencing, they're about 75% preleased on average across the market. So huge preleasing going on. That is the nature of most office development these days. They typically have a big portion of their tenants before they break ground. At least in our markets.</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: And let me end with one final comment, Rich, and that is we're always concerned that people are going to find California less desirable and some of the tech jobs move to Boston, for example. So again, the fact that big investments are being made in our markets is really important to us. We view that as sort of a leading indicator. What are the tech companies doing. Can -- everyone's concerned about migration out of California. We're concerned about it as well. Again, we try to couple together a number of sort of leading indicators to give us some sense of what decisions are being made by developers and some of the big tech companies.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.</p><p>JOHN JOSEPH PAWLOWSKI, ANALYST, GREEN STREET ADVISORS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Angela, could you remind us what you're expecting for property taxes in Seattle, property tax growth rate to be this year? And are the favorable reassessments do you think it's the beginning of a multi-year trend, the fever finally breaking in Seattle?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: Well, on the tax piece, we're expecting the full year to come in at the midpoint around, say, in the high 1%. So say, 1.7%, 1.8-ish somewhere around there. In terms of the trend, boy, that's a tough one. I wish I had that crystal ball. It's interesting because in the past 3 years, our Seattle property tax has gone up between, say, 15%. I think it was 15% for 2 years and 17% for one of those 3 years. And this year, it was a decrease. And so that -- and we actually didn't budget the 15%, but I certainly didn't budget a decrease. So I'm not entirely sure what's going to happen next year. I think we're going to just try to take a best estimate, talk to our consultants and get some advice on that. But if you have a better solution, by all means, please call me.</p><p>JOHN JOSEPH PAWLOWSKI: I guess the shorter question is, was there anything lumpy onetime benefits this year that won't persist in Seattle?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: Nothing significant. We have some refunds, but they are -- those numbers are not big enough to drive year-over-year comp.</p><p>JOHN JOSEPH PAWLOWSKI: Okay. And Mike, on the regulatory front in Washington, what are your political contacts saying about 2020 legislative session and rent control chatter gaining steam again in Washington?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: I don't have any recent information on that. So I don't -- I haven't heard of any major movement in Washington at this point in time.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Hardik Goel with Zelman &amp; Associates.</p><p>HARDIK GOEL, VP OF RESEARCH, ZELMAN &amp; ASSOCIATES LLC: Congrats on the strong quarter and the guidance raise. I just had a couple of questions for you. The first one on a comment I think John made. So permits are declining year-over-year across your markets, but the delay environment that's persisted, do you think there's risk that even though supply is plateauing now and it's kind of getting smoothed out with consistent delays that there's still this pipeline of supply that is started but not yet completed or maybe stuck in predevelopment that already has been permitted in past quarters that will continue to dribble out supply even beyond 2020, early 2021 and onwards? And my second one is easier. Sorry, you go ahead, I'll ask it afterwards.</p><p>JOHN F. BURKART: Yes. No, just to say, so again, as we've said, we literally drive all the different sites. We take down from a process perspective, we have multiple vendors providing information as to permits that are obtained, sites that are started, et cetera. And then we have a mobile program where our people drive all the sites and upload information into the cloud as to where they're at, what's going on, and we clean up that data quite a bit and reconcile what we get from the vendors to what we see on the streets. So I think we have our hands around what's going on really well, probably better than most. And so that's what's in construction right now. And then the permits we reconciled, the permits to the actual as built and obviously there's typically some leakage going back the other way, things -- more things get permitted than actually get billed for various reasons. But at the end of the day, I think we have our hands around it pretty good. I think we're, at this point in time, supply has plateaued. We'll start to see it tick down, and it would take something else, like increasing rents or something to change the picture. But as Mike has said many times, construction costs are growing faster than rents, so at this point, it looks like we've hit the peak.</p><p>HARDIK GOEL: That's very helpful. For my second one, just -- should be pretty straightforward, I guess. On the Seattle kind of tax savings, how much of that was just the market and it will probably benefit others who own assets there? And how much of that was something that was an Essex push where you have an appeals process or some kind of mechanism where you try to get a favorable appeal or saving?</p><p>ANGELA L. KLEIMAN: Yes. That's a good question. It's mostly market-driven. So this is a Seattle millage rate assessment, and so it's assessed across the board. As far as the savings, we go through our refund process every year, and there's some benefit there, but that's not at all a key driver.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.</p><p>HAENDEL EMMANUEL ST. JUSTE, MD OF AMERICAS RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, MIZUHO SECURITIES USA LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mike, I guess I'll start with an oldie but goodie. What's your current view on the Essex footprint. California is not getting easier. Costs, taxes, regulation keep on increasing. Senior peers going to Denver. You'd once been in Portland, the weather is nice, and there's -- seems to be parity in Honolulu. So I'm curious if your view on your footprint here has changed or evolved at all and if so, how?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Well, Haendel, it's a good question, and it's probably the most essential and important question of all of them. And here we go through a process each year of reviewing strategy with our Board. And we kind of start with that very question, and we look at many major metros around the country and try to distill them down into a supply and demand and what it means. And so it's an ongoing question and an ongoing process here at Essex.</p><p>From where we ended up on this in the last year is, we think that the resiliency of the technology world is something that's going to probably be with us for several cycles. And that, along with the supply constrained nature of these markets and the difficulty of building here is going to keep a premium on housing. And there's this virtuous cycle of high cost of housing drives wages higher and which allows rents to go higher, which you see in very few places. And so we concluded and continue to conclude that we are well positioned in the West Coast markets.</p><p>HAENDEL EMMANUEL ST. JUSTE: And then, I guess, back to, I guess, the growth. As you very well know, it's very hard to buy in California. Not much trade and Prop. 13 being a clear headwind. So building is really the only gains for the multifamily guys and for growth in a Golden State. So I guess I'm curious if there's anything in your shadow or future pipeline that's penciling yet or getting close to penciling given the continued rent growth, notwithstanding the rising construction cost you guys have mentioned. And if so, where? And as an add-on to that maybe you can talk about potential interest in doing mixed-use development as well?</p><p>MICHAEL J. SCHALL: Yes, it's a good question, and we do have some land inventory. There's a Phase 4 at Station Park Green, and there are a couple other smaller projects that are behind our current pipeline that we will likely be active on. And as I said earlier, we continue to look for development deals. And the challenge there, as we've stated earlier is that construction costs are growing faster than rents, which means we have to see a fairly quick period between when we're financially committed to when we start construction because that's the period of greatest exposure.</p><p>So it's pretty challenging, I would say. Again, we continue looking, and we have some deals that we are working on. Remains to be seen whether we move forward with them or not. So -- and again, transitioning over to the preferred equity where we don't have that upfront risk because we're not financially committed from when -- during the entitlement period from when the entitlement period starts until when you start construction, we come in at construction, and we eliminate that part of the risk.</p><p>And we've been very active in preferred equity, and we'll continue to do that. As Angela mentioned, we're above the top end of the range this year in terms of commitments there. So it's -- this is kind of a mosaic. We put the pieces together and every deal is unique unto itself, and we try to make decisions that make sense in the broader scheme of things. And it's hard to bring it down to kind of the larger trends because every deal is a little bit unique. So I would say that more of the same, that we will look at development deals whether they have a mixed-use component because obviously there are many deals that have mixed-use components. There are other -- actually other REITs and other landowners that are interested in having a multifamily component. There are no shortage of discussions out there, for sure. And we will look at all of the above and try to make good value decisions and make sure that -- I think the key part is that we're compensated for the risk that we take relative to our other opportunities.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session.

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tyler Rose, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.</p><p>TYLER H. ROSE, KILROY REALTY CORPORATION: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are John Kilroy and several other senior members of our management team who are all available for Q&amp;A. At the outset, I need to say that some of the information we will be discussing is forward-looking in nature. Please refer to our supplemental package for a statement regarding the forward-looking information in this call and in the supplemental. This call is being telecast live on our website and will be available for replay for the next 8 days, both by phone and over the Internet. Our earnings release and supplemental package have been filed on a Form 8-K with the SEC, and both are also available on our website.</p><p>John will start the call with an update on conditions in our markets and a review of the second quarter, and I'll give you the financial highlights and discuss our updated 2019 earnings guidance. Then we'll be happy to take your questions. John?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, KILROY REALTY CORPORATION: Thanks, Tyler. Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with a review of market conditions and follow with details of our recent leasing performance. Then I'll bring you up-to-date on our development and capital recycling activities.</p><p>Conditions in our West Coast real estate markets remain very strong across a wide variety of industries. From Seattle to San Diego, the tight supply of available space, combined with significant demand for high-quality work environments, continued to drive rents. And Class A vacancy rates remain at frictional levels in all of our key markets.</p><p>Technology continues to be a key driver. As I've said before, I believe we are still in the early innings of this new digital era. Advanced computing technologies, turbocharged by artificial intelligence, continue to influence health care, finance, retail and many other service industries that had proven difficult to disrupt in the past. Another key driver of demand has been life science. U.S. spending on health care exceeded $3.5 trillion in 2018, more than 18% of U.S. GDP. That spending represents a huge opportunity for life science enterprises, and it's driving new investment, new businesses and new collaborations. It is boosting demand and shrinking supply in traditional life science clusters, from coastal San Diego to Seattle, and we believe this growth story is still in the early stages.</p><p>In addition, many of the majors we look to, to gauge the strength of the economic activity remain healthy. West Coast job growth continues to surpass the rest of the nation. VC funding is at all-time highs. U.S. health care venture fundraising reached a record $21 billion in 2018. Big tech continues to buy little tech, which improves overall credit quality. And the IPO market is providing strong liquidity.</p><p>On the ground, we're increasingly seeing a trend that the intersection of technology and life science is creating significant competition for office space in the same buildings across many of our markets.</p><p>In San Francisco, we signed a lease with Dropbox, as you recall, for the Exchange, but we had both tech and life science users competing for the project. You may also recall last year at our 360 Third Street project, a life science company established a 136,000 square-foot presence in what was a traditional office building.</p><p>In San Diego, at our 9455 Towne Center Drive development project, we have been in discussions with both tech and life science companies for all of the project, and now we're seeing it at Kilroy Oyster Point. With the scarcity of new large, state-of-the-art, highly amenitized work environments, we find ourselves negotiating more and more frequently with both tech and life science companies that are in competition for the same space, and we expect this trend to continue.</p><p>These conditions lay the groundwork for a terrific second quarter and first half leasing performance at KRC. We signed more than 2 million square feet of space in the first 7 months of the year, putting us firmly on track for another year of record performance. And that includes about 975,000 square feet in our development program, which scored more successes as Apple leased our entire project at 333 Dexter in Seattle and Cytokinetics leased more than 35% of the first phase of Kilroy Oyster Point, just 4 months after commencing construction.</p><p>In our stabilized portfolio during the second quarter, we signed just under 900,000 square feet of new and renewing leases at cash rents that were up 41% and GAAP rents that were up net 69% from prior levels.</p><p>Among the highlights, San Francisco tenants, WPP and Sony, both expanded their footprints in the city, signing up for 234,000 square feet between them at cash rents that were up 75% on a GAAP basis and -- excuse me, 75% on a cash basis and GAAP rents were up over 109%. WPP expanded its existing footprint by 70%, while Sony established a new presence in the city.</p><p>In San Diego, 2 existing tenants expanded their space in our Del Mar portfolio by more than 90,000 square feet in the aggregate, with cash rents that increased about 12% and GAAP rents that increased 31% on a weighted average basis. We ended the second quarter with our stabilized portfolio 97.2% leased. We estimate that in-place rents across our stabilized portfolio at the end of the quarter remained more than 20% below market, the highest level in company history.</p><p>Now let's talk about the progress across our in-process development program. Starting in Seattle, we signed a long-term lease with Apple in June for all 635,000 square feet at our 333 Dexter project in South Lake Union. 333 Dexter is our first ground-up development project in Seattle and its design, scale and location, one of the city's most sought-after submarkets, attracted attention from a variety of organizations. It's a great example of how our development program creates substantial value. Our cost basis in this brand-new state-of-the-art project is roughly 65% of where older product has recently traded. And we've now locked in an attractive revenue stream with a high-quality tenant for the long term.</p><p>In San Francisco, during the second quarter, we added 100 Hooper, a 400,000 square-foot project, to our stabilized portfolio. We also delivered the first half of the Exchange on 16th, a 750,000 square-foot project. In Del Mar, the retail portion of our One Paseo mixed-use project is now 94% leased and 72% occupied. The office portion of the project, which delivers in mid-2021 is 68% leased and 81% committed. Rents for both retail and office are setting records for the Del Mar submarket and for San Diego County. The project's residential units will begin delivering towards the end of the summer, and Phase 1 is already approximately 20% committed. Our success at One Paseo underscores the compelling attraction of the live, work and play environment we have created.</p><p>In Hollywood, as previously announced, the office space at our On Vine mixed-use project is fully leased to Netflix. Both office and residential components of the project remain on schedule for a 2020 completion.</p><p>Moving to life science. We have 2 projects underway, totaling 820,000 square feet. That's Phase 1 of Kilroy Oyster Point in South San Francisco and 9455 Towne Center Drive in the University Town Center submarket of San Diego. And I'm happy to report that we are in active lease negotiations for the entirety of the square footage. And just yesterday, we announced that Cytokinetics signed a 12-year lease for 235,000 square feet at Kilroy Oyster Point, taking more than 35% of Phase 1.</p><p>In the aggregate, our $2.2 billion of projects under construction is 2/3 leased, excluding resi and retail. Upon stabilization, the 5 projects will generate an estimated cash NOI of approximately $140 million, roughly 80% from office in life science and 20% from residential.</p><p>Before turning to the development pipeline, I'd like to recap our development track record in this cycle. Since 2013, we have delivered over $2 billion of projects at cost, 90% of which was office and 10% residential with a cash return of roughly 7.7%, generating more than $165 million of stabilized NOI. On the leasing front, 3/4 of the projects were started spec and 95% were leased prior to completion. Obviously, we're pleased with this performance.</p><p>Now moving to the development pipeline. On July 18, we received unanimous approval from the San Francisco Planning Commission for our Flower Mart project. The next and final step is for the Board of Supervisors to approve the project's development agreement this fall.</p><p>On the acquisition front, we continue to evaluate opportunities that could add immediate cash flow and other opportunities that would replenish our development pipeline. While we had not been large-scale buyers of operating properties in the past 2 years, we are seeing a few select properties in our key markets that could offer growing yields and other attractive metrics, including below-market risks and meaningful discounts to replacement cost.</p><p>In our capital recycling program, we completed the disposition of a small property located along the 101 Corridor in Westlake Village for $18 million and have a second asset currently in the market. Together -- Westlake together with the Calabasas sale earlier this year means we've now exited the 101 Corridor completely. We now believe that other asset dispositions we are evaluating are likely to happen next year. With the new timing, we expect our total dispositions in 2019 to be about $150 million.</p><p>I'll wrap up my comments with 5 key takeaways. Market conditions are the best we've seen in some time, and we are capitalizing on this across the portfolio, driving rents and increasing value. While we continue to believe development is the best way to create value and we believe 333 Dexter is another good example of that, we are underwriting acquisitions of existing assets with favorable valuation metrics. More to come on that.</p><p>We remain disciplined in evaluating new development starts, replenishing our pipeline and pursuing other strategic opportunities. We continue to place balance sheet strength and financial flexibility at the core of our business strategy, and we have a highly experienced and talented management team up and down the West Coast that is well positioned to continue to create significant value for our shareholders.</p><p>That completes my remarks. Now I'll turn it over to Tyler for a review of the financial results. Thank you, Tyler.</p><p>TYLER H. ROSE: Thanks, John. FFO was $0.95 per share in the second quarter, which included the earlier-than-forecasted commencement of the first half of the Exchange. Same-store NOI in the quarter grew 4.7% on a GAAP basis and declined 5.6% on a cash basis. GAAP NOI growth was helped by a net $0.05 charge from bad debt in the prior year period. As we've discussed on earlier calls, cash NOI in the first half of the year has been impacted by a handful of large expirations, which have been largely re-leased but required some downtime for TIs. We expect cash NOI to resume growing in the second half and it will be roughly flat for the full year. At the end of the second quarter, our stabilized portfolio was 93.8% occupied and 97.2% leased.</p><p>With our strong leasing activity through the first 7 months of the year, we've effectively addressed all 2019 lease expirations with just 1.5% remaining. And over the next 15 months, we only have one expiration greater than 100,000 square feet to lease. As John mentioned, we estimate that our portfolio-wide average in-place rents remain 20% or more for the market.</p><p>By region, in-place rents for San Francisco are approximately 31% below market. Los Angeles and Seattle's are 11% below market, and San Diego's are about 9% below market.</p><p>Also during the quarter, we increased our regular quarterly cash dividend by 6.6% to $0.485 per share or on an annualized rate of $1.94 per share. This represents close to a 30% increase over the past 3 years.</p><p>Now let's move to the balance sheet. We drew down all the proceeds on the sale of $5 million shares of equity we had placed last August on a forward basis and used the roughly $350 million to pay down our bank line. The roughly $90 million of forward equity placed in the first quarter under our ATM remains undrawn at this time. We have substantial debt capacity and flexibility. We have $690 million of capacity under our bank line and an incremental $600 million under the accordion feature. We have a large unencumbered portfolio, with only 2 mortgages, very little floating rate debt and no significant maturities until 2022. Our debt-to-market cap at quarter end was approximately 25.5%, and our debt-to-EBITDA was approximately 6.1x adjusted for the equity forward transactions. Given favorable credit market condition and our choice to defer some anticipated asset disposals into next year, we're reviewing options to accelerate the timing of issuing new debt.</p><p>Now let's discuss our updated guidance for 2019 provided in yesterday's earnings release. To begin, let me remind you that we approach our near-term performance forecasting with a high degree of caution given all the uncertainties in today's economy. Our current guidance reflects information and market intelligence as we know it today. Any significant shifts in the economy or markets, tenant demand, construction costs and new supply going forward could have a meaningful impact on our results in ways not currently reflected in our analysis. Projected revenue recognition dates are subject to several factors that we can't control, including the timing of tenant occupancies.</p><p>With those caveats, our updated assumptions for 2019 are as follows. As John noted, we now expect dispositions for 2019 to be at approximately $150 million. We forecast accelerating our next bond deal by a quarter given the lower disposition target. We forecast remaining 2019 development spending of $250 million to $300 million. Our forecast for year-end office occupancy remains at 94% to 95%. And we continue to expect 3% to 4% growth in GAAP same-store NOI for the full year and flat results on a cash basis. Taking all these assumptions into account, we are increasing our 2019 earnings guidance range to $3.67 to $3.78 per share, with a midpoint of $3.73 per share. The midpoint increase of $0.02 is primarily driven by the earlier-than-forecasted commencement at the Exchange.</p><p>That's the latest news from KRC. And I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question today will come from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.</p><p>PILJUNG KIM, SENIOR REAL ESTATE ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Congrats on the Apple lease at 333 Dexter. It looks like the stabilization date was moved back a couple years. And I was wondering if you could discuss the timing of the FFO contribution of the asset.</p><p>TYLER H. ROSE: Yes. So the projected -- it's going to be taken down in 3 phases starting in the second half of 2020 into 2022. We'll be providing more detail in that in the coming quarters.</p><p>PILJUNG KIM: And do you stop capitalizing interest when the occupancy takes place on a different basis?</p><p>TYLER H. ROSE: Yes.</p><p>PILJUNG KIM: At the Flower Mart, it looks like there's some conflicting news items whether or not the Flower Mart is going to decide to stay in the project after you complete it. Can you just provide some -- any further clarity you have on that?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Yes. This is John, John. Yes, the Flower Mart came to us in the city and said that with all the buildings that are going on, us, KRE, everybody else in Central SOMA, that it's going to be changing the character of the area from industrial to much more upscale. \"We think maybe it would be better for us to go over to the produce mart (sic) [another location] that's going to be built. Do you -- would you accommodate us?\" We talked to the city, and they said, \"Fine with us. You still get credit for saving the Flower Mart to the project, all the rest.\"</p><p>And so they may very well movement there. They have the option to do that. That's been approved by the city and all its different components, including the supervisors in terms of supporting it. So we don't know whether they will come back or not. It doesn't cost us any more money because the money was already there. So -- and in fact, it would increase our leasable office square footage slightly if they did not come back. So more to come on that.</p><p>PILJUNG KIM: As far as the total cost, it looks like similar projects that you have are around the $850 range per square foot. Is that a good benchmark for the Flower Mart? And can you also provide an update on the litigation project?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Well, I can't talk about litigation. There is a variety of -- other than to say that its people are endeavoring to negotiate a successful completion. We're hopeful that it will happen, but I can't be coming -- because it is litigation, I can't get into the specifics of that. In terms of the cost, let's just say that we're in a very favorable cost basis, but we are in negotiation with a lot of different people for the Flower Mart and I don't want to talk about what the cost is. It's going to make -- it's good to be favorable.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question will come from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank.</p><p>NICHOLAS PHILIP YULICO, ANALYST, SCOTIABANK GLOBAL BANKING AND MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just following up on Flower Mart. I guess can you give us a feel for where you think demand is like in the city right now? And what are Class -- where have Class A market rents for new construction in the city risen to?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Yes. Well, demand is -- I don't think I've ever seen demand any stronger. As you have seen us announce over the past, I don't know, year's worth of conference calls, we've been leasing space of record rates for space that is -- isn't contiguous or space that may not be available other than in tranches over the next couple of years. And that's in older buildings like 303 and 360 and 201 and so forth and 101st. Rents in the Brannan Street Corridor for quality product is, let's just say, north of $80 triple net and I think moving higher.</p><p>NICHOLAS PHILIP YULICO: Okay. That's very helpful. And then going back to the Oyster Point lease. Cytokinetics did file some information about it. And based on that rent, it looks like the project is already going to yield -- is already yielding over 7%. I mean how should we -- assuming you got similar rents for the rest of the space, I mean, how should we think about potential rent growth in that market and then also like future phases of construction cost? I mean is this a development that's going to get closer to an 8% yield over time?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: I'm not going to put my neck out there because every time I do, you guys want to chop it off because something happens. But we think that the Phase 1 will exceed our pro forma expectations that we've talked about before. Future phases, we think, the rents will grow tremendously in that market. You heard us say before that the same tenants, types of tenants and many of the same names lease space in Cambridge, lease space in South San Francisco for the similar kinds of properties and operations. And if you take a look and draw a little bit of a forward thinking to where rents might go in South San Francisco, look at where they are in Cambridge. We think we're going to see big rent increases over the next number of years. And we think rents will escalate significantly in the future phases of KOP.</p><p>NICHOLAS PHILIP YULICO: And just one last question on a lease that was signed. It looks like there's -- the tenant is -- doesn't pay rent on the full amount of square footage in the first year. It pays a piece of that. I wasn't sure if that was because they are not taking all the space or if there was -- that was built in, in some like additional free rent component.</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Tyler, do you want to handle that?</p><p>TYLER H. ROSE: Michelle, go ahead.</p><p>MICHELLE NGO, SENIOR VP &amp; TREASURER, KILROY REALTY CORPORATION: Yes. No, I think they are taking the 160 in the first 12 months and then the remainder over time in the second year, the total 235.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question will come from Craig Mailman of KeyBanc Capital Markets.</p><p>CRAIG ALLEN MAILMAN, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Tyler, just one quick one on guidance on the bond deal. Kind of what should we think about size and timing on that one?</p><p>TYLER H. ROSE: Yes. I mean we're still working on it. I mean 350 to 400 maybe on size. And timing, maybe September-ish kind of thing. Still working on it.</p><p>CRAIG ALLEN MAILMAN: Okay. That's fair. And then, John, just going through your comments on you're seeing more acquisition opportunities? Could you just kind of juxtapose that with that good development pipeline you have with Flower Mart and others? And kind of having to fund all this with where the equity is, maybe doing more -- mix more debt and dispose, kind of how the mix of capital allocation could go in the next 12 to 24 months.</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Honestly, I mean, just on dispositions to begin with, we gave a guidance early in the year, as I think everybody remembers, up between 150 and was it 350, Tyler?</p><p>TYLER H. ROSE: Yes.</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Yes. And we're at the lower end. And we explained before that somebody asked us, we thought we'd be selling, we think we can create some significant value by repositioning them before we sell them. So that means we'll probably do more dispositions next year. In terms of acquisitions, I don't want people to go out and think that we're going to become massive acquirers. We're not. But we are seeing a couple of assets that we think are extraordinarily well-positioned for huge increases in the future with -- that are currently accretive. And if we can be successful in acquiring those, then we think that's a good play for shareholders. Tyler, if you want to talk more about funding, if -- I think that was the second part of your question.</p><p>TYLER H. ROSE: Yes. I mean in terms of the funding of the existing needs, 2019 is effectively taken care of with these dispositions that we're still doing and the ATM floor that we drew down in the first quarter. So 2019's checked off. And then for 2020, as we just talked about, we're looking at a potential bond deal that would prefund from the 2020 development spending. And then to the extent we do acquire something or decide to do more development, then we'll evaluate the other alternatives that we've always used, which is dispositions, debt, and equity. We have a lot of debt capacity. And there's also the joint venture alternative.</p><p>CRAIG ALLEN MAILMAN: Okay. And then just, John, I know because you don't want us to think you guys are buying too much, just order of magnitude maybe of what you guys think you could take down and maybe the spread between those types of stabilized yields versus what you're getting on your developments.</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Well, as obviously, you're not going to get on anything you buy or reposition or that gets repositioned through the course of time. You're not going to get anywhere near the development yields. I don't want to get into specific yields because we have deals in discussion and I just think that's inappropriate to talk about because people do listen or read these scripts that are competitors, and I just feel uncomfortable talking about it. But it is definitely safe to say that you're not going to go out and acquire high-quality, best-in-class assets and have them be anywhere near the yields that Kilroy has been able to achieve in this cycle, including currently in our development. So there's probably 250 basis points, plus or minus, and possibly more of the spread. But what I'm looking at is if you can end up with something that is slightly accretive that can become massively accretive a few years down the road, then I like that.</p><p>CRAIG ALLEN MAILMAN: And what do you think -- and how much would you spend on this, just wide kind of goalpost?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Well, it'd be a fraction of what we do from a development standpoint. What do we have, Tyler, right now? $2.2 billion, $2.5 billion of development underway. And I'm not talking about anything that approaches even half of that.</p><p>CRAIG ALLEN MAILMAN: Right. And then just one last one for me. I think, in the past, you said that even though you're going to get approvals on the Flower Mart, you still wouldn't start until kind of the lawsuits are settled. I'm just curious if that's still the case. And then just how it's looking from kind of a phased perspective. I know in the past, you said maybe it would be 2 phases. Is there enough demand out there to just do it all at once? And just kind of thoughts around that.</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Yes. I think there's enough -- first of all, the entitlements that we have will be entitlements for what we call Phase I, which is everything but the Gateway building, which is roughly 350,000 square feet worth of leasable space. So we think it's likely that we will start -- it gets staggered a little bit between the blocks building and the market-all building because the market-all building doesn't take as long to start. So it all doesn't technically start at the same time, but I think it will finish at the same time. In terms of demand, I -- there's very, very strong demand by major companies for all of it. And I'm talking about all of it, where there's companies that want all of it for themselves.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question will come from Steve Sakwa of Evercore.</p><p>STEPHEN THOMAS SAKWA, SENIOR MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: John, I guess to kind of follow up on that point about the demand. Just help us understand how you sort of decided on Cytokinetics. And I realize it's a little bit more of a smaller biotech company, has a couple of drugs. It's not a traditional household name. It's certainly not an Apple from a credit perspective. So how did you guys go about sort of evaluating that company, kind of giving them part of Phase 1 given the kind of demand that sounds like that's behind that?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: I think it will become very clear in our next conference call.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Jamie Feldman of Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR US OFFICE AND INDUSTRIAL REIT ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: I want to talk a little bit about rent growth. Can you just talk about, across your major markets, what you're seeing in terms of net effective rent growth and maybe how does it feel versus last year?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: You want to cover that, Rob?</p><p>A. ROBERT PARATTE, EVP OF LEASING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, KILROY REALTY CORPORATION: Sure, Jamie. This is Rob Paratte, by the way. Starting with Seattle, we just see continued pressure on rents. So again, based on what brokers are forecasting for the year, for the remainder of this year, I wouldn't be surprised to see it in the double digits again in terms of net rent growth. The Seattle-Puget Sound area added over 43,000 jobs in the past 12 months. So there's, I think, this pent-up demand with a lot of employees in the area, plus people moving in, and the same tenants up there are pushing a lot of this rent growth as well as just occupancy.</p><p>In San Francisco, I think, again, it will likely be. I mean brokers are predicting, and especially for larger transactions, that we'll be in the double digits again. So whether that's 10% or 12%, hard to say right now. But based on the demand we're seeing and the number of tenants that are in the market, it's looking like it will be at least as good as last year. And your question was, I'd say up and down the coast, how do the markets look, how does rent growth look. I'd say they look, in every case, better than they did last year. So it's a very dynamic time right now.</p><p>In Los Angeles, probably in the -- just, again, depending on the submarket. I think in the west side of L.A. and Hollywood, you could start getting into double digit, but it's probably more, I'd say, safer to say 5% to 8% rent growth. And San Diego has really started humming well, I mean, just in terms of the amount of activity that is going on with tenants that are in the market, but also tenants that haven't yet come to the market that are looking. So we're seeing, particularly in San Diego, in the right submarkets, whether it's our Del Mar area where One Paseo is, or for example, our Little Italy project, we're starting to see different types of techs. So I think rent growth, again, probably won't be in the double digits, but could certainly be in the mid-single digits.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Right. That's very helpful. And then as you think about we keep seeing more and more news coming out of San Jose and Silicon Valley, I guess Silicon Valley occupancy improving and San Jose, a lot of investment and housing and mixed-use, what are your thoughts on what's happening down there and your appetite to get even more involved?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: In San Diego?</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: No. At Silicon Valley Peninsula, San Jose?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Yes. I think San Jose has got a lot of people that are assuming there's going to be tremendous growth, and there's -- in my mind, I like San Jose. I think it's a wonderful place. We've looked at it very thoroughly. We've had a lot -- we've reviewed a lot of property, some of which have been bought by some of our peers. But there's no limitation on what you could build. Rentals don't just buy new construction. That doesn't mean that rents won't get there. But if you need 1 million square feet, there are probably 8 or 9 people you can talk to for that million square feet. So the scarcity factor is -- the demand/supply is -- balances not to our liking. At this point, that could change.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Okay. And then Tyler had mentioned one expiration over 100,000 square feet over the next 15 months. Can you talk about that lease and your prospects to either renew it or if you think it's a move-out?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Yes. It's going to be a move-out. And I think we'll move the rents up considerably by repositioning it. But it will take a little time. And that happens to be in a property that we were thinking about not remodeling anyway. And so it's part of a larger development at multiple buildings. So -- but they are moving out, Jamie.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Where is it and...</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: It's Kilroy -- I think we call it Kilroy Center, Long Beach.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: And you're planning to keep the asset, not sell it?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: I don't want to talk about what we might be doing with any particular asset until we announce it. We don't talk about it.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Okay. And then just bigger picture, when you guys -- it looks like you're very comfortable growing more in life science. What are you thinking on the regulatory environment and drug pricing and how that might impact this sector?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: It's hard. I mean if you knew that, I wouldn't be in the real estate business, I'd be making that bet making zillions of dollars. So I don't mean to be flippant, but I don't know that anybody can make a call on that. I think you have to look at it. The fact is, our population is getting older. We got massive problems with diabetes and Alzheimer's and a variety of other things. It would bankrupt the country if we don't find new protocols to deal with and new drugs to deal with it, and so I think that we're going to find this area continue to expand. I think its technology is going to bring prices down and develop new remedies and whatnot. So I think it's pretty well-based that it's going to grow. Will drug prices tamp that down a little bit? I don't know how to predict that, Jamie.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question will come from John Guinee of Stifel.</p><p>JOHN WILLIAM GUINEE, MD, STIFEL, NICOLAUS &amp; COMPANY, INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: A question for you. DIRECTV probably getting down below 10 years on the lease. Is that lease appreciably below, above or below market? And then I noticed that your residential deal on Vine is costing about $1 million a unit. Can you talk about what kind of yield you can get on $1 million a unit residential deal?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Yes. Well, I'll start -- I'll let Steve talk about the resi, but let me talk about the DIRECTV. The rent is very, very, very significantly below market.</p><p>JOHN WILLIAM GUINEE: Okay. So all we need to know.</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Okay. Steve, you want to talk about the resi?</p><p>STEPHEN ROSETTA, CIO &amp; EXECUTIVE VP, KILROY REALTY CORPORATION: Sure. John, on yields on our resi buildings are in line with what other developers are delivering projects at, and we're not reporting those yields and breaking them out. But they are competitive, they are accretive, and they add an important value to these mixed-use projects.</p><p>JOHN WILLIAM GUINEE: Are you going vertical with steel and concrete in Hollywood and then doing a podium building in Del Mar? Is that what my guess is?</p><p>STEPHEN ROSETTA: Yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank.</p><p>DEREK CHARLES JOHNSTON, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: I know we touched on funding briefly, but I wanted to be pretty direct. So what are the funding plans for Flower Mart specifically?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Well, we've talked about that before. And we have a lot of different ways of thinking about that. It's just bigger project, but it's exactly the same as we've talked about with others, and that is we did -- we could venture it, we could add debt, we could add equity, any comp, we could do dispositions. We're totally flexible right now. I think we'll end up with a significant lease in due course, and then we will address our capital plan concurrently with announcing any lease.</p><p>DEREK CHARLES JOHNSTON: Great. Great. And just secondly and lastly, so what do you have left to lease in San Francisco this year given the truly full occupancy? And really, is there much juice left to squeeze out of this orange in San Francisco in the second half of '19?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Tyler?</p><p>TYLER H. ROSE: Yes. I mean as I mentioned in my comments, there's very little left in 2019 in the Bay Area to lease. We're basically full. So rents are below market in our San Francisco portfolio, about 31%, but we can't capture too much of that as we're getting out in 2019.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Blaine Heck of Wells Fargo.</p><p>BLAINE MATTHEW HECK, SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: John, you talked about acquisitions. I think you were referring mostly to operating properties and value-add type deals. But I guess how are you thinking about your landholdings at this point? Obviously, you've got a lot of wood to chop with regards to Oyster Point and Flower Mart. But are you guys still actively looking for other sites for development down the road?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Well, yes, we are -- we look at everything, Blaine, as I think we've said multiple times over the years. We literally looked at everything, even, again, whether it's a potential development, whether it's a potential acquisition. Part of that is market knowledge, part of it is what are others doing, what do they see that we don't and sometimes, we act on it. With regard to your -- specifically with regard to development sites, there are some sites that we like because they are right in our wheelhouse and they check all the boxes, and whether or not we'll be successful over time in acquiring some additional sites remains to be seen.</p><p>With regard to the 2 big projects you mentioned at Oyster Point and the Flower Mart, first of all, Oyster Point, we're in -- we have entitlements for another couple of million square feet at Oyster Point. You have to go through a precise plan process, which takes about a year. We'll be submitting the precise plan for the subsequent phases at Oyster Point. It would be -- we'd be hard-pressed to be under construction in 15 months, assuming we wanted to start construction. I don't think we could start probably for another 15 months, plus or minus, there for the next phase. With regard to Flower Mart, obviously, we've got to see the city solve the lawsuits. Hopefully, that happens over the course of the next 6 to 12 months. Then we got to move the Flower Mart off and then we start construction, so you know those are downstream. There could be -- we have 2100 Kettner down in San Diego, which Michelle, what's the -- forgive me, everybody, but I just can't remember the numbers on every single project. That's an incremental spend of how much, Michelle? 2100?</p><p>MICHELLE NGO: It's about $100 million.</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: $100 million?</p><p>MICHELLE NGO: About $100 million. Yes.</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Yes. Okay. Yes. And we'll probably start that sometime in the next 6 months based upon what we're seeing for tenant demand. And then buying additional sites, we're always looking. We'll report on that when we think we're serious about something or we have something to announce.</p><p>BLAINE MATTHEW HECK: All right. That's really helpful. And then it looks like CapEx per square foot and concessions in general were a little higher this quarter. Can you just talk about whether that was a mix issue? And I guess, maybe for Rob more generally, what are you seeing with respect to TIs and free rent in your markets?</p><p>A. ROBERT PARATTE: Sure. I'll handle the last part of your question first, Blaine. With what's happening with the TI market is basically cost-driven, meaning that costs are higher just because labor, et cetera, materials, that kind of thing, just given the economy that we have. That said, with our new development particularly, the TI tends to be a little bit higher, but we're also getting higher rents for that. And it's also -- TIs are also driven largely by function of how long the lease terms are that you sign. So it's not -- in past markets and that sort of thing, TI becomes sort of a concession that gets increased. But that's not the case now. It's really -- they're all in different submarkets falling within a certain range depending on whether it's new construction or existing lease term and then the type of rent you're getting.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question will come from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. The next question will come from Manny Korchman of Citi.</p><p>EMMANUEL KORCHMAN, VP AND SENIOR ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: John, can you talk about -- you talked about sort of an overlap between tech and life science tenants. Can you talk about your leasing approach to those 2 different constituencies and how you either make sure or don't make sure if there's overlap?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: I'm sorry, Manny. The last part, how -- what was the last part of your question?</p><p>EMMANUEL KORCHMAN: So how you manage the leasing process between those 2 somewhat different constituencies within the same assets.</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Well, remember that in the -- sometimes in the same assets. Sometimes, it's a multibuilding thing. All of the stuff, whether it was the Exchange or whether it's KOP or whether it's 9455, they're all designed structurally, mechanically, et cetera, floor loading, ceiling height, et cetera, for life science because they do have specific things that are important to them. However, what we're seeing with the major tech companies is they also need more mechanical, more ceiling height. And so it tends to fit pretty consistently between the 2 uses.</p><p>In terms of mixing them in a building, as you know, there's various lab issues and so forth on lower floors versus higher floors and so forth. So we're very conscious of making sure that the different types of uses we might put into a project are compatible and not incompatible. And we have not had any resistance. The -- as I mentioned in my comments, all the space that we have underway for life science, we are negotiating -- in negotiations with life science companies and in many cases, with tech companies for the same space. And I like that because the tech companies push life science companies on rent.</p><p>EMMANUEL KORCHMAN: And then can you just give us updated thoughts on your search for JV partners, either for existing assets or some of these large-scale developments?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Well, there's a lot of people out there that want to do ventures on existing product and on life science product, on the Flower Mart, on new -- other projects that we're doing. And so if we want to do that, unless there's some big change in the marketplace in a macro context, I think we have multiple candidates from which to choose with very favorable pricing. More to come.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Dave Rodgers of Baird.</p><p>DAVID BRYAN RODGERS, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: John, maybe this dovetails a little bit with Manny's last question. But with regard to kind of pushing asset sales into next year and bringing the bond offering forward, what was the main driver in kind of pushing the asset sales back? And just kind of given the demand you're seeing for assets, would you want to get that done sooner rather than later? So were there any triggers kind of in the first half of the year that led you to kind of push that back a little bit?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: Well, it's -- as I've tried to explain it in previous conference calls, the mark-to-market, Dave, on these assets is far greater than what we thought it was, and we think we can significantly increase the value of them through repositioning. And then to dispose of those -- of the assets that we had sort of earmarked, we think it will translate to a much higher sale price. So that's -- it's as simple as that.</p><p>DAVID BRYAN RODGERS: So same assets, just maybe investing some more capital, or is it more leasing when you talk about repositioning?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: It's investing some capital, which will, we think, achieve significantly higher rents on the expirations that we see over the next year or so. Yes. And I think it translates to a lower cap rate because it puts the assets in a much better line.</p><p>DAVID BRYAN RODGERS: Fair enough. And then is that a meaningful number in terms of the CapEx going into those for sale or potentially for JV assets?</p><p>JOHN B. KILROY: It's not. Put it this way, the value creation versus the added increment of investment is an enormous positive return.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Tyler Rose, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for any closing remarks.</p><p>TYLER H. ROSE: Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in KRC. Goodbye.</p><p>OPERATOR: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

The strong operational results produced in these numbers exceeding up 14%, and that reflects the client franchise that we run. This has been bolstered by the improved investment performance in our Shareholder Investment Portfolio, which together with operating earnings led to an increase of normalized headline earnings of 51%. We're pleased with numbers, and I'll share with you some thoughts about the progress we've made during 2019 during the course of this presentation.</p><p>Liberty's strategic direction remains unchanged, and we are deeply in the execution of our strategy. 2018 was a year of us delivering on our commitments and of achieving meaningful progress on the initiatives that we have prioritized. And we feel that this momentum has continued into 2019. I'll be sharing some of that progress with you this morning. We feel that we've put our company on the right path, and that we've taken substantial steps to simplify and strengthen our business to better serve our clients and advisers in a digital way as part of the Standard Bank Group.</p><p>We feel that the disciplined execution of our strategy is starting to deliver value. As we noted before and as is evident in our integrated report, we are guiding and measuring the execution of our strategy through the 5 strategic value driver model, and this forms the basis of our reporting to you this morning as well. I will be outlining our progress against the first 3 strategic value drivers. And the fifth one, the fee impact. Yuresh will then share with you the financial results and outcomes for the first half.</p><p>Let me start in relation to client and adviser experience, and I'll spend some time detailing several initiatives that demonstrate the progress that we're making here.</p><p>First, it's important when we think about our clients and advisers to illustrate the impact that we're having on real people's lives who are our clients. It's important to give you a sense of how we're able to serve our clients during this first half of 2019 as we maintain our promises and deliver against our purpose.</p><p>We paid ZAR 3.8 billion in death and disability claims to help family meet their financial responsibilities through our retail business and an additional ZAR 1.2 billion through our corporate business to employees of our institutional clients. Both of these numbers represent a 7% increase and meaningful contribution to families at a time of restitution.</p><p>Likewise, our retired clients received ZAR 3.9 billion in annuity payments, which is up 9% in comparison to the first half of last year. These statistics truly demonstrate the profound impact on people's lives and on these families that our business can have. And it is why this is so important that we maintain the momentum to restoring Liberty, its health and its competitiveness.</p><p>Let's focus then on the initiatives that we delivered that have enhanced our clients' experience. We listen to our clients and try to understand their needs, and through extensive insights, confirm that people are living longer and healthier lives. This has led to us repositioning Liberty's flagship Lifestyle Protector product, which is now uniquely positioned to provide benefits for evolving life stages. The recently launched Liberty Wellness Bonus enhances our product. And it is a major step forward in the way that Liberty seeks to reward clients for living healthy lifestyles. The launch of the Liberty Wellness Bonus was motivated by 2 key client insights.</p><p>The first is that clients want to be rewarded, but they do not want another rewards program. The second key insight is that clients want the freedom to choose their wellness program independent of the provision of other services and in particular, independent of other financial services. They wanted to be given the credit for their healthy lifestyles, where they choose to take that credit and not to have benefit dictated to them.</p><p>One of our competitors, Discovery, has sought to prevent us from providing this benefit to our customers. They have lost an action in the High Court, where they allege that we've infringed their trademark -- trademarks and they've alleged unlawful competition. We have responded with our own submission of court papers and affidavits, and we will vigorously defend this matter.</p><p>I'd like to highlight to you 2 important principles that underline this matter. Firstly, Liberty sees this action by our competitor as an attempt to limit competition in our markets. Secondly and perhaps more profoundly, we believe that client data belongs to the client.</p><p>We believe that this is a question about whose data is it really. We believe it belongs to the client and not to the company and that the client should not be prevented from using their own data to their best advantage.</p><p>During the first 6 months, Liberty Corporate has redeveloped their investment and annuity propositions in support of an improved employee benefits offering. And finally, with respect to our client experience, we have simplified connected and enhanced many of our basic customer experiences and services using Agile work methodology and good examples of this are the launch of the MyLiberty website and our new claims [loss] platform, which uses new robotic automation to significantly improve our claims processes.</p><p>Focusing now on our advisers, we also listen to their needs. We've helped to focus our advisers and improve their productivity so that they can make sure that they can establish, build and maintain and grow the relationships with their clients. We've done this by providing more competitive products and work towards delivering excellent client service to them, while enabling them with new smart tools.</p><p>We've rolled out the atWORK financial needs analysis tool with 1,000 of our top advisory partners, and we did this in a 4-month period ending March. This was made possible through the MuleSoft integration layer. I mention that because this is the first major demonstration of the use of fintech and the cloud to radically improve our ability to deliver the best digital tools fast and efficient.</p><p>The feedback from the field has been positive and reflect the sentiment around simplicity and an enhanced customer experience. Significant progress has been made in refocusing our service strategy within the IFA and SBFC channels to drive increased support for these critical partners of ours.</p><p>And finally, we hosted an inaugural risk conference, which was designed to showcase the extensive insight that we have related to living longer. Critical to delivering experience and outcomes for our customers is STANLIB, our asset management platform. And I'm pleased to report that they've delivered a fantastic first half of 2019.</p><p>Management efforts to improve investment oversight by strengthening the team and by continuing to enhance the governance processes has started to show benefits. And we're pleased to report improved investment performance has continued through the first 6 months, now reflecting 18 months of top or second quartile performance in key funds. The operational environment in STANLIB has also been significantly strengthened over the past year through the diligent work in both the operations and finance areas, both of which have new leaders.</p><p>And finally, within STANLIB, we continue with the fund rationalization program, with the closure of 6 more funds so that we can continue to optimize client offerings and cede classes.</p><p>Our relationship with the Standard Bank Group remains a critical differentiator of Liberty. The bancassurance relationship continues to provide considerable value to both Liberty and Standard, with growth in the embedded credit part of our business and net customer cash flows, respectively, for the 2 businesses.</p><p>During the period, we also collaborated to launch a new enhanced funeral proposition in the embedded business. Our Assurance Banking initiatives are also moving forward with both the wealth and investment and short-term insurance, with the insurance proposition being delivered now to the Liberty customer base.</p><p>Moving to our second strategic value driver, our focus on employee experience, initiatives have been ongoing to shift the culture within Liberty. We're seeing the interplay of 3 key forces within our business. Firstly, the adoption of new ways of working and SAFe Agile methodology. Secondly, the adoption of modern digital technologies that are helping to shift our human engagements. And good examples of these are the implementation of Office365 and the SAP Success Factors platform. These are not just work tools, these are tools that are helping our teams come together and work in significantly more collaborative and future team type work styles.</p><p>Culture, as you know, can drive these things in a positive way or they can hold them back. And so we are seeking to really influence our culture within the entire Liberty Group through the cascade and implementation of observable, consistent and conscious behaviors by leaders and all of the teams within Liberty.</p><p>In respect to our risk and conduct environment, Liberty remains well-capitalized and has managed within its risk target range and well within risk appetite throughout the period. We continually enhance the risk culture across the organization through various grassroots interventions as part of the larger Risk and Control Enhancement Programme.</p><p>We continue to invest and enhance the group's cybersecurity profile and resilience based on changes to both the threat landscape and the development of technology.</p><p>And finally, in relation to risk and control, our area of focus has been the financial control environment, which has continued to be enhanced across our organization.</p><p>Moving then to the impact that we have on society, the environment and the economy, I'd like to note that we've aligned that measure of our 5 strategic value driver model to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. You'll see that in our report to society, and we'll provide you with a more detailed update when we provide our results at the end of the year.</p><p>However, it is important for Liberty to continue to deal diligently with critical industry issues that impact on our client franchise, and importantly, that impact on our clients. The important matter of unclaimed benefits within the pension fund industry is one of the issues that we continue to focus on, with the primary goal to provide benefits due to beneficiaries. The significant progress made in placing members in the Liberty-sponsored unclaimed benefit funds has continued into 2019, and this resulted in just under ZAR 64 million in claims being paid in June, up into the year to June, representing more than 16,000 beneficiaries and tracing efforts enabling 35,000 claims per month.</p><p>In relation to the issue around fund rehabilitation, we are working with the trustees of the 25 funds that were reinstated last year through the High Court process towards being in a position to actually pay benefits to beneficiaries where these are due and to do that as fast as we can. We aim to approach the High Court in respect of the remaining that need to be reinstated before the end of 2019.</p><p>We're seeking to learn from the current reinstatement process to expedite the next set of funds in the future. We've been proactive with our engagements to all our stakeholders in this regard, including regulators, and importantly, including social organizations that represent beneficiaries seeking to find what is rightfully theirs.</p><p>I'd now like to hand over to Yuresh, who will outline the financial outcomes delivered during the period, and then I will return and present some thoughts to conclude this morning's proceedings. Thank you very much.</p><p>YURESH MAHARAJ, GROUP FINANCIAL DIRECTOR &amp; DIRECTOR, LIBERTY HOLDINGS LIMITED: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before I present the 2019 results, first reflecting on the global and local operating environment of the last 6 months, this graph provides some context to the results reported for the period.</p><p>We have seen ongoing Brexit-related uncertainty, together with global economic markets or equity markets which need to benefit from the easing of the U.S./China trade tensions. We've also seen the accommodative stance adopted by Central Banks and the surge of the U.S. S&amp;P 500 Index in achieving an all-time high.</p><p>Locally, we started the year with some pre-election uncertainty, economy contracting in the first quarter of this year, with real GDP down 3.2% quarter-on-quarter. This was followed by the Reserve Bank revising its 2019 full year growth forecast down to 0.6%. However, following the national general elections in May this year and with the newly-appointed Cabinet, the country is in a better position to grow and develop.</p><p>Now let's turn to the group financial performance. The group's performance for the first half of 2019 reflects the continued progress achieving our medium-term key financial outcomes, with an annualized return on equity, 17.7%, supported by a 14%</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>in earnings, significantly higher earnings from the Shareholder Investment Portfolio.</p><p>The annualized return on group equity value increased to 14% from 4.7% at June 2018 and compares favorably with our return on group equity value target of greater than 12%. The group value of new business margin increased by 20 basis points to 0.9%, and the group's capital position continues to remain strong at the upper end of our target range.</p><p>I will now detail the drivers underpinning each of these financial outcomes. Normalized operating earnings for the 6 months was just below ZAR 1.1 billion, reflects an improved operational performance, good earnings contribution from the South African insurance and asset management businesses, up 7% and 19%, respectively, on 2018. Shareholder Investment Portfolio delivered earnings of ZAR 922 million, benefiting from strong local equities and bond performance, together with good performance from developed market equities. Portfolio produced a gross return of 5.9% over the period. This resulted in a 51% increase in normalized headline earnings to just over ZAR 2 billion.</p><p>Earnings from the SA Retail business, ZAR 782 million, 11% up on 2018. This increase was supported by favorable risk experience variances, offsetting lower persistency variances. Cost managed in line with current sales growth volumes.</p><p>Liberty Corporate earnings of ZAR 39 million showed an improvement from the ZAR 25 million loss reported in the second half of 2018. The underwriting results was impacted by poorer group life mortality experience in the period. However, the experience on the disability book continues to improve, following management actions taken, adding selective risk [premium] repricing. Cost continued to be well-managed within this business.</p><p>LibFin markets, comprising our assets and liability management capability, credit portfolio, delivered earnings of ZAR 191 million, which was 13% up on the prior year.</p><p>The improved earnings from the continuing operations in the Africa region, ZAR 31 million, was primarily as a result of better claims experience from the -- from the short-term insurance businesses in Kenya. And the asset management operations in the Southern Africa regions [formed] in line with 2018.</p><p>As regards to asset entities and the ownership review, the loss of ZAR 64 million is reduced compared to the 2018 loss of ZAR 81 million, due mainly the sale of the short-term insurance technology platform to Standard Bank Group in January this year. David will elaborate on the progress we are making with the entities under ownership review later in the presentation. Cost discipline continues to be -- continued in the current business environment, and the central costs have been well-managed across the group.</p><p>Now turning to StandardSouth Africa. Standard South Africa earnings grew by 19% to ZAR 209 million. The result was supported by higher fee income due to good client cash flows and favorable investment market returns in the period.</p><p>Operating expenses were well-managed, with focus on the cost-to-income ratio continuing within the business. Standard's third-party cash flows grew by 58% to ZAR 13.3 billion. Standard has continued to maintain its top quartile peer ranking performance for its core retail and balance funds for the last 18 months. The improved investment performance has started to demonstrate market confidence in these franchises, supported by good institutional inflows.</p><p>Standard has a reputation of being a large fixed income manager and has also benefited from the current risk-off sentiment, with strong money market inflows during the period.</p><p>Moving to the sources of group equity value-added. The higher return on group equity value was supported by improved investment market returns in a marginally lower interest rate environment. Management actions, including overhead cost control, supported a 3% growth in operational equity value profit.</p><p>SA Retail's experience variances remained positive in the period. However, persistency and early duration of less than 12 months is reflecting the impact of the economy, as several management actions are underway to improve the retention on these -- on this portfolio's policies.</p><p>Liberty Corporate experience variances were negatively impacted by higher umbrella terminations, low salary growth rates and member withdrawals correlated to the challenging economic cycle.</p><p>Turning to the key insurance metrics. The group value of new business of ZAR 171 million, grew 20% over 2018, with a margin improvement from 0.7% to 0.9%. SA Retail's value of new business increased by 14% to ZAR 134 million, with the increase supported by positive product enhancements and margin management, combined with an improved business mix.</p><p>The value of new business for Liberty Corporate and Liberty Africa Insurance increased to ZAR 22 million and ZAR 15 million, respectively.</p><p>Group long-term insurance indexed new business of ZAR 3.9 billion, increased by 2.4%. Guaranteed investment plans and conventional annuity new business has increased significantly compared to 2018, which continues to demonstrate the need for certainty in a volatile economic environment.</p><p>Liberty Africa Insurance indexed new business reflects a significant improvement, with good sales of living annuity and personal loan protection products across the region. Focus remains on sales assets and new business volumes in the prevailing tough consumer environment.</p><p>As David noted earlier, a number of initiatives were launched in the first half of 2019, which includes various product enhancements within the retail and corporate risk and investment propositions, which we now need to capitalize on for the remainder of the year to increase these lead indicators.</p><p>Moving to our capital position. The group's capital position remains robust, with a solvency capital ratio of Liberty Group Limited, the group's main long-term insurance license, at 1.85x at 30 June 2019, and this remains within the upper end of our target range.</p><p>The Board has approved the 2019 interim dividend of ZAR 2.76 per ordinary share. This is in accordance with our dividend policy, amounting to 40% of our 2018 full year dividend.</p><p>In summary, good progress has been made in moving towards our medium-term financial outcomes over the last 18 months. Our focus remains on driving SA Retail performance, growing the group value of new business, maintaining top quartile investment performance in STANLIB and concluding the outcomes for the operations and ownership review. All of these will ensure that we achieve our financial outcomes on a sustainable basis, facing long-term value creation for all our stakeholders. Thank you. I'll now hand over to David to conclude this morning's presentation.</p><p>DAVID CHARLES MUNRO: Thank you very much, Yuresh. I think it's obvious that the improved financial results and the much better risk and control environment are giving us the opportunity to continue to invest in the future of our business, allowing us to focus on building a really competitive and sustainable business, with the core driver at all times being our focus on client and adviser experience.</p><p>I'd like to now just share with you some thoughts about what differentiates Liberty today. Firstly and importantly, we are a focused South African business, not exclusively, I'll come to that in a minute, but the large part -- the largest part of our business is focused on South Africa. South Africa is our home. We understand our clients and customers here, and we will keep listening to and learning from them to enhance our service to the people and advisers of this country. We as Liberty are really highly geared to this country and to South Africa's economic recovery. We're positive about this country, and we remain committed to playing our role in its progress and its future. And so while South Africa is a nice democracy, and this has been evident in the last few months and years, we think it's important to remain positive and have good reasons to do so. Many of our state institutions remain strong. There is a focus on governance being brought to the SOEs and the state sector as a whole. The impact of the transparent processes, such as various commissions of inquiry are building a much more -- a much stronger foundation for this country. A strong political cohesion in a world today that is evidenced by significant political fragmentation in many countries around the world. There's a vibrancy in our private sector and our private sector truly has the capability to mobilize capital to drive growth in this country.</p><p>And indeed, we are also a society that is trying to look after all of its people, and indeed, the poorest of the poor. These are good reasons for us to remain positive about our country, and we do believe that it's the individual acts of confidence by the citizens of this country and the corporate sector and the businesses in this country, can today -- can help capitalize to start to shift the fortunes of our country, and we remain committed to playing our role in this regard.</p><p>We are working towards ensuring that the foundations of our business are capable of sustaining what are the tough times now, that we will be well positioned to benefit once the economic tailwinds begin to blow.</p><p>The second area of differentiation I'd like to focus on are our operations across Africa regions. And so while our focus has been on the rehabilitation of our South African operations because of the scale, we do remain committed to the opportunities where we see long-term growth in countries outside South Africa, where we can partner with the Standard Bank Group and where we can be competitive.</p><p>This includes our operations in Kenya, where we already have significant business. And we will also retain our asset management operations in the Southern African regions, where they can link to South Africa through the common monetary area. And so with this backdrop, I do need to give you an update on the progress that we're making in respect of our disposal group. As advised to shareholders in an announcement on SENS last night, we have entered into an agreement to dispose of our STANLIB Ghana operations to the Standard Bank Group for a consideration of GHS 70 million, which is approximately ZAR 185 million. This agreement is obviously subject to various conditions precedent, including regulatory approvals, but we do think it represents evidence of our progress towards executing against the initiatives and goals that we set for ourselves.</p><p>We are also in advanced negotiations for the disposal of 3 other asset management operations across Africa regions in 3 different countries. Unfortunately, the negotiations with respect to our initial partner in respect of our health business were terminated within sight of the finishing line. However, understanding that we h ave recommenced the process with other partners and parties that we felt and knew were interested in that business, and we will continue to run that process and try to bring it to a conclusion as soon as we can.</p><p>The third area of transformation and differentiation in our business is our focus on client and adviser experience. We fundamentally believe in the role that advice plays in our business, particularly in the management of investment and risk for clients in this complex world.</p><p>Our goal is to leverage this capability, advance the power of the adviser and the humanity that they bring to the client and to this business through the power of digital and data interventions. And to achieve this, we've underpinned our transformation plan by a powerful technology plan. We'll be partnering with big tech players that we think can radically shift the customer experience and engagement capabilities of Liberty to rapidly change both advisers and clients' experience of us. These partners include some of the world's biggest companies like Microsoft Azure and the Amazon Web Services business.</p><p>The final differentiator, we think, that Liberty has today is that we are part of the Standard Bank Group. There are 4 dimensions to this relationship, which we should call out when we think about the Standard Bank Group. The first is obviously our bancassurance agreement and the work that we do, as I highlighted earlier in the presentation, towards delivering through Standard Bank's distribution channels, product manufactured by Liberty. And obviously, the Assurance Banking initiatives as well. It's the first dimension to our relationship.</p><p>The second dimension to our relationship is our ability to partner with Standard Bank Group as they continue to grow their operations across Africa regions. Where we have bancassurance agreements with the Standard Bank Group operations, we will continue to run to build and grow our short- and long-term insurance operations, as I said earlier, particularly in East Africa and Southern Africa.</p><p>The third dimension to our relationship is the scale and capabilities that the Standard Bank Group can bring to bear and that they can use to help leverage and support us, particularly in the world of technology and digital and data. The relationships that I spoke about with big tech companies are not just Liberty relationships alone, they form part of the wider Standard Bank Group relationships.</p><p>The final element of differentiation and final dimension of this part of Liberty's differentiation is the fact that the Standard Bank Group is a strong core shareholder for Liberty.</p><p>So in conclusion on this morning's presentation, I'd like to summarize as follows. We're really pleased with the solid performance that we've delivered in this business in the first half of 2019. We're proud of our 51% increase in normalized headline earnings, and we're proud of generating 14% growth in our operating earnings in a very tough climate. We feel that, that creates a good foundation for us to tackle the second half and build towards a full year result. It is clear from our presentation and our comments this morning that we continue to reorientate our business and to deliver against the needs -- to deliver towards the needs of our clients and advisers.</p><p>Importantly, we will continue to look for opportunities to satisfy these needs through innovations, particularly in a disruptive way. Modern digital technology forms a key part of this plan going forward with world-class partners. The final piece that I'd like you to take away from this presentation this morning is that the transformation of our business currently underway will position us to be competitive and sustainable for the growth -- for growth in the future.</p><p>I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Liberty community for their hard work and support over the last 6 months. We've built a good foundation in the first 6 months to deliver an excellent year of progress for Liberty in the full year of 2019.</p><p>I'd like to thank you all for listening to our presentation this morning, and we'd be very happy to field any questions that you may have. Thank you.</p><p>Right. So I think let's see if we have any questions here in the auditorium at the Standard Bank Global Leadership Centre, and then we'll move to participants on the webcast and conference call. All right, [Warrick]? Sure, go ahead.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (technical difficulty)</p><p>Dividend's been flat since 2015, full year dividend. What are your considerations in making the decision as whether to maintain or increase your dividend cover ratio for the full year?</p><p>Second question is on cost containment for the group and</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>Standard's operating expenses, they fell 5% and new expense base, to what extent all this benefits? Just give us some more color on do the costs</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>going forward. And last question on new business volumes, do you have targets, new business volumes? And maybe you can provide some more insight as to what channels are working well, whether there's any change in strategy on growing new business?</p><p>DAVID CHARLES MUNRO: Sure. Thank you very much, [Warrick]. Yuresh, why don't you take the dividend and cost question, and I'll deal with the volumes...</p><p>YURESH MAHARAJ: Yes.</p><p>DAVID CHARLES MUNRO: Question, if that's all right?</p><p>YURESH MAHARAJ: Okay. Thanks, [Warrick]. As to our interim dividends, 40% of our full year 2018 dividends as per our dividend policy. I think we, in consideration of the dividend, we look at our core underlying earnings and clearly, in the 6 months, we have to look at sort of going forward in terms of the future for the next 6 months. And clearly, the indicators that we show is on an annualized basis. We've seen the benefits of investment markets. And we will take all of this into consideration as we go into the next 6 months in terms of assessing our full year dividend. However, it's still underpinned by our dividend policy, which he has referenced to core -- growing our core dividend earnings and a dividend cover of 2% to 2.5%. So I think there's various considerations, as you rightly pointed out. And we'll do that as we close the next 6 months of the year, which we have to appreciate that is a level of investment performance in these numbers, and we need to understand that that's the status.</p><p>As regards to the cost increase. As a group, I think we've made massive strides in terms of cost discipline, both within the Liberty and the Standard franchises. And quite rightly so sort of running below inflation now and on an absolute sort of below prior year level, these are good achievements. I think we spent a large amount of time and focus on central overheads and sort of management cost. I think these are well-sustained and within a fairly good [base]. I think where we do get injection in terms of our top line in terms of new business volumes. There will be, obviously, less to see in terms of our acquisition cost because now, I think I'm very comfortable with where our overhead costs are running at for the group and it's less than (inaudible) levels.</p><p>DAVID CHARLES MUNRO: Thanks, Yuresh. And then in respect to your question in relation to new business volumes, the first one is our targets are as high as possible. But obviously, we have budgets. We have goals in terms of production for various different parts of our business, depending on channel, depending on product type, investments versus risk. So we have a very comprehensive program towards what we're trying to deliver. Clearly, in terms of where are we seeing performance across the different channels, importantly, for us, we're seeing renewed support from the IFA channel. That's been, I think, an important feature for us in the first half of this year.</p><p>If you juxtapose that to having to work very closely with our colleagues at Standard Bank Group, and particularly the [QBP] operations of Standard Bank, as they've gone through the restructuring of the branch network, which impacts on the SBFC channel. So we've seen some impact of that through the SBFC volumes and in between that we would put our entire workforce with entrepreneur performing a little bit better than agency. Thanks, [Warrick]. [Johan], have I got that right? I'm getting a thumbs-up from Johan , so thank you. Okay. Any further questions here in Johannesburg? Okay, let's see whether we can go to the webcast and see -- am I pointing at the right thing? Webcast, start with the webcast, are there any questions from the webcast?</p><p>Sharon's telling me that there's no questions from the webcast, so then let's go to the conference call, participants on the conference call. Are there any questions? I'm looking, I think, to [Herman] on that. There's one coming.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have a question from Francois Du Toit from Citi.</p><p>FRANCOIS DU TOIT, DIRECTOR, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just quickly on the core earnings. I've seen the core earnings adjustments that you provide us, the sustainability adjustment for Standard's earnings. If you can just explain why you think Standard's sustainable earnings is ZAR 19 million lower than what was reported? Similarly, also there is a ZAR 132 million down in production for the SA Retail business for, I guess, elements you consider to be one-off, there's operating variances, assumption changes and so on. So you, based on that, you believe that there were one-off positive contributions in earnings -- in operating earnings from those 2 operations. So if you can just explain those one-offs and why you believe they're a one-off, please?</p><p>YURESH MAHARAJ: Thanks, Francois. Starting with Standard, that ZAR 18 million adjustment, I wouldn't characterize that as once-off adjustment. If you recall, last year, we set the sustainable earnings for Standard at ZAR 380 million per year. And if you sort of slice that into half year, you could see our run rate at ZAR 209 million is essentially higher than that. We've been cautious at this stage. We've just -- we've had a look at Standard's earnings on a sustainable basis 6 months ago. I think we pretty much also have to adjust that in a 6-month performance. So that's something that we look at, at the long-term through the cycle view on valuation. And hence, that's the adjustment relating to Standard.</p><p>With regards to the SA Retail business that you referred to, the ZAR 132 million, the one element within that result is the cost recoveries that we did receive on the sale of the Standard Bank -- to Standard Bank, the short-term insurance technology platform. So you're quite right that, that won't be repeatable. And furthermore, in terms of some of the variances, again, we do that on a regular basis. So there's nothing, should I say, once-off in those. However, the Standard Bank recovery of cost is clearly one that is.</p><p>FRANCOIS DU TOIT: Can you just quantify the recovery of cost component?</p><p>YURESH MAHARAJ: It's roughly around ZAR 30 million to ZAR 35 million.</p><p>DAVID CHARLES MUNRO: Great. Thank you very much, Francois. Is there any further questions here at Johannesburg? Anyone else want to ask anything? I don't think so. Any more came on the webcast conference call? Okay. Well, thank you very much, everybody. We look forward to another 6 months of very hard work and disciplined execution of our strategy. And we look forward to seeing you and reporting back for our full year in 2019 in March next year.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

I know you're all busy, so I appreciate you taking the time to listen in on the call.</p><p>As the need for better data insights continues to grow, the market for data management and technology continues to increase as well. We're making great progress with our different verticals and BIGtoken and are excited about the opportunities to leverage the 2 together. We continue to build our data assets through increasing adoption of our proprietary platforms. Through building what we predict will be one of the most valuable opt-in data sets in the world, we're well positioned to generate long-term revenue and value for our shareholders.</p><p>The data tools we're building have one theme and that is to create data assets that will return recurring revenue for the company. We believe that the ownership of this data and the recurring revenue nature of these data assets are key to our long-term growth in revenue.</p><p>As many of you know, we have close to 100 software developers in the company, and they are working diligently to deliver products that help us reach our goal of creating the most valuable opt-in data set in the world. Over this quarter, the team delivered many enhancements on our key products. I'll now review some of those enhancements and talk about how they're translating to recurring revenue for the company.</p><p>For those of you that are new to our story, our products are broken into 3 areas. First, we have -- our BIGtoken platform that's enabling consumers to own their own data and helping us revolutionize the way the data is purchased and used by marketers. Second, we have our SRAX IR platform that enables publicly traded companies understand key data points on their investors. Third, we have our verticals that are creating unique data sets in specific marketing areas such as shopper marketing, luxury consumers and automotive.</p><p>First, let's talk about SRAX IR. For those of you who are unfamiliar with SRAX IR, it's a platform that helps public companies understand who is buying and selling their stock while providing those companies with the tools to market to those investors directly.</p><p>This quarter, in our SRAX IR platform, we integrated innovative enhancements and unveiled new features that are getting great reviews from current and new users. Our Situation Room provides real-time data insights into the price that certain investors are executing stock trades, thus giving the issuers a detailed understanding of when those investors may buy and when they may sell. We added capabilities to track and manage warrants and the related documents in one location. Now users can easily monitor the impact of expirations, further they can run testing scenarios to determine what money can be raised at different levels.</p><p>One of the most innovative enhancements in the quarter is our new ability for management to access their shareholder contact data, which includes e-mail addresses, phone numbers and social media links such as a Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. Issuers can then directly reach and advertise to those investors from within the platform. The days of only snail mailing company info to investors are limited, and SRAX IR is providing the infrastructure needed to accomplish this new communication method.</p><p>With over 20 companies and partners on the platform, we are off to a great start. Each company pays $3,000 a month on a year-long contract to have access to the data. The company has a goal of reaching 100 customers by the end of 2019. SRAX IR is a perfect example of the type of platform that we believe will deliver long-term recurring revenue to our investors, while building one of most valuable data sets in the financial markets.</p><p>In Q2, our revenues from our vertical has grown 53% sequentially. During the quarter, we launched a new vertical SRAX Lux in partnership with one of the largest owners of media assets in the luxury area. We will target and reach luxury consumers at luxury retail stores; high-end art, music, film and fashion and sporting events. We're excited about entering this vertical and expect it to ramp in late 2019 and early 2020. Marketers are very interested in reaching the luxury consumers. And as we build this data set, we will be creating a very lucrative and recurring revenue stream for the company. Other verticals continue to show strength as we enter the busiest part of the year for advertising.</p><p>Last, but most certainly not least, during Q3, we achieved a major milestone as we began to monetize our BIGtoken subscriber base. During the second quarter, we engaged with media and consumer packaged goods brands and agencies, and these interactions have generated applications from our BIGtoken data that we had not originally envisioned or projected.</p><p>Also, this morning, we announced that we formed a joint venture with Yash Birla Group, one of India's largest conglomerates that has diversified interests in consumer and industrial products. We'll work with the Yash Birla Group to leverage their strong presence in India to bring BIGtoken to the country's 627 million active Internet users. The digital advertising market is 3 -- in India is $3.5 billion and is set a grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 32%, making it one of the largest growing digital ad markets in the world.</p><p>BIGtoken will provide the tools for Indian consumers to earn from the value of their data. It's a huge opportunity for the Indian people. It provides a new approach for the Yash Birla Group and SRAX to create value. And it expands our geographic reach, furthering our mission to become the undisputable global platform that gives people choice, transparency and compensation for their data, while building the world's most valuable opted-in data set.</p><p>Overall, BIGtoken's impact on our business is profound, particularly in light of the fact that media has entered another inflection point. In the last 30 years, the digital media industry had 2 major shifts driving massive growth: adoption of the Internet and adoption of mobile. Today, media has experienced the most flux since the '90s, caused by regulatory issues, browser policy updates, third-party cookie policy changes, consumer privacy concerns and general discontent with big tech.</p><p>Companies that solve privacy problems will win, and it's clear that proprietary data is a huge asset. As such, we believe it's especially important for us to focus on growing our data assets right now and maintain our first-mover position with BIGtoken.</p><p>As you know, we decided to raise additional capital this last week. While we do not need the capital immediately, given the current market conditions, we wanted to take the conservative approach and raise capital from existing investors who've been good holders of the stock in the past. We've raised $5.5 million and netted just over $5 million after all fees.</p><p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Kris Nelson to review BIGtoken in greater detail.</p><p>KRISTOFFER E. NELSON, COO &amp; DIRECTOR, SOCIAL REALITY, INC.: Thank you, Chris. With BIGtoken, we continue to make progress, positioning ourselves for growth by introducing new features, expanding our commercial offerings and beginning to monetize in the third quarter.</p><p>At the beginning of Q2, we experienced viral growth in our subscriber base. And today, we have 15.9 million subscribers. Due to the magnitude of this growth, particularly internationally, we had to quickly shift gears from our plans of growing predictably in United States to an enthusiastic global community.</p><p>This impacted several initiatives and shifted priorities. We adjusted our sign-up process. Now instead of using the desktop, users are required to download the application, which generates more data, including location data, device IDs, advertising IDs and provides a richer and more immediate experience for users. While the app sign-up requirement as well as additional points of verification have slowed down our pace of registrations, the app delivered better data that will be far more valuable in the long term.</p><p>Next, we're leveraging referrals as our primary marketing tool. We have active programs to incent people to invite their friends and family to the platform. After refining these programs over the last few months, we're implementing them at scale now. If you haven't yet, search BIGtoken on YouTube, Twitter and Instagram to see the participation and engagement. Take a moment to check it out.</p><p>We're impressed by our community's creativity and enthusiasm. As a result of this, our marketing costs have been negligible. Going forward, to drive growth and acceleration in specific countries, we anticipate increasing targeted marketing spend. To engage subscribers by providing additional value and to create more partnership opportunities, we are continually introducing additional methods for our subscribers to use their data payment.</p><p>In last quarter, we announced partnerships with The ALS Association, which has celebrated its fifth anniversary of the Ice Bucket Challenge; HealthCorps; and Keep a Child Alive. We added Walmart, Xbox Live and Apple gift card options to the application, among many others.</p><p>To service subscribers across the globe, we are working on more international capabilities. Some of the tools we had in our development pipeline were accelerated to help us handle the viral growth. As such, many of our resources were diverted through this effort away from commercial and business features that were being developed. Focusing on our users will produce long-term value. We now have the tools that are capable of handling a global subscriber base. We are building scale within data segments in specific countries, reaching to commercially viable data sets for advertising scale.</p><p>Along these lines, as Chris mentioned, we announced that we entered into an arrangement with one of India's largest conglomerates, the Yash Birla Group, to launch BIGtoken in India. You may recall our announcement about Asia in May. And we're pursuing other opportunities with market leaders in countries where we've seen accelerated growth.</p><p>Finally, we recently announced that our users now have the ability to import their data from Facebook automatically into the BIGtoken platform. We will be adding a multitude of other platforms, including Amazon, Twitter, and LinkedIn. This greatly enriches our data set by providing new data and verifying the data we have. This also allows for consumers to earn from the full body of their existing data.</p><p>Moving on to our commercial growth and revenue scale. We have been actively engaged with brands and several marketing agencies to leverage BIGtoken's high-quality user data for advertising targeting, research and redemption offers. This is all done with the complete user transparency and opt-in, with value going directly to consumers.</p><p>As a business, our cost of data in research is decreasing while consumers greatly benefit. We've begun monetizing our advertising targeting data at initial scale, while we continue to grow our taxonomy to full operational size.</p><p>A few initial opportunities have emerged, and I'd like to spend a little bit more time focusing on the research capabilities of the platform. BIG was created to solve inefficiencies and inaccuracies in advertising data targeting. We've discovered the same systems we use to create data at scale and analyze its accuracy, is ideal for brand research, media measurement and advertising impact, an attribution. And this has created new partnership and revenue opportunities.</p><p>With existing market tools, creating and scaling research panels is slow and inefficient. Between 40% and 60% of survey responses are inaccurate and data set is typically limited to specific consumer responses. The BIGtoken platform can immediately scale consumer population targeted opt-in research panels with thousands of participants. In a recent activation, we reached over 45,000 people in just a few days.</p><p>The systems we use to analyze the accuracy and relevancy of a data point for media targeting will solve the accuracy problems, giving BIG research a very high level of certainty and confidence. The BIG Data graph has now 12,000 unique data points for each consumer, which include purchase transaction, location, loyalty program and historical social media data provided a very rich data insight. We believe BIGtoken is the future of brand research.</p><p>Another unique opportunity is media measurement. Content consumption has dramatically changed over the last 15 years, with consumers viewing and interacting with media on multiple screens from many different platforms. The tools for measuring viewership and consumption are no longer effective. Currently, television ad spend in the U.S., which is over $100 billion, is governed by a panel of 41,000 households, which does not consider the many devices and the unique preferences of individuals and misses the growing population of cord-cutters. This legacy measurement currency no longer holds value.</p><p>In stark contrast, BIGtoken can effortlessly scale panels to millions of people, measuring all devices and content consumed down to the individual level and include follow-on research for advertising impact in sales attribution.</p><p>This is a massive shift. We're very excited about the research and measurement capabilities of BIGtoken and are already conducting programs for brand strategy, consumer and media consumption and advertising campaign measurement. The legacy tools for consumer and media consumption and advertising measurement are now ineffective, and this is an exciting market opportunity for innovation.</p><p>Our current global reach and depth of data makes the platform ideal for immediate research programs, while we scale to optimal size for data targeting and activation in key geographies. For media targeting, we're focused on deals with the largest brands and agencies and are making custom BIGtoken segments available to them. And as time goes on, we'll initiate deals with third-party platforms to achieve greater scale. BIGtoken is the leading edge for the new data economy. We're very excited for what the future holds.</p><p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike Malone for financial review.</p><p>MICHAEL THOMAS MALONE, CFO, SOCIAL REALITY, INC.: Thanks, Kris. For Q2 2019, total revenue was $904,000, increasing 53% compared to the first quarter 2019. Vertical revenue grew 53% compared to the first quarter 2019 and 8% compared to the second quarter 2018, excluding SRAXmd and Reach, which were sold or discontinued, respectively.</p><p>Gross margins for the verticals were 54% compared to 50% in the first quarter 2019 and 30% in the second quarter of 2018, which excluded discontinued products.</p><p>Operating expenses were $5.1 million compared to $4.5 million in the first quarter of '19 and $3.7 million in the second quarter of 2018, which excluded discontinued products. The increase reflects investment in BIGtoken and our sales infrastructure.</p><p>Q2 2019 net loss of $8.1 million included a charge of $2.9 million related to a noncash warrant valuation adjustment. This compares to Q2 2018 net loss of $4 million, which included a charge of $1 million related to noncash warrant valuation adjustments as well as operations from discontinued products.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA loss was $4 million. This compares to Q2 2018 with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.3 million, excluding discontinued products.</p><p>Now turning to our balance sheet. During the quarter, we raised a total of $8.8 million through various equity offerings. And as of June 30, 2019, we had $2.5 million of cash on hand in addition to being debt free. As Chris mentioned, earlier this week, we raised $5.5 million to register a direct offering.</p><p>And at June 30, 2019, there were approximately 12.5 million shares outstanding. And after this recent raise, we have approximately 13.9 million shares outstanding. We remain confident in our growth prospects across our verticals and BIGtoken, as demand for data insights continues to increase.</p><p>And now I'd like to turn the call back to Chris.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MIGLINO: Thanks, Mike. The digital media industry is changing drastically. As with any industry transition, we can't predict the timing of the exact outcome, yet it is very clear that proprietary data is a huge asset to researchers, advertisers, sales and marketing and more.</p><p>We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from these changes in the market. We're seeing evidence of this need in our everyday conversations. Agencies want to meet to understand the BIGtoken data assets. And the marketers we work with recognize the need to engage in the conversation of data ownership.</p><p>And as the marketers dig deeper, they want to know how our verticals can help, and BIGtoken is opening doors to new opportunities for the whole company. As such, the lines between BIGtoken and our verticals are blurring. And to fuel our momentum, ours sales team is shifting resources towards BIGtoken.</p><p>Therefore, we are prioritizing our focus on growing our data assets right now. Our geographical expansion furthers our mission to become the undisputed platform offering everyone choice, transparency and compensation for the data, while building the most valuable opt-in data set in the world.</p><p>Before I open the call to questions, I would like to note that you can see us at several investor events. In September, we'll be at the LD Micro Summit in San Francisco and the D.A. Davidson 18th Annual Tech Conference in New York. In October, we'll be at the B. Riley Consumer &amp; Media Conference and the LD Micro Big Apple Summit in New York.</p><p>I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&amp;A.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Jim McIlree with Chardan Capital.</p><p>JAMES PATRICK MCILREE, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST OF INDUSTRIAL AND CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY, CHARDAN CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: In times past, you've talked about revenue for the year between $20 million and $25 million. I was hoping you could comment on that, given all the changes that have taken place with BIGtoken over the past few months.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MIGLINO: So when we -- thanks, Jim. When we first did that analysis, it was -- we weren't including the BIGtoken focus. So we're working through the numbers right now on the transactions that we've signed. We have some pretty substantial transactions that we've done for BIGtoken that are happening in the third and fourth quarter of this year. So that's why we're not making any adjustments to the guidance as of yet, because we're still processing what new transactions are coming in from the BIGtoken side of things.</p><p>Like I said earlier, what we're finding is that our verticals are starting to merge a little bit into the BIGtoken side of things. So you have the biggest transactions that we're closing on BIGtoken are very Shopper-marketing-oriented. And so we're finding a lot of the revenue shifting over from Shopper into the BIGtoken side. And then the research stuff that's happening, we had not planned on generating any revenue in research, but we're finding that, that's a big line item for us with some really substantial brands.</p><p>So we don't have any adjustments as of now to the -- to where the revenue might be. But as we go into the third quarter and we get some view as to how the BIGtoken revenue is going to come in, then we'll give some more insight into what those -- the revenues at the end of the year might look like and what that margin profile might look like as well, because the BIGtoken margins are significantly higher than our regular margins are.</p><p>JAMES PATRICK MCILREE: It sounds like with the merging of -- the -- merging might be too a strong word, but you know what I mean, the merging of BIGtoken with the vertical. That -- the revenue that you are expecting just might be classified differently, although it would still be -- you would still expect to generate a similar level than what you had expected 3 months ago and 4 months ago. Did I -- is that what you're saying?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MIGLINO: Yes, I'm saying that I think that we're still evaluating that. We're not at a point where we can say that it's going to be a lot more than that or lot less than that. We're just -- I want to see in the pipeline before we make that call, and that's why we haven't made any adjustments to it on this call. But I think that there is revenue coming in there, and we're recognizing that now and those deals are happening. So I think there is definitely opportunity. And we're going into the busier part of the year for advertising, so we're -- there is a natural uptick into the second part of the year as well.</p><p>JAMES PATRICK MCILREE: All right. That's helpful. Kris Nelson talked about a number of initiatives that you have in BIGtoken. And I was just wondering, the order that you presented them, Kris, is that the order that you think are the most impactful either on a revenue line or a growth line or addressable market line? I'm just wondering if there's any anything we can draw from how you laid out the different initiatives that you have underway with BIGtoken. And specifically, I'm talking about the market research, and it sounds like a white-labeling product as well.</p><p>KRISTOFFER E. NELSON: Yes. So I think market research is our leading edge. That's driving a lot of conversation now as we brought the product in and shared the technology and its capabilities. Especially through our ability to scale groups quickly and analyze data for accuracy and consistency, brands were coming to us and really bringing these initiatives forward to us, which has created whole new product sets. And so we look at that as the leading edge. That's also kicked in the ability for us to target specific offers and promotions to specific groups. Sometimes that's coupled with research, sometimes it's not. And we look at that as a new leading product set as well.</p><p>As we talked about on the call earlier, segments are scaling and that opportunity right now is targeted to specific brands and agencies, and we're building those direct relationships. As the segment population continues to scale, we'll move from those custom data sets and targeting opportunities to broader platform distribution. And so we're looking at those high-touch relationships first. We want to dig in and build out those specific relationships with advertisers and brand marketers, and we'll continue to scale beyond that.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from Mike Crawford with B. Riley FBR.</p><p>MICHAEL ROY CRAWFORD, SENIOR MD, CO-HEAD OF THE DISCOVERY GROUP &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, B. RILEY FBR, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I'd just like to go back to that prior revenue guidance discussion where at one point you were looking -- you thought over $20 million of revenue for the year was a decent estimate and that was maybe even without much contribution from BIGtoken. And then, Chris, it seemed like you were saying that now the BIGtoken interest is additive. So would you say that you're more likely to then increase that guidance and have like a really -- like, I guess, monstrous second half compared to the first half? Or that it's still too early to call exactly what the second half is going to look like, so it could equally be less than $20 million for the year?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MIGLINO: Yes. So the point I was trying to make earlier was that it's not additive to it, because what we're finding is that the sales team is bringing BIGtoken in our different verticals to their media-buying customers and those customers are interested in launching a number of different initiatives. So while the team was responsible for the $20 million in revenue from the year from the media perspective, we're finding that data side of the business that they're bringing to the table is getting merged into that. So I don't think it will be higher than that.</p><p>And the contribution coming in from the verticals is going to be lower, but BIGtoken is contributing. So it's going to bring us back to a level, but we just don't know how high that will be quite yet, because those deals are just starting now. All the research and the different shopper marketing campaigns are launched at the beginning of the third quarter of this year.</p><p>MICHAEL ROY CRAWFORD: Okay. Thank you. That makes -- that's helpful. And previously, you had also talked about an interesting kind of a toolbar like add-on that could potentially block ads that consumers are not getting paid for from showing up on their mobile screens, though I think development of that particular application was maybe taking a backseat to some of these more market-leading projects that you have. Is that still the case? Or is that something that we should, like, expect soon?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MIGLINO: Yes. It's on the radar. The viral growth that we had at the beginning of the quarter, of the second quarter certainly had an impact on that development. The team was working 24/7 just to make sure everything was up and running. And so a lot of -- that's what Kris was saying, and a lot of those initiatives got pushed back a little bit, because when you went from 0 to hundreds of thousands of people signing up every day, it was quite a change. And so some of those things have gotten pushed back, but we're certainly -- is on the drawing board and designed out to be built along with many other features.</p><p>So we have a lot of developers that work within the company, and they're constantly going from sprint to sprint. So we have a bunch of stuff that is being developed now that is revenue-generating-centric, so things that the advertisers that we're cutting deals with want. And so we're implementing those things first, because they have revenue behind them. And then once we're done with those things, then we're going to bring in some additional things. And we'll look to bring in partnerships with additional ad blockers. And our biz dev teams have been talking to some of the other ad blocking companies to partner with them within the BIGtoken ecosystem so that we can leverage their installed base already.</p><p>MICHAEL ROY CRAWFORD: Okay. And then I know the company doesn't break out specifically where the user -- or the people that have opted in are located geographically. But I think at one point, you may have commented that around half or at least half were U.S.-based. Is that an accurate statement?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MIGLINO: I don't think I ever said that unless me and you're having a beer somewhere. But I think that we haven't broken that up out in the marketplace, but it's -- in order to attract the likes of the big corporate 100, 500 customers that we're attracting to the platform, you have to have scale in the United States. And so we have what it takes to make that happen. But certainly, we're getting exposure in other markets, and that's why we cut the deal with -- to grow into China. We didn't have any presence there, but we hope to. India, we cut the deal with the Birla Group to be able to service the customers that are there and to help grow it.</p><p>So yes -- and we have a lot of other markets like that. We have conversations going across South America for users and also in Southeast Asia. And so you'll -- you should expect to see additional partnerships in each of those markets with very substantial companies.</p><p>MICHAEL ROY CRAWFORD: Okay. And then last question is on this joint venture with Yash Birla. Is there a financial contribution the company is making or will be disclosed?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MIGLINO: They're bringing -- they own around 10 publicly traded companies and a number of privately traded companies and they have a number of interests in a lot of entertainment assets inside of India. So we're leveraging their marketing capabilities and their know-how with the advertising agencies inside of India. So they're bringing the -- they're bringing marketing and sales to the table, and we're bringing tech. So that's the partnership. And if at some point if we -- if they want to contribute additional capital, we'll certainly entertain that. But it's more from a partnership perspective. And we've known them for long time. We know they have the capability to do this. And we're excited to get them started.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from David Lavigne with Trickle Research.</p><p>DAVID LAVIGNE, FOUNDER &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, TRICKLE RESEARCH, LLC: So I'm still trying to get my arms around this revenue transition a little bit. So it sounds to me like if we get through the end of the year, if we're transitioning maybe sort of out of the verticals and more into BIGtoken, which is kind of -- seems like maybe the path it was going to go. If we do get to the end of the year and we have more than $20 million revenues, is it reasonable to assume, though, that, that $20 million or $18 million or $17 million or whatever is, would likely carry a better margin than had that occurred in the traditional verticals then?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MIGLINO: Yes, for sure, because we're -- even though the margin is up and -- even though the margin is up to 55% over, I believe it was, 30-something percent the year before, we're -- the products that we're building now are much more SaaS-based. BIGtoken can be seen as a like SaaS-based platform, where you build it once, you acquire the data, and then it could be sold multiple times again and again, and the cost of that process isn't as high.</p><p>And same with SRAX IR. Just SRAX IR alone, if we get to 100 companies, which is the goal by the end of the year, you're talking about $300,000 a month in recurring revenue with a 90% margin. So that alone is, I think, worth more than the market cap of the company as it stands today. And then you add on top of that whatever we -- the value that we're building inside of BIGtoken and then you add on top of that whatever value we have in the other assets that are not recognized on our balance sheet, like our 30% ownership in the md business, I think that we're at a point where this -- the company has a lot of value.</p><p>DAVID LAVIGNE: Is the -- can you talk about a little bit about the sales process for IR? Will that be broader question to deal with here?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MIGLINO: No, no. We mentioned...</p><p>DAVID LAVIGNE: Because I was just kind of wondering how you go about it.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MIGLINO: So we -- a lot of the referrals are coming in from other people that are on the platform already or from IR firms and from our direct sales team. And the way it works is we tell them that we can help them with understanding who their shareholder base is. And then we show them the platform. We show them how we use it to understand who's buying and selling and what prices they're buying and selling at. And it's invaluable data at the end of the day for a publicly traded company. Just to even understand who is selling is really important. And how many shares they have left is important for a CEO, a CFO to understand. And so we show them all the tools around that.</p><p>And the new stuff that we've built in there is the ability -- on a NOBO list, you can pull a NOBO list, you can get a name and an address. And we've created it so now you can get a e-mail, a phone number, a LinkedIn profile, a Twitter profile and the Facebook profile of that consumer. So as a CEO, if I see somebody has 50,000, 100,000 shares, I can connect with them on LinkedIn and I can send them a message directly and say, \"Look, I see you own a lot of stock in the company. If you'd like to have a phone call with us, let us know.\" And we've automated that process to make those invites happen within the LinkedIn environment. And just adding all of the -- in the latest release -- Dave, we should reconnect and do another presentation of it. But there's So many additions that have happened, even since the last time that you and I have talked about it. But there is -- that's -- we just go through and show the CEO the -- or the CFO the platform and how we use it, and that's the sales process. And then we typically give them a 3-month free period to get launched, because it takes a couple of months to get data into the platform. And at first, doesn't have as much value as it does 2 months in. So we give them the ability to get a couple of months for free and then they start paying after that, and it just becomes invaluable for them.</p><p>DAVID LAVIGNE: Do you have any sense of whether the price point -- I mean -- originally, I don't want to say it was random. But is the price point seemed to be in the right place? Or do you feel like that's...</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MIGLINO: Yes, it -- yes, I think that it gets rid of the really small cap companies and it brings in companies that can afford to make it happen. And we're finding we have a couple of billion dollar companies that are using the platform, so it's not all small cap stuff. And we're just, and we're -- and I just want to point out, we're building a massive database of public company investors, and that is invaluable. That's an invaluable data set.</p><p>DAVID LAVIGNE: Agreed. On the OpEx piece, it sounds like you still aren't spending a great deal of money in terms of marketing BIGtoken or maybe it's just how we're defining marketing. But is most -- but there did sound like there was a pretty sizable increase in OpEx because of BIGtoken. Is that largely development stuff then?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MIGLINO: Yes. There was -- even though we haven't spent that much money, I think it was like -- something like $180,000 or so in marketing for the quarter. And -- but we also -- we have a cost of money that we paid out to the consumers. So we paid out some money to the consumers on the platform. That's an expense. And we did -- and we have hired up additional resources on the programming side to build out the new features like the stuff that Mike was talking about earlier.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Michael Kupinski with Noble Financial.</p><p>MICHAEL A. KUPINSKI, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AND SENIOR MEDIA &amp; ENTERTAINMENT ANALYST, NOBLE CAPITAL MARKETS, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I kind of want to drill down back on BIGtoken. I know that you're trying to monetize the subscribers that you have now. And I was just trying to benchmark this, because I would imagine that advertisers are really going to be focused on North American subscribers and probably not internationally. Tell me if I'm wrong about that. And I was just wondering if you could just kind of frame for me what are -- what is the opportunity at this stage at the 15.9 million subscribers that you have, what are the monetization opportunity that you have. And then if you could talk a little bit about what is the number of subscribers that you would like to see in North America before you could really hit your stride in terms of monetizing the numbers of subscribers that you have.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MIGLINO: The first thing that I think you're asking was is the amount of -- like what are opportunities in the revenue? Like are we -- what are we seeing as different opportunities across different markets? And the reason -- and not only U.S., right? The reason we're partnering with people in India, with people in China, with people in Southeast Asia, people in South America is because boots on the ground are important to the sales process. We have consumers in those markets, and we want partners that can bring expertise with the agencies and with the brands that are working in those markets.</p><p>Now from a Fortune 500 perspective, we are selling campaigns globally to those people, not only in the United States. So when we're talking to them about research, they're saying, \"Okay. Can you launch these questions in Brazil? Can you launch these questions in Mexico? Can you launch these questions in North America?\" So these are different questions as it relates to the audience.</p><p>Then on the revenue side, we're -- on the revenue side, we never -- we didn't anticipate that the research piece was going to be so valuable. And what we are finding is that the advertisers, in order to get a panel of people like Kris was mentioning earlier, like a Nielsen panel, is driven by only so many households. We have the ability to launch into millions of households at the same time. So instead of being limited to 50,000 people, we can then -- we can come to market for an advertiser and create a panel of millions of people. And brand marketers are willing to pay a monthly fee for each person that joins a panel. So they'll pay us a certain amount of money for each person that joins into a certain type of panel for a brand and then answers questions about that brand and gives insights about that brand, scans barcodes if they buy that product, takes pictures of receipts if they buy those products. There is a lot of opportunity there, which we had not anticipated when we launched the platform. But we're getting a lot of deals along those lines.</p><p>And as far as the number of people that we'd like to see, we had a massive viral growth. It's kind of -- we've grown like another million since we had our massive viral growth. And now we're going to -- I think we'll kick back into it as we start to launch in each of these individual markets, I think we'll start to see growth come back again. So a short-term goal would be to get to 20 million. I think that would be a really big accomplishment for the entire platform. Now keep in mind, we have not spent barely any money on marketing. This has all been consumer-to-consumer viral growth. And so our goal is to continue to incentivize those people to keep that growth going, and we're creating initiatives around that.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris for closing remarks.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MIGLINO: Thanks, everybody. I appreciate you taking the time to join us today.</p><p>The digital media industry is changing a lot. As with any industry transition, you can -- we can't predict the timing of the exact outcome, but it's really clear to us that proprietary data is a huge asset to researchers, advertisers, sales and marketing and more. We believe that we're really well positioned to benefit from the changes in the market. We're seeing evidence that -- of this need in our everyday conversations. Agencies want to meet to understand the BIGtoken data assets. And marketers we work with recognize the need to engage in the conversation of data ownership.</p><p>And as marketers dig deeper, they want to know how our verticals can help and BIGtoken is opening doors to new opportunities for the whole company. As such, the lines between BIGtoken and our verticals are blurring, like we just talked about. And to fuel our momentum, our sales team is shifting resources towards BIGtoken. We're prioritizing our focus on growing our data assets right now. We think that's a very important value proposition for the company. The asset of data itself is invaluable. Our geographical expansion furthers our mission to become the undisputed platform, offering everyone choice, transparency and compensation for their data, while building what we think is the most valuable opt-in data set in the world.</p><p>And I think that's a really important thing to focus on, is we are building a data set that is invaluable, not only -- like not only is it an invaluable data set, but we're building a data set that is opted in from consumers that have said, \"Yes, you can market to me. Yes, you can advertise to me. And yes, I'll participate in that.\" So that's a really important piece to the entire equation.</p><p>So we're going to be at a few investor conferences coming up. We're doing the LA (sic) [LD] Micro Summit in San Francisco. We're going to be at the D.A. Davidson 18th Annual Tech Conference in New York in September. And then in October, we'll be at the B. Riley Consumer &amp; Media Conference and the LD Micro Big Apple Summit in New York.</p><p>I would now like to turn the call back over to the operator. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you.

(Operator Instructions)</p><p>I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Chris Toth. Thank you, Mr. Toth. You may begin.</p><p>CHRIS TOTH, VP OF IR, THE TRADE DESK, INC.: Thank you, operator. Hello and welcome to The Trade Desk Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Our call today is taking place today from our Ventura headquarters. On the line is our Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Paul Ross. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com, in the Investor Relations section.</p><p>Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, the matters that we'll be describing will be forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings.</p><p>In addition to the GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures combined with our GAAP results provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance.</p><p>I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?</p><p>JEFFREY TERRY GREEN, FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, THE TRADE DESK, INC.: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. I'm excited to announce that our revenue growth accelerated to 42% in Q2 compared with 41% last quarter. Our accelerating growth is a testament to the increasing trust that major global advertisers are placing in us as they shift more of their advertising dollars to programmatic. To understand the significance of our growth, we need to provide context for what is happening to advertising from a macro perspective.</p><p>In 2019, according to IVC, global advertising spend will be about $725 billion, up over 4% from 2018. At current growth rates, global advertising will be $1 trillion industry in about 7 years, one of the only handful of industries with a TAM over that mark. Programmatic is still a relatively small part of total global advertising. It is estimated at around $34 billion in 2019. But it is growing 5x faster than total advertising at around 20% year-over-year according to Magna Global. We maintain our predictions that, before long, most advertising will be digital and nearly all of it will be transacted programmatically. This puts us in the fastest-growing segment of an expanding industry where we expect to continue to aggressively take share.</p><p>We saw this in our results last year. We are continuing to outperform the industry again this year, which is reflected in our biggest Q2 to date. But more significant than comparing our company's performance now to our performance in the past, our growth rate is 10x the pace of overall advertising growth, and in fact, our growth is nearly 4x the growth rate of digital.</p><p>There are many reasons for our industry-leading growth rate. Some of our growth is coming because we're executing well in capturing opportunities, but other growth drivers are secular. The digitization of advertising, particularly TV, is massive. The shift to data-driven decisioning versus guessing or intuition is game changing. These changes in the landscape significantly benefit us. We have created our strategy, our technology and our business model to take advantage of these shifts.</p><p>As a result, more advertisers are standardizing on our platform. Every brand and every agency knows that they need to be engaged in programmatic advertising, which is another way of saying that every brand has come to understand that advertising using data-driven decisions is much more powerful and effective than simply following intuition alone. Our results are proof that this is occurring.</p><p>For example, in the second quarter, we signed 55 new MSAs representing some of the largest brands on the planet. This is the highest number of new MSAs we have signed in one quarter since the end of 2016. Through the first half of the year, 60% of the Fortune 500 companies are now growing advertising through The Trade Desk. More brands, nearly 50,000 of them, mostly through their agencies, are moving more of their ad budgets into data-driven advertising.</p><p>These numbers are very telling because once advertisers embrace this model, they start to shift more of their budget into it. Once one person on an agency account or a brand starts to realize the value of data-driven precision, then others start to adopt it across much more channels. We see evidence of this everywhere.</p><p>For example, in Q2, EMEA had continued solid growth and share gains. Our offices in both Madrid and Paris achieved record spend in Q2. We added more major advertisers, and more accounts grew their spend with us. During the quarter, we added a large regional hotel chain and a smart home energy company, to name a few. We are seeing similar trends in APAC, where our offices in Hong Kong, Jakarta and Sydney all achieved record spend. We are also seeing exciting growth in many of Asia's fastest growing emerging markets.</p><p>eMarketer defined Southeast Asia and SingaporeIndonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines. They predict digital mobile growth there to be about 35% in 2019. In several countries, we are growing exponentially faster than that. For example, in Vietnam, we grew 125% year-over-year. In these smaller, but fast-growing markets, data-driven advertising is the perfect fit. The cost of sales and distribution is way lower, and market-moving shifts require adoption from fewer people. I continue to predict that these emerging markets will be nearly 100% data-driven before the U.S.</p><p>To continue demand in these emerging markets, you have to grow supply. That's why I'm excited about the premium inventory partnerships we have developed in Asia. For example, in Thailand, we access the country's top TV digital platforms, Channel 7 and Channel 3. We also access TrueID TV, the second largest broadcaster in Thailand. In Vietnam, we partnered with the largest free TV station, VTV. Globally, our commitment to invest and innovate in the channels that matter most to advertisers is a major driver of growth for The Trade Desk.</p><p>In Q2, 47% of spend on our platform was in mobile. That's a new record. Mobile video spend growth was about 50%. Mobile in-app spend growth was about 63%. Data spend, again, was about 80%, and cross-device spend was up over 250% for the third quarter in a row. Audio, which I believe is the best value in programmatic today, grew almost 3x in Q2 for the second quarter in a row. Connected TV spend growth was also amazing, growing nearly 3x from a year ago.</p><p>I said before that we will likely never see a channel larger and more full of opportunity than we have right now in CTV. Much of what we've done over the last decade has simply been a dress rehearsal for the digital shift happening in TV right now. This is important because as we drive towards $1 trillion total advertising market by 2027, about half of that market will be in some form of video, and most of that will be in premium TVs.</p><p>We are at the very beginning of the digitization of TV advertising. More and more consumers watch TV content through connected devices. And as they do that, advertisers are getting a much better understanding of who's watching their ads and how they are responding. This enables advertisers to apply real data to their large TV ad campaigns for the first time, making those campaigns more precise and more effective. This kind of targeting is simply not possible with linear TV.</p><p>This is especially important for major consumer brands who are among the most aggressive in embracing data-driven advertising. For them, brand differentiation is critical. They are facing unprecedented margin pressures in their core business. Getting smarter, more precise and more scientific about how they invest their ad dollars is a very effective way of maintaining and enhancing brand value. And nowhere is this more apparent than in TV.</p><p>Nearly every discussion I've had over the last few months with advertisers or content providers starts with the potential of Connected TV. It was the #1 point of discussion during the recent upfront season and at the recent Cannes Lions conference. Every top advertiser wants to know how they can best access CTV inventory at scale and how they can apply programmatic to it.</p><p>On the publisher side, all of the major premium TV content providers in the world want to know how they can make more of their premium content available for programmatic demand. This is driving our premium inventory supply growth that we see every quarter.</p><p>In Q2, our CTV inventory growth was up over 3x from a year ago, but our momentum doesn't stop there. We've recently announced that Amazon Publisher Services is working with The Trade Desk. This is a breakthrough deal in Connected TV for several reasons. As always, let's start big picture, then zoom in on what this means directly for our business and our advertisers. This announcement is a victory for the open Internet. So many decisions by big tech players have created walls around their content and reduced transparency for advisers. In this deal, Amazon has taken a different path. By making this announcement, they're staking 4 claims: one, they are joining the open Internet; two, aside from advertising on Amazon.com, they are centering their efforts on the cell side; three, they are going to reduce the cost of cell side fees significantly while being completely transparent; and four, they are partnering with the demand side instead of the go-it-alone strategy that the walled gardens often deploy.</p><p>Let me tell you why I believe these points are significant. Advertisers on our platform now have access to 100% of Amazon's third-party content providers: think Discovery, NBC and ESPN apps on your Amazon Fire Stick. This is quality inventory on premium content. With APS, we have a joint focus on improving the consumer experience by doing better with ad frequency. Amazon is providing an anonymized ID, very similar to the IDFA anonymized ID that Apple shares in its mobile ecosystem, and we can use this to measure reach and frequency across the entire Internet, but also allow brands to unlock the power of their own data and insights, their most valuable data, to drive ad relevance across the TV ecosystem.</p><p>In so doing, Amazon Publishing Services is supporting the open Internet, in contrast to big tech walled gardens. It's a strategic move, which I believe will put significant pressure on the other CTV aggregators. And finally, Amazon is being transparent about their fee structure in exactly how much the publisher will receive, something that's very important to us and something I'll come back to shortly.</p><p>We are equally excited to be working with other major TV content providers. For some of them, it's the realization that more than half of their viewership is now coming from connected devices. For others, it's the realization that live TV events, such as sports and political debates, are driving massive new viewership on connected devices. They need to overhaul their models to allow for ad price optimization during unpredictable spikes in demand. This requires a new business model, and these providers are coming to us to partner on that strategy work.</p><p>We are driving similar relationships internationally. In Europe, for example, we are working directly with many of the largest media companies, such as RTL Group, ProSieben, Mediaset, and others. Across Asia, we have access to many of the top OTC video streaming services, such as TVB, HOOQ, iflix, View and Lion TV, just to name a few.</p><p>Across all of these relationships, our focus is on monetizing premium ad-funded content. This contrast with walled garden platforms, which prioritize user-generated content. Premium content is more valuable to advertisers because it's much higher quality, it's inherently more brand safe, viewers cannot skip through these ads typically, and there are better content-to-ad ratios.</p><p>This shift towards premium content will also force big walled garden platforms to reevaluate their take rates and margins. All in, they're offering it at something like 50% today. Emerging platforms, including Amazon and others who are just starting to make their content available, are operating at a fraction of that, and often with significantly more premium content. In this environment, more advertisers such as The Hershey Company are shifting more of their campaigns to The Trade Desk. In fact, Hershey has consolidated much of its programmatic advertising on our platform. They've gone from several DSPs down to just one, which gives them simpler line of sight into the effectiveness of their programmatic campaign.</p><p>They share our view that data analytics, transparency and user experience are critical to driving greater effectiveness as they emphasize TV across all their campaigns based off in The Trade Desk, a partner who can help them drive greater relevance and success. They've built a small internal team at Hershey that manages their agencies and their relationship with us. That team focuses on areas such as audience targeting, social media marketing and data science. They're building in-house programmatic capability because like an increasing number of major advertisers, they want to get a much better handle on supply transparency.</p><p>Which brings me to another point that I want to make. Since our last report, we have started to see a lot more regulatory focus on big tech, and much of it has to do with how they manage their ad platforms and the consumer data that they manage through. Many of you have asked what this means for our industry and for our company. To answer that, I want to take a step back and try to give you some context as to why we do what we do because I don't think we've talked enough about this or taken enough credit for the pressure we are putting on the advertising ecosystem to be more transparent about data, pricing and value.</p><p>As I mentioned before, the total addressable market for advertising is on a growth march towards $1 trillion, driven by growing demand from advertisers to apply data to their ad campaigns and drive greater precision and relevance. This growing ad market is also driving the Internet as we know it today. This includes not only content delivered over computers and phones, it's also Internet-fueled TV that is right now the most exciting growth area within advertising.</p><p>But to sustain that great content, advertising must keep up and keep innovating. In the near term, as CTV advertising grows rapidly, that means fewer ads with greater relevancy. But the data that will fuel more relevant advertising won't come from TV viewing data alone. It will come from where you click on your many devices, what other content you interact with, and an understanding of what else you are interested in.</p><p>So let me give you a sense of how we approach data, and how he put it to work, and a couple of the initiatives that we have pioneered in our industry to improve transparency, confidence and the power of data analytics.</p><p>We have a very consumer-friendly position on data. We do not transact indirectly identifiable data. We don't want the data that comes from owning the search engine, and we don't want the personal information and social graph that comes from operating the social network. We don't need it. And this is a huge distinction for us when compared to the walled gardens who are under huge scrutiny on this issue.</p><p>We don't know your name, your address or the details of your health. We know about the products you are interested in and the content you tend to like. We can put that data to work to help our advertisers build an understanding of the kind of advertising that should be relevant to you. All of this data is anonymized. Our acquisition of Adbrain has been hugely important in our ability to advance this kind of work. Adbrain's AI helps us integrate insights across environments in a way that protects consumer data by using only anonymized information.</p><p>This is a differentiator for our advertisers who are hyper focused on protecting the integrity of their consumer relationships, which sometimes go back decades. But let's look a little closer. Because of our leadership position on the demand side of advertising, advertisers also expect us to leverage that position to apply pressure to the supply side of ad tech. Over the last 2 or 3 years, we have done exactly that, often behind the scenes. And in doing so, we've used our strong position as the leader in the open Internet to make the Internet better.</p><p>As we do this, our focus is on improving the ad ecosystem for all players so that everyone benefits. We firmly believe that the more transparent the ecosystem is, the more confidence advertisers will have in it, and the more demand it will drive. That's why we developed and then gave away our unified ID solution. As the largest independent demand side platform, we have a massive cookie footprint leveraging the scale through unified ID radically improves match rates across the ecosystem. This is true even when the transactions aren't on our platform. Both demand and supply side companies can use the unified ID to drive a much more transparent view of users across the ecosystem. This is all done anonymously, with no directly identifiable information. We have seen match rates go from what was considered decent by industry standards, around 50% to 60%, to close to 100% for those who use a unified ID. On the supply side, we've seen CPMs more than double in some cases.</p><p>Every day, more and more companies are deploying it. It's great for advertisers who have a much cleaner view of their market. It's great for publishers who can drive greater value, and it's great for other DSPs as it takes one of their major challenges and radically simplifies it. And of course, it's great for us. While it may seem counterintuitive to create the technology and then give it away, we believe that it helps create a growing competitive market, and we believe we will take an outsized share of that market.</p><p>Another major initiative on the supply side has been our partnership with White Ops to scrub all ad inventory for fraud. Three years ago, if you were at any digital advertising industry conference or event, the #1 issue was fraud. Advertisers were worried that they would inadvertently buy fraudulent ad spots. The problem at that time was that those companies who claimed to help advertisers manage fraud were really just taxing it. Their vested interest was not in preventing fraud itself, but taxing it, levying a fee for layering their technology on to every impression.</p><p>Working with White Ops, we appended that model. We wanted to scrub all inventory before it ever came to the buy side. They reduced their rates, and we significantly increased their volume by insisting all of our suppliers work with them. In doing this, we put pressure on the entire ecosystem, big and small, to scrub for fraud. Our leverage was such that we could take this position, make it affordable, and make it pervasive. And today, this is not a major issue in our industry anymore.</p><p>These are a couple of the examples of how we are working to improve the digital ad ecosystem for all parties. There are many others. As I mentioned before, I don't think we've taken enough credit for the work we've done, but I think in the context of all the scrutiny of our industry right now, it's important to understand how the industry is changing, what's driving that and how The Trade Desk is creating value.</p><p>There are times when some supply side players get uncomfortable with these efforts to improve transparency and efficiency. That's because many of them are trying to protect their business models to drive high margins while providing comparatively little value, but this is the natural cycle of a maturing industry. Transparency will force price and value discovery, and every market participant will ultimately have to account for the value they provide and the prices they charge. In this climate, I don't think it's coincidental that our business continues to thrive and more advertisers standardize on our platform. They want to align themselves with a partner who ensures they can act with transparency, objectivity, and integrity.</p><p>Finally, as I stated many times before, we believe our business model is exceptional. We have the luxury to not have to choose between growth and profitability. We are doing both, and we have pretty much done so since the beginning. In Q2, our financial performance and particularly, our $58 million of adjusted EBITDA was significantly better than we had estimated. So I want to give a little context.</p><p>We've increased our operating spend by more than $41 million year-over-year in Q2. This means our investment was up 50% over the previous year. Even at that rate, we couldn't invest fast enough. Of course, part of that is our investment discipline. We invest quickly but carefully, always focused on the needs of our customers worldwide. We are also careful to ensure that we maintain our culture, which we believe is key to our success.</p><p>In Q2, some of the hiring and investments we did not complete are already happening in Q3. As a result, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be $45 million in Q3. If we expect additional investments will lead to an outsized return, we will invest as fast as we can. That's how we operate. We consider this a great position of strength. We can produce EBITDA margins that meet or beat most other SaaS companies, including those much bigger than us.</p><p>So hopefully, you found this context useful as you think about the nature of the market that we operate in and why we believe we will continue to grow share in the fastest-growing part of it, data-driven advertising. Our focus is on advertisers and agencies, our commitment to the open Internet and everything that means in terms of transparency. Our pragmatic approach to rapidly investing our profits in future innovation means that we will accelerate our leadership in this market. With the biggest shift in media and the advertising we've seen in the generation now underway, we are in a great position to grow share moving forward.</p><p>Now I'm going to turn the time over to Paul to discuss our financials.</p><p>PAUL E. ROSS, CFO, THE TRADE DESK, INC.: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've seen in our press release, Q2 was another outstanding quarter.</p><p>Revenue increased 42% year-over-year and accelerated versus our Q1 growth of 41%. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $58 million, and GAAP net income increased 45% to $28 million. We achieved this while we continue to invest aggressively in areas critical to our future growth such as on our platform and adding engineering and sales talent.</p><p>Revenue for the second quarter was $160 million, which was above our prior expectations and reflected increased spend by our existing customers, plus the addition of new customers and advertisers. For the quarter, approximately 89% of our second quarter growth spend came from existing customers who have been on our platform for over a year. Q2 marks the 22nd quarter in a row where customer retention was over 95%.</p><p>With the growth of our business, our operating expenses grew to $128 million. This increase year-over-year was due to sales and marketing and engineering as we continue to scale for future growth. The year-over-year increase also reflected higher G&amp;A expenses, which takes into account stock-based compensation, and we expect G&amp;A to moderate as a percentage of revenue in the back half of the year.</p><p>Income tax was a $5.6 million expense mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. GAAP net income was $27.8 million for Q2 or $0.58 per fully diluted share. Our adjusted net income was $45.6 million or $0.95 per fully diluted share compared with adjusted net income of $27.2 million or $0.60 per share in the comparable period.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA was $58 million, with a corresponding margin of 36.2% of revenue during Q2. The increase in adjusted EBITDA dollars reflects the strong growth of our top line, offset by our increasing investments in product, people, global expansion and corporate expenses.</p><p>Net cash provided by operating activities was $11 million in Q2, and our trailing 12 months of operating cash flow and free cash flow were $95 million and $60 million, respectively. We continue to have 0 debt on our balance sheet, and our total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments exiting the quarter was $231 million.</p><p>Our DSOs at the end of Q2 were 100 days, an increase of 1 day from the same period a year ago. DPOs for Q2 were 81 days, a decrease of 1 day from the same period a year ago.</p><p>For Q3 of 2019, we are expecting revenue of $163 million and adjusted EBITDA of $45 million. For the full year 2019, we now expect revenue to be at least $653 million, revised upward from $645 million last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be $201 million, also revised upward from last quarter or about 31% of revenue.</p><p>I will now turn the call back over to Jeff for final comments, and of course, Q&amp;A. Jeff?</p><p>JEFFREY TERRY GREEN: Thanks, Paul. Q2 was another very encouraging quarter for The Trade Desk as we continue to see our strategy and execution payoff as more advertisers commit their budgets to us. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter and are raising them for the year. The fundamentals of our business are solid, and we continue to scale our business across markets and channels.</p><p>As the worldwide advertising market moves towards $1 trillion in a few years, we are well positioned to win a lion's share of the programmatic portion of that market, the fastest-growing segment. We invested early in key markets and channels. And while we are pleased with our initial gains, we see far more upside yet to come.</p><p>That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open it up for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Shyam Patil of Susquehanna International Group.</p><p>SHYAM VASANT PATIL, SENIOR ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP, LLLP, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats on a great quarter. Jeff, I wanted to ask about the Amazon partnership. As you mentioned in your prepared remarks, it seems like it's a big step for the industry. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you think it means for the industry? And I know it's super early, but how do you think about the opportunity for The Trade Desk?</p><p>JEFFREY TERRY GREEN: Awesome. Thanks, Shyam. So first, let me talk about Amazon just generally, before I talk about the deal. So in talking about Amazon and what they're up to, a lot of people have asked like what does -- what are they doing? And what does third-party apps mean? And what is Amazon Publishing Services?</p><p>So my understanding of Amazon Publishing Services is they -- the primary thing they're monetizing is Amazon Fire, which is the sticks and the hockey pucks. And inside of that, of course, you have Amazon -- Amazon's own app where you watch Amazon Prime video, and then you have Netflix, and you'll have YouTube, then you have a lot of third-party apps where there's ads. And they're going to those third-party apps, whether that's Sony Crackle or CBS or anybody else and saying, \"We can help you monetize that.\" And we're doing it in a very different way, which is why I'm so excited about the deal, and let me talk about what this means for us. So let me just summarize the deal.</p><p>So first, Amazon is joining the open Internet in the sense that they're using their ID to make it possible for us to measure what's happening in that ecosystem that I just described as well as on the rest of the Internet. So that makes it so measurement is meaningfully better than what we would get inside of any walled garden.</p><p>Secondly, they're being more aggressive in the economics from what I can tell than what anybody else has been on the sell side for Connected TV. And what this does for content owners is if you rewind 2 years and you're looking at this through the lens of a content owner, an owner whose 90% of their revenue comes through linear television, and the money that you have to divide with somebody like YouTube versus the money you have to divide with an MVPD partner is roughly the same, then you're in no rush to move to digital. In fact, digital just represents risk for you. But if you make targeting better because of the use of that ID and so you get the efficiency that digital can provide, and then you also get the chance to keep more of a dollar, you get a greater percentage of the deal, it becomes economically irrational to not race towards digital.</p><p>So what I think is specially significant about this deal is that it just became more incentivizing for content owners to move into digital, and it also gives us a little bit of insight as to what Amazon might be thinking in terms of overall strategy, which is to be way more focused on the sell side when it comes to everything that's not on Amazon.com.</p><p>So I think it's a game changer for TV. I think it's a one of, if not the most significant deal that we've done in television to date. We hope it's the first of many, both with them and with others, and really excited about the opportunity that it represents.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes to the line of Youssef Squali of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.</p><p>SAGAR VACHHANI, ASSOCIATE, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Sagar on for Youssef. I wanted to ask a couple more questions about the Amazon partnership. First question is that, do you have access to Amazon's first-party shopping data for targeting? And second is, how do you compete with Amazon's own DSP?</p><p>JEFFREY TERRY GREEN: Great. So first one is easy, no. Amazon would never want to do that because it's a risk that, that would represent in terms of data security. So they'll continue, I suspect, to do that on their own. So to answer your first question is no, we don't.</p><p>Secondly, in terms of how we compete with Amazon's DSP, I'd like to take a step back and just talk strategically for a second. If you look at this through the lens of some of the biggest advertisers in the world that are CPGs, CPG companies, Amazon as a distributor has more power, and to them, can be a little bit more scary than any distributor that we've ever had. So if you, for instance, compare them to Walmart a decade or 2 ago, while Walmart may have been the most powerful distributor they had then, Amazon has more power than they did today.</p><p>And that's for a number of reasons, in part because Amazon has become just such an amazing retail engine that's done lots of consolidating, made it possible for other merchants to come on to their platform, but also because Amazon has gotten into so many other businesses, including selling CPG products themselves. So the conflict they have with those companies can create some pause.</p><p>And then when you add the fact that AWS often stores the data for all of these companies, I think it's a really hard pitch for Amazon to go to a CPG company or really most of the biggest advertisers in the world and say, \"We know you give us a lot of money and you trust us a lot to do all the distribution on our site, but we would also like to ask you to give us all of your marketing budget to do all of the spend off of Amazon.com.\"</p><p>Because they have, in that sense, a bigger objectivity problem than any company in the world where, in effect, they're saying, \"Trust me with your money, trust me with your data, and trust me with your entire marketing spend.\" I think -- what I anticipate is that the core of Amazon's buy side efforts will be to monetize Amazon.com.</p><p>While they do have a DSP helping do some other things today, I don't expect that to be the core of what they're doing, and this does shed more light on the significance of the sell side approach that they're taking in Amazon Publishing Services, where I anticipate that we'll be partners with them for a very long time.</p><p>So when you look at sort of the strategic hand that Amazon is dealt, I think it makes a ton of sense, that while we do compete with Amazon's DSP, the much more significant headline is that we're partnering with Amazon Publisher Services, and really excited about what that means for the future.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Levine of Pivotal Research.</p><p>MICHAEL LEVINE, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIVOTAL RESEARCH GROUP LLC: Congrats again on the quarter, Jeff. Terrific acceleration. Wonderful to hear the detail about Amazon, but one of the other things that was interesting to see come out this week was about the partnership with Disney and also in the context of their basically bundling Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu ad-supported at probably a much lower price point than I think a lot of investors had expected. So I'd love to hear your thoughts about that and how impactful you think it could be to the business.</p><p>JEFFREY TERRY GREEN: Fantastic. So as you know, Disney has been so aggressive in the last 18 months, and it is actually so exciting to watch. A few years ago, I was really -- in the forward thinking of AT&amp;T, and I feel just so excited by what Disney is doing as a partner and as a consumer as well. I think the new bundle they have coming out with Disney+, and ESPN+ and Hulu plus per ad is really great, and I think it's going to be successful.</p><p>But in about that same time, about 18 months ago, as they approach [Sesame] to started working together, we learned something in those discussions, which is that more than 50% of the views that they're getting on their content is coming from connected devices, and they wanted to figure out a better way to monetize that. As somebody who's watched them for a long time as an investor in their business, I've watched them try to figure out what happens with -- what do you do with ESPN in a world where cord cutting is happening and especially with just the business model that they have for ESPN, say, a decade ago compared with today? It's actually why I am so excited about this partnership because: one, we anticipate getting access to a significant amount of inventory as they become more digital. But also, I think programmatic is better suited for live events than any other way of monetizing.</p><p>If you think about it, when a game goes into extra innings, it's not really conducive to planning month in advance as to how many ads you're going to see, and most advertisers aren't going to spend a bunch of time thinking about, \"Well, what if it goes into 13 innings?\" Instead, you make your plan. And then often, what those companies have had to do in the past is give away those ads -- the extra innings, for free. And so instead what they can do is, in real time, check what demand is out there and also make certain that, that -- that those ads are relevant and not overly repetitive like they often are in those situations. So you make more money make a better user experience.</p><p>It's really critical when more and more of the views are coming online, and the only way to support that content with the optimal user experience of today is to welcome programmatic demand so that you get higher CPMs on each of those ad views, and it's the reason why I think us and Disney are strategically sort of stuck with each other.</p><p>I mean we have a fantastic partnership. It's not because we don't love working with each other. We absolutely love working with them, but it is strategically obvious that product, live content and the amazing offering that they have is going to continue to grow together. And our great partnership with Hulu, I think, is just indicative of what's to come. So a lot of bullishness on our partnership with Disney.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer.</p><p>BRIAN JEFFREY SCHWARTZ, MD &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO. INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Jeff, congratulations too. It's just great to see the company executing so well here. I was hoping maybe we could switch subjects over to what's happening at Google. Can you please provide an update on any impact or opportunities you're seeing or expecting to see from the Chrome browser changes?</p><p>And then, separately, you talked a lot about the Amazon transparency initiative. Can you also provide an update on the transparency initiative that you have been working on with Google for some time?</p><p>JEFFREY TERRY GREEN: You bet. Thanks for the compliments, Brian. And yes, happy to give comments on Chrome. So just a reminder that Chrome has roughly 60% of the browsing market, and I talked -- I think it was last quarter of the quarter before, at length, about their initiatives including same site. I'm actually -- I'm one that wants to really sing the praises of Google -- at Google. I know sometimes because we compete with some divisions of Google, because they're so big, a lot of people are quick to pick on them, attack at least the parts that we compete with, we've talked about. But what they're doing in Chrome I think is exactly what the industry needs, and I think they should be praised for what they're doing. They're making the Internet better, and they're making privacy better. I think it's a positive change for us, and it's good for the industry. And I think the fact that it is positive for us and good for the industry is indicative of how we've aligned well with just if you do the right thing, then you're going to be set up well for the long term.</p><p>And it's really great to see Google under the pressure that they are sort of reaching the same conclusion. So I'm really optimistic about it. They haven't been specific about when they'll roll it out. I think they just want to make sure that they dot every I and cross every T, which is exactly what I would do if I were them, too. So I think -- I suspect we'll be well into 2020 before we see the actual changes implemented, but there's been a little more discussion than just sort of coming soon to a theater near you. So excited about that. Can you remind me, Brian, of the second part of your question?</p><p>BRIAN JEFFREY SCHWARTZ: Yes. It was just on the transparency initiatives I think you've been working on for some time here with Google. I know you talked a lot about where Amazon is heading on transparency. I was just wondering if you can provide an update on what you're doing with Google on the transparency initiative.</p><p>JEFFREY TERRY GREEN: You bet. So I know there's been a lot in our trade publications talking about just our desire to put a lot of pressure on the sell side to just be more transparent. And essentially, the way that I look at -- most advertisers, when it comes to digital, have 2 options, 2 types of options: one, is walled gardens, which are very good at making it easy to spend your money; the other is the open Internet where you have more data, more transparency, you have more optionality, you have more power, but it's more complicated.</p><p>And sometimes what has happened to the open Internet is because of that complexity, some players have used that as an opportunity to hide, to hide margin, to charge more than they add in value. And I actually think that has been the thing that has held back the open Internet while the walled gardens have grown so aggressively, and so impressively.</p><p>And so I view our role as leading the open Internet, and what that means is that we have to go to all of our suppliers and say, \"We expect you to add more value than you extract.\" And as we get bigger, we're going to demand that we have more transparency on what we buy. And we are in this really strong position that because there is so much media out there, and because we're -- the world of media and the Internet is producing so much content so fast, we are in the power position, if you will, in that we are able to be picky. We get to choose what we're going to buy and what we're not. And so we just demand a lot of our suppliers, and those that are transparent and open and honest and give us a fair environment to participate, we spend way more with them, and we're growing very aggressively. And those that aren't, we don't grow as aggressively.</p><p>And so I think that approach is putting pressure on a number of players on the sell side, and that is a great thing for our industry. It is great for the Internet. It's great for consumers because that will make a better Internet, and we're on a mission to do it, and we'll keep doing that. It's something that we spend a lot of time talking about with Google. Overall, Google is interested in the exact same thing. So it is good for our industry to continue to work for a better Internet, and I'm really proud of all the efforts that we've done to date on that front.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Jones (sic) [Nicholas Jones] of Citi.</p><p>NICHOLAS FREEMAN JONES, ASSISTANT VP &amp; SENIOR ASSOCIATE, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just wanted to touch base on the unified ID. How would you try to benchmark adoption of this? And what kind of pushback are you getting from various players who don't want to adopt the ID?</p><p>JEFFREY TERRY GREEN: Yes. So I don't know if we've been public yet about just adoption numbers, but just I'll tell you just in terms of commentary. The number of companies that have adopted it is overwhelming. And I would say that it's very difficult to be a top 10 supplier for us in any channel if you're not adopting it in some way, if you're not [putting] it in some way. So I do think it's been massively successful. I think at this stage it's nearing inevitability in terms of its ubiquity.</p><p>We've seen adoption all over the world so it's not isolated to North America. It's happening all over the world, and it is a better way to operate the Internet. It is better for users. And one thing that I don't think I've said enough is that we basically have used the standard with unified ID that operates in mobile with IDFA. So this means that our privacy standards or the way that we're creating this ID and the degree of privacy that this provides to consumers is just like IDFA, which is, of course, what Apple uses to operate its ecosystem and what the entire mobile community uses.</p><p>So this ID, while a way to sort of go to market or get its adoption has been unique, in effect, especially to the consumer, it looks just like IDFA, which is part of the reason why we're so proud of what we have been able to accomplish in getting adoption to unified ID.</p><p>So I expect it to be one of the few standards for IDs, and therefore, targeting on the Internet as we march towards the future. And I'm sure at some point, we'll give updates in terms of where adoptions happened. But it's happened on the buy side, on the sell side, on the data side, all over the Internet, all over the world.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz of Rosenblatt.</p><p>MARK JOHN ZGUTOWICZ, SENIOR ANALYST, ROSENBLATT SECURITIES INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Jeff, thanks for all the detail on the Amazon partnership. It's helpful. I just wanted to separate the anonymized ID, what you're getting from Amazon, from the shopper data, which you're obviously not, and just trying to understand how the average advertiser sort of closes the loop, if you will, with attribution. So without having the shopper data, do they go back to sort of Amazon to close that loop? Sort of how do you close the entire attribution loop within your platform?</p><p>JEFFREY TERRY GREEN: Yes. So this is actually something that I think important to understand about walled gardens is that when you operate a walled garden, you can't really provide attribution for the rest of the Internet. You simply say, \"This is how many people I touched in my walled garden, and this is how many conversions came from those people that we touched.\"</p><p>Whether -- you can't really make many arguments about causation or correlation because you're just measuring in isolation. That is sort of what you sign up for when you create a walled garden. And the reason you have to create a walled garden is so that you can use powerful data that isn't owned by the advertiser. So in order to use the data that another company like an Amazon or like a Google or like Facebook have, you have to operate a walled garden and to make sure that, that data never leaves that garden. Otherwise, you run the risk of sharing that. That includes closing the loop on attribution.</p><p>We're not able to say how did that shopper out on Amazon actually convert when they went and bought on the rest of the Internet? We can't weigh in on the effect they had on the open Internet nor can we weigh in on the open Internet's effect on sort of bringing them into the walled garden and participating in sort of the supply chain once you get on to Amazon because Amazon's not going to provide that outside of their own shopper experience in order to utilize that data.</p><p>So walled gardens, by their very nature, makes attribution hard for everybody else, and that is why it is so important, but for more and more advertisers to be spending on the open Internet, and it is why as Connected TV continues to grow and it will be extremely fragmented because TV has always been extremely fragmented, that the bias will be to the open Internet. So as an advertiser said, they said they want to spend in Connected TV, the first place to start is on the open Internet, and then you'll give the leftovers to walled gardens because one, that's where all the premium content is; two, I expect that for all the volume will be too of users because they'll spend more time there than they will on user-generated content, even though that's also a huge pool. But just by their very nature, you're not able to connect the dots between walled gardens because that is what makes them walled.</p><p>OPERATOR: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: This is Ben on for Mark. Two if I could. Just firstly on China, if we could talk about that. And I understand that it's not going to be material for a while, but you are partnered with 3 of the largest Chinese media companies. But just wondering about the short term limits to growth. Does that have more to do with: one, a lack of demand from the global advertising partners you have? Two, is media partners limiting access to their inventory? Or three, you kind of self-capping the spend that you're bringing on to them in order to maintain positive relations with these partners?</p><p>And just secondly, if we go back to Amazon TV, is there any way you could kind of quantify, in relative terms, just the incremental amount of CTV inventory that this Amazon TV deal brings to you, like relative to the CTV inventory you had prior, understanding that you do have access to 100% of those impression?</p><p>JEFFREY TERRY GREEN: Sure. So as it relates to China, so as you pointed out, it is very early stage for us. I wouldn't characterize anything that we've experienced today as limiting or anything like that. We started a partnership with Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. We're growing that. We are seeing growth every single month, and we're going slow and being very deliberate.</p><p>We, of course, are going to continue to roll out in a bigger and bigger way, and there's more to come before the end of the year on just some of our plans there, but things in China are going well, and we're playing the long game. So there's nothing that's happened in China that I view as a setback. It's us just staying the course and making certain that we tap into the media market that's about half the size of the United States, but growing at double the pace and is the second largest media market in the world, and perhaps the biggest opportunity geographically that we'll ever see again. So huge, huge opportunity for us, now we want to make certain that we don't mess up by being hasty or by burning bridges. And I'm really excited about what we've done so far.</p><p>Second, to your question about incremental inventory, I can't comment on how much it will add to our total inventory, but I can reiterate that we will see 100% of every impression on Amazon. We will also compete with all other demand, and that includes anything that the Amazon sales team sells. Sorry. I messed that sentence up. Let me say that again. We will compete with all other demand, and that includes competing with anything else that the Amazon sales team sells.</p><p>So that means they haven't carved out the 20% or 30% of inventory that they then sort of give it a carriage deal that is separate and then make a much higher margin on that than they would on the rest. They're putting it all together, and that's all competing. So we're just as eligible to win any impression as anybody else is, including Amazon. So given that, that represents 100% of every impression on those third-party apps, that is, without a doubt significant.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Coolbrith of Wells Fargo.</p><p>ROBERT JAMES COOLBRITH, ASSOCIATE ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jeff, I wanted to go back to your comments earlier about programmatic so far as a dress rehearsal for CTV, and where you're going. Programmatic was initially sort of a non-premium opportunity, which ended up, in some cases, impacting premium pricing integrity. Given that, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the PMP model and how some of the premium publishers and networks you're partnering with now are getting comfortable that we won't have sort of a repeat of that history with the creation of sales channel conflict or impacting pricing integrity.</p><p>And then just one quick one, in Amazon, just wondering if that deal could potentially extend to their ad-supported IMDb TV profit.</p><p>JEFFREY TERRY GREEN: You bet. Let me answer the last one first. So it doesn't today, but I see no reason why it couldn't in the future, but there's no plans for that, that we have talked about today.</p><p>On the pricing, I love this question, first of all. So you're actually right, that programmatic was born out of sort of a bottoms-up growth or evolution in the sense that when we first started monetizing display 10 to 15 years ago, we were taking the remnant, the leftovers and running an option for it, and that was really scary for companies like MSN and Yahoo! because they were saying, \"Uh oh, I make 90% of my revenue on 10% of the impressions. And I don't want necessarily everybody to know that I have more supply than I do demand.\" So programmatic shined a light of transparency on things and it did make prices go down temporarily.</p><p>But what's happened over the last few years is that, that helps create better or fewer ads per page. It's helped to make the Internet overall better, just economics getting more effective. But especially what's happened in Connected TV has been exactly the opposite, which is exactly what you want to do. So programmatic in a way should have never started with display because when you have more supply than you do demand, then auction is not the best way to monetize that. But when you have more demand than you have supply, which is exactly what's happening in Connected TV because we're taking a number of ads in a commercial break and reducing them and because cord cutting is accelerated adoption, we're getting record demand for Connected TV. That's made it possible when you've joined that with the increased efficacy that comes from -- in data-driven instead of just sort of the spray and pray model that most linear is. Most CPMs have gone up pretty meaningfully so it's not uncommon to see a $10 CPM in linear TV and see the same content monetizing a $30, $40 or $50 CPM in digital.</p><p>So programmatic is exactly what that needs, and I don't think that that's going to create any pricing erosion. And what that has done as well is created a desire for both the buy side and the sell side to get together and create sort of a faster distribution channel. How can we reduce the number of hops, the number of taxes that happen in the middle by creating private marketplaces or PMPs or private deals, so that you can reduce the tax that the people in the middle take, and that is something that we're working really hard on with suppliers. We want to make certain that as much money as possible is kept by the ends, if you will, advertisers and publishers so that they continue to do really well.</p><p>We think that's one of the things that we're extremely good at, which is adding more value than we extract in the middle, and making certain that everybody along the way is earning their keep. So the evolution you're describing is it's a really important moment for those macroeconomic forces to be changing media because what audio and Connected TV have is a secular tailwind that display and native never had.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our final question comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov of Cannonball Research.</p><p>VASILY KARASYOV, FOUNDER, CANNONBALL RESEARCH, LLC: Jeff, wanted to ask you about a topic that we don't talk about much in these calls and that's audio spend. And I think in your prepared remarks you said that you think it's the best value in advertising right now. And looking at the growth rates, it's growing as fast -- a little faster than Connected TV, but I believe that's from a high -- from a bigger base.</p><p>So my question to you, can you talk a little bit more about that why do you still think that Connected TV is a bigger opportunity for you here? Maybe talk a little more about how audio is growing? How that option by advertisers is growing? How far do you think this growth will extend? And anything that you think is worth sharing with us would be interesting because it is growing fast, and we don't talk about it as much.</p><p>JEFFREY TERRY GREEN: I'm so glad you've asked this question, and in part because we get to rectify exactly what you point out, which is that we have not given audio, and that includes Spotify and Pandora, the word count that they deserve. So we did mention in our prepared remarks that audio grew by 3x for the third quarter in a row, which given how long we've been in audio is unbelievable. I am blown away by that number, and I'm looking at the trajectory. So I'm just so excited by what's happening.</p><p>Part of the reason why I call it such a great value is when you compare it to some of the other forms of advertising, including other forms of programmatic, I don't think that there's a form of advertising that captures your attention much better than audio. You think about the way most of us consume Spotify, for instance, is you're in your car or you're exercising, you're walking around, you're way less likely to skip an ad than if you're watching YouTube or something where you're sitting in front of a computer.</p><p>And you're also more likely to give it more of your attention in some cases. And then when you look at the fact that the rates of those audio ads are exponentially or a fraction of the price of more premium television content, I think it represents a big opportunity.</p><p>When you look at what's happening in podcasting and some of the other ways that those companies are starting to monetize, it's no wonder that we're growing at the pace that we are, and I think it continues to represent a huge opportunity.</p><p>One thing that I also think is just worth pointing out because I think we can learn from it as we look at other markets, and that includes other geographical markets because some of the markets we're just about to go into are smaller markets than where we've entered before. We're not top 10 media markets.</p><p>But that's -- they have something in common with audio, which is that audio is operating on such tight margins that they can't really afford to do what radio used to, which is pound the pavement looking for dollars and selling to SMBs. You have to sell in a more automated way, and you have to reduce your cost of sale in order to be competitive.</p><p>So as Spotify and Pandora are competing around the world to get as much listening time as possible, they have to operate really efficient engines, and there's nothing that helps the distribution of -- helps the efficiency of the distribution of ads more than programmatic advertising. So it's another one of those places where we're sort of destined to work together, and I'm just so excited by what we're doing together.</p><p>OPERATOR: There are no further questions over the audio portion of the conference.

We're very happy to host all of you here in our head office, the ones joining through the conference call and the ones attending through the web stream. We are here with our CEO, Fuat Erbil, and our CFO, Aydin G\u00c3\u00bcler; and myself, Handan Saygin, Investor Relations.</p><p>Now we'll be presenting you today our 2018 and 2019 plans, along with the strategic journey -- just a moment. So there are 3 parts in our agenda. So I'll give you a quick wrap-up on the 2018 status, what we based our operating plan, the 2018 numbers. And then we'll disclose our 2019 operating plan. And then I'll leave the floor to our CEO to talk to you about our transformation journey.</p><p>Now let's start with the market position. I mean just to remind you that we're very happy and that we lead among the peers in terms of profitability. We have the highest ROA, highest ROE among the peers. We ranked top not only in the profitability but also in the capital levels, highest core equity Tier 1 level we have. And we were the ones that could distribute the highest dividends in 2018.</p><p>And moving on to the revenue items. Not only we have the highest NIM level among the peers, but also, the performance has been consistently the best. And again, this is one area we lead along with the net fees and commissions, again, in that line. Again, we have, by far, the highest net fees and commissions. And in terms of net fees and commission generation capability, meaning the -- its portion to interest-earning assets and the noncash loans, we ranked top. So with all the strengths, of course, we were able to achieve last year, having the best cost income ratio, the most improved and the lowest cost income ratio among the peers.</p><p>Now on the 2018 status wrap-up. If you recall our initial -- I mean our guidance, 2018 guidance, we were expecting a Turkish lending growth of below 14%. Actually, the year started off quite well. In the first half, we already grew 9% in this line item but then, as you know, significant changes in the macro environment. The third quarter, it was pretty muted. And fourth quarter, we did see some shrinkage in Turkish lira loans. So most likely, the year-end 2018, we expect that to be in the low single digits.</p><p>So versus the guidance, yes, it's lower. It's going to be -- most likely end up to be lower. In foreign currency lending we said shrinkage, and yes, we do expect shrinkage. So that's an in-line guidance. In NPL ratio, we had to revise it in July that we're expecting 4% to 4.5% NPL ratio. Now we are -- we're revising that a little bit. There's a -- it's going to be higher, it seems, maybe near 5% levels, rather. And along with that, we are revising our net cost of risk, excluding the currency impact, to be rather near 250 or around 250. But the good thing is that despite these higher provision costs, the margin, including the swap cost and including the CPI, we'll be seeing a beat -- clear beat there given the high CPI rating, of course, and the core margin being strong. And fee growth, again, there's going to be a beat, it seems. We do expect around 30% versus our initial guidance of higher than 20% fee growth.</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER, EVP OF ALM, CAPITAL, IR &amp; FINANCE, TURKIYE GARANTI BANKASI A.S.: Not initial, but...</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Well, during the year, (inaudible). You also may have expected in the first 9 months the performance here on [it] remained above 30%, and it seems like we're going to finish the year above 30%. Of course, this is something that, again, helped by the interest rate level, and that's impacted our payment systems, fee generation positively during the year.</p><p>So OpEx, growth-wise, if you recall, we had guided around average CPI OpEx growth. And right now, you may also recall from the 9 months realization that this is significantly below the average CPI, and it seems we're going to be finishing the year above -- I'm sorry, below average CPI. So there's a beat there as well.</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: Which is there is CPI of...</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Average CPI of last year -- actually, it's like 2016, not last year. Last year, like 20%, if we take. So there's going to be -- it seems we'll be sustaining the first 9-month performance by the...</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: Much less than 20%. I think it's fair to comment on this issue.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: So -- yes. Okay. I'm sorry. So these clear beat line items were good buffers to compensate the higher-than-anticipated provision costs, basically. So I'm very happy to say that -- glad to say that even though there are some changes in some line items in terms of beats are being lower, in terms of the ROE, when we take into account -- adjust for the free provisions we have set aside during the year, we'll end up getting to the ROE that we initially anticipated. So -- but we did continue -- just to give you in parenthesis, we did continue setting aside free provisions in the fourth quarter's after the third quarter's figures.</p><p>Now...</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: So -- but very, very -- in summary, we took the advantage of the last quarter's extraordinary CPI income to set aside better provisions. As you can see here from the increase of cost of risk, that's the pure source of this increase as well as free provisions. So by having this opportunity in the -- especially in the last quarter, so we just make those adjustments for the year-end but maintaining the ROE level, including the free provisions around 17%, which has been the guidance for the whole year.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Okay. Now let's move to the main agenda item, 2019 operating plan. What we based our plan -- the macro assumptions that we based our plan on is that we're expecting a GDP growth to be lower next year but still remain in the positive territory. And -- so our assumption is that it's going to be 1% next year. I mean not next year. We're already in 2019, sorry. And in terms of the funding costs, the interest rates, we do expect to get some -- we do expect that Central Bank remains tight until they see a permanent recovery in inflation outlook. And it seems like by midyear, it is possible that they may start lowering interest rates and maybe end the 2019 year-end with 20% rate. In terms of inflation, these tight policies were able to curb the worsening inflation. So we believe we saw the worst reading in inflation already in 2018, and we're expecting to end 2019 with 16% inflation.</p><p>So now based on this macro, how will our balance sheet look? We do project a loan-driven asset composition to remain. So loans in assets, it seems, year-on-year, they will be slightly lower, but that has to do mainly with the -- with our new subsidiary that's now moved from the loan line to others, our LYY, the new Otas-related subsidiary.</p><p>And in 2019, in terms of asset growth, we're expecting around 5% growth, TL lending growth to be around 5%. We do expect the shrinkage in foreign currency loans to continue and be around 10% next year. So this alludes to a lending growth, basically, that's parallel to the asset growth around 5% for total lending.</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: With the assumption of Turkish lira against dollars, will be 6.10 end of the year.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Yes. So the depreciation is assumed to be in line with the inflation.</p><p>So moving on to the -- like what makes up the loan growth is that, yes, I mean, relatively, we're expecting a muted loan growth in 2019, but the growth will remain, and the leaders of the growth will be, again, the Turkish lira business banking and credit cards. So Turkish lira business banking loan, we're expecting 10% growth, and in credit cards, 15% growth, whereas on the consumer loans, we're expecting shrinkage. Why is that the case? It's mainly due to the fact that we will be having the highest level of maturity hitting 2019, and we don't anticipate the demand to be strong to cover this maturing portion.</p><p>So in mortgages, we're expecting 10% shrinkage; in autos, 10% shrinkage. In general purpose lending, though, where we believe we can maintain flat loan book there because, as you know, these are small ticket items and with average duration 1 year, so we think we aim to keep that book flat next year.</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: And the reason why we're having better growth estimation for the credit cards because of the base effect, number one. Number two, we just launched -- actually, soft launched already a credit card program for travel and entertainment, Shop &amp; Fly. So we believe that this will give us another buffer to grow more than the market for the next year.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Okay. On the foreign currency front, foreign currency loans, we do expect the downward trend to continue, especially due to the lack of demand and significant reduction. So as I mentioned earlier, we're expecting 10% shrinkage -- further 10% shrinkage in foreign currency lending in 2019.</p><p>Now moving to the funding part. The funding will remain to be deposit-heavy, and customer deposits, we do expect some increase in the weight of the assets from 58% to 61%. So that will allow us to -- also given the loan growth projections, that will allow us to manage the loan-to-deposit ratio -- total loan-to-deposit ratio around 100% in 2019. So you're going to see further improvement.</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: But we're ending 2018 to -- very close to 100%.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Yes. Already there. So it seems we'll manage -- we'll be able to easily manage around 100% level.</p><p>And in terms of the foreign currency borrowing, that borrowings portion, you see that it's coming down from 19% to 17%. That has to do largely with the fact that, as I mentioned, the foreign currency loan book has been diminishing and has been -- we're coming from 20% market share levels back in 2010 to 10%, most likely, we expect by year-end 2018. So the need to fund the foreign currency loans, this has come down. The need to also raise foreign currency funding has diminished.</p><p>We have eurobond redemptions coming up in July and October for EUR 500 million in July and $750 million in October. And then we have syndication rollovers. But in our operating plan, we did assume lower than 100% syndication rollover mainly due to the high cost. And also currently, we do have comfortable liquidity. But overall, our approach in this foreign currency borrowing is that we will continue to be opportunistic there. So if market conditions are attractive, we'll try to get in there but with the focus mainly to extend the maturity.</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: I think it's worth to mention, we've been always sharing with you and with the investors the levels of -- the level of the buffers, foreign currency liquidity buffer that we're carrying. Maybe you remember, it was -- almost all the time is around $10 billion. As of now, it is $11.2 billion, $11.3 billion. So with this figure, I mean, the recent history, I mean, including before these turmoil times, we've been getting the highest level of foreign currency buffer. So this will give us, as Handan stated, more room to be opportunistic in our wholesale funding strategies throughout the year.</p><p>So if you find it opportunistic, and of course, we're going to tap it, but we don't push ourselves to roll over every coming issuances, including syndications or eurobonds or whatsoever, with 100%. We will be more -- we will have more balanced approaching that includes liquidity concerns but as well as pricing.</p><p>So that's why our borrowings will shrink in the total liabilities from 19% to 17% going forward in favor of deposits. So we'll be increasing our customer deposits in that respect.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Now let's look at the -- what's going to happen to margins. For that, let's start with the spread. Now in the last quarter of 2018, there was a period that we saw actually a negative TL loan to TL time deposit spread. Well, including demand deposits, we didn't see negative, but this is the spread versus TL time deposits. And by December, it did improve. And now projecting this spread-out, it seems the core spread expansion will be continuing into 2019 and '20. So yes, we're being squeezed at this time. But when we take into account also the focus of our -- for the low-cost deposits, our strong demand deposit base, which makes up about 1/4 of our total deposits, the projection doesn't look that bad. And it seems like excluding the CPI, we'll be able to maintain the core margins flat year-on-year. So 2019 margin, excluding the CPI, we expect that to be flat year-on-year. But in 2018, in the core margin, the last quarter, as I mentioned, because of the spread, we will see some hit. So the core spread, there will be some slight suppression. So over that, we do expect flat 2019. But looking into 2020, it's -- the projection in that, there's going to be a significant recovery in the core margin in 2020.</p><p>Now taking into account the CPI portion, I mean, I'd like to explain it differently because last year's CPI was record CPI. So we did enjoy those windfall gains, and it doesn't seem it's going to repeat next year. So the CPI will have a pressuring effect on the overall margin. And so including the CPI, it's inevitable right now that we're going to see some margin suppression in 2019. On the foreign currency front, you see on the...</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: No major change.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: No major change. So -- and also, in terms of the swap utilization, again, we'll continue our opportunistic capping there.</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: I think in terms of spread -- Turkish lira spreads, I can safely say that we have seen the worst spreads in Turkish lira last year in November -- October and November. And by that point on, the spreads start to get better and better, but the recoveries improvement is not impactful yet. As we have stated here, the 1% difference between 23 and 22 is a little bit improved. But this pace is highly correlated with the rates of the Central Bank. In our assumption, this will take maybe after May, maybe after June, so that we will be enjoying much better improvements in terms of spreads in the second half of the year. I mean that's another safe bet that we can share with you.</p><p>And one thing related with the CPIs for your calculations, very roughly, we'll be recognizing around TRY 6 billion 2018, income coming from the CPI linkers. Based on our inflation assumption of total assumption, that will be decreasing to TRY 4 billion, and the TRY 4 billion itself is still a good amount of money. But comparing to last year's extraordinary TRY 6 billion, so expect TRY 2 billion net income -- sorry, gross income shrinkage coming up from the CPI linkers. That's gross.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL, PRESIDENT, CEO, GM &amp; DIRECTOR, TURKIYE GARANTI BANKASI A.S.: That 25.24 (inaudible).</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Thank you. Now the most fixed guidance line item, asset quality, let's move on to that one, which is not always the easiest part to predict given our highly dynamic operating environment. So as always, we do choose to guide you as conservative as possible in this line. So taking into account this conservativeness, let's say, we are projecting an NPL level that's less than 7%. Now how we get to this level is that now in the new NPL inflows, we think we'll be lower, especially upon the fact that most of the big ticket items were already accounted in 2018, especially in the last quarter. And so year-on-year, when we just look at the new NPL inflow line, it's going to be lower. We do expect lower. However, we do expect higher inflows coming from the retail portfolio. I mean we haven't seen much in 2018 in [slow-term] retail. But in expectation of the lower GDP growth, higher unemployment rates, we're expecting some inflows from the retail portfolio.</p><p>Also in our assumption lies a collection performance that's lower than last year, about 1/3 lower than 2018. So combine that with the denominator, not as much growth in Turkish lira lending. We're expecting an NPL ratio below 7%. And the translation of this into the total net cost of risk, we're projecting a net total cost of risk of below 300 basis points. So this is where we stand in terms of the...</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: As Handan stated, maybe I'm rephrasing again, it's not easy item going forward to forecast, to estimate the budget. These 2 ratios, because NPL ratio is -- you cannot control much because the denomination effect is always there, number one. But cost of risk, more importantly, we did approach, as always, very prudent, very conservative. So what we believe, as of now, most of the big tickets asset quality story is almost over. But next year will be in terms of growth, in terms of inflation and so on and so forth, macro-wise, not an easy year. So we're expecting the smaller tickets from the retail portfolios, and (inaudible) portfolios, will continue to deteriorate. So we're bringing some pressure on the NPL ratio as well as net cost of risk. So we try to be as conservative as possible. And hopefully, we will come up with some upsides if we can here.</p><p>And the debt 300, as an example, based on some macro assumptions, which are the macro realities 2, 3 months ago, so we have seen a better outlook in terms of macro now and going forward. So that will hopefully positively impact in our IFRS models for the upcoming provisions. But again, take it around 300 for your conservative analysis studies. Hopefully, we'll update you -- guide you in time. So this year is going to be a very difficult year for us to promise, especially on this slide, anything specific for the next 12 months. Hopefully, it will -- coming up better guidance's throughout each quarter.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: But, of course, our prudent provisioning always serves as a good cushion, especially in a decelerating economy. So a little more well guarded. Would like to speak well, right?</p><p>Now let's look to the net fees and commission. The double-digit growth momentum will be preserved in 2019 as well after a significant increase in 2018 of 30%, around 30% that we anticipate for 2018 year-end. The growth will be mainly coming from the payment systems. And payment systems, recall that they contribute more than 50% of our net fees and commission. So we do expect about mid-teens net fees and commissions growth coming from the payment systems and money transfer fees, whereas on the cash and noncash loan fees, we're expecting slight to slightly down. This is parallel to our lending growth projection.</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: But again, this is -- remember, last year, when we were here, it came up with the same low teens guidance for fees and commissions and also suddenly come up around 30%. So hopefully, it will come up some good surprise. But again, to be on the conservative side, make your calculations with your low teens in this front as well.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Okay. Now lastly, let's also look at the operating expense items. Now cost discipline, you must have noticed, has been one of our top priorities for the last 3 years, and 2019 will be no exception. We are projecting the low CPI growth to continue in 2019 as well. Now, of course, there are uncontrollable facts causing costs to increase eventually such as the Turkish lira depreciation and high inflation. We got hit in 2018, but we managed it quite well, as I mentioned earlier. We project the impact of these 2 factors, TL depreciation, and the high inflation, to be in the low teens parallel to the macro expectations.</p><p>As you're aware, we've been implementing a new business model. Last year, we shared it with you, the branch model. The last 1.5 years, we've been working on this. And not only that but also, we've been investing in a grand technology hub in Pendik, like a space center. That project has been underway for a long time. Now these 2 visionary projects are now up and running, and therefore, we will be seeing the amortization costs hitting the OpEx line starting from 2019, from this year. So this impact alone will have roughly 2% increase in OpEx on a year-on-year basis. And despite this, the overall, again, we'll manage just below CPI.</p><p>Now also, in terms of the number of FTEs, you may have noticed actually has not been growing for the last 3 years, which is also true for our number of branches. Now this trend likely will remain the same as our new service model enables us to operate with much higher efficiency. And on the other hand, our HR strategy remains the same, and our HR costs are to increase above inflation.</p><p>And for the portion that's controllable, we will continue to work on projects to create further efficiencies and keep the OpEx growth below the average CPI.</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: Yes. I mean I was going to mention 2 things. I mean as Garanti culture, we don't like to be showing off things, and we try to be more quiet than being on the stage. The IT compass that we built, I mean, we would like to host you there, but it's in Pendik. So it will take for you to go and come at least 3 hours for you. So we don't want to hear some more words from you, but I hope one time, we'll create an opportunity to show you. I mean we've been creating a hub -- I mean really, really something to be seen. So that is already effective end of this year. So all our IT operations and related functions, already more than fully based in Pendik and functioning from there, that's finished. And that will create some -- as you might guess, an impact on our OpEx. As well as our branch transformation, I will be giving the details in a few minutes, that's finished as well, end of November, and 97% completion. We call it 100% because the 3%, there are some special cases for the branches. So that's finished as well.</p><p>So those are creating the pressures on the OpEx, but we are still saying, and in the last 3 years, we are the true leaders of the sustainable efficiency performance. That will be the thing going forward as well, including 2019. So you will be seeing us not only best bank but also best efficient bank in the country. So this will continue.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Okay. Thank you. Now we actually move to your presentation.</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: So I don't want to bore you much, but I would like to give you, on behalf of our whole team, the transformation journey, some flavor from our transformation journey. So we believe that the transformation is happening for the last -- I don't know how many years or decades. It's because of the technology, because of the customers, because of the competition. So the technology has been changing, as you know, we've been following very closely. Drastically, that is impacting the customer behaviors and the needs. So their expectations are changing. And competition, I mean, so far, I cannot say that we've been threatened by the nonfinancials or nonbanks yet, but what we have seen, very good examples globally. So we have to be ready to compete or fight with this type of -- in a competitive environment. So that's why we've been transforming ourselves for many years, and this will continue.</p><p>So the very good example, as I already stated, the branch transformation project that we have started 1.5 years ago. The implementation took in 1 year, a little more than a year. So we have converted almost 97% of our branches to a new format. We call it internally the silent revolution. I believe it's a silent evolution because it was a really big thing, big project aiming a lot of things. But what we did in this project, we really -- the role of the new lobby service model, I think, designed, physically designed, not only physically designed but designed everything, including the process fees, including the customer journeys and try to make them as much as digital as possible.</p><p>And most of the efficiencies will come from the final item. We redefined the roles and responsibilities in the lobby levels. We used to have 5 different responsibilities and 5 different people working for that interesting specific responsibility, give merge under [2]. So this was the biggest challenge to converting our people overnight from one -- someone to multiple persons. So it was a very great project. It ended. So we converted all our branch network very successfully.</p><p>What we got -- actually, we aimed or we object our objectives in 4 pillars. Number one, it was the sales and efficiency improvements. These are the real figures that's reflecting the realities of the first half, to be frank because things are quite -- much quieter in the second half of the year. But what we have tested, what we have seen in the normal days, we improved our sales at least by 10%. So that happened. That has proven reality of this project.</p><p>Number two, we digitized all the processes, and we make them as much as digital and lean possible. So we'll be giving an example here. A loan, a typical branch loan is taking now 7 minutes. It used to be taking half an hour in the branch in terms of total process. It's 7 minutes because of the digital loan approval process. Now as of now, that 85%, I'm sure, about 90%.</p><p>Our main objective, one of our main objective was the employee is creating the better, more competent employees for the future of this bank in the branches. I think we're glad to say that -- I can say that we created that capacity and that competence in our branches. And customers has always been our first priority. What we have seen -- the waiting times in the queues are shrinking. And now I can very probably share with you that based on our NPS, Net Promoter Score researches, we are still, again, the #1 bank in the country in terms of Net Promoter Score or, in other words, customer satisfaction.</p><p>I think this project also has a lot to maintain this leadership in the customer happiness. But is this finished? Yes, the project is finished, but things are still under progress. As BBVA, our purpose is to bring the age of opportunity to everyone. This will be our motto. This will be our purpose going forward. So this means our transformation journey will continue.</p><p>What you will see us in terms of our transformation journey was all the building blocks. There are many that we can share with you that we've been concentrating on do-it-yourself. It has been very first priority for some time, and now it reached 93%, as far as I remember, 93%. Whatever you can do in the branch, you can do with digital in the consumer. 93%, I think, one of the highest levels globally. For the commercial clients, corporate clients, we're above 50%, yes. So we will be continuing to build more efficiencies and more flexibilities, functionalities and do-it-yourself.</p><p>The second pillar is the open market. Open market in -- I don't want to bore you in the details, but to serve any customer, that includes noncustomers of Garanti through not only Garanti channels but from everywhere. So that's the spirit. That's the objective that we want to position ourselves going forward. So that's why we call us not a digital bank but a digital company. There are a lot of things to do going forward, you might agree with me, but that is the clear vision for us going forward.</p><p>The third one is the touch points. We believe that, yes, technology is important. Efficiencies, processes are very important, but our people are the key assets of Garanti, has always been like that. So it will be like that forever. So what we try to do, we migrate the power with the technology power. The branch project was an example, good example as well as with the step platform. We've been sharing with you this step platform. That's the one app, one single app on our tablets. So that is the banking platform for our employees. So that makes our people mobilized. So that makes our people with the customers through technology. That will be our main vision, one of the main vision pillars going forward.</p><p>The other thing is the data and advice. I mean I can say that there are a lot of things to be done here. I don't think anybody is doing a great job globally, including big tech companies. So there's a long way to go, but our very core value proposition to customers is trust. So we believe that trust is coming with data and the power of data, sharing with the data -- of customers' data with us. So we're building our older processes and strategy and the policies regarding this data use, data efficiency and come up with the right advice, right solutions to our customers based on data, including to improve the customers' financial out. That will be another important pillar going forward.</p><p>And finally, we've been investing our business model for some time heavily. So the items here, I already mentioned to you the data-driven organization. That is one of the keys. Lean processes with engineering automation are the second part. AI is -- and the robotics, I mean, we started to use robotics, not the physical robots but robot algorithms in our operation centers by now. So this also will improve.</p><p>And finally, we've been transforming our organization, our (inaudible) organization to agile organization. That has already started with the head office, and it will continue with many functions throughout this year.</p><p>So overall, this will be the main items in our efficient business model. Hopefully, we come up with more details.</p><p>So finally, to wrap up our expectation before taking your questions. Again, tough year, not an easy year, challenging year, but the good news is expected. So our approach not to face with the surprises, especially negative surprises, so we come up with this -- from this outlook, more robust, more conservative and prudent, as always, with some guidance's to you. So Turkish lira loans, let me repeat, 5%, mainly driven from business lending, not from the retail, except credit cards. Foreign currency loans, no demand, not big investments in the country and a lot of redemptions. So that has been happening in the last 3 years. It happened in 2018, and it will continue as saw in 2019 as well with 10%.</p><p>NPL, we just comment on that. Net cost of risk like that. And hopefully, we'll come up with some upward revisions in a positive way in these figures. NIM, again, we come up with the conservative approach. Hopefully, second half of the year will be a better year than expected. So we come up with some improvements in the NIM margins. Figure of low teens, I don't want to make any further comments on the fee and the OpEx. And as a result, we're still under this conservative assumptions guidance as we still can come up with low teens ROEs.</p><p>So we believe that in a challenging environment like this, it's not going to be easy to come up with some good profitability. So under these circumstances, coming up low-teens ROEs is a good performance. But hopefully, this rebalancing period will end soon, end of this year. And hopefully, starting from 2020, it will come up much better ROE figures. As I stated here, we're not changing our midterm ROE targets at high teens, hopefully, for some years, above 20%.</p><p>So this is the summary and we are all now ready to take your questions. Right, Handan?</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Yes, please. Yes.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: One gentle reminder. Because of everybody listening to us on the video, could you please speak on the microphone and introduce yourselves. Thank you.</p><p>SAMUEL MAGNUM GOODACRE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND HEAD OF EMERGING MARKET EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (CEEMEA) BANKS, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. It's Sam Goodacre from JPMorgan. I've got a couple of questions. The first is on asset quality and, specifically, it relates to the expected deterioration in your retail portfolio. We've obviously had an early corporate cycle. What sort of cycle are you expecting from retail in terms of the duration and the magnitude? And can you share some of your expectations on the macro indicators that would impact retail? Was unemployment part of the kind of demographic that you think the weakest and that you are most watching as it were. So that's the first question on retail to quality. The second one is on fees. Because, of course, your guidance for 2019 is exactly what it was this time of year of 2018. And as you said, there's a massive surprise. How much of that surprise was under your control? And related to the transformation journey that you've just been speaking about, what elements of that transformation could you perhaps point to as future drivers of [more volume]?</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: Thanks, Sam. Regarding the first question, the current picture, if I'm not mistaken, I'm going to give you rough figures. Maybe my colleagues correct me if I'm wrong. The retail portfolios, total NPL figures, including all products as of now is less than 4%. Including mortgages, including credit cards, including GPL, those 2 products are uncollateralized products, as you might guess, including the auto loans. So we're assuming the unemployment as of now is 11.3%, very roughly. This might go up about 13%, but not 14%, about 13% end of the year. That's our best case scenario. That's one thing in our models in that calculations for the NPLs and the cost of risk.</p><p>And number two, please do remind that the household debt to GDP is still 15%, 16% to GDP ratio or something like that, I mean, much less than before. So yes, there will be deterioration in the retail portfolio, as expected, within our figures. And what we try to do, come up with some worse macro parameters. We are modeling those assumptions for this retail portfolio. That includes higher unemployment, higher inflation and worse than the expected foreign currency after -- going forward, although none of them exposed to foreign currency. That is the main indicator for the whole economy.</p><p>So very -- in summary, very briefly, we tried to be as conservative as possible for the portfolio in our assumptions. That is already included in our guidance's. But our real debt much concerned coming up from those segments going forward, not much relatively than in the past.</p><p>The second part of the question, fees and commissions. I'll give you one example. You have seen the average inflation expectation for 2019 is 19% and 55% of our fees coming up from payment systems. Payment system fees, 2 portions: merchant fees and the credit card fees.</p><p>We already increased the annual card fees, [with interest]. That same thing will be happening with the merchant fees. So I'll give you a tip for the upside. 55% of the portfolio, fees and commissions portfolio, is already linked with the CPI. So there might be some loss coming up from the cash loans, yes, true. Our cash loan portion is how much? 17%? 14%, 15% of the total. Expect 5% growth, 10% growth, much less than the inflation. So royalties are really, really low guidance. Hopefully, I mean, I don't want to promise again. What I guide you, in theory, low levels, but in terms of my hunches, it should be much better. Hopefully, our Board is not listening to me.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Maybe one small reminder, if I may add. In the retail portfolio, the average ticket sizes are small. So I mean if we're seeing higher unemployment, like almost all of this unemployment is gone -- and their already existing interest rates are at attractive levels because they're fixed, rates. So don't expect as much flows as we received from those big-ticket items.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: And transformation, I think it's already happening. I mean, we call -- we don't call our transformation journey digitalization or digitizing ourselves, but it's the main -- the main part is happening. I mean, we've been the leaders for the last 22 years in this digital world. And I think we are the, by far, best performance generating fees and commissions from that segment. That's part of our transformation journey. And we're not losing any market share, we're not losing edge from that front. So transformation will further help to improve the fees and commissions going forward, hopefully. Sorry.</p><p>GABOR ZOLTAN KEMENY, RESEARCH ANALYST, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: This is Gabor Kemeny from Autonomous Research. I would also ask about asset quality, as I think a key assumption of the 2019 (inaudible).</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: Your guidance cover for this year. Change your subject. You've been asking all the time asset quality questions. Okay.</p><p>GABOR ZOLTAN KEMENY: So yes, the NPL formation, you are expecting to slow down and migrate to retail, I understand. And I'm sure you have done many sensitivities. And as you said, around your macro assumption, would you be able to give us a sense of how the asset quality metrics could look like if, let's say, we don't get a modest growth in the economy, but a more negative scenario with, let's say, a recession?</p><p>And the other question, I understand that you are expecting roughly 2-percentage point NPL formation in 2019. And the provisioning assumption, which is below 3%, suggests that you might actually over provide for the NPL. So that sounds very conservative. Are you expecting the additional provisions on the -- so what is driving the additional provisions on the Stage 1 and Stage 2 exposure, given that you see an easing in the macro parameters of your model?</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: I mean that's the best case scenario. But in our -- the more conservative more -- worse scenario and worst scenarios, the NPL ratio, still within the single-digit levels. That is in our budgetary NPL scenarios. So I can state that NPL will stay single digits not only in our best scenario but in our worst case scenario. So that is one thing I can share with you.</p><p>The second part was the...</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: The provision.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: I mean the bigger tickets, by nature, comes up with some collateral for the NPL. I mean as an example, a big company or a big project that always comes up with some collateral value. So when you go down for the SME portfolio that's also valid, it comes with the collaterals all the time. So the provision level is relatively less. But when you go a little further down for those credit cards, for those GPLs, for those retail portfolio, those are uncollateralized. So whenever you provision, you have to provision 100%. So that's not the case for the much bigger ticket items. That's why -- that is the main difference between cost of risk and the 2 percentage points of NPL increase.</p><p>GABOR ZOLTAN KEMENY: And you mentioned a worst case estimate in terms of your NPL and provisioning sensitivity. Would you be able to give us a sense of what assumptions did you make in this worst case in terms of macro parameters.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: I don't have it with me, but -- and again, dollar goes up, again, about 7 -- negative growth to 2%, 3% negative growth in the country, 4% -- minus 4%, those are typical worst-case assumptions for our scenario. And I'm sure next question will be, in that scenario, what will be the level of the cost of risk? That will be less than or around 400 bps.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: We have Waleed in the front row.</p><p>WALEED MALIK MOHSIN, EQUITY ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Waleed from Goldman Sachs. A couple of topics I want to explore and I also wanted to talk about the asset quality. So given the news around restructuring of [soccer club] debt as well as news around consumer debt restructuring, which is -- probably will be undertaken by Ziraat bank. I just want to understand if this would have any implication for Garanti. And what kind of implications would that be? And secondly, have you seen any other incremental impact from Otas as some of your competitors have highlighted? So any impact from that?</p><p>And finally, linked to this point last quarter, you've guided for 300 -- below 300 basis points of net cost of risk for 2019. In terms of quarterly net cost of risk, most banks have talked about first quarter as being the most difficult. Where do you see first quarter net cost of this? Or where would you see peak net cost of risk on a quarterly basis?</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: [Soccer clubs], we will have no exposure to soccer clubs . So are not getting involved in the restructuring of the soccer clubs process. We don't know anything related with that. For the debt, especially the credit debt, restructuring announced yesterday. And very frankly, we really don't know the conditions of the restructuring program, whom are eligible, in what terms. And in terms, meaning, we know the loan structure, but we don't know who are eligible, what makes you go and get the loan, we really don't know. So I cannot give you the neat picture regarding that. But I can share with you for our credit card portfolio, NPS ratio is 4.3%, and the total book of our NPL is like TRY 1.1 billion.</p><p>So if that portfolio moves in, I think that's not a very bad news for Garanti for the micro level. So -- but again, I cannot make any comment regarding how much will be the impact and so on and so forth without knowing the structure yet. Unfortunately, we cannot share. I cannot share with you. If I knew, I would do so.</p><p>WALEED MALIK MOHSIN: (inaudible) the one they have difficulties, not the (inaudible). So they have the eligible...</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: The definition is not clear. Are those NPL customers eligible or delinquent customers are eligible and so on and so forth. So -- but again, we'll let you know as soon as we have the information. The Otas, I'm sure you heard from our dear friends yesterday or today regarding Otas and the structure, the same structure applies to us. So this means 33% write-off. The remaining will be now, as a single loan, it will be, as Handan stated, in the first quarter, most likely, will be the equity and loan swap 20% to 80%. This means we'll be some kind of positioning that company as our subsidiary with 20% of the remaining growth.</p><p>So in total, the total amount written off plus equity will be 50%, maybe a little bit more than 50%, very roughly. So that's the thing I can share with you. Anything else, I don't have any other information. So what was the last question?</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: The cost of risk.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: I mean it's very difficult. Unfortunately, it's very difficult for you. I mean I can share with you this quarter will be this much, this quarter will be that much. But more likely, the intensity will be in the first half, that's because we'll look into that in the next 3 quarters. But how much will be the distribution to the year, but expect that throughout the year. And I expect that the retail performance comes with a lag. I mean better -- to the better news with a lag, to negative news with a lag. So it started, and it will continue to start. Even if the economy started to perform in the second half, the impact will be not directly in a positive way to the retail portfolio in the second half. So unfortunately, I don't have any information. And yes, we have numbers in our budget, but those are more equally distributed numbers throughout the year.</p><p>ALAN RAMSEY WEBBORN, EQUITY ANALYST, SOCIETE GENERALE CROSS ASSET RESEARCH: This is Alan Webborn from SocGen. What, in your view, is the message that the regulator is giving to you in terms of core capital? I think you've all had the early Christmas letters from the regulator telling you, you have to have 12% in Tier 1 if you want to pay the dividend. Is that how you interpret it? And how do you feel the regulator is -- wants you to behave in this environment? And once I get the 2 of you to talk about dividends, perhaps you could give us a view on what you think is the responsible approach given what the outlook is for next year. And that was the first question.</p><p>The second question was on loan restructuring. Are you -- how do you feel the process is going. I mean from the outside of Turkey, we hear numbers of there being up to 1,000 corporates in the process of taking advantage of laying restructuring opportunity and so on, and whether that's good for like the SME tale of companies. How do you feel the process of the corporates adjusting to the new environment is going? Do you wish it was being done in a different way? Do you have a particular approach? What's your intention and what you feel the impact on you risk costs is as a result of this process? That was the second question. And the third one was, obviously, we do a lot for the Garanti employees if we're getting an above an inflation improvement in our salaries this year. It always seems a little generous in this environment and always seems that a fixed cost that, again, it's a very uncertain environment. How do you manage -- I know you want to keep your employees happy, but the above-inflation HR costs is a market where we have very little idea what the economic growth outlook is going to be. Now cost of risk could be 500 basis points at the end of this year if there are a few shops that we're not expecting. How do you manage that, giving that message to your employees differently in a very uncertain year. It would be interesting to get your view about it.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: Difficult question, the last one. The first one, the BRSA direction, in general, capital -- those measures, core balance measures, we've been saying those were temporary. And they just said, it's over, they were temporary. So we are back to normal, back to BRSA, Basel III standards. So the approach of BRSA is just as in the universal approach anymore, so end of the year. So we're not expecting anything new on that front. Regarding the dividends, we are still internally in the discussions if we should or should not pay dividends this year. So that decision has not been taken or sealed by the Board yet, so I cannot share with you. We will be applying to BRSA to pay some or not.</p><p>But to us, in our reading of what BRSA says, if you're comfortable with your capital, you might come up and ask for it. So that's our interpretation. So as soon as we decide internally and approved by the Board, then we will come up, leave to you the guidance if you're going to pay the dividends this year or not. So I think this was the first question.</p><p>The second question. I mean in general, what you see, Alan, from Paris or from London, a little bit worse picture. I mean regarding -- here's an example, this restructuring concordatos. Concordato is an English word. No? I'm not sure anybody asks this. But I think that English speaking people understand concordato. I think, yes. So it's a little bit exaggerated this year. I mean the number of companies, end of the year, reached like 1,500 -- 1,500, 1,600. And then you look at the last 2, 3 months, inflows is much less, but not the system. But we've been working almost 1 million from very small companies to very large corporates. And commercial companies, excluding the SMEs, we've been working like almost 40,000 companies, only us, not the system. So the numbers are a little bit more attractive and exaggerated in that front. I'm not saying to you we're not restructuring anything. I mean what we're doing internally, if a customer, an individual or a company, have a difficulty to pay their upcoming debt in terms of installments, in terms of capital. But if they have the ability to maintain their performance, going forward, you're helping them. That's our approach. And that's our responsibility as well as a banker, as a bank. In that front, that's happening. But more the news -- I mean this started to the year last year, remember 2 names, 3 names. The same corporate names, we talk and talk and talk, and we just stop talking by now, those 3 names. But can you name another 3, 5 names on top of that list? Not much.</p><p>So we talk about [soccer clubs]. So it's a few soccer clubs . I don't know how many banks. I think 2 or 3 banks.</p><p>So what I'm trying to say, I'm not defending the lousy picture that we have in terms of asset quality, but we are managing. If we can manage, we're setting us for the provisions very generously. But at the same time, it was fine on the Stage 2, it's required on the Stage 3. That's happening. But overall, the image internationally in that front, a little bit more exaggerated to me. These are my personal comments.</p><p>Regarding the HR costs and the inflationary, and so on and so forth. Number one, the employees are, as I stated in my presentation, the main assets of banks. We believe that we have the best talent in the country and we would love to work with them forever, with the best talent. So I think that's one thing. That's an investment for us. It's not an expense, number one. But regarding the difficulties in the coming environment, we've been increasing the efficiency, and we keep up paying them. All the time, inflation and average salaries of Garanti employees should be higher than the average bank employees in the system most likely. So -- but we're happy to make the raises, and inflation raise is just the customer taken into account. Everybody, every employee expecting an inflation. If you don't do any inflation, you'll be in a trouble. So that's another side of the story.</p><p>But that's not (inaudible) for Garanti employees' work for sure. But on top, and I did not mention the FTEs, we've been transforming as well in terms of headcount. Year 2017, total FTE decreases from (inaudible) almost 5%. Total FTE reduction in 1 year in 2017. '18, around 3%, on top. So we're not, at the same time, we're growing. We're optimizing not the branches, number of branches much dramatically, but optimizing the number of FTEs in a positive way, and this will be sustainable performance of Garanti going forward. As long as we can do that, we will be happy to pay them more if we can. So that's all the -- our approach. It might be different from other companies' approach. And hopefully, we'll be doing that.</p><p>HADRIEN DE BELLE, ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Hadrien De Belle, KBW. Just a follow-up question on asset quality. And IFRS 9, how much profit (inaudible) decreasing you can have in your profitability, meaning macro and in GDP, in your 300 basis points cost of risk? That would be my question.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: In terms of nominal values, maybe we can share with you. But the budget of this year, TRY 2 billion, roughly.</p><p>HADRIEN DE BELLE: TRY 2 billion?</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: For the whole year, the provisions regarding the macro. Or am I exaggerating it?</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: TRY 1 billion. TRY 1 billion.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: TRY 1 billion.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: TRY 1 billion is the max.</p><p>HADRIEN DE BELLE: For '18 or '19?,</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: For '19.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: For '19.</p><p>HADRIEN DE BELLE: TRY 1 billion.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: TRY 1 billion. But for '18, we had set aside much more.</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: It's an ongoing process (inaudible) '18, so how we approach to the...</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: So macro permit, we saw the main inputs. And the provisions are the outputs. And around the system, I think, it is more conservative, that is the number. And this sets aside, I don't know how much, TRY 1.2 billion. I think more.</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: TRY 1.2 billion.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: TRY 1.2 billion in 2018. So just to make sure to compare the numbers. So only for a macro impact, to make it clear, 2018, TRY 1.2 billion; budgeted for 2019, TRY 1 billion. So in 2 years, TRY 2.2 billion from only macro impact.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: That's still conservative. We're not expecting as much macro volatility as we made in 2018, actually. That makes it conservative.</p><p>SIMON NELLIS, MD AND DIRECTOR, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Simon Nellis from Citibank. Just a quick question on the free provisions that you have. You have quite a bit of free provisions. It sounds like you're going to create more in the fourth quarter. In your plan for 2019, is there any release expected in those numbers (inaudible) for a rainy day.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: Not planned. I mean, of course, we'll be watching very closely the developments. But it is no more likely that we will be setting aside any further provisions. That's also not flat. No release, no increase.</p><p>SIMON NELLIS: You haven't really -- have you factored in some -- because you've had currency hedge impacts on the risk cost continues in 2019.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: That's still the same approach.</p><p>SIMON NELLIS: So the 300 excluding any...</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: Fully hedged approach will continue in 2019 as well.</p><p>SIMON NELLIS: I mean the 300 basis points were below risk cost guidance is excluding the currency impact. So actually it could be higher given the currency depreciation factored into our plan.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: I think including.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Including.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: Including.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: To make it comparable to the peers.</p><p>EMIR MORAN, SENIOR ASSOCIATE, UNLU &amp; CO., RESEARCH DIVISION: Emir Moran, (inaudible). Can you share your capital ratio targets for next year -- for this year, actually, and where they would stand compared to 2018 year-end?</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: I think, so around '17, most likely at the same level that we had this year. So we are not expecting major changes much.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: And profitability will continue, and the risk-weighted asset growth...</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: And the FX portfolio will be shrinking in the risk-weighted assets. And FX expectation, as we have stated, more normal than the recent developments. So we believe we can maintain our car ratio around '17 as we have -- as we will be reporting this shortly at the end of 2018, solar ratios, solar car ratios.</p><p>EMIR MORAN: (inaudible)</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: 85% of Tier 1.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: Yes, yes. 85% of the total car ratio is Tier 1. No plan in the Tier 1 or Tier 2.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible). My question is regarding the monetary policy, the expectations, as well as for representation. You are plugging in roughly 400 basis points easing towards the end of the year. So when do you expect the easing to start in terms of timing? And does all the spreads -- does evolution affect that evolution?</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: I mean it's not easy to guess, but what we're saying that type 1 is their policy as had been shared with the public why the economy management will continue. With that assumption, Central Bank will wait for some trend change, real trend change in the inflation. And this will trigger the downward trend in the interest rates, our expectations close to second half. So this means, May, June will be the trend change point. So that anything can happen, I don't know, I say. But in terms of trend, the real thing will be happening after June. That's in our calculation. So based on assumptions, 16% will be this year's inflation. So 400 bps rate cut will be happening mainly in the second half of the year.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Any other questions on the floor?</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: We do have some...</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: If we don't have further questions here. We can -- yes, I mean, do we have any questions for the ones connected to the conference call?</p><p>OPERATOR: We don't have any questions on the line right now. (Operator Instructions)</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Okay. If there are no further questions connected to online, we have some questions addressed through the web. The first one is from (inaudible) from Everest Asset Management. Could you please comment on Credit Guarantee Fund loans? How much of such exposure has been restructured? And how much have you actually collected from Credit Guarantee Fund?</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: The main accumulation ended early this year in terms of Credit Guarantee Fund, and redemptions are still continuing. As of today, total balance of Credit Guarantee Funds is TRY 15 million.</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: TRY 14.6 million.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: TRY 14.6 million as of now, the highest that we have seen, if you might remember, TRY 24 million, TRY 25 million. The NPL ratio, (inaudible)?</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: 2.4%.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: As of now, still 3.7%, much less the market.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Gross. That's gross, though.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: Gross. Yes, yes.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: 3.7% is gross.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: That portfolio is generating 3.7% NPL ratio. As you might remember, 7% cap. So we are still developing that 7%.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: And the net is...</p><p>AYDIN G\u00c3\u00bcLER: (inaudible)</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: And the second question, what will be the minimum acceptable NPL coverage ratio for Garanti? How much coverage ratio could decline?...</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: '19...</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: I mean I don't know the year-end figure, but it should be around 60%. I think we'll be maintaining this figure. If not, it will go up going forward, just as mentioned to, I think, Gabor's question for the collateralized ones, big tickets versus the smaller tickets. So most like the NPL coverages will be around 60%, if not more. Second.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: From Valentina from Barclays. Where do you expect the majority of NPL inflows to come from, from Stage 2 loans or straight from your performing portfolio? What is the assumptions for coverage?</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: The third question. I mean the inflows will come up from the mid-sized and smaller sized loans, that includes commercial SMEs and retail. That will be the main inflows coming up from the portfolio. Most likely, based on our previous experience, Stage 2 loans will be the main source of the NPLs going forward because of the IFRS 9, because of the restructuring and because of the other watchlist strategy of Garanti.</p><p>The second question, can you share your expectations towards 2019? Any increasing versus 2018 figures and so on and so forth?</p><p>I think we ended the year, again, around the same levels. I think as always, the -- we were the first movers. We've been criticized heavily and everybody is coming up with our levels. So the situation will be there, if not a little bit, we'll go up. But we're not expecting any further extraordinary increases in the special loans going forward. So as of now, it is 16%</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: 16%.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: Around 16%. So expect around those figures. Our -- John is asking, John (inaudible) is asking a question.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: From (inaudible) company. Garanti is going to be a house bank for many large corporates in Turkey, which are predominantly foreign currency borrowings. What is the downside of investing less into this franchise by shrinking the FX book?</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: I mean as you expect, it's a balance game. I mean you're making a lot of gains, incomes, interest incomes, fee income, but at the same time, you're losing some because of the provisions. So the nature is shifting the Turkish lira. We find it very healthy. We are supporting to continue. Of course, those exporters, of course, those FX revenue companies will be borrowing from us in FX. But the FX story of the banking system for the next couple of years, I should say, is over. Expect those exports, of course. You'll find this healthy. It should be the case. I think we win as Turkish banks overexposed to big ticket FX loans, and we've been penalized recently for this as Turkish banks. So the downside, yes, less revenues. But upside will be hopefully, with the growth with the investment because Turkey is lacking in terms of investments in macro terms for some years, hopefully, one time, it will start again. So we as banks, and as a leading bank in the industry, will support these investments going forward, hopefully. So we'll be benefiting from that trend, hopefully, as well.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: So the main reason for the shrinkage in foreign currency lending is the redemption because we were large lenders in 2010 to 2013, so redemption technique.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: Yulia is asking from Federated Investors, are you assuming any new forbearance measures from -- on capital in 2019? No.</p><p>The second question, would the 7% NPL ratio will be the peak? Yes, in our business plan for 2019, '20 and '21 is the peak. Yes.</p><p>And the last question, giving your (inaudible) for retail asset quality, what are you choosing to grow credit cards -- why are you?</p><p>As I already stated, credit cards, in general, has not been growing much in the last 3, 4 years because of the base, lower base effect. That was the main driver. And as I always stated, we have a new card program to tap the -- not the affluent, but mid-affluent segments with our travel and entertainment cards. So that will boost another market share in our credit cards, Yulia.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Maybe one more thing to add here is that, keep in mind that in Turkey, the minimum dues are high. So -- and also the rollover ratios, average rollover ratio is still faring around 30% only.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: So we don't have any further questions. So thanks so much, first of all. So we wish you as a whole entity a great year.</p><p>So to just wrap up, just a few words. We as Garanti team, some our colleagues from on top management from our head office are with us, we are very confident, number one. We know what to do. We know what we are doing. I think this is very important. We have the best talent, best team, I mean, not only in Turkey. I mean I think when you compare with many jurisdictions, we have the great team. We have very clear minds, we trust this country. We will be here forever, so we'll be doing our best, and hopefully, we'll continue to be the best bank in Turkey for the short term, midterm and long term. Thank you for your patience, and we'll be in touch as we did last year with you with the (inaudible). So again, have a great year. Thank you.</p><p>HANDAN SAYGIN: Thank you. And as an IR team, we're always here to help you further with your questions. So feel free to contact us anytime.</p><p>ALI FUAT ERBIL: Thank you.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

I mean most of the <xhtml:span class=\"hit\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">regulatory</xhtml:span> risks we face is really at the local and state level, not as much at the national level.

(Operator Instructions) Your host for today's conference is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.</p><p>JASON REILLEY, VP OF IR, AVALONBAY COMMUNITIES, INC.: Thank you, Matt, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.</p><p>Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There's a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.</p><p>As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.avalonbay.com/earnings\">www.avalonbay.com/earnings</url>, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.</p><p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON, CHAIRMAN, CEO &amp; PRESIDENT, AVALONBAY COMMUNITIES, INC.: Thanks, Jason, and welcome to the Q2 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Sean, Kevin and I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night, and then all of us will be available for Q&amp;A afterwards. Our comments will focus on providing a summary of Q2 results, an update on operations and some perspective on development in the balance sheet now that we've entered an economic recession.</p><p>But before getting started on the deck, I thought I would offer a few general comments about the environment we are currently facing. To say things have changed over the last 4 months is certainly an understatement. We are in the middle of the largest global health care crisis in a century. The economic downturn is the most severe we've seen since the Great Depression and on the heels of the longest expansion on record. And social unrest is at a level we haven't experienced since Vietnam and the civil rights movement over 50 years ago.</p><p>It's been said, but these are indeed unprecedented times. And these events aren't just having an unprecedented impact on economic activity but also on income and wealth distribution across industries in the broader population. For those companies and workers leveraged to the virtual economy, they're actually doing quite well, and some are even thriving. For those companies and workers that operate in the real economy of bricks-and-mortar like AVB, we're certainly feeling the normal effects and then some of the downturn. And then for those companies and workers in the travel, leisure and entertainment sectors, among others, they are basically in shutdown mode. These sectors as well as others will undoubtedly need to be restructured over the next few years. Many companies will not survive, and their employees, if evenly temporarily furloughed for now, will join the ranks of the permanently unemployed over the next several quarters. And unfortunately, those impacted by these events or most impacted by these events are those in lower-paying service jobs and minority populations. As a result, this downturn carries not just the normal economic risk of prior recessions but also profound health, social and political risk that are likely to shape the length and shape -- shape the length and of the economic recovery.</p><p>So while this was a sudden and quick downturn, the timing and shape of the recovery is hard to project. And that presents a unique challenge in managing our business and communicating our expectations to you, our shareholders. Having said that, we'll do our best to be as transparent and direct as possible as we all try to understand and engage how the current environment will play out in our business in the months and quarters ahead.</p><p>Right now, let's turn to the results for the quarter, starting in -- on Slide 4. As expected, Q2 was a challenging quarter. Core FFO growth was down almost 2% driven by a same-store revenue decline of almost 3%, or 2.2% if retail is excluded. And on a sequential basis, from Q1, same-store revenue was down 4.5%, or 3.9% excluding retail.</p><p>We had no development completions or new development starts this quarter. And we've had no starts so far year-to-date. And lastly, we raised over $700 million in capital this quarter at an average initial cost of 2.8%, with most of that coming from a $600 million long 10-year bond deal at a rate of around 2.5%. As Kevin will share in his remarks, our liquidity, balance sheet and credit metrics are very well positioned heading into this downturn.</p><p>Turning to Slide 5. I wanted to drill down a bit more on the decline in same-store residential revenues this past quarter. As this slide demonstrates, the decline was primarily attributable to a loss of occupancy and uncollectible lease revenue or bad debt.</p><p>Economic occupancy was down 120 basis points, while bad debt was 200 bps higher than normal. Higher-than-normal bad debt is likely to continue, given the breadth and depth of the downturn, coupled with eviction moratorium in many of the markets in which we operate.</p><p>We also experienced higher concessions in the quarter and lower other income as we waived various fees this past quarter for our residents, including late payments, common area amenity and credit card convenience fees. Average lease rate for our same-store portfolio in Q2 was actually up 1.8% over Q2 of 2019, reflecting embedded rent growth on leases entered into in 2019 through Q1 of this year.</p><p>Turning to Slide 6. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, this downturn poses a unique risk relative to other recessions. In addition to the household contraction and consolidation that occurs due to job losses in any downturn, the pandemic is driving other trends that are impacting rental demand. These include work-from-home flexibility that is shifting some renter demand from higher cost and urban/infill markets. Many renters are relocating, perhaps only temporarily, to lower-cost markets or submarkets, leisure areas or even back home with their parents.</p><p>Second, record-low mortgage rates and the desire for space is accelerating demand for single-family homes. Many homebuilders reported strong orders in sales this past quarter, particularly towards the back half of the quarter. And homeownership rate is on the rise.</p><p>And lastly, we're seeing reduced demand from 2 important segments of renters, corporate and students, as most temporary corporate assignments have been canceled, while higher education is adopting remote learning models and limiting on-campus activities for the fall. These factors will likely weigh on performance until the public health crisis has abated. On the other hand, they will also likely contribute to a more robust recovery once employees begin to return to the workplace.</p><p>With that, I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss operations and portfolio performance in more detail. Sean?</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN, COO, AVALONBAY COMMUNITIES, INC.: All right. Thanks, Tim. Turning to Slide 7. The factors Tim highlighted on the previous slide impacted leasing volume throughout the quarter, which is down roughly 10% year-over-year. Turnover for the quarter fell about 5%. So the volume of resident notices to leave our communities exceeded leasing velocity, most materially in May when we experienced about a 25% increase in lease breaks for a variety of reasons, including corporate apartment operators shutting down operations in certain markets. As a result, move-outs exceeded move-ins for the quarter. As of yesterday, net lease volume for July is roughly on pace with the volume of notices to vacate our communities, which should help stabilize occupancy as we move into August.</p><p>Moving to Slide 8. We experienced a 120 basis point decline in physical occupancy from April to June, with most of it occurring in May as a result of the lease break volume I mentioned a few moments ago.</p><p>Chart 2 on Slide 8 depicts both lease and effective rent change for the quarter. As detailed in our earnings release, blended lease rent change was down 40 basis points in Q2, while effective rent change was down 3.1%. Rent change for July has improved slightly from June, but the nature of the health crisis and economic environment will dictate the ongoing demand for rental housing and our pricing power as we move through the balance of the year.</p><p>Turning to Slide 9. You can see the regional distribution of both lease and effective rent change for Q2. Northern and Southern California were the most challenging regions for a variety of reasons, while the Pacific Northwest performed the best.</p><p>Moving to Slide 10 to look at performance metrics by submarket type. Urban submarkets deteriorated more materially during Q2 as compared to suburban submarkets. From an occupancy standpoint, urban submarkets declined by 270 basis points from April to June, while suburban submarkets fell by only 50 basis points. And from a rent change perspective, urban submarkets trailed suburban by roughly 200 basis points. While the weakness in urban environments is pretty broad-based across our portfolio, it's most pronounced in San Francisco, Boston and parts of L.A. Unfortunately, demand in urban submarkets is suffering from a variety of factors, several of which Tim mentioned in his prepared remarks, including a desire for more affordable price points, extended work-from-home policies across corporate America, a lack of short-term and corporate demand, uncertainty regarding on-campus learning at urban universities and a general concern about population density.</p><p>Shifting to Slide 11 to discuss our development portfolio. Construction delays at the beginning of the pandemic weighed on both deliveries and occupancies during the second quarter.</p><p>As noted in Chart 1 on Slide 12, deliveries and occupancies for the first half of the year fell short of our expectations by roughly 450 and 650 units, respectively, which translated into an NOI shortfall of approximately $2 million. Fortunately, following some initial shutdowns at about 1/3 of our construction sites for a short period of time, all of our jobs are currently under way, albeit with a slower pace of deliveries expected across certain assets.</p><p>I will now turn it over to Kevin to further address development starts, funding and the balance sheet. Kevin?</p><p>KEVIN P. O'SHEA, CFO, AVALONBAY COMMUNITIES, INC.: Thanks, Sean. Turning to Slide 12. In response to the current environment, we have chosen not to start any new construction projects so far this year despite having initially guided in the beginning of the year to about $900 million in new construction starts for 2020.</p><p>Looking ahead, we expect lower construction costs will benefit many of our future planned starts. And we are prepared to wait for this expected correction on hard costs before breaking ground so that we can lock in a lower basis on these investments. Although real-time construction cost data are difficult to come by, initial indications suggest we are beginning to see a softer labor market and a reduction in overall construction activity makes their way into subcontractor pricing.</p><p>As for development that is currently under construction, as you can see on Slide 13, we are in a remarkably strong position from a financial point of view. Development under construction is already 95% match funded with long-term capital, which not only mitigates the financial risk of development, but also means that we have locked in the investment spread profit on these developments by having matched the long-term expected returns on the projects with equity and debt price when we were starting these projects.</p><p>Finally, as shown on Slide 14, we continue to enjoy an exceptionally strong financial position today. This is particularly evident when comparing our key credit metrics today to those from the fourth quarter of 2008 when we entered the last recession. Specifically, since late 2008, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has improved to 4.9x from 6.5x. Our interest coverage ratio has increased to 6.9x from 4.5x. Our unencumbered NOI percentage has increased to 94% from 77%. And our credit rating has improved to A3, A- from Baa1 to BBB+. This strong balance sheet position provides us with great flexibility to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may emerge as this downturn unfolds.</p><p>And with that, I will turn it back to Tim.</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: All right. Thanks, Kevin. Just turning to the last slide and offering a few summary comments. Q2 was a challenging quarter driven by the suddenness of the pandemic and the depth of the downturn. So far, the impact on same-store performance has been driven by lower occupancy and elevated bad debt. Contributions from NOI and new development lease-ups were less than expected due to construction delays and weaker absorption. We have curtailed new developments dramatically and have not started any new communities so far this year. Despite the strength in the for-sale market, we do expect construction costs to fall over the next few quarters. And we'll incorporate that into our capital allocation plans.</p><p>And then lastly, the balance sheet is very well positioned in both an absolute sense and relative to prior downturns, which as Kevin said, just gives us plenty of financial flexibility to address challenges or opportunities as they arise.</p><p>And so with that, Matt, we'll open the call for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Nick Joseph with Citi.</p><p>NICHOLAS GREGORY JOSEPH, DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Appreciate the color and the rationale behind pausing new starts. Just curious how long do you think the delay will be until you actually start to do projects again. And then what signals are you looking at before actually making that decision to proceed?</p><p>MATTHEW H. BIRENBAUM, CIO, AVALONBAY COMMUNITIES, INC.: Hey, Nick. This is Matt. Yes. I mean it is -- we have deals that could start. And we are -- we do have a fairly high degree of conviction that hard costs should start to correct here. So that's -- the main thing we're looking at is kind of where our hard cost is trending, what the subcontractor bid coverage look like.</p><p>There may be one deal that we would start here that's kind of got some exceptional circumstances that's actually in an opportunity zone. And we're looking at starting with some third-party joint venture capital, which is, as you know, is very unusual for us. But for -- kind of for wholly owned balance-sheet-funded starts, that's really what we're watching. It's kind of interplay between potential reduction in hard costs and, frankly, reductions in NOIs on the other side and kind of looking at what the total basis looks like, what costs look like relative to their long-term trend line and what rents and NOIs look like relative to their long-term trend line as well.</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes, Nick. It's hard to know exactly. If you looked at last cycle, [we've lost] about 4 or 5 quarters. Part of my introductory comments around what this economic downturn might look like, it's maybe different from others that we've seen where others may have been sort of -- maybe drifted a bit more into the recession. This was quite sudden. And others were maybe in a quicker bounce back. We think this could be a more drawn-out bounce back and likely to be more and more -- you've heard certainly the Nike Swoosh with more people -- more and more, you're hearing sort of the K-shaped recovery, where it's going to be very uneven depending upon even demographic and the population.</p><p>So just given the public health and economic aspect of this one, it's hard to know for sure. But as we showed on that one slide, we're just starting to see construction costs correcting. Last cycle, they correct on the order of 15%, maybe a little bit more. And it's -- we're probably going to need to see the kind of double-digit corrections before we start to have a little bit more faith that we're buying deals out of the basis that we'll look good sort of next cycle.</p><p>NICHOLAS GREGORY JOSEPH: I think you announced the $500 million share repurchase program. How do you think about actually executing on that? And where does it currently stack up in terms of the use of proceeds maybe relative to development or any other kind of acquisitions or redevelopment, kind of other options that you have for that capital?</p><p>KEVIN P. O'SHEA: Yes. Hey, Nick. This is Kevin. I'll jump in here, and Tim may want to add a couple of comments. And you're right, as we -- as you saw in the earnings release, we did announce a share repurchase program of $500 million. And really, the genesis behind that is we believe our stock is, as you alluded to, trading at a compelling value, both absolutely and relative to our other investments, including development. And because we have the balance sheet strength and liquidity to pursue a program, we intend to do so. Though as we indicated in our earnings release, we're likely to fund that on a long-term basis with asset sales and potentially some incremental debt, but we do intend to proceed. And probably we'll do so initially on a measured basis until we have clarity on those sources. But I think at this point, that's probably our most attractive investment that we have today.</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes -- no. I -- maybe to just add a little bit, Kevin, I agree. I think you had 2 things working. It's the best -- it's the most attractive investment, and you've got the disparity between what equity's costing and what -- certainly what debt's costing as being supported artificially by the Fed right now as we know.</p><p>And our belief is while there's not a lot of visibility on asset pricing, we're -- we feel pretty strongly that asset prices haven't corrected near what equity prices have corrected. We've seen in the order of 30% on the equity, and probably -- we think probably less than 10% on asset sales. So that informs our conviction as well in terms of what the alternatives are in terms of capital sources.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Rich Hightower with Evercore.</p><p>RICHARD ALLEN HIGHTOWER, MD &amp; RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I'm on the second chart on Page 8, just on the blended like-term rent change chart. And just help us understand some of the details there across new and renewals and what you're seeing currently, urban and suburban and maybe some of the weaker markets you mentioned, Boston, San Fran and L.A. Just help us understand some of the -- what goes into the mix there.</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes, Rich. It's Sean. Happy to walk you through it a little bit. I mean as we noted on an effective basis, blended rent change was down about 3% for the quarter. If you look at it on a lease basis, it was down only about 40 basis points. And certainly, based on what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing the greatest weakness in Northern and Southern California. And if you double-click through those regions, probably the softest spots are San Francisco and throughout L.A., particularly in some of the entertainment-oriented economies around L.A., so think about Hollywood, West Hollywood, Burbank, San Fernando Valley, et cetera.</p><p>And then the other markets, we're basically anywhere from sort of 0 to minus 2%. And across the other markets, the softest spots are probably in New York City and throughout the urban submarkets within Boston. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, generally, across the portfolio, what we're seeing in the urban submarkets is rent change is trailing suburban by about a couple of hundred basis points.</p><p>And as you probably noted in the chart, our economic occupancy and physical occupancy are both trailing what we're seeing in the suburban submarkets as well. So certainly, a tougher place to be as it relates to both rent change and occupancy in those environments.</p><p>And as it relates to kind of where things are today, if you look at it in the context of July, effective rent change is down about 3.5%, a little bit better than June. And lease rent change is down about 2%. And in both cases, renewals do remain positive right now, sort of in the 50 to 70 basis point range, slightly lower than what we experienced in Q2 but still positive in July at this point.</p><p>RICHARD ALLEN HIGHTOWER: Okay. Sean, that's helpful. And then just thinking maybe a little more broadly, in some of the bullets highlighted in the prepared comments about the work-from-home shift and the fact that suburban is outperforming urban. And I would also assume, with respect to home purchases, I mean, given the price points in Avalon's markets, maybe you're a little more insulated from that effect than the average apartment landlord out there. So at what point does that sort of mix start to help Avalon in the sense of having a highly concentrated suburban portfolio? When do you think we'll really see that show up in the numbers there as a net positive, you think?</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes, Rich. It's Sean. I can provide a couple of comments, and then Tim can chime in. I mean it's really a function of how some of those factors evolve over the next few months here. I mean urban submarkets, we've mentioned several of the factors that are sort of driving it. So I think what I mentioned in my prepared remarks is sort of the nature of the health crisis, and the economic environment will dictate when people start to come back to the urban submarkets and at least some in a more material way.</p><p>And on the suburban side, it's really a function of sort of portfolio mix. And in some places, it certainly is very helpful. There are some submarkets where, even though it's suburban, it's a little bit painful right now. I'll pick one specifically, like Mountain View in Northern California, where Alphabet is headquartered. Given their extended work-from-home policies, it tends to be a weaker submarket even though it's technically considered suburban. So I'm not sure there's a one-size-fits-all answer here as it relates to that. At least, that's my general thoughts at this point in time. But Tim, do you have anything you want to add?</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes. I just -- maybe just -- I've mentioned suburban had been outperforming urban before -- prior to the pandemic. And we had been seeing a trend, both on the demand</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>next year, urban supply to outpace suburban by a fair amount in our markets, but also on the demand side, which, last cycle, supply and demand was stronger in the urban submarkets. This cycle, it's probably going to be the opposite, where both -- when you get beyond sort of '21, '22, where you're likely to see stronger demand in some of the suburban submarkets and more supply. And that's partly because millennials are coming of age, there's more economic activity starting to occur in the suburbs, and part of it's affordability. So as you see more economic activity, that ought to drive more rental -- renter demand in the suburbs as well. But -- and we already started to see that trend a little bit before the pandemic, but it's just a longer secular trend that we expect that will continue over the next few years.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.</p><p>JOHN JOSEPH PAWLOWSKI, SENIOR ANALYST, GREEN STREET ADVISORS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Sean, I want to go back to your comment about you see signs of stability in at least occupancy heading into August. Does that comment hold for the current pockets of weakness that you alluded to, L.A., Boston, San Fran?</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: In the short run, John, yes. And we are starting to see some student demand come back in some of these urban submarkets based on announcements that have been made to date as it relates to the hybrid learning environments, both on-campus and distance learning, and just anecdotally, getting a lot of feedback from some of the student population that they had enough time at home. And even if they only could be on campus a couple of days a week, they want their apartment back. So whether that holds or not, obviously, it's a function of the health crisis and the decisions that are made across the university systems. But in general, I would say we are seeing it relatively sort of stabilize a little bit.</p><p>That being said, between now and year-end, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the health crisis and the economic environment will dictate whether things kind of shift up or down in terms of demand as we move forward here.</p><p>JOHN JOSEPH PAWLOWSKI: Makes sense. And then the 200 basis point drag from bad debt in the quarter on the residential portfolio with the opening remarks or something to that effect that it remains elevated. Is that a reasonable betting line just the trajectory over these coming months? Or will it get meaningfully worse or meaningfully better? I guess I don't understand -- I don't know how to completely think through markets like in L.A., where this eviction moratorium keeps getting kicked down the road. So just curious, comments around the trajectory of bad debt from here will be helpful.</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes, John. I'm happy to comment, and then Kevin or Tim can chime in as well. I mean at this point in time, it's obviously difficult to predict, given the nature of -- we already have mentioned the health crisis, the macroeconomic environment. Obviously, there have been federal support for people to date in terms of being able to sort of subsidize their incomes, which I think came through this morning in terms of personal income growth. So I think assuming it's a relatively static environment through year-end, you probably expect those sort of collection rates to hold within reason. But to the extent there is significant shift in any one of those variables in a meaningful way, obviously, that could pick it up or down as a result. But I think those are the primary variables we will all be monitoring to try and determine whether we think it's going to tick up and/or down. So...</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR, MD AND HEAD OF UNITED STATES REITS, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just want to go back to some of the big-picture comments, Tim, that you've discussed so far, including some of the comments during the Q&amp;A. And I very much appreciate how difficult it is to figure out the medium to long term. As you're thinking, again your comments about the lower-cost options elsewhere, Southeast, increasing homeownership, I mean can you talk a little bit more how this is impacting, let's say, Avalon's medium- to long-term strategic plans, whether that includes new markets? I guess can you share some thoughts on that?</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes. Sure, Jeff. I think we've spoken to this in the past. As many have said, I mean, I think the pandemic is -- they're -- these trends aren't necessarily new. They're -- a lot of them are being accelerated. And you can certainly think about sort of big tech and employers in places like New York and California. They're already diversifying their workforces in other markets whether it's Amazon in D.C. or having bases in Austin or Denver. And so we want to be leveraged really to the innovation and knowledge economy. And so that means kind of going where those workers are going. And to the extent jobs -- employers continue to chase jobs, rather jobs -- sort of the job is chasing the employee rather than the employee is chasing the job, then we want to be in those markets. That was one of the reasons we got into Denver and Southeast Florida.</p><p>I would say one of the things that -- you look at the -- just a fiscal situation of some of the blue states, obviously, are being exacerbated as well. And so I think that probably informs our thinking also and just the overall affordability driving -- in driving some of the populations as some of these markets, we want to be in those sort of spillover markets.</p><p>We think what's happening is good for the innovation economy. So I don't think it's bad necessarily for San Jose and San Francisco and Boston but recognize that some of the -- some of those benefits are going to spill over to some other sort of secondary innovation markets as well. And those would be good markets for us to be in.</p><p>And so we look to do a few things. One is to kind of reallocate or recycle capital -- some capital in New York certainly, and probably in the future, some out of California to both expansion -- our existing expansion markets as well as markets like D.C., Seattle and Boston and then also potentially some new markets that we're not into today.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: And is that -- and I appreciate the comments. I mean I guess, the -- your thoughts on work-from-home and the permanency of work-from-home, does that impact the decision process at all? Or do you feel like that it's just a temporary adjustment right now, but maybe it will be more going forward but not to the extent that some in the media are portraying or some on The Street are portraying?</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes. Yes, it's hard to know. And I know that the office guys get that question a lot. I can sort of speak from our own experiences. We would expect we would have more work-from-home activity kind of going forward. But there are certain jobs where there -- that are more kind of individual contributors where they can be efficient working away from the office space, but that is not close to the majority of the jobs in this company or most companies.</p><p>And so we view it as kind of more of a marginal effect that gives people a little bit more flexibility about where to live if they want to work from home. And secondly, they're probably not that focused on career growth. They're probably not going to manage a lot of people working from home at least over the next few years in my view.</p><p>So I would say, does it really affect our view in terms of where we want to be? Probably less so than the fact that big employers like the Googles and Apples of the world are already diversifying their workforces in other markets with satellite operations there. So whether it's a satellite operation or people working from home, they're likely to get out to some of the same markets, I would think.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>RICHARD HILL, HEAD OF U.S. REIT EQUITY &amp; COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE DEBT RESEARCH AND HEAD OF U.S. CMBS, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to follow along those lines of bigger-picture questions and go back to some of your prepared remarks. Specifically, about homeownership, we've seen some similar trends with homeownership, particularly under the age of 35 cohort. Do you think those are just near term given the decline that we've seen in interest rates? Or do you think there's a more secular shift that's going on there?</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes, Rich, I can speak to you, and others may have a view. I think part of it may be -- if you just looked at the composition of the millennials, it's a little bit as a -- [that they have gone through the pipe]. So there's a lot more of those that are under 35 in that 30 to 35 cohort than there were 5 years ago. So they're starting to enter into those kind of prime homeownership. Yes, so I think a lot of this is being stimulated by demographics and really being accelerated by what we're seeing in terms of interest rates. We're not seeing it yet with our residents. Reasons for move actually went down to purchase homes. But homeownership is going up nationally, and it has an impact on the overall renter pool that affects all of us as landlords at some level. We may be a little -- we think we're probably less at the sort of the epicenter of it. It's probably mostly coming from single-family rental and other demographics and other markets. But it does have an overall -- it does have an impact on a broader sort of renter pool, if you will.</p><p>RICHARD HILL: Got it. That's helpful. I've been a little bit surprised there hasn't been more focus this earnings season on the election coming up in a couple of months and potentially rent regulation depending upon what parties have power. I'm wondering if that is something that you're focused on. Obviously, the Biden plan has housing as a big focus, and affordability on the other side of COVID-19 is obviously more challenged. How are you thinking about that maybe over the medium to long term?</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Richard, it factors in. I mean most of the regulatory risks we face is really at the local and state level, not as much at the national level. I think we'd would probably be a little bit more concerned if there was another nominee that was a [Democratic] nominee at the national level. But our markets have always been more regulated than other markets. We are in blue states. It's always -- it's part of what's been the appeal of our markets is sort of the barriers to entries created some supply constraints on new housing, which has helped elevate rents and rent growth over time.</p><p>I think the issue that you're starting to touch on is the key one, which is when it starts to leak into the price controls and rent control, that becomes the issue for us and the type of rent control. Certainly, in New York and parts of California, you have vacancy we control. That's usually pretty manageable in terms of as an owner of apartments. Where you have -- when you lose -- when you have controlled pricing on vacant as they become available, that's the kind of rent control as an industry we have to absolutely avoid and it is -- it will be awful for the housing markets if that occurs.</p><p>So that's something we're going to continue to watch, we're going to continue to fight as an industry because it's -- one, it's not good for us as landlords for sure, but it's not good for the housing market long term. And it's not a way to solve any housing crisis at any local level. It's politically expedient, but it's -- from a policy standpoint, it's absolutely poor policy.</p><p>RICHARD HILL: Understood. And then one more question, if I may. In the past, you've done a really good job thinking about how your development and your land development is really under option and you don't have to move forward with it. So I'm wondering, as you survey the landscape post-COVID-19, are there any land that you have under option, in maybe high barrier or blue states that you might want to not move forward with? And you had mentioned Florida, I think, earlier in your remarks. Are there any other markets where you prefer to maybe focus on the development going forward versus some of the markets that you're in right now?</p><p>MATTHEW H. BIRENBAUM: Yes. Hey, Richard. It's Matt. As it relates to our current development rights pipeline, you're right, we only own 2 of those 28 deals are land owned that we bought from a third party. So we do have a lot of optionality. And it's really deal by deal. There may be deals in there that are not going to work without some type of restructuring. There are other deals that probably will work. And there are some deals where we may say the land is a good price, and we may close on the land and carry it for a while and wait for hard costs to come down.</p><p>So it's a little bit of all of the above. It doesn't really factor into the geographic mix. It's really bottom-up in terms of where we're finding the best opportunities. And so we have a couple of development rights in some of our expansion markets, including 2 in Denver and one in Florida, that are working their way through the system. We have development rights in our legacy markets as well. I don't think we've seen any particular trend yet in terms of kind of an impact to the land market or development economics more so in one market than another, other than where you're seeing, obviously, rents taking the biggest hit so far.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY, VP &amp; EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Another development question for you. I was wondering if you could frame up how the development pipeline that is active is positioned relative to the headwinds you cite on Slide 6. And then I'm basically trying to get a sense of the potential volatility around your 5.7% projected development yields.</p><p>MATTHEW H. BIRENBAUM: Hey, I'm sorry. Is that about the development under way or the development rights on the future starts?</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY: No -- yes. Sorry, the active pipeline. I mean I believe you guys pivoted a few years ago to more of a suburban footprint, but I don't know if they technically qualify, in your view, as more of the infill that you cite as a headwind on Page 6.</p><p>MATTHEW H. BIRENBAUM: Yes. I mean when you look at the 2.4 billion in development under way, you can kind of look at it in terms of -- you're right, the current yield is at 5.7%. Those deals are still -- there's only 5 of those 19, where we've actually done enough leasing that we mark the rents to market yet. And on those 5, actually, the rents are slightly ahead of [pro forma] by about $30.</p><p>So now the yields are a little bit behind because there's been some cost overruns on a couple of deals. Generally speaking, so 5 of the 19 are more or less mark-to-market. The other 14, you could handicap them. A lot of them are in markets that have seen less downward rent pressure so far. It is a predominantly suburban portfolio. In fact, looking at it, I think the only deal in that, that we would consider urban other than Hollywood, which is under construction, would be the one deal in downtown Baltimore right now. And yes...</p><p>WESLEY KEITH GOLLADAY: And then what about with the work-from-home trend? Are you noticing any demand for your larger units, people looking for maybe another room for an office or maybe rooms with a view?</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes. Wes, this is Sean. I mean we've been digging into that, and at least based on sort of early returns, I would say it appears as though suburban direct-entry product, which often is a townhome, is doing a little bit better in the current environment. And the data is a little bit mixed. But overall, that appears to be a positive trend for us in terms of that product type across the portfolio.</p><p>MATTHEW H. BIRENBAUM: And I would say, just to add to that, this is Matt, that when you look at our development, as an industry, the average unit size has been trending down really for the last cycle, probably came down 10%. What we've seen, at least in the last year or 2, our development starts, the average unit size has started to move the other direction. A lot of that has been our shift to more suburban assets. But also, even before the pandemic, we were starting to see, just with demographics heading where they were, greater demand for 3-bedroom units, which we didn't use to -- hardly build at all, now almost every project we build has at least about 3 bedrooms in it. And more of the kind of 1-bedroom den and 2-bedroom loft, we're definitely building more of that product than we were 5 years ago.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.</p><p>SUMIT SHARMA, ANALYST, SCOTIABANK GLOBAL BANKING AND MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Sumit Sharma in for Nick. A question about your bad debt expense. And I just want to be clear. Maybe you've stated this earlier, so I apologize in advance. But of the 2.7% of uncollectible rent, I guess how much was part of the bad debt provision or reserve? Some of your peers have talked about reserves of the tune of around 200 basis points or so. And just getting a sense of how much went into reserves, how much is deferred, how much is write-offs and cash bad debts.</p><p>KEVIN P. O'SHEA: Sumit, this is Kevin O'Shea. I'm not -- I'm having difficulty hearing you, but maybe just to give you an overview of what we did with respect to bad debt, and then you can ask questions to the extent that I'm not responding to some of your questions.</p><p>So first of all, our policy is to reserve delinquent base residential rent for 3 months and other delinquent items after 2 months. For residential revenue, we typically take a reserve of about 50 basis points of residential revenue. And we did so in Q2 in our same-store portfolio. In addition, in Q2, we took a further reserve of about 200 basis points or $10.7 million, including for residents who didn't pay anything during the quarter. That resulted in a total reserve for the same-store residential revenue portfolio of about 250 basis points or $13.6 million. So of course, we continue to caution our effort -- our collection efforts, and we're certainly encouraged by recent collection trends, which show collections against unpaid April and May rents improving to about 97.5% from about 93%, 94% at month end. So that's the story in residential revenue. Is that helpful? Is that responsive?</p><p>SUMIT SHARMA: Yes. No, that's great. And apologies for the bad sound quality. Another question, following up a different kind of area. I'm just wondering, in terms of the concession activity, you actually provided a lot of information on urban versus suburban. Trying to understand where -- what kind of unit types are being -- are seeing the biggest concessions, 2 bedrooms, 3 bedrooms. I think a few moments ago, someone was talking about developments and how it's changing with the unit mix. I'm just wondering, from a concession standpoint, where you're seeing the biggest drop in rent or where you have to give the largest amount of concession.</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes, this is Sean. I'll give you some general thoughts on that. So first, as you might imagine, from what we described in our prepared remarks, concessions are generally greater in urban environments as compared to suburban environments. So let's start with that.</p><p>Within urban environments, we tend to see fewer concessions on the more affordable price points, which tend to be the studios and 1-bedrooms in those submarkets as compared to the larger units. Initially, we thought there might be sort of steadier demand for larger units and people looking to work from home with extra space. But I think the affordability issue sort of weighed on that a little bit, and we've seen better performance out of the studios and smaller 1-bedrooms.</p><p>And then the suburban environment, I wouldn't say there is a common theme as it relates to unit type. It's really submarket-driven and the nature of the demographics within that environment. We've got very high-quality towns in suburban Boston with great schools, and 2 and 3 bedrooms are -- have solid demand and ones not quite as much. And if you revert to some submarkets in L.A., the more affordable price points in studios and 1-bedrooms are in better shape as compared to the larger 2- and 3-bedroom units given the shutdown of some of the entertainment studios and such. So it's not a common theme as much as it relates to the suburban unit type as much as the specific suburban geography.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Alex Kalmus with Zelman &amp; Associates.</p><p>ALEX KALMUS, ASSOCIATE, ZELMAN &amp; ASSOCIATES LLC: Looking into bad debt and delinquencies, have you guys run an analysis on your resident base to see what age, income or profession this is mostly centered on?</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes. Alex, this is Sean. We'd have to run some data on that. And I think what I would tell you is it's more industry-specific than it is typical demographic make-up in terms of gender, age, things of that sort. It tends to be self-employed, sort of freelance workers, content producers, folks like that, that have been impacted most materially.</p><p>And then some of our Eaves communities, some of the service-based sectors that have been impacted as well, whether it's foodservice, hotels, things of that sort, some of the occupations that Tim alluded to earlier in his opening remarks. So it really is more occupation-driven than anything else.</p><p>ALEX KALMUS: Got it. And just to touch upon the Park Loggia sales, how was the selling on that this quarter? And I noticed the average unit price was a little higher. So I'm assuming some of the higher units got sold. Was there any discount to February levels that you needed to offer to enhance the sale process?</p><p>MATTHEW H. BIRENBAUM: Yes. Hi, Alex. This is Matt. So the closings that we saw in the second quarter were almost completely deals that have been under contract earlier than that. Not entirely, there were a few deals we did in the second quarter that were quick closes, including, I think, one of the penthouse units which -- so the average price that's settled in any given time period is really more a function of just what units happen to settle based on scheduled settlements and so on. So you can't draw a lot of conclusions, I don't think, from that.</p><p>We have 54 units closed right now. We have another 12 under contract. When you add that together, it adds up to a little bit more than 200 million. We have -- there certainly is negotiation, and there's probably more negotiation at the higher price points. And that was a trend even before the crisis hit. So we have not really taken a different approach to pricing post-COVID. There just hasn't been enough traffic and transaction velocity in the market to really even justify it. I'm not sure that if we were to drop prices, we would see a significant change in the volume.</p><p>And we were offering a very compelling value, we believe, before, and it's still a pretty compelling value. And that was validated by the pretty strong sales pace we had before everything shut down in early March. So there is more supply coming. And I would say that there is a little bit more negotiation at the higher price points, but we expected that. So relative to our expectations, nothing's really changed with our pricing yet.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB, MD &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIPER SANDLER &amp; CO., RESEARCH DIVISION: So 2 questions. The first one is do you guys have an idea of how many residents are living in your apartments who are paying rent but aren't actually there? So they've moved away, but they're still paying rent.</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes. Alex, this is Sean. That's a tough number to come up with. So the blunt answer is no, we don't. Unless they voluntarily come to us and say, \"Hey, I'm going to be gone for x period of time. Can you do something for me?\" There's not necessarily a tracking mechanism for that, that would give you any sense of -- any real sense of accuracy there.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB: Okay. So as your apartment managers are seeing, I guess, maybe mail not being picked up or what have you, there's not a way to sort of track and understand if those people plan on coming back or they're going to exit whenever their term ends?</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Not necessarily. I mean people have mail picked up. I mean you think about buildings that are 500 units and they have 1,000 people in them, it's really hard to get a sense for that unless there is something specific related to a mail hold that we're aware of or a package delivery. But I wouldn't say you could count on that as a representative sample that would give you an accurate estimate.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB: Okay. And then, Kevin, on the development program, you guys were planning on doing meaningful starts this year. You haven't. At what point -- as you deliver but you don't replace the deliveries, at what point do the capital -- the current capitalized costs start to burn off and that starts to -- those expenses start to accrete to the income statement? Like where -- how far would the delays have to go, meaning before we would see the expenses start to appear on the income statement because they could no longer be capitalized?</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Hey, Alex. This is Tim. Maybe I'll jump in, and Kevin may have something to offer. I mean certainly, if we have people working in development or construction that are not actively working on a job, whether it's one that's under construction or one that's going through the planning process, they get expensed. They go to the income statement. They don't get capitalized.</p><p>I think you still need to -- while we haven't started anything year-to-date, we still have over $2 billion under construction and $4 billion under the process. So we're still managing a $6 billion pipeline. Now we are trying to rightsize it. If you look at this quarter, it's about 10% lower than the last 4-quarter average of total capitalized overhead. And it's been trending down as we've seen -- we've had some recent departures and retirements over the last 6 to 12 months of some senior folks as we try to really start to sort of rightsize it for the sort of the next cycle and where we're currently at.</p><p>The other thing to remember, well, you probably don't know this, but roughly about half of that group's comp is incentive-based. So if they're not doing things or if they're not doing as much production, there's a sort of automatic adjusted factors in the overhead piece as well. But our objective is really just to be really -- is to be well positioned and rightsized kind of for the early part of the next cycle to be able to flex up if we need to as the opportunities arise if you -- so capitalized overhead this quarter is about $11 million. About $6.5 million of that is development. About $3.5 million is construction. And about a little over $1 million of it's redevelopment. If you annualize that, you get about $25 million in development, about $12 million maybe construction. That is a level that supports kind of in the -- I think we would talk about $800 million to $900 million range, sort of plus or minus. And that's what we're still geared for.</p><p>So to the extent we decide over the next 3 or 4 years, it doesn't make sense to be doing that kind of volume. Obviously, head counts will need to be adjusted. But we suspect, over the next couple of years, we're going to be in a position to sort of ramp up that group. We want to make sure we've got the leadership and the right personnel in place. And they're still managing as we go into this recession about $6 billion worth of a total pipeline, which is probably only about 25% off of kind of where its peak level, probably in the $7.5 billion to $8 billion range.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Rob Stevenson with Janney.</p><p>ROBERT CHAPMAN STEVENSON, MD, HEAD OF REAL ESTATE RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: What's the positive impact that you typically see in terms of traffic- and leasing-wise in the May, June, July time period from the influx of new college graduates renting for the first time in your core markets in a normal year? And what have you seen thus far this year? It seems like very few college grads in your core markets have actually rented apartments this year versus a normal year given how early COVID hit and so that might be a big driver.</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes, Rob, Sean. Good question. A couple of thoughts on that, not necessarily specific data since it's a little hard to capture. But in our particular case, I mean we don't have a lot of student-oriented assets. They're pretty select across certain markets, particularly in the urban environments, I would say. But your broader question really probably relates to the percentage of the market that is really made up of the student population that sort of brings the occupancy up in the entire market. That's something, to be honest, we've been trying to get our arms around that. Not quite there yet in terms of what that represents in each one of those submarkets. But there are certain submarkets, like we have a property here in the district that's pretty tied to AU that when they announced their plans to have a hybrid learning model, we did 80 leases in 1 week. So there are submarket stuff like that, that are highly dependent upon it.</p><p>But I think the broader question is one we're still trying to answer, which is sort of collectively what the demand is. From the student population is one segment, and then from the short-term and corporate rental market is the other segment. We think the short-term corporate piece is probably in the 2% to 3% range. And we're trying to understand that in terms of the student population, particularly as universities may shift their on-campus housing options to the extent that they're trying to sort of de-densify some of those communities.</p><p>So it's a little bit of a moving target. It's probably hard to answer right at this exact moment. But certainly, the peak time for that demand is, as you described, as we're moving through the pre-leasing season, that you're going to see sort of basically April through June, like you might see on some of the student housing rates. And you want to be pre-leased in those buildings in the 90%-plus range as you get towards the end of July and before they show up in August. So we're on track for that at some of the buildings, but there are places in and around urban Boston, Berkeley, places like that, where they are falling short because of the uncertainty around the ultimate learning model.</p><p>ROBERT CHAPMAN STEVENSON: Well, I mean, beyond the student stuff, I mean, I was really focused on the 21-, 22-year-olds that just graduated, that have a job with, let's say, an investment bank, a tech company, a consulting firm or whatever, that you normally get in New York, San Francisco, Boston, et cetera, renting for the first time, where they're bringing in an offer letter to you and they're leasing off of that. I mean that influx of students -- of former students, but now people entering the workforce for the first time, I mean, how significant is that typically in these big sort of gateway cities?</p><p>SEAN J. BRESLIN: Yes. And that's a -- it's probably a tough one to answer other than the stuff that's related to people that are coming in for a specific kind of program, like a training program or some other kind of corporate program, I guess, 2% to 3% of the market</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>our markets. What you're really talking about is just ongoing demand as people are graduating from universities, moving into the rental market. That's a little tougher to quantify overall at this point in time.</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes. No, Rob, that is part of -- I cited earlier in my remarks about the typical household contraction and consolidation that you see in a downturn. That is part of it, which you're describing to me. Kids that can't get jobs when they get out of college, they stay at home or they go into a house with 6 guys, and there are 6 people instead of getting their own apartment.</p><p>So you'll see -- in past recessions, you've seen occupancies fall by a couple of hundred basis points. You may still be seeing a little bit of new supply. So it's not unusual to see contraction of household demand on the order of a million, 2 million housing units across the country in a normal downturn. And a big portion of that is, I think, exactly what you're focusing on.</p><p>ROBERT CHAPMAN STEVENSON: Okay. And then lastly for me, what are you guys seeing today versus at the beginning of the year in terms of construction costs, both hard and soft? I mean how meaningful has been the delta? And where is the greatest amount of slack today? And is there any of these buckets that are -- that you're seeing more cost pressures either up or down on now given what's happening in single-family or what's happening elsewhere or the falling off of new construction in other sectors?</p><p>MATTHEW H. BIRENBAUM: Yes. Hey, Rob. This is Matt. It's -- we are starting to see it, but it is early. So where we started to see it first is really in some of the smaller-contract CapEx work. So if you think about it, those are the types of jobs that are short in duration. So if you're a subcontractor that's doing a facade restoration project for us or some concrete repair work, that might be a 2- or 3-month or 6-month job. And if they finish one up, they don't necessarily have stuff to replace it. So we are starting to see it there. And in some markets, we've seen mid-single-digit buyout savings on that work, which isn't all that meaningful. But given where we've been coming from, where we've just been seeing construction costs growing much faster than inflation for the last 4 or 5 years, it is a significant change.</p><p>On the new construction, it's probably still too early in almost all markets because everything is under way, and there's a lot under way. It's going to have to get finished first. So again, where you're going to see it first is going to be in early trades, earthwork, pipework, demolition, maybe a little bit concrete. And then regionally, it's going to vary as well. So what we've heard others say is maybe we're starting to see a little bit in South Florida because a big part of what drives that is also -- there's no wood frame construction there for one thing. It's all concrete because of the hurricane codes. And there's a lot of cruise ship restoration work. And hospitality work is not happening. That's been canceled. So the sub base there has more excess capacity. It hasn't really worked its way into most of our markets yet.</p><p>Some commodities are down. Lumber is up. Lumber is up quite a bit right now. So -- and that's probably in response to what's going on in the single-family market and just home renovation market. So there are some cross-currents there, but it generally takes a while. Construction pricing is a lagging indicator. And it's going to take a while for it to work its way through the system in our view.</p><p>OPERATOR: And our final question will come from Rich Anderson with SMBC.</p><p>RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON, RESEARCH ANALYST, SMBC NIKKO SECURITIES AMERICA, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So Tim, you mentioned, or maybe somebody else, but the kind of the suddenness of what happened, made a lot of decisions for you, particularly as it relates to development postponement. If memory serves, in the '08, '09 time frame, you did have a sizable write-off related to your development pipeline. And if I'm wrong about that, I apologize, but I'm going on memory.</p><p>I'm curious, though, as you fast-forward to 12 years later today, is there anything about what happened then that you took from a lesson learned and is sort of allowing you to sort of walk the tight rope here without having any sort of disruption like that? I'm just wondering how that experience during the great financial crisis has manifested itself at how you look today. I know you mentioned the difference in balance sheet in your prepared remarks, but I'm just wondering just in terms of how you approach the business, particularly on the development side.</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes. Hey, Rich, Tim. I would say it's largely been in land. And when you say we had -- like we wrote off or had impairments on the order of about $80 million total, and a good portion of that was in land. And I would just say relative to the size of the development rights pipeline, we've had deals where profits have been larger than that in terms of value we created. So I -- we weren't -- I mean the homebuilders are -- were taking impairments in the billions. We took a -- I think we took an impairment of -- on the order of $60 million. This time were just on our land. And so we've been really very disciplined about maintaining optionality. And some of the -- as Matt was talking earlier, some of the deals may not make. And we may have sellers that are unwilling to restructure to the extent restructuring sort of could close the gap. And we could have some future write-offs, I suspect, but it's really out of the pursuit cost, which is pretty cheap capital relative to the size of the pipeline that we control. So I would say the biggest issue is just -- we just don't have land inventory of any significance this cycle compared to the last one.</p><p>KEVIN P. O'SHEA: And the only thing I would add to that, this is Kevin, Rich, is just, obviously, we've discussed many times in recent years, one key lesson we took from that downturn was to be a whole lot more match funded with respect to the development under way in terms of having the long-term capital in place. And so you see that lesson being applied here in a very visible way with respect to the $2.5 billion we have under way right now, with 95% already match funded. So that obviously leaves us a lot more foot forward this time around to pursue opportunities that may pop up.</p><p>RICHARD CHARLES ANDERSON: Great. And then secondly, a lot of talk in this call about suburbs beating the urban core. You guys are, I think, pardon me if I'm wrong on this one, I think you're 60 -- 2/3 suburban, 1/3 urban, and perhaps, you're still an expensive option in those suburbs. But do you think that, that sort of breakout could ultimately help you out long term here as this sort of situation settles and that people maybe don't go all the way back in, but they come back close enough where it benefits you in your suburban portfolio?</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Yes. Again, Rich, I think I was talking earlier, there already was a trend. We already were sort of starting to tilt the portfolio suburban. And if you look kind of about our history, probably where we created the most value, at least in the development pipeline, is kind of that suburban infill. And I think as millennials get a little bit older, you see more economic activity in suburbs. I think the kind of this kind of urban-light kind of lifestyle, mixed-use kind of infill/suburban areas is probably -- provides -- offers one of the more attractive opportunities that's less dense than an urban environment, also has -- generally is more affordable than what we delivered in our urban areas. So we were already kind of moving in that direction. And maybe this just pushes us a little bit harder. But -- so I think the demand factors that were already in place are just -- are probably just being magnified by what's happened here in the last few months.</p><p>OPERATOR: And with that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Tim Naughton for closing remarks.</p><p>TIMOTHY J. NAUGHTON: Okay. Well, great. Thank you, Matt. I know all of you have a number of calls you need to be on today. So I just want to thank you for being with us, and enjoy the rest of your time. I look forward to talking to you soon.</p><p>OPERATOR: Once again, that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation.

Today's date is July 29, 2020, and this call is being recorded.</p><p>The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding projections of future revenues or earnings, operating margins, operating and capital expenses, bookings, new solution, services and offering development and capital allocation plans, cost optimization and operational improvement initiatives, future business outlook, including the markets or prospects by the company's solution and services, the expected benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures or other collaborations and the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Please see Cerner's earnings release, which was furnished to the SEC today and posted to the Investors section of cerner.com and other filings with the SEC for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.</p><p>A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in this earnings release call can also be found in the company's earnings release. Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, except as required by law.</p><p>At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brent Shafer, President and CEO of Cerner Corporation.</p><p>DAVID BRENT SHAFER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, CERNER CORPORATION: Thanks very much, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining the call.</p><p>Like most of you, we're doing this call from remote locations today, so please bear with us through any technical challenges. Hopefully, we won't have any.</p><p>I'll spend a few minutes providing my thoughts on the business and current environment before handing the call over to CFO, Marc Naughton; our Chief Client and Services Officer, John Peterzalek; and our President, Don Trigg, for more on the numbers and marketplace commentary.</p><p>While COVID has hurt our clients financially by significantly reducing elective procedures and other margin contributors, Cerner's intense focus on supporting them through the pandemic has enabled us to strengthen and extend client relationships and actually help plan for their post COVID recovery. As an example, we recently announced the expansion of our Banner Health relationship to include Cerner's Revenue Cycle Management Solution. With 28 hospitals in 6 states, Banner is one of the country's largest health systems, and we're very proud to grow our relationship with them.</p><p>In addition to clarity, alignment and focus, COVID has also produced a real burst of innovation as Cerner teams delivered critical, quick-turn projects. Our Lights On Network analytics solution released more than 15 new reports and dashboards in 45 days. We stood up a new version of our cloud-based CareAware solution to support the Center for Disease Control on a national scale in just 72 hours, and we developed and deployed new syndromic and surveillance reporting to support clients in a matter of hours.</p><p>The flexibility and commitment we've shown our clients has been inspiring, and Cerner Solutions are helping caregivers respond to the crisis and plan for recovery from its impacts. In many cases, COVID is helping our clients to actually reimagine new post-COVID business models that reflect the increasing importance of comprehensive data and network strategies. You'll hear more from Don about the forces of change impacting health care.</p><p>Cerner's flexibility is largely the result of our ability to execute and deliver our transformation efforts. We've made meaningful progress on cost optimization and business simplification initiatives that will drive efficiencies and ultimately make it easier to do business with Cerner.</p><p>Tomorrow marks an important milestone, the 1-year anniversary of our agreement with Amazon/AWS. The pandemic has underscored the value and relevancy of this relationship, and Cerner recently deployed the innovative AWS cloud-based Cerner Command Center. That's a tool that provides real-time data and predictive analytics that enable health systems to monitor and more effectively manage critical resources, such as bed utilization, ICU occupancy and staffing levels. Launched in January, Cerner Command Center is already helping health systems like Northern Light Health, Cook County Health and Hospital System and Christiana Care Health Services, and I'm pleased with the considerable interest that is coming from other clients in this tool.</p><p>Cerner's COVID task force continues to inform our clinical, business and operational decision-making. The task force regularly interacts with the CDC, the World Health Organization and other global health agencies to help guide their recommendations. And the health and well-being of our associates is a paramount concern as our workforce provides critical support to Cerner's global client base. As I mentioned last quarter, I want to again thank our Cerner associates for adapting so well into this virtual work environment. They've just done an outstanding job and deserve our robust thanks.</p><p>Since we last spoke, we've also welcomed a new Chief Technology Officer, Jerome Labat. Jerome brings more than 30 years of technology experience, including more than 10 years in cloud-based environments. And Jerome will define and implement Cerner's technology vision and strategies to deliver next-generation innovations for clients across all platforms. He will also provide leadership over all development resources and work collaboratively with our sales, marketing and consulting teams. And I can tell you, Jerome is passionate about health care, and he has a proven track record of transformational leadership. And we're really thrilled to have him on the Cerner ship team.</p><p>Finally, I'd like to recognize the work that we are doing to build a more diverse and inclusive culture at Cerner. While diversity and inclusion efforts have been underway for many years, recent events have challenged organizations to reexamine their strategies. And as I mentioned in a recent all-associate town hall, the Cerner leadership team is committed to making even more progress in our diversity and inclusion programs and policies.</p><p>For 2 consecutive years, we've been named a leading Diversity Employer by Forbes, and we will continue a series of actions that will further advance our culture and improve the communities where we live and work. Also this week, Cerner was named a technology partner in an initiative led by nonprofit Testing For America. TFA is driving an effort to safely reopen historically black colleges and universities by developing comprehensive COVID testing and safety plans for students, faculty and administrators. Cerner will play a key role in safely running test results from partner labs to the HBCUs and the other health agencies.</p><p>As for our financial results, I'm pleased that we've delivered a very solid second quarter, especially given the unique, unexpected circumstances. Our quarterly bookings reflects strength in our client relationships and our strong focus on cost control drove a favorable earnings result. We're fortunate to have a resilient business model, engaged associates worldwide, highly relevant health care technology and a solid transformation plan that positions us to manage through the pandemic with less impact than many other companies.</p><p>With that as context, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, CERNER CORPORATION: Thanks, Brent, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover our Q2 results and share our updated views on the remainder of the year.</p><p>This quarter, we delivered strong bookings, but revenue came in slightly below our expectations, primarily driven by some low-margin items being impacted by the pandemic more than we expected. This was offset by expense control, and we delivered earnings at the high end of our guidance range. We've adjusted our revenue guidance to reflect a lower Q2, a more current view of the COVID impact going forward and the anticipated sale of our remaining RevWorks services business. We also tightened our full year earnings outlook while maintaining the same midpoint. Overall, we are pleased with our results and outlook given our prior guidance was provided in the early stages of an unprecedented environment.</p><p>Now I'll go through our Q2 results, starting with bookings, which were $1.34 billion, down 6% from second quarter of 2019 but above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to strong levels of managed services bookings in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $13.66 billion, which is down 9% from a year ago, primarily due to the termination of our RevWorks outsourcing agreement that we discussed last year as well as a lower level of bookings in the first half of this year. Our backlog revenue, combined with other contracted revenue that is excluded from ASC 606 backlog definition still provides visibility to more than 85% of expected revenue over the next 12 months.</p><p>Revenue in the quarter was $1.33 billion, down 7% from Q2 of '19, driven primarily by the Q4 '19 exit of the RevWorks outsourcing contract and the impact of the pandemic. Revenue was $10 million below our guidance range, with the impact of COVID contributing to lower levels of technology resale and reimbursed travel. We also had less third-party services, licensed software and transaction processing revenue during the quarter. As I mentioned, these are primarily lower-margin revenue streams, so the impact on earnings was limited and we were able to offset it with expense control.</p><p>I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q2 of '19. Licensed software revenue in Q2 was $152 million, down 23% from a record high of $197 million in Q2 of '19. While we expect the licensed software would be down this quarter, it did come in a bit lower than expected as strong growth in our SaaS offerings was offset by a decline in traditional licensed software.</p><p>Technology resale of $42 million in Q2 was down 31% year-over-year, primarily driven by a few anticipated new business deals pushing out of the quarter amidst the pandemic. Subscription revenue grew 3% in Q2 to $92 million. This was slightly below our expectations due to lower transaction processing revenue, which is volume-based and was impacted by the significantly lower level of ambulatory visits.</p><p>Professional services revenue was down 5% in Q2 to $461 million, largely in line with our expectations, with the decline driven by the impact the pandemic had on project activity, lower third-party services and the termination of the large RevWorks agreement. Note that while we expect implementation activity to grow in the second half of the year, total services are expected to decline due to the termination of the large RevWorks agreement, the sale of noncore assets in Germany and Spain, which closed at the beginning of Q3, and the sale of the rest of our RevWorks services business, which is expected to close during Q3. All of this activity has been factored into our guidance.</p><p>Managed services was up 3% in Q2 to $307 million, in line with our expectations.</p><p>Support and maintenance of $274 million was down 1% year-over-year and essentially flat to last quarter, which remains in our expectation range and continues to reflect the impact of attrition and reduced hardware maintenance revenue.</p><p>And finally, reimbursed travel of just $2 million was down 93% in Q2 due to travel restrictions that went into place towards the end of Q1. We had anticipated travel would be down in Q2, but the ongoing restrictions related to COVID-19 impacted our ability to travel even more than anticipated.</p><p>Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue was down 8% from the year ago quarter at $1.17 billion, and non-U.S. revenue of $162 million was down 2% from the year-ago quarter.</p><p>Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q2 was 84.1%, up more than 200 basis points from 82% last quarter and up nearly 300 basis points from 81.2% year-over-year. This is a reflection of the overall mix of revenue in the quarter, with the largest revenue declines primarily coming from low-margin technology resale, third-party services and reimbursed travel.</p><p>Now I'll discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related adjustments, organizational restructuring and other expenses, COVID-19-related expenses and other adjustments that are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.</p><p>Looking at our operating spending, our second quarter GAAP operating expenses of $971 million were down 6% compared to $1.03 billion in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating expenses were down 4% compared to Q2 of '19, primarily resulting from our continued cost optimization efforts. We also had some areas where COVID drove lower expenses such as unreimbursed travel, entertainment and associate medical expenses.</p><p>Looking at the line items for Q2, sales and client service expenses decreased 3% year-over-year, driven by lower personnel and non-personnel expense. Software development expense decreased 2% from Q2 of '19, with essentially flat gross R&amp;D and a 9% increase in amortization that was offset by increased capitalized software. G&amp;A expense in Q2 was down 7%, driven by a decline in both personnel and non-personnel expenses.</p><p>Moving to operating margins. Our GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 11% compared to 9.2% in the year ago period. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 18.4%, up from 18% in Q2 of '19, reflecting an improved revenue mix and the impact of our cost optimization efforts. We remain on track with our planned cost optimization efforts and additional measures we implemented to mitigate the impact of the crisis. As a result, we continue to expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be around 20%. This will be approximately 150 basis points of full year margin expansion, which we view as impressive given the circumstances.</p><p>For Q4, we still expect our operating margin to be 50 to 100 basis points below our original 22.5% target, reflecting the reality that even with going beyond our original optimization targets, we won't fully offset the impact of COVID-19 by the end of the year. This would still reflect strong margin expansion of approximately 150 basis points compared to Q4 of '19. We also believe the framework for ongoing margin expansion we shared at our Investor Day remains valid, and we expect to continue improving margins beyond this year as we implement additional optimization efforts and aim to realize a longer-term opportunity to benefit from platform modernization.</p><p>Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $135 million or $0.44 per diluted share, which is up from $0.39 in Q2 of '19. Adjusted net earnings in Q2 were $193 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.63 compared to $0.66 in Q2 of '19.</p><p>Both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 21% for the quarter. For the remainder of 2020, we continue to expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 20% and 22%.</p><p>Moving to our balance sheet. We remain in a solid position. We ended Q2 with $441 million of cash and short-term investments, while our debt remained at $1.34 billion. Given our relatively low leverage, we believe we were remain well positioned to access additional capital is needed to support our growth and capital allocation strategy.</p><p>Moving to receivables. Recall last quarter, we previewed that we anticipated some impact on collections from COVID in the near to intermediate term. We did experience some of that impact in Q2 as total receivables ended the quarter at $1.18 billion, up $33 million from last quarter. Our Q2 DSO was 81 days, which is up from 74 days in Q1 of '20 and 78 days in the year-ago period. Looking forward, we expect some continued impact on collections, but we view it as more of a timing issue than the collectability issue, and do not currently expect it to materially impact our operations.</p><p>Operating cash flow in Q2 was $259 million, and capital expenditures were seasonally higher at $117 million, while capitalized software was $78 million.</p><p>Free cash flow was $64 million for the quarter. For the second half of the year, we expect higher operating cash flow and lower capex to drive stronger free cash flow.</p><p>Moving to capital allocation. As we mentioned last quarter, due to the uncertain nature of the current environment, a significant level of repurchases in Q1, we paused repurchase activity in Q2. We still have $1.03 billion remaining on our current authorization, and we'll continue to evaluate our program, which may also be impacted by the amount of funding use for other purposes such as acquisitions or investments.</p><p>Moving to our dividend program, we paid a dividend in Q2 of $0.18 per share or $55 million. And our sustained strong financial position should enable us to continue our dividend program subject to Board approval.</p><p>Before moving to guidance, and I'd like to comment on the announcement from early June that R1 RCM Inc. will acquire our RevWorks services business. This divestiture is consistent with the portfolio management activities we have discussed. As part of the transaction, Cerner will extend R1's revenue cycle capabilities to our clients and new prospects as part of an integrated offering.</p><p>The RevWorks services business represents approximately $80 million of annual revenue. This is a profitable revenue stream, but we do not expect the transaction to have a material impact on Cerner's earnings. The transaction is expected to close in Q3, and we have factored in approximately $30 million less revenue into our full year guidance to reflect this timing.</p><p>Moving to guidance. While the pandemic continues to progress, it remains difficult to precisely quantify the extent to which it will affect our business operations and financial results for the rest of the year. As we were able to demonstrate in Q2, our business is generally resilient with significant recurring elements. We believe that the largest impact from the pandemic occurred in the second quarter, and the project and sales activity will improve in the second half of the year, assuming the impact of the pandemic begins to subside during this period.</p><p>The following guidance essentially reflects minor tweaks to our prior expectations based on what we have learned during the early stages of the pandemic. While we continue to believe it is helpful to investors to provide our current view of expected results for the future, I would caution that our guidance remains subject to a higher-than-normal amount of risk, given we are operating in unfamiliar territory, especially with the recent surges in COVID cases.</p><p>Now I'll walk through the guidance for the third quarter and full year. For Q3, we expect revenue to be between $1.35 billion and $1.4 billion. As a reminder, Q3 of '19 included a little more than $80 million of revenue from our RevWorks and global divested businesses, of which approximately $70 million is not in Q3 '20 revenue. The $1.375 billion midpoint of this range reflects roughly flat growth from Q3 of '19 after adjusting for divestitures. The Q3 range reflects a slightly larger pandemic impact than we originally anticipated and factors in the pending sale of the remainder of our RevWorks services business that is expected to close in Q3, which we expect to reduce revenue by about $10 million in the third quarter and $20 million in the fourth quarter.</p><p>For the full year, we expect revenue between $5.45 billion and $5.55 billion. Once again, I would note that 2019 included approximately $330 million of revenue from our divested RevWorks and global businesses, of which approximately $220 million is not in 2020 revenue. The $5.5 billion midpoint reflects roughly flat growth from 2019 after adjusting for divestitures. This new range is down from our prior guidance range as we have factored in the sale of the remainder of our RevWorks business, the impact of the lower revenue in the second quarter and an updated outlook for the second half of 2020 to reflect our current view of the impact of the pandemic.</p><p>Recall that our full year guidance already reflected the exit of our large RevWorks outsourcing contract in Q4 of '19 and our global divestiture. As I indicated, adjusting for all of the portfolio management activities now captured in our guidance would result in roughly flat organic growth. We recognize that there are a lot of moving parts, but we do believe the actions we are taking to position us for solid growth when the pandemic impact subsides and the divested revenues out of the comparable periods.</p><p>Moving to EPS. We expect Q3 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.70 to $0.74 per share. The midpoint of this range represents 9% growth over Q3 of '19. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.80 to $2.88, reflecting a narrowing from the prior range of $2.78 to $2.90, while maintaining the midpoint of $2.84 and expected growth of 6% over 2019. The expected EPS growth in Q3 and for the full year reflects our ability to offset the impact of lower revenues from COVID and the lost earnings from divested businesses through our cost optimization initiatives to date.</p><p>Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.35 billion to $1.55 billion. The midpoint of this range represents a nice sequential increase over Q2, reflecting our expectation that activity will ramp as we move through the year. Overall, we view this guidance as solid with the lower expected revenue being offset by additional expense control, leading to our expectations for solid earnings growth in a very challenging environment.</p><p>In conclusion, we are pleased with our solid results given the circumstances and we are focused on continuing to execute throughout the second half of the year.</p><p>With that, I'll turn the call over to John.</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK, EXECUTIVE VP AND CHIEF CLIENT &amp; SERVICES OFFICER, CERNER CORPORATION: Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide results highlights and an update on our federal business. I'll start with bookings.</p><p>We delivered solid bookings, given the circumstances, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. While this did not translate to revenue upside given the mix of bookings, it does feed our backlog and create visibility going forward. This mix is evident in the higher level of long-term bookings at 32% of total compared to 22% a year ago, reflecting strength in managed services.</p><p>While the pandemic did impact the volume of new footprints, we were very competitive where decisions were made, winning several new CommunityWorks footprints. We continue to see activity with larger systems, including a noteworthy win against our primary competitor at Wisconsin-based Marshfield clinics.</p><p>We had solid bookings across our strategic growth businesses, reflecting the relevance of these solutions as hospitals cope with the pandemic and continue with our long-term strategies. Additionally, we continue advancing our revenue cycle footprints with another strong bookings quarter. This was highlighted earlier this month as we announced the continued expansion of our strategic relationship with Banner Health, adding our revenue cycle solutions.</p><p>Another positive related to revenue cycle is the relationship recently announced with R1 as part of the expected divestiture of our RevWorks Services business. This puts our clients in good hands from a revenue cycle services standpoint, while allowing Cerner to focus on the continued advancement of our solutions. Additionally, we're working with R1 to bring an integrated offering combining R1's tools and services capabilities with our solutions, and we believe will further strengthen our revenue cycle value proposition. Moving to federal.</p><p>Like a vast majority of our clients in health care in general, DoD and VA have been on the frontlines of combating COVID-19. While this has required us to adapt to virtual interactions, less-intrusive user engagements and limited on-site activities, we continue to make significant progress on both programs.</p><p>On April 18, the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization Program Office, DoD and VA launched a joint health information exchange, enabling a seamless, secure exchange of health information among each department and their expanded network of community partners. Since the launch, more than 2,000 hospitals, 8,000 pharmacies, 33,000 clinics, 1,000 labs, 800 federally qualified health centers and 300 nursing homes across the country have access to VA and DoD patient information.</p><p>Later this year, DoD and VA expect to connect to the CommonWell Health Alliance, which will add an additional 15,000 providers to the network.</p><p>We continue to work with the VA and DoD to update the go-live schedules for the impact of the pandemic. While revised go-live dates have not been announced for the VA, we continue to move forward with the VA-centralized scheduling solution go-live and our first VA program go-live.</p><p>On the DoD side, as part of the Leidos partnership for Defense Health, we are making significant progress working virtually to advance the program and have activations schedule in the coming months, including a U.S. Coast Guard pilot site.</p><p>Now I'll discuss the broader marketplace and how we are executing in this environment. As discussed last quarter, while the pandemic has created some disruption to business activity in the near term, I'm very pleased that a clear message we're hearing from our clients is they want to continue and, in many cases, accelerate their strategic plans. And Cerner is essential part of those strategic plans. We continue working very closely with our clients as they manage the challenges of response and recovery.</p><p>To date, the impact of the pandemic is playing out close to how we anticipated it would when we talked last quarter. Q2 had very little activity early in the quarter, then activity increased towards the end of the quarter. We're closely monitoring the financial and operational impact of the pandemic, including the recent surge in cases. At this point, we believe our outlook is achievable.</p><p>Overall, both Cerner and our clients have adapted to different ways of doing business. We have modified our sales and service delivery approach, and our clients have been receptive. We have shifted to virtual interactions for most contracting activity, demos, open houses and road mapping sessions.</p><p>On the project side, our professional services organization performed well in mitigating the impact of the pandemic. As mentioned on our last call, we shifted to doing as much work as possible remotely in the early stages of the pandemic. Our clients were supportive, and we quickly adapted to this approach as traditional onsite events inclusive of go-lives were done completely virtual.</p><p>As reopening occurred, we have shifted where possible and feasible to a hybrid model, combining limited on-site presence with virtual capability. This approach is proving to be effective. And given the ongoing traveler restrictions, we plan to continue this approach for the foreseeable future. Over time, I expect our on-site presence will increase from our current levels. However, I believe the hybrid model will continue, resulting in overall less travel than before the pandemic. This will be more efficient and cost-effective for both Cerner and our clients.</p><p>In summary, I am pleased with our execution in the second quarter, and I believe we are well positioned to deliver against our forecast in the second half of the year.</p><p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Don.</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG, PRESIDENT, CERNER CORPORATION: Thanks, John.</p><p>I had the chance to spend the afternoon yesterday with the Chief Executive and the leadership team of one of our leading health system clients. We dove into COVID response, we dialogued on revenue recovery, we talked about what both might tell us about the chance to rethink the future of care delivery in their region and nationwide.</p><p>The current pandemic continues to showcase the very best in frontline caregivers. At the same time, it also eliminates the lack of an integrated system of health and care focused on the person. We still lack a unified health network architecture. These systems and data gaps decrease access to care, increase complexity of care and complicate the delivery of what was described by the team yesterday as the essential need for one patient experience.</p><p>As entrepreneurs, we're excited about the opportunity to solve these challenges. As our late founder, Neal Patterson, framed, health care is a system and name only. And Cerner's technology and data solutions hold the promise to change that.</p><p>Our product and larger platform vision operates at 3 levels: the person, the enterprise and the health network.</p><p>At Cerner, we always begin with the person. Only one thing is common across any health care process, the individual. Our focus is on the whole person, and they're always shifting role as a patient, as a member, caregiver for an extended family, more increasingly as a consumer. Our solutions must supply a person-centric experience that have the potential to change behavior, and over time, health care itself.</p><p>Our consumer business delivered a solid second quarter. Booked revenue was a particular bright spot, nearly doubling in the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This growth signals that our digital front-door strategy is working. Key partnerships with industry leaders, such as our telehealth efforts with Amwell, provider matching with Kyruus, and self-monitoring with GetWell Loop all have solid momentum within our unified consumer framework.</p><p>As we elevate from the person, our next systems-level focus is the enterprise. That's here where our Cerner Millennium EMR and CareAware solutions are deployed in 1/3 of U.S. health care and key global geographies worldwide. And it's also here where we automate critical provider workflows and where we differentiate with our ability to drive decision-making within the last mile workflow of the provider.</p><p>In the second quarter, we made important progress unifying our access management solutions in the revenue cycle business with our consumer solutions. These front-end patient engagement and access capabilities move us closer to the touchless registration experience the current pandemic requires. And as we look beyond COVID, they'll ensure the person, the provider and the payer all have the right information to deliver a better experience at a lower total cost.</p><p>As Brent framed in his comments, our CareAware Solutions suite also continued to see solid demand in the second quarter. Providers are looking to our CareAware communications capabilities and our health systems operation solutions as critical for both COVID surge response and durable revenue recovery, and the business is on pace for over 30% growth for full year 2020.</p><p>As providers look to tackle the operational and financial challenges of COVID, it also is pushing them to think not just at the enterprise level but at the larger health network level as well. Success requires them to manage a patient, member or consumer across multiple organizations regardless of the core EMR. And our EMR-agnostic HealtheIntent platform was architected to enable this essential work across diverse stakeholders and payment models.</p><p>In the second quarter, HealtheIntent saw new footprints at organizations ranging from the University of Southern California to the Marshfield Clinic to Western Health in Australia. It also delivered important displacements at organizations like Aultman Health. This market is beginning to define what a total solution offering must look like and also beginning to recognize Cerner and its increasing capabilities to deliver it.</p><p>The person, the enterprise, the health network. They are the architectural building blocks that will drive Cerner forward in the decade ahead.</p><p>Finally, we believe our data business holds the potential to be the next Cerner. Our Release of Information business is on a path to exceed an aggressive 2020 revenue target, growing over 100% off a small base. The team also has meaningfully advanced our Cerner Learning Health Network, hitting their full year goal of 40 participating provider organizations by June 30. And in a strong demonstration of the real-world potential of this data, academic researchers have launched 42 active projects, leveraging our free COVID de-identified data cohort to tackle challenges ranging from racial and ethnic determinants to advancement of new COVID therapeutics.</p><p>As we look beyond the COVID crisis, we see important secular forces of change playing out. We've always understood that today's future is tomorrow's present. And that the best way to predict the future is to lead it.</p><p>Some contend the solutions to the clients' needs that framed my conversation yesterday will come from big tech. Others argue Silicon Valley start-ups will bring the next wave of change. However, I would argue that none of them have our depth of knowledge of health care and IT. None of them have the same ability to impact the last-mile provider workflow, and none of them have our combination of entrepreneurial scale.</p><p>Cerner's value proposition has never been more relevant or more needed than it is in 2020, and the current crisis is mobilizing a new generation of Cerner leaders to advance it.</p><p>With that, I'll turn the call over for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Sean Dodge with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>THOMAS MICHAEL KELLIHER, ASSOCIATE, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Tom Kelliher on for Sean. Going on, on the VA implementation, can you give a little more color on what types of projects are still active? And how long this can sort of background work continue before the on-site work becomes essential? I'm still assuming that some of this work can be done simultaneously rather than sequential as sort of a catch-up when these travel restrictions are completely lifted.</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: Yes, this is John. I'll address a couple of those issues. So the background work can continue and is continuing, and we're preparing for the first go-live and subsequent go-lives as well. And we're already making plans to be able to go on site. So we're working on everything from testing protocols and other things so that we're able to go-live. The exact dates of those, while not public, have been proposed, and we should be hearing something sometime in the near future more publicly about when those go-lives occur.</p><p>But I'm actually very pleased with how we're making progress in this sort of hybrid environment of virtual and limited on site. And we continue to progress as we would in any other project, given the types of restrictions we have, particularly around travel. But I see that moving forward, and we've already made plans to when we can go on site, how we'll activate and continue on.</p><p>THOMAS MICHAEL KELLIHER: Excellent. And then just another one real quick, and you'll spend a lot on R&amp;D., and kind of in the past, it sounded like there's some opportunities to rationalize or refocus some of the spend. How much of this has been done? And kind of what do you think the right amount is going forward from here?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes, this is Marc. We're an innovation company, so our widget, our strength is to invest in R&amp;D. So most of our work hasn't been necessarily focused on reducing R&amp;D. A lot of it's been focused on how can we maintain current levels of R&amp;D without increasing it, but deliver significantly more innovation from that spend. Certainly, the hiring of Jerome as our CTO is a great step in those -- in that direction.</p><p>We continue to work on the processes and how we develop, and certainly, with the modernization efforts that we're doing relative to our platform. The current spend level that we have, I think, is something we want to maintain. But I think for us, the goal is to figure out how we can get an even bigger bang for the buck and how we can get to market more quickly with our solutions. So we -- over time, if that doesn't grow relative to the rest of the revenue, we'll get some margin expansion opportunities. But I don't see us drastically cutting our innovation and the money we spend on R&amp;D.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore.</p><p>ELIZABETH HAMMELL ANDERSON, ASSOCIATE, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: You talked a bunch about the demand environment as you're seeing it. But as you're looking forward, are you seeing any differentiation between places where COVID has sort of had a recent uptick versus not? Or are there any differences in terms of -- to think about in terms of like size of customer who are sort of able to look more longer term at this point versus not? Or would you say that your demand environment is fairly even all around?</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: This is John. If I understand the question correctly, I think it wouldn't come as a big surprise that where there's COVID surges and where there's not, there's differing -- different priorities in terms of what our clients are working on in the near term and those surge activities that have been occurring in different parts of the country in different parts of the world.</p><p>Now as a general statement, and I mentioned it in my side of the comments is, is that this is not stopping health care in its tracks. The initiatives that were going on, the strategies that are the broad health care environment we're embarking on, they're still incredibly relevant, if not, more relevant in the new world.</p><p>So the strategies that have been placed out in most clients, and regardless of where they are, frankly, in the U.S. or around the world, they want to continue those strategies and, in many cases, advance them more quickly. They are a big part of the recovery. So yes, there will be individual shifts as surges occur in different spots. But broadly, people remain focused and they want to advance their strategies.</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Yes. I'd just say one more thing, which is rather than geography, if we were to think about it relative to business model and mix, obviously, organizations that have provider-sponsored plans and are taking first-dollar risk, clearly, have had differentiated performance relative to their peers. And I think that's one of the reasons why we're excited about the capabilities that we've built off HealtheIntent, the partnership with Lumeris, we think strategies around risk will have a tailwind around them as we kind of get to that after COVID window and people start thinking about business model strategy go-forward.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Don, this is Marc. What about the Cures Act? Are we seeing a benefit from that client base?</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think there's a set of things that are having uniform impact on kind of the financial health of our clients, and they start with the fact that the stimulus dollars have had big and impacts for those organizations. And I think most organizations would anticipate that there'll be additional stimulus dollars coming forward given the essential role that they played the last 90-plus days. And then I think beyond that, obviously, very focused, to John's point, on a durable revenue recovery, elective surgery recovery. And their hotspot dynamics do a role relative to the realities of what that does or doesn't look like.</p><p>ELIZABETH HAMMELL ANDERSON: That's very helpful. And then just in terms of your -- as a follow-up question, just in terms of your some of your recent revenues cycle management wins at Banner and elsewhere, can you talk about what people were particularly interested in, in terms of solutions that you guys can provide, either sort of new additions or the integration with the core network or whatever the case may be? That would be helpful.</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Yes, it's a great question. So one of the things which clearly is top of mind right now for every health care organization is how they think about front-end access management. So strategies around how you engage the consumer, make it easy for them to think through registration and scheduling, help them think about that on a virtual basis increasingly. So I talk about touchless registration. That's the framework that I'm discussing. So the front end is a major area of focus and emphasis. And to John's point, it's one of the things that we're excited about around the R1 relationship. They have some capabilities like tonic for intake that we think will have big, big impact there. So that's a real focal point today.</p><p>And then, obviously, from a Banner perspective, beyond the front end, they're really looking for that opportunity for that integrated front, middle and back and our ability to deploy that. And we, to Marc's point, plan on delivering that from a solutions perspective, and in some cases, complemented by the capabilities of R1 as we think about the blend of technologies and services required to drive the financial metrics of those organizations.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.</p><p>ADAM CHASE NOBLE, EQUITY RESEARCH ASSOCIATE OF HEALTHCARE, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Adam Noble in for Kevin. I just want to talk about some of the kind of virtual go-lives or hybrid go-lives that you talked about. To what extent do you think those will really become the norm in the future? And beyond reimbursed travel, how could more virtual go-lives impact your revenue and margins for those implementations -- for that implementation?</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: Adam, this is John. I'll answer that in a general context as it relates to the go forward. And I mentioned a little bit in our -- in my comments, is that an absolute virtual, purely virtual go-live, they've actually gone pretty well. But the more complex a go-live is, the more difficult it is to do some of that stuff. So I believe that moving forward that we are going to bring this BMS hybrid model, where we don't bring as many people on-site and that we're able to use our virtual capabilities, our remote capabilities, our centralized capabilities to support these go-lives with fewer people on-site.</p><p>And they worked really well. The ones that we've done, both in a virtual, purely virtual that we did early in the quarter, they went very well. The ones that we've done in a hybrid model, they've been working very well as well.</p><p>In the context of the cost is -- travel is always a big part of the cost, both for our clients as we scope these projects out. And being able to limit that will not only be more cost-effective for our clients, but frankly, it should allow them to purchase more capability as well.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. This is Marc. When you think about it, when we travel an associate, they're traveling a half day out and half day back. So they can, in essence, build 4 day's worth of time. If they're doing work virtually, we can get a full 5 day's worth. So that's a 25% increase in their productivity. So if we continue to leverage the virtual nature, once again, to John's point, there are things we have to go on-site for. But if we're doing 85% to 90% of the work remotely as opposed to the 60% we were doing, that's all at a much higher efficiency, and therefore, overall lower cost and higher margin. So those are the things that, at least in that business for me, are somewhat the exciting opportunities from a virtual world.</p><p>ADAM CHASE NOBLE: Great. And as a follow-up question, could you remind me what the revenue contribution of any that you guys get from your Amwell telehealth partnership? And given the major surge of telehealth demand, have you considered restructuring that relationship or finding more direct ways to participate in the telehealth market, similar to some of your EMR competitors?</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: This is Don. So I think, one, we think about virtual health more broadly than just our partnership with Amwell. So we're really thinking about, to John's construct, what is the mix of virtual and physical activity that's going to make up strategies around the person, the enterprise and the health network. So we have big strategies and investments in that space, and we think it will be a meaningful contributor to top line.</p><p>In terms of the Amwell partnership, as I indicated, at the network level, we feel very good about that partnership and the capabilities that we've been able to take to the market around it. But I think we have a broader view of what the opportunity looks like around virtual. And we think some of those opportunities will be in higher-acuity settings like e-hospital and the e-ICU where our CareAware platform becomes particularly differentiating.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.</p><p>ANNE ELIZABETH SAMUEL, ANALYST, JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Annie on for Lisa. Just one on the VA. Given some of the delays at the VA, do you see that impacting the timing of your target for a return to 5% to 8% growth?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes, this is Marc. Clearly, 2020, as we've talked about, is a reset year for the top line, right? We've just basically over the last kind of 6 quarters divested $330 million worth of revenue. So we're really re-basing the organization, focusing on the things that we think have high-growth potential and can drive operating margins. So I think from an overall revenue, to point to any particular business, we continue to be on track, relatively. I mean, we saw that as a fairly important part of our growth, and that is delivering as very close to what our expectations were, the ones that we shared with investors. So I think that continues to contribute.</p><p>But when you look at getting to the kind of the organic growth rates we've talked about, you've got to kind of -- we got to get through 2020. We've got to kind of rebase and reset our revenue. But all the things that Don is talking about, the focus that COVID is creating on the capabilities we have in our client base, some of the strategic growth initiatives that really complement that, I think we are well set up to continue growing once we get kind of the comparables wash through from these divestitures, which have all been done -- been a focus for us through the first half of the year, really getting those things taken care of.</p><p>Ideally, we're going to be able to spend the second half of the year looking for opportunities. We still like the opportunities of looking for potential acquisitions that we think can really leverage and drive forward some of our initiatives, particularly in this strategic growth area. And that will obviously contribute to some of the inorganic elements of growth.</p><p>But I think, overall, we're kind of asking investors, hey, let us get through 2020 and let's get the -- get you a good exit revenue number and then we'll lay out the growth strategies from there. But we should be consistent with what we've talked about because we don't see anything in the business or in the environment that changes our top line growth strategies, or expectations or the operating margin growth opportunities we've seen.</p><p>ANNE ELIZABETH SAMUEL: That's really helpful. And then maybe to your point on the strategic growth, are you finding that the disruption in the marketplace is opening up any potential opportunities for M&amp;A or new partnerships?</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: It's a great question. So I talked about some of the areas inside the strategic growth side of the business that have real traction and trend. I think in particular, we've been very excited about the communication and hospital operation capabilities off of CareAware, very excited about the dialogue that's playing out around our consumer capabilities and consumer framework and see some interesting other pockets of growth and areas ranging from behavioral health to what we're doing in the workforce health place, all of which have been catalyzed by dynamics around COVID. So that's the first thing I would say.</p><p>The second thing I would say is build by partner strategies are a dimension of how all of those organizations think about going to market. And interestingly, we think that Cerner as a destination location for partnership has really been accelerated over the last 90 days. These earlier-stage companies don't have the same access to provider clients who are focused on COVID, and they're looking for partnership opportunities with Cerner as a means by which to create access to provider client base.</p><p>And then obviously, as Marc suggested, we're going to opportunistically think about acquisition opportunities contextual for those strategies. And if they can be catalytic and help us move further faster, those are things that we're going to look at in terms of deployment of capital, not only in the second half of the year, but going into 2021.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>RIVKA REGINA GOLDWASSER, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: So clearly, a lot of uncertainty around COVID. But maybe you can help us with just giving a little bit more color on what are the underlying assumptions for trajectory of COVID that are embedded in the low end of the revenue guidance range?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes, this is Marc. I think that as we look out across our client base and we look at our -- do our fairly rigorous forecasting activities that we do on a quarterly basis, that gives us a view of what we think the business is going to do. It includes backlog, it includes projects that we think we're going to be able to go work on, it includes all of those elements relative to the timing. So</p><p>I don't know that there's anything -- certainly, we would -- don't have built into our expectations that there's going to be a second wave of COVID that's going to shut everybody down. And that basically, they're going to go back into the mode of responding and not being able -- not be in a recovery mode that most of our clients are in now. With the Cures Act and with the reinvigoration of some of the elective procedures, they're a little bit back on track to some extent at this point.</p><p>So I don't know that there's any specific COVID -- we're not doing percentage points. We're not doing those types of activities. It is -- if there's something that's material that impacts our clients' ability to focus on the projects and the things that we're bringing to bear, yes, that could impact us. And that's one of the things we're talking about when we tell you that this is an environment that's got a lot of change.</p><p>The thing we do have is 85% of our revenue plus comes out of our backlog or highly recurring revenue. So for us, we've decided we're going to give guidance because we think we have a decent view of the business. Once again, COVID puts a bigger risk range to that, and -- but we think it's important that we can give people a view of what that looks like from a guidance perspective.</p><p>So I don't know that there's anything specific. And really, when you look at our revenue, there's very little this specific to certain health care volumes. So the real impact of the increase in COVID is the focus of our clients and being able to move forward on things that are in our forecast and that we are expecting to land.</p><p>So that's -- I don't know that can be any more precise because we're not tracking and say, if this case is go to this number, then our revenue is going to go to this number. It's just not the tight coupling that you might be expecting.</p><p>RIVKA REGINA GOLDWASSER: No, but it's helpful because I think the point is that it's about the second wave.</p><p>And then just in terms of clarification. You talked about 32% of contracts coming from long term. Is this just kind of like the nature of the current hospital spending environment where they're less focused on near-term projects, it's just that it's increased versus the strategic focus, right, on moving away from these long-term contracts? So is 32% just -- is a reflection of current environment? Or is this more of kind of like steady state that we should expect going forward as well?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. Just from a percentage, really, the 32% in is a little bit higher than the year ago quarter. But 30% is pretty consistent if you look across everything, but the year ago quarter. You would see it in the upper 20s or around 30%. So I don't think it happens. And John, if you want to comment on just these longer-term bookings, they include an expansion of most of the relationships.</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: My comment would be that the longer term and expansion are very complementary. That almost without exception, that when you do an expansion, it's inclusive of new solutions, it's inclusive of new capabilities as well as the extension of the current capabilities. So it's not one or the other, they're very complementary.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Steve Halper with Cantor Fitzgerald.</p><p>STEVEN PAUL HALPER, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD &amp; CO., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a quick housekeeping question on the cash flow statement. That was an acquisition for $35 million. Could you just tell us what that was?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. No. We had -- it was a cybersecurity company that we acquired. We see that as an opportunity. We already offer those services to our professional services organization. But we think in the current environment, security has always been a big focus, and us, being able to bring on resources that have context in that, particularly context outside of our client base where we can extend that service capability beyond our existing clients with something that was attractive to us.</p><p>So pretty small, therefore, not -- other than be on the cash flow statement. It's not really something that we'd talked about a lot. But it's enhancing our capabilities in the cybersecurity space.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America Securities.</p><p>MICHAEL AARON CHERNY, DIRECTOR, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Thanks so much for the details so far. Maybe to pull at that string a little bit more from a future basis. I don't know if it was John or Don, you mentioned some of the dynamics regarding capital deployment going forward. Is there anything about COVID and the response that your customers are doing to COVID that potentially opens up various different avenues in terms of the type of acquisitions you might want to pursue in order to build out your service capabilities while also driving that incremental growth that's part of the long-term plan?</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: That's a great question. I guess I would say -- kind of tethering to my earlier comments, I'd sort of start by saying all of the areas that we've made, capital allocation and bets in the strategic growth space are things that we like. And we felt like we're supported by macro trends that were playing out prior to COVID. So most of them, I would say, have seen acceleration as part of kind of pulling forward those secular trends that were already playing out.</p><p>So we loved the BH space before. We think it's going to be an area of growing crisis and focus going forward. The employer space was probably one that we were tooking -- took a real hard look at in terms of how to think about and focus that business. Again, that's an area where that relationship between employer and employee has never been more relevant and where that dialogue has never been more real time. So interesting dynamics there.</p><p>And then certainly, back over on the provider side of the business, interesting traction and trend around the acute assets from a CareAware perspective. The healthy intent space, we think, is interesting. This probably isn't the time when I'm going to stand up a provider-sponsored plan. I'm trying to work through a pandemic and crisis setting. But we think that's one on a 3-year basis that looks pretty interesting to providers as they really step back and say, what's it look like to take more control over my top line revenue and my go-forward business strategy.</p><p>So I think each of them have individual dimensions around them, but I think in the main, because they were tethered to larger macro trends that were playing out, we feel like most of what's playing out there has been accelerated.</p><p>And then finally, just to kind of reiterate what I said earlier, absolutely, if there's an opportunity for us to accelerate those strategies through acquisition in an area like cyber, then we're going to look to do that. And we've got a set of business leaders in space that are absolutely capable of integrating those acquisitions and using them to scale their larger growth strategies.</p><p>MICHAEL AARON CHERNY: And just as a quick follow-up to that. Marc, you mentioned the capital availability you have. Obviously, the balance sheet has long been one that's been very clean. Is there any thought or any openness to more exploring utilization of the balance sheet in the event that something more sizable, whether it's an internal investment or potential acquisition, would come along?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Sure. No, I mean we've -- part of our strategy was to have dry powder available, right? So we do have a strong balance sheet. We've traditionally done kind of smaller tuck-in acquisitions. Lumeris is a larger investment that we made, similar to what Don was talking about, is an area that we see as growth, provider-sponsored plans. But I think from -- we are well situated, given our balance sheet, to be able to start looking at some things that might be more sizable. As most of you know, doing any M&amp;A that size transaction moderately increases the difficulty. So doing things that can have a big impact on our growth and certainly help leverage some of our existing thoughts.</p><p>So I think the things that Don was talking about, I think he -- certainly, one of the additional things he would probably certainly put on that list would be the data space. Because once again, we're looking for things that we can acquire -- the issue -- for Millennium, we don't want -- we're going to innovate on Millennium. We're going to create our own modernization. But where we can invest is primarily in the things in Don's area, in the strategic growth.</p><p>And Don, I don't know if you want to talk -- hit the data topic just a little bit to give some ideas as kind of...</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: Yes. No, it's another good example, I think, of where it has been interesting in terms of reinforcing a thesis. So if you look at the release of information side of that business, from an organic perspective, how to do virtual and touchless release of information for legal and life insurance, workmen's comp, it's got a lot of traction and trend around it.</p><p>I think more interestingly, from -- to Marc's point, from a learning health network perspective, the team setting up a structure around that with other 40 participating organizations in the first half of the year, I mean, very impressive against that full year goal achieved at the midyear. And what that tells me is that these organizations are thinking about data and analytics, contextual for what's buying out with COVID. Many of them see interesting opportunities to advance research strategies around it to participate in research economics. And those are things that aren't going to be unique or point in time to COVID. They're things that are going to absolutely accelerate on a multi-quarter basis. And if we could do an acquisition in that space and use it as a way to catalyze the move forward, we would.</p><p>OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Jeff Garro with William Blair &amp; Company.</p><p>JEFFREY ROBERT GARRO, RESEARCH ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: A couple of quick ones for me. Managed services were mentioned a couple of times as a positive bookings area in the quarter. So I'm curious what's driving demand for what I would expect is mostly hosting, and how we should view that as a positive long-term indicator for platform modernization.</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: So in terms of managed services, it is -- there is hosting involved in that, but there's other things involved it as well as we surround most of our solutions with some type of managed services. So in many ways, I view expansion and extension of managed services directly related to expansion and extension of solutions. So for me, it's an incredibly positive thing. We need to run, care for and support all solutions we put out there.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: And this is Marc. To the extent that the element is hosting, it's definitely a positive indication of when we're moving to the cloud, right? Because, in essence, our hosted solutions are private cloud for those clients who are using it. So they're used to having someone else handle all of that and do the work and be able to depend on that infrastructure at a very high level of reliability. And we have that reputation in the industry, well earned. So that's -- so it is definitely a positive as we go forward to more of a cloud-based opportunity in the future.</p><p>JEFFREY ROBERT GARRO: Great. That makes sense. And the second one for me, probably for John. Just curious if there's any change in client receptivity to SaaS offerings versus licensed software that would require larger capital expenditures given the current environment for providers.</p><p>JOHN T. PETERZALEK: Yes. I won't speak to the capital side, but I will speak to the receptiveness side. I think that there is a lot of interest in SaaS offerings. It's sort of a pay-as-you-go type of model. And what clients are really interested in is just being a very specific and intentional for what they use and how they use it. So yes, I think the SaaS business model or the SaaS offering, which we do offer many of our solutions in that model, is attractive and allows people to consume what they use.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. I'd just remind people that half of our license revenue today is Saas so...</p><p>OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.</p><p>ERIC R. PERCHER, RESEARCH ANALYST, NEPHRON RESEARCH LLC: Marc, did you give a number for COVID impact similar to the $30 million? I believe you had projected something around $95 million last quarter.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: I do not recall if I did.</p><p>ALLAN KELLS, VP, IR, CERNER CORPORATION: Eric, this is Allan. There's really -- it's difficult to give a precise number, but I think our point is, is that we essentially flowed through for the rest of the year a similar impact and looked at our forecast a little bit differently for things like reimbursed travel that was less than half of what we had projected and adjusted for that. So for the most part, I'd say, other than taking out the sale of the rest of our RevWorks business, the rest of the change is largely COVID, inclusive of the amount we missed Q2 by relative to our guidance.</p><p>ERIC R. PERCHER: Got you. That's helpful. We can back into that. And then, Marc, the areas of weakness you've seen, it doesn't feel like anything that would necessarily tell us any changes in the way backlog or bookings convert into revenue. But as you've thought it through the risks to plan, how do you think about what might be meaningful in terms of changing the book-to-bill?</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Yes. I think that certainly, as we move forward and kind of resettle 2020, keep in mind that any historical bookings have -- many of them have a chunk of RevWorks sales in them, right? So those are things we're not doing now. So you're going to have a little bit of a challenge with comparability of bookings in terms of the booking ratio. But clearly, once we -- kind of we work our way through 2020, we're going to have to be growing bookings at or above the rate of which we're growing revenues. I mean that's just -- that's a given.</p><p>And I think you're taking away the appropriate point is the adjustments we're making here to are the things that are a little bit more tactical, a little bit more quarter-up type of bookings rather than some of the 12-month sales cycle type of things that we have.</p><p>And based on our pipeline, based on what we're seeing, the opportunities are still there. Clients are as excited or more excited about what's the what they can get from us and what that does to help them deliver care than we've seen. I mean, it continues to be an active environment. Clearly, our caution is that COVID is going to impact things, and we're trying to give you our best view. But our view is based on backlog, based on the hard mechanics of doing a pretty rigorous forecast.</p><p>Once again, can't foresee everything. Clearly, in Q2, we didn't see that tech resale will go significantly lower. And certainly, we didn't see that reimbursed travel was going to fall off a cliff completely as it did. So still, things that are being impacted. Even the federal business is going to be impacted at some point by the COVID. But based on our current view of what we expect to deliver, we're on track for that. So our plan is based on our best view, and our guidance is based on our plan. So that's the best we can kind of provide at this time.</p><p>ERIC R. PERCHER: That's helpful, particularly the federal commentary. Thank you.</p><p>MARC G. NAUGHTON: Why don't we take one more question?</p><p>OPERATOR: And that question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.</p><p>GEORGE ROBERT HILL, MD &amp; EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Thanks for sneaking me in under the wire. I'll let Marc and Don kind of tag team this one. I guess one of the macro themes of the COVID environment has been telemedicine. I guess, from a telemedicine perspective, can you talk about the demand that you're seeing from your clients? I guess, is this something that you guys feel like you have to own?</p><p>And maybe talk about the build versus buy approach to it? I know you guys have the relationship with Amwell and just I guess, kind of talk about how -- I remember when we used to fly out to Kansas City, when we could still all fly, we would do the pop health visits and talk about centralized patient monitoring and centers initiatives there. Just trying to think about, I guess, how you guys are bridging, what was the prior view of that business to what is the future view of that business as it relates to telemedicine post COVID? I know that was complicated.</p><p>DONALD D. TRIGG: No, that's a good question, George. Maybe I'll start, and if Marc wants to amplify on it, he can. But first and foremost, I think this concept of a virtual health system or system of health is one that's been sort of central to the thinking of the company for a long time. You're right, we've had strategies, both in low-acuity settings that we've experimented with over the years, we've had strategies tethered to intensivist dynamics around virtual Inet and other strategies in the space. So I think we have a pretty informed view, in my opinion, about what it takes to deliver on the provider supply side and what the expectations around clients are going to look like.</p><p>Having said that, you've got accommodative, administrative environment relative to tele, a major shift in reimbursement, shifts in licensure. Those things are all playing out. And I think organizations are experimenting with a lot of different strategies. So it would be very typical for John and I to have conversations with a client and for them to have multiple telehealth strategies that they're pursuing in the current environment.</p><p>At the end of the day, what we think that ends up netting out to, George, is, a, better sophistication around these organizations around what the combination of virtual and physical needs to look like. Most importantly, contextual for the regulatory and the reimbursement model. We think that certain areas of this space, particularly higher-acuity areas in the enterprise setting and at the network level, sensitive areas like BH, end up being areas where we can particularly create niche capability with the margin profile that we're looking for.</p><p>And then I think importantly, just to tether to something that John said earlier, we're going to think about it from a total solution perspective. So the accommodative environment that we have around things like cyber and security right now, that pendulum will swing back. And so it will create interesting opportunities for us to think about, areas like cybersecurity, where we've made big investments contextual for strategies like tele as we see increased sensitivity to what the go-forward strategies need to look like in a different regulatory and administrative environment.</p><p>So we think we have multiple strategies afoot. We think those strategies are going to have interesting top line and bottom line dynamics to it. And it's not as binary as build or buy, I think we're going to do a mix of things to create something that's going to have tangible impact on the top line.</p><p>DAVID BRENT SHAFER: Well, I want to thank everyone for their time this afternoon.

We'll now begin the 2020 first half business results presentation. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to everyone for participating in our call. We have here with us our Group CFO and Deputy President, Kim Ki-Hwan as well as other members from our group management. We will first hear the 2020 first half major financial highlights from CFO and Deputy President, Kim Ki-Hwan, and then engage in a Q&amp;A session.</p><p>I would like to invite our Deputy President to walk us through the 2020 first half major financial highlights.</p><p>KI-HWAN KIM, SENIOR EVP &amp; CFO, KB FINANCIAL GROUP INC.: Good afternoon. I am Ki-Hwan Kim, CFO of KB Financial Group. Thank you for joining KBFG's presentation on first half 2020 business results. Before moving on to earnings results, allow me to first present on the operational backdrop. Despite prolonged uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 curve repeating the flattening and rising cycle helped by strong monetary fiscal policies worldwide in an effort to overcome economic recession, financial markets regained some level of stability. Nevertheless, concerns over global crisis of real economy continues. If and when COVID-19's second wave hits us despite massive quantitative easing, economic recovery could may well be delayed significantly. Thus, we are in no position to loosen our vigilance and in the face of ultra-low rate, banking industry is tasked with countering structural pressures as well.</p><p>In such an unprecedented crisis brought on by the pandemic, KBFG will fully live up to its role and responsibility, befitting a top-tier company and will proactively respond to changes in the financial paradigm so as to solidify our position as a leading financial group. First of all, in order to support companies hit by the pandemic and the vulnerable class, we have provided financial support, and KB independently is running various programs, including good consumption movement to help small local business operators.</p><p>Also, we are fully committed to asset quality and risk management. We operate continuous monitoring system on potentially problematic loans and conduct fine-tuned expert management of marginal borrowers and have uplifted the group's risk management system to be prepared for possible extended economic recession. Also to be preemptively ready for possibly -- possible quality deterioration, we made additional provision of KRW 206 billion this quarter.</p><p>In addition, KBFG is steadfast at its strategic tasks that seek to enhance earnings stability and gain growth engine for the future. To that end, last April, we acquired PRASAC, Cambodia's biggest microfinance company as a sub subsidiary. And in Q3, we'll complete the acquisition process for Prudential Life Korea, a best-in-class company in terms of capital adequacy and channel competitiveness.</p><p>Last month, we also entered a strategic alliance with global investor, Carlyle Group, issuing KRW 240 billion of EBs, exchangeable bonds. The EBs were issued at 0 coupon. As the company's high exchange premium on treasury shares were highlighted, KB's undervalued corporate value and growth potential were recognized. It is also considered a best case in the strategic use of treasury shares and diversification of funding sources.</p><p>Last but not least, KB Financial Group is focused on ESG based responsible management and growth in innovation. Including renewable energies and green industry for environmentally friendly investment, we plan to expand ESG-related product investment loans to KRW 5 trillion by 2030. As seen from recent launches of KB Clean Ocean Deposit and KB Clean Ocean Public Trust, we incorporated ESG elements to new product and service development. As such, we will endeavor to lead ESG innovation growth at the very forefront as a leading financial group.</p><p>With that, I will now move on to business results for the first half of 2020. KBFG's Q2 2020 net profit was KRW 981.8 billion. On recovery of other operating income from a more stable capital market in the second quarter, an improvement from net fee and commission income and underwriting profits, net profit was up 34.6% Q-on-Q. First half net profit was KRW 1.7113 trillion, down 6.8% year-on-year. But setting aside additional provisioning aligned with our future economic forecast and Q1's ERP expenses and other one-off items, on a recurring basis, our earnings capabilities continued to be solid despite difficult operational environment triggered by COVID pandemic which led to economic recessions and interest rate declines.</p><p>Now moving on to more details. Group's first half 2020 net interest income was KRW 4.6832 trillion. Despite lowering of the policy rate and low -- loan conversion program, which squeezed the NIM, supported by solid loan growth for the bank and the card, NII was up 2.9% year-on-year. Group's first half net fee and commission income was KRW 1.3813 trillion, up 21.6% or KRW 245.6 billion year-on-year, continuing a solid growth trend. This is because although bank's trust income fell due to restrictions and limits on ETF sales and increases in trading volumes, brokerage related fee income saw KRW 126 billion of sizable increases and also active card marketing and cost savings efforts led to sustained rise in the credit card fee income.</p><p>Next, in Q2, other operating income recorded KRW 227.7 billion, improving significantly over the previous quarter. We saw recovery from first quarter's securities, derivatives, FX-related losses, including foreign currency bonds, CVA and ELS valuation losses incurred from steep volatilities in the financial markets. Insurance underwriting performance also improved on overall decline of loss ratio. As there still exist further volatilities in the financial market from resurge of COVID-19 and deteriorating real economy, we will continue on with a defensive posture for the time being and manage our earnings in a stable manner.</p><p>Next is on the group's G&amp;A expenses. Q2 group G&amp;A was KRW 1.5864 trillion. On seasonal factors, i.e., setting aside for banks and cards welfare fund and payment of taxes and dues and inclusion of PRASAC, the sub subsidiary in the financials, G&amp;A was up 8.7% Q-on-Q. But excluding these factors, there was only a minor Q-on-Q rise. For the first half, G&amp;A reported KRW 3.0456 trillion, flat year-on-year and well under control, thanks to our group-wide cost savings efforts.</p><p>Next is the provision for credit losses. Q2 provision for credit losses posted KRW 296 billion, a 21.5% increase Q-o-Q. This was a result of additional provisioning based on FLC or future economic outlook scenario, despite some large-scale reversals. Excluding these one-offs, it decreased by around 26% Q-o-Q. In this quarter, KB applied forward-looking criteria from a conservative perspective and reclassified some high-risk loans in stage 1 to stage 2. KBFG provisioned an additional approximately KRW 206 billion in order to improve capability to respond to future uncertainties.</p><p>For your reference, as of end June, the group's NPL coverage ratio, including the current reserve for credit losses, posted 296.5%, a 3.0% point improvement Q-o-Q and is maintaining a high level. I will explain the major financials from the next page.</p><p>2020 first half cumulative group ROE posted 8.88% and the recurring ROE, excluding additional provisioning, is being maintained quite stably. These results are the fruit of our continued efforts to strengthen our nonbanking side. And going forward, KBFG will respond to the low growth, low interest rate regime and continuously diversify our revenue basis.</p><p>Next, I will cover the bank's loans and won growth. As of end June 2020, the bank's loans in won posted KRW 287 trillion, a 6.8% increase YTD and 2.4% increase Q-o-Q. In the case of household loans, driven by our focus on expanding Jeonse loans and quality unsecured loans, it grew 4.2% YTD. And compared to the end of the previous quarter, most of the safe conversion loans were securitized, and there was a slight downturn in growth.</p><p>In corporate loans, SOHO, SME and large corporate loans showed balanced growth, recording a 10% growth YTD and 4.2% growth Q-o-Q. In particular, SME loans, including SOHO loans, grew KRW 8 trillion YTD on the back of expansion of COVID-19 related financial support program. KBFG in the second half of this year will continue to have qualitative growth centering on safe quality assets and also strengthen low review standards as a measure to preemptively manage risk and to reduce potential NPLs. KBFG plans to focus more on profitability and asset quality management going forward.</p><p>Next is NIM. Q2 bank NIM posted 1.50%, a 6 bp drop Q-o-Q. This was mainly a result of a slight contraction in asset yield with key rate cuts taking effect in earnest and with a partial increase of ex FX liquidity management burden, although funding burden was relieved through growth of low-cost deposits and decrease of time deposits.</p><p>On the other hand, the Q2 group NIM posted 1.74% with decreasing mid interest rate products, including card loans and cash advances. The card NIM also dropped, leading to a 10 bp drop Q-o-Q. Taking into consideration the recent key rate reduction and expansion of policy loans, it will be quite challenging to safeguard our NIM this year, but based on the best channel competitiveness in Korea, we will focus more on expanding low-cost core deposits and apply a selective and sophisticated loan pricing program to guard the NIM as much as possible.</p><p>Let's go to the next page. First, I'll elaborate on the group's cost-income ratio. 2020 first half cumulative group CIR posted 50.6%. Excluding one-offs, including digitalization expenses, including next-generation IT investment costs, CIR on a recurring level posted a 48.5% level and showed a significant improvement compared to the recurring CIR level of the previous year. With noninterest income source expansion and group-wide cost-cutting efforts, cost efficiency is gradually tangibly improving, and we plan to improve it to a mid-40% level in the mid to long term.</p><p>Next, I would like to cover credit cost ratio. 2020 Q2 group credit cost posted 0.29%, and it rose slightly Q-o-Q on the back of additional provisioning that I aforementioned. However, excluding one-offs at 0.14%, it is still being well-managed at a low level.</p><p>Next, I will cover the group's BIS capital adequacy ratio. 2020 June end group BIS ratio posted 14.13%. CET1 ratio recorded 12.80%, similar to the previous quarter. Despite the risk-weighted asset growth following corporate loan and unsecured loan centered loan growth, along with sound net profit growth, strategic capital adequacy management, including issuance of hybrid bonds and disposition of securities FVOCI, we are maintaining the industry's highest level of capital buffer.</p><p>Please refer to the following pages since they cover the details related to the earnings that I just aforementioned. With this, we will conclude KBFG 2020 first half management results presentation. Thank you for listening.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) From Hyundai Motor Securities, Mr. Kim Jin-Sang. Go ahead with your question.</p><p>JIN-SANG KIM, ANALYST, HMC INVESTMENT SECURITIES CO., LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. First of all, thank you very much for good business results. Starting with your net profit as well as other financials also, quite positive result. But it seems that the bank's NIM has declined quite significantly, which is a bit unfortunate. I believe that the banking industry as a whole, on the backdrop of policy rate cut, it was relatively speaking not as negatively impacted because there was demand for loans and more growth.</p><p>So I know that you provided some background information, but could you elaborate a little more as to why your NIM fell? And what you plan -- what your plans are to recover? And you've mentioned KRW 206 billion of additional provisioning. Can you provide us some more color and breakdown of more details?</p><p>My last question has to do with COVID-19 pandemic. In the second half, we think the situation is going to more or less stabilize. However, the capital markets are fluctuating and the COVID situation also is quite volatile. And if this whole situation prolongs, there would be more pressure felt by the company. So in terms of asset quality prospects, forecast, what's your feel as we experience prolonged COVID-19 pandemic?</p><p>BONG JOONG KWON: You submitted 3 questions. Give us 1 moment. We will respond shortly.</p><p>KI-HWAN KIM: Thank you very much, Mr. Kim Jin-Sang, for your question. Bank's NIM basically fell by 6 basis points on Q-on-Q basis. Let me provide you with some more background information. As we entered into Q2, we've seen surge in the market liquidity. And basically, the low-cost deposit on a Q-on-Q basis have risen by about 8%, which is about KRW 9 trillion. Time deposits fell by about KRW 3 trillion. So on the funding cost side, basically, the pressures were relieved. But if we were to look at the drivers behind the decline in the NIM, it is as follows.</p><p>First, the biggest impact was felt from policy rate cut. This year, there was 75 basis point cut and market rate, therefore, declined, and that really fed into the NIM erosion. So due to the market rate decline, NIM was impacted by negative 3.2 basis points. However, in terms of interest rate sensitivity, this extent of interest movement or NIM movement, we believe, is within normal range.</p><p>Second is the impact of spread. Based on COVID, basically, we provided policy loans and also there were market stabilization funds. So various different types of financial support programs and also loans to large corporate and Jeonse loans where it's less profitable for us, we grew more on high-quality loan asset. So the return and spread basically declined, and that had an impact of about minus 1 basis point on NIM.</p><p>In Q2 with respect to COVID, in order to respond to potential FX crunch, we wanted to secure ample amount of FC liquidity. So from a short-term perspective, we expanded foreign currency short-term assets. Therefore, that had a downward impact on NIM by negative 1.2 basis points. But we believe that after June, things normalize, so starting Q3, we believe the pressures on NIM is going to get itself resolved. And lastly, April, as we acquired PRASAC from Cambodia, we financed for that investment, and there was about 0.5 basis point impact on NIM from the financing for the investment of PRASAC. So all in all, there was a 6 basis point impact on NIM.</p><p>In terms of investment in order to manage our NIM, basically, we want to expand our quality assets. So this is our growth strategy from a risk-adjusted return basis. However, by different business segment, we will look at profitability and capital efficiency and adjust our loan portfolio accordingly. And also make our loan pricing more sophisticated by different segments so that we can really guide against our profitability as much as possible.</p><p>On the funding side, LDR and LCR, which are liquidity regulations, they have been temporarily softened. So in terms of funding lower funding cost, basically, we want to be very flexible and make use of market funding as well. And KB has its channel competitiveness. We want to fully utilize that, really strengthen our marketing so that we can do our best to expand on low-cost deposits.</p><p>Our annual NIM projection for this year in light of policy rate cut, market situation and the impact of loan conversion, considering all of these factors, we believe that for this year, we will record 1.5%. We think that in the Q3, Q4, we will probably hit bottom, after which we will stabilize.</p><p>Responding to your second question, on the additional provisioning for the second quarter, due to COVID pandemic in order to preemptively respond to potential asset quality deterioration, we've taken a very conservative future projection criteria, reclassified assets and basically set aside, in addition, KRW 206 billion in provisions. Looking at different scenarios, basically, in the second half, this is the assumption. COVID-19 is going to come again. And next year, there's going to be another massive pandemic. This was the assumption. So we apply forward-looking model. Based on that forward-looking model, basically, we've set aside provision of KRW 143 billion of additional provisioning that is. Also, on top of that, of the Stage 1 loans, we looked at some highly risk loans. What we did was we reclassify them and put them under Stage 2 loans. And then accordingly, we have additionally provisioned KRW 63 billion from this adjustment.</p><p>In terms of the level of provision of the banks, I know there are some concerns. At KBFG, we've applied forward-looking area and model. And by the end of last year, we've provisioned KRW 529 billion. And this time around, we've provisioned KRW 206 billion. So basically, on a forward-looking basis, we've set aside KRW 720 billion or KRW 735 billion. So if you look at the group's NPL coverage ratio, it's 144.4%. And if you were to add the reserve, basically 295%, that's the coverage ratio, NPL coverage ratio. Our loan-to-value or basically coverage of collateral is 80%. So loss absorption capacity of the company is relatively high.</p><p>Responding to your third question about COVID-19, basically, what we think our asset quality outlook is going to be going forward. Because of COVID-19, with economic downturn, there's a lot of concern about quality deterioration. In the case of bank, delinquency ratio, NPL ratio is industry's best and also credit card company, we think our delinquency ratio is being maintained at a steady level. So compared to our peers, we are very rigidly managing and also by upgrading our credit risk management process, we're very much focused on quality management and also quality to be easing, financial support, low interest rate environment, all of these factors we fully are aware of. So we think the credit cost within this year can be controlled within 30 basis point.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic is global. And there's U.S.-China trade tension becoming worse. So these are more conservative scenario assumption. Even under that scenario, group's credit cost, we believe, will still be within 40 basis points. So even when things turn for the worst, we don't think our asset quality is going to be degraded significantly. However, on the back of COVID-19, there are some marginal borrowers, and there could be NPL that's formed from such segments. So on COVID-19, we have scenario analysis in different phases. So based on that, we've set up contingency plan and by different industry sector and the types borrowers, we've come up with more refined and sophisticated plan.</p><p>And for vulnerable class, we will continue -- we will operate continuous monitoring. So we have risk management regime and schemes in place. For household, basically, the credit ratings of the borrower or whether that borrower has multiple loans, so depending on different criteria, we would monitor. And for marginal borrowers, we would continuously monitor so that we can really allow for a soft lending. By corporate, for COVID-19 sensitive industries, we will make our lending origination criteria much more stringent and also preemptively reduce potential NPLs. So we're rebalancing and strengthening our credit review. So above BBB-, our ratio is about 80% as of end of June.</p><p>So our loan portfolio has been continuously being improved, as you can see, and we think that there is limited possibility for things to actually worsen below fundamentals, especially for SOHO loans because they are highly sensitive to economic cycles. There are concerns about asset quality. Delinquency at this point is 0.16%. And collateral ratio is around 90% and also high credit rating portion is about 90% as well. So all the asset quality indicators are quite positive. And if you look debt servicing capabilities and also in terms of review process, it's mostly focused preserving the actual loans. All of these are the basis for managing all of these aspects.</p><p>In the case of credit card, basically, the delinquency ratio on a Q-on-Q basis had fallen by 0.2%. So for credit card, all the quality-related indicators are quite positive. But if COVID, once again, spreads, then individual small operators, and small businesses may be exposed to further deterioration in the credit quality. So we are applying more fine-tuned to review strategies for different industry sectors, depending on their exposure to economic cycles. So we are being prepared against crisis so provided some more detail on the asset quality management.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll take the next question from Samsung Securities, Mr. Kim Jaewoo.</p><p>JAEWOO KIM, ANALYST, SAMSUNG SECURITIES CO. LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: I have 2 questions. The first question is, as it was given to us, regarding your loan growth, you mentioned that it grew this year. And can you tell us more? Because it seems that you have reached your goal. So can you tell us about the changes that you may have? And your future loan-related policies, guidance going forward? And related to the recovery of your other operating losses, in Q1, you mentioned some details about why you saw some operating losses, other operating losses and since they were improved, we think it is very fortunate. And can you tell us in more detail about what actually improved, leading to the recovery? It will be very helpful if you could explain to us.</p><p>BONG JOONG KWON: Thank you, Mr. Kim Jaewoo, and we will soon answer the questions for you. Please hold.</p><p>KI-HWAN KIM: Thank you very much for your question, Mr. Kim Jaewoo. Regarding our second half loan growth goal on a won basis -- Korean won basis, we had seen a 6.8% growth. And our goal was between 5% to 6% loan growth for this year. So it has actually exceeded that. Regarding this, in the second half of this year, we are going to focus on profitability and asset quality, and we are going to have a very conservative loan policy and we're going to have qualitative improvements entering on a portfolio improvement so that we can actually keep an eye on the speed of our growth. We also will see some regulatory effect from the real estate regulation strengthening, and we believe that there might be a decline in the demand for loans so we believe that on the whole, there will be limited growth factors for loan growth in the second half of this year.</p><p>We believe that our second half loan growth goals will be more limited than in the first half. So that will be our policy going forward. And for household loans, there are unsecured loans, Jeonse loans that we are going to focus on. And for corporate loans, in the second half of this year, we are going to have a more conservative loan policy and we are going to flexibly respond to the market environment, so we are going to actually control our growth speed centering on high-quality growth industries.</p><p>I would like to talk about the other operating gains and losses. And you can see that actually, it was KRW 227.7 billion, and it was actually a minus figure, minus KRW 27 billion -- minus KRW 207 billion, and you can see for the FX derivatives in Q1 of last year, we had seen surmountable losses because of the FX market. But in Q2, we have seen a stable stance in the financial market, so we have seen a KRW 545 billion of gains. And you can see of profits. So we have seen a growth of KRW 495 billion, and you can see that it was actually similar to the level of the previous quarter.</p><p>In Q1 of the previous quarter, the securities ETF ELS portfolio investment and CVA and our private -- our PE fund related losses was about KRW 330 billion. But in Q2, we had about KRW 170 billion of profit. So we had seen a KRW 500 billion of improvement for our FX bonds. You can see that most of it was recovered, and our securities ETF almost all recovered and our portfolio ETF almost have all recovered. And our CVAs also have mostly recovered as well. So on the whole, you can see that in most areas, we had seen a recovery.</p><p>In the case of ELS and for PE funds, our losses are recovering at a slower pace. However, for the ELS management, you can see that the market, if it continues to stabilize, then we can see the profits coming in from the prepaid repayment. And with the expansion of COVID-19 going forward, if there are shocks in the market, and there is a high possibility that it might happen, and if that happens, that in our group, we're going to have a defensive stance so that when the market volatility increases, we are going to respond to that. And we are going to actually focus on our stable profits going forward.</p><p>OPERATOR: We will take the next question from Hana Financial Investment, Mr. Choi Jung-wook.</p><p>Apologies, I think we got disconnected.</p><p>As we will move on to the next question Baek Doosan from Korea Investment Company -- Korea Investment Securities.</p><p>DOOSAN BAEK, RESEARCH ANALYST, KOREA INVESTMENT &amp; SECURITIES CO., LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: I have a question on asset quality and loan classification. My first question is, this quarter, Q-on-Q, I see that your recovered loans volume has declined. Does that have to do with the reversal of the provision? Second question, basically on substandard loans, we've seen some increases, but this didn't come from bank or card. Is it from KB Securities? What are -- what's the type of this loan? And also, as you reclassified Stage 2, you've also added on the provision. So below substandard, what is the size of the substandard loans for this quarter in relation to the reclassification into Stage 2?</p><p>BONG JOONG KWON: Thank you. We will respond shortly. Yes, we're preparing to answer your question. So just give us one moment.</p><p>KI-HWAN KIM: Thank you for your question. Because your question was very specific, I had to look for some numbers. I will be able to respond to third question and there are some numbers that I do not have, and I will make sure that our IR department respond to that later. In terms of doubtful -- excuse me, in terms of doubtful loans -- now in terms of reversal of the provision, basically, there were reclassification from doubtful to normal. So there was a reversal or write-back from doubtful to normal. In terms of substandard, I would have to go back and check our numbers again. For Stage 2, basically, we reclassified normal loans to precautionary.</p><p>OPERATOR: From Hana Financial Securities, Mr. Choi Jung-wook. You're on the line, sir.</p><p>JUNG WOOK CHOI, ANALYST, HANA FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CO., LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes, I am Jung-wook from Hana Financial Securities. Recently, we see fintech or big tech, which are both worse in the market and KakaoBank's asset is fast-growing and Naver Financial is trying to expand its influence. So for these big tech companies, what are your thoughts? And from the group, do you have a specific strategy to respond? And for different subsidiaries, what are their different approaches to big tech?</p><p>BONG JOONG KWON: Please hold and we will soon answer your question.</p><p>KI-HWAN KIM: Thank you very much, Mr. Jung-wook, for your question. There is a lot of talk about big tech and fintech, and you asked about what is our strategy to respond to these trends. As you mentioned, with the COVID, the unpack trend has been expanding and from the off-line channel to non-face-to-face channels, the major channels have been shifting, and we are seeing the competitiveness of fintech which has been expanding according to the government's policies as well. And we're seeing financial NOMADs emerging in the market with more competition with big tech companies and the fintech regulatory policies are quite different from the past. And we are seeing that the commercial customers have been shifting, and this can lead to changes in the profitability. So we believe that it can actually be addressed to the banking business on the whole.</p><p>However, seeing from another side, we can actually enter into new markets that were locked in the past, and we can actually evolve as new platform companies. So we believe that we can also fully utilize these changes. So in the digital big tech and fintech market, we believe that we can actually lead the way. It's because we have 35 million customers and we have diverse subsidiaries and banks and diverse financial products and we offer diverse services. So we can utilize these, and we have our strong banks off-line channel, and we can link these together. We can have seamless services between online and off-line services so that the customer experiences through digital innovation can be provided from the group.</p><p>How we're going to respond is the following: first, we are going to find out the pain points of customers, and we are going to reestablish our platforms. We have our main apps Star Banking, Liiv and Liiv ON. And we are going to completely revamp them so that they are customer based so that we can offer more polished customer experiences. It will be faster, simpler, customized and the communication will be more improved.</p><p>Secondly, we are going to cooperate with other companies so that we can lead innovative service development. We are going to develop innovative APIs and based on open API platform, we're going to have an innovative financial ecosystem. Within our group, we have cloud-based KB Drive, and we have already implemented this and we're going to also have a open based, cloud-based collaborative platform, CLAYON, and we are discovering -- uncovering start-ups. And we have KB Innovation HUB that we are actually already implementing, and we have a KBC fund within our group from 2018, and we have been making strategic investments.</p><p>Thirdly, we are going to meet the needs of our customers so that we can offer differentiated products and services. According to the different age brackets, we can have asset management services for the seniors, and for millennials, we can offer different types of services that will meet their needs and their digital environment, we are going to act and respond very aggressively.</p><p>Fourthly, is regarding data, the internal data integration will be utilized, and we can actually link that to external data. Our internal data will be utilized in the optimal way, and we're going to have public data and nonfinancial data that will be integrated together. And based on that, we're going to have big data analysis so that we can offer more services, and we're going to offer more profitable services, so that it can work for us. From August, we're going to have MyData that will be implemented and have a TFT within our group so that we are seeing the different directions of the different subsidiaries and we had 8 subsidiaries, including bank securities, insurance car capital, and we have actually submitted our preliminary demand for MyData to financial authorities. And from February of last year, with our card business, we have our independent my data business that has been already been implemented and we have KB My Money that will be improved, and we're going to offer online/offline simultaneous services for our asset management. We are going to have a leadership role in the MyData era as well. Thank you very much.</p><p>BONG JOONG KWON: It's now been 50 minutes since we began our presentation. I think we are entertaining sufficient number of questions. But -- so due to the time constraint, we will take the last question. If you have any additional questions, please contact the IR team, and we will respond.</p><p>OPERATOR: As our final question from Cape Investment Securities, Mr. Kim Do Ha. Please go ahead.</p><p>DO HA KIM, ANALYST, CAPE INVESTMENT &amp; SECURITIES CO., LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Kim Do Ha. Excuse me, I just have 1 question. I would like to ask if you look at credit costs and your delinquency figures, I think the figures are quite positive despite the COVID situation. However, when it comes to the other support programs, the moratoriums that you have applied on the repayment of principal and interest, we believe that, that moratorium program had an impact. So extending of the repayment period or interest rate payment, do you have any specific figure that could actually tell us what the impact of the moratorium program on the principal repayment and interest payment is?</p><p>BONG JOONG KWON: Please bear with us. We will respond shortly.</p><p>KI-HWAN KIM: Kim Do Ha, thank you very much for your question. In relation to the COVID pandemic, the government has announced various different forbearance program. And at our group, through the government support program, we have been providing preemptive liquidity into the market and have been playing up to our role and responsibility.</p><p>So in terms of such preemptive liquidity provision, we feel that they play an important role in bringing about soft lending and also help against deep asset quality deterioration or sudden rise in provisioning. If we get government program, most of these programs actually compensate for the interest rate or also they use a credit guarantee fund and also different types of government guarantees are provided. And most of these forbearance support is all guaranteed by the government. So as to a burden that needs to be borne by the bank is not that significant.</p><p>If you look at the specifics of the loans that's been originated under such program, we will collect that information and provide that to you later as I do not hold the data at this point. And when we did a forward-looking provisioning, I think we did reflect some impact from these types of financial support program, the government forbearance program. There is government support, but at the same time, the credit cost increases or delinquency increases, we wanted to make sure we can control them and to fend off any asset quality deterioration. So we have things in place, and we will continuously and preemptively, really focus on managing our asset quality. Thank you very much.</p><p>BONG JOONG KWON: As I had mentioned, we will conclude our earnings release. Thank you very much.</p><p>[Statements in English on this transcript were spoken by an interpreter present on the live call.]</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)</p><p>I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Dunkel, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.</p><p>DAVID L. DUNKEL, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, KFORCE INC.: Good afternoon. I would like to remind you that this call may contain certain statements that are forward-looking, including statements regarding the impact, opportunities and benefits from actions taken related to the COVID-19 economic and health crisis. These statements are based upon current assumptions and expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary materially from the factors listed in Kforce's public filings and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We cannot undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. You can find additional information about this quarter's results in our earnings release and our SEC filings. In addition, we have published our prepared remarks within the Investor Relations portion of our website.</p><p>Our focus on providing critical technology talent to world-class companies as well as the ability of our FA business to support large-scale, critical government-sponsored COVID-19-related initiatives in addition to our core FA footprint allowed us to grow revenues 1.2% on a year-over-year basis against the backdrop of an unprecedented macroeconomic landscape resulting from the sudden and dramatic effects of the global pandemic. Our strong performance in the second quarter is a testament to the longer-term strategic decisions we have made to position Kforce for success and significantly insulate the firm from the consequences of the economic disruption.</p><p>We have worked diligently over many years to shed nonstrategic businesses, which has resulted in roughly 80% of our revenues being concentrated in high-end information technology staffing and solutions. This decision was supported by our belief that the technology staffing and solutions market would exhibit very strong and stable long-term demand that would have very limited economic sensitivity due to the critical need for ongoing technology investment, particularly in industry-leading world-class companies. While nobody could have foreseen this severe of an event to be the proof positive of our long-standing secular thesis, we believe that the current crisis has only strengthened the secular drivers of demand and technology as companies accelerate investments in their digital transformation efforts. We will continue to place a priority on allocating capital to grow our technology business.</p><p>While we remain cautious and continue to fortify our balance sheet in the near term, the strength in our performance and financial position allows us to be flexible in how we deploy capital in the future. I am extremely proud of the tenacious focus and execution our leaders and associates have displayed during this difficult time. Our people have successfully tackled a sudden shift to working fully remotely, many schooling their children virtually in the spring and likely in the fall without any decline in productivity levels. Our people have been nothing short of tremendous, and they have proven to be one of the best teams in the industry. As we look to the future, there is much that remains uncertain, but several things seem relatively clear to us. For instance, we will not be reoccupying our field and corporate offices anytime soon and are assessing what our future real estate needs may be as we modify our business model and structurally reduce operating costs.</p><p>Our investments in cloud-based, technology-enabled operating model, primarily leveraging Microsoft as our platform of choice, has put our people in a position to excel in this virtual work environment, and we are assessing areas to accelerate investments in technology that will drive much greater effectiveness and enhance service levels in what will likely be a more flexible future working environment. Our priority during economic downturns has always been to return -- retain our great people and maintain important strategic investments in our business so that we are well positioned to take market share and accelerate growth rapidly as the situation improves. We have handled the current situation in much the same way. We are very well positioned to navigate through the current period without having to take drastic actions to reduce costs, restrict or eliminate dividends or raise capital. Rather, we will continue to manage our business in a disciplined manner as we always have based on operating trends.</p><p>Through these difficult times, we will continue to put the safety of our associates first. They are the key to our future success, and we know that their resilience and determination will drive increasing success as we move through and beyond the current situation.</p><p>I will now turn the call over to Joe Liberatore, President, who'll give greater insights into our second quarter performance, recent operating trends and other insights into our operating environment. Dave Kelly, CFO, well then give greater detail on our financial results, including cash flows and balance sheet position as well as guidance for the third quarter. Joe?</p><p>JOSEPH J. LIBERATORE, PRESIDENT, KFORCE INC.: Thank you, Dave, and thanks to all of you for your interest in Kforce. The journey that Dave mentioned is an overall focus by shedding nonstrategic businesses to take greater advantage of the secular shift in technology demand and to limit our exposure to the highly cyclical Direct Hire business is providing significant level of resiliency to our revenues as demonstrated by our second quarter results and early third quarter trends. Our overall revenue growth in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis of 1.2% and the performance in each of our lines of business exceeded both internal and Wall Street expectations. Let me give you a little bit more color in each of our lines of business.</p><p>With respect to our technology business, Flex revenues declined 3% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. As noted on last quarter's call, we didn't see notable impacts from the COVID-19 crisis until late March and into early April. After the April impacts of decline from these businesses directly affected by the pandemic, our weekly trends were largely stable throughout the remainder of the second quarter. Since mid-June, we've seen modest growth in our billable headcount. For the month of July and on a year-over-year basis, Technology Flex revenues were down approximately 2%, though these declines may increase slightly for full quarter against the more difficult prior year comp. Search activity and job order flow have begun to increase over the last several weeks. They remain lower than pre-pandemic levels. While job orders are lower than pre-pandemic, the quality of the job orders is higher as clients seek to stop critical roles.</p><p>Our internal metrics and revenue trends point to an improving environment. If trends continue, we will see third quarter sequential growth in Tech as the higher skill set work, which is being done virtually 100% remotely, has been retained by our clients throughout the pandemic and is now being supplemented with new assignment growth. The majority of the declines we experienced at the onset of the pandemic, as noted previously, were principally concentrated in travel and leisure, retail and health care sectors. We found that many of our largest clients, where we have greatest presence and most mature relationships, actually added additional resources in transformational roles as the quarter progressed.</p><p>We continue to experience the acceleration of technology-driven, mission-critical, strategic consumer direct initiatives within world-class companies. We have matured our capability to source and deliver diverse skill sets of qualified talent at scale to these large users that are priority needs for large-scale town across the U.S. We are well positioned to further evolve our offerings to meet these clients' changing needs, inclusive of expanding demand for managed services and solutions that have historically been provided by large solution providers. Due to our longevity in the market and reputation for delivering quality services, we are seeing increasing demand supporting clients' needs and managed teams, services and solution areas.</p><p>Revenues in this offering are accelerating at a significantly greater pace than our overall technology business. We feel extremely confident in the positioning of our technology business and the ability to expand our market share as competitive disruption in staffing companies emerge with those less capable or financially viable to navigate this economic downturn. We expect Flex revenues in our technology business in the third quarter to be stable to slightly up sequentially. It is also notable that the stability we have seen in Tech is much more significant than that experienced during the 2008, 2009 recession, which further supports the secular story. Should current trends continue for the remainder of the year, Tech Flex would experience a full year decline of less than 3%.</p><p>Moving to our FA business. Flex revenues were up nearly 29% year-over-year in the second quarter, primarily as a result of the contribution of approximately $35 million of revenue from our support of government-sponsored initiatives tied to the COVID-19 pandemic. For this business, we have partnered with several companies to provide consultants in roles including customer service and call center agents as well as loan processing specialists. These opportunities have provided a level of support to our core FA Flex business as we navigate the revenue reductions brought by the crisis. Our long-standing personal relationships, fortified by experience with these clients during prior natural disasters, and our ability to quickly source and deliver talent on a large scale, primarily due to our centralized delivery capability and innovative technology, uniquely positioned us to support these critical initiatives. These engagements remain fluid, but we expect these opportunities should continue through the third quarter and at least into the fourth quarter. Due to the nature of the projects, we would expect declines in these revenues as the economy recovers, which would likely correspond with increasing demand for our core Tech and FA offerings. Due to the growth we experienced in the second quarter, revenues related to COVID initiatives could be in the range of $45 million to $55 million in the third quarter. Our core FA Flex business declined approximately 25%. As we stated last quarter, we felt the negative impacts from the current crisis earlier and more deeply in this line of business. After the initial impacts were felt, we saw signs of stabilization during the majority of the second quarter and have experienced modest growth in billable headcount since the end of June. For the month of July, revenues in our core FA business were down roughly 26%, and we could see a sequential decline for the third quarter of mid-single digits. When combined with the midpoint of the range for COVID revenues, total FA Flex may be up approximately 17% sequentially and nearly 50% year-over-year.</p><p>Direct Hire revenue in the second quarter decreased approximately 50% year-over-year. We experienced the significant impact at the end of Q1 and generally held at those lower revenue levels through the second quarter. Direct Hire revenues are inherently less predictable. Year-over-year revenue declines have decelerated in the month of July, and we may see revenue levels for the third quarter at approximately second quarter levels. As of most recessionary cycles, this service offering tends to be the most impacted by the economic uncertainty, and we have consistently reduced our concentration of Direct Hire revenue over the years. At the peak of the economic expansion prior to the dot-com bust, direct hire revenues were 22.5% of revenues and now constitute less than 2% of revenues in the second quarter. While Direct Hire remains an important part of our service offerings to clients over the long term, we have not allocated significant investments here in part due to the sensitivity of the revenue stream to economic cycles and the disruptive technologies that have continued to evolve in this space.</p><p>Additionally, we are able to provide Direct Hire capability in our technology practice through the same channel utilized in our Technology Flex business as the skill sets we service are similar. As Dave stated, we have continued to invest in strategic initiatives to better position our firm for the long term, including investments in our most critical technology initiatives. Several years ago, we made a strategic decision to leverage Microsoft suite of product offerings for our cloud-based technologies. This includes our customer relationship management system, which we implemented in 2017, and our talent relationship management system, which we are in the process of implementing in 2020. This, combined with the seamless integration of these technology with other Microsoft Office 365 products, such as Outlook and Teams, has provided us significant efficiencies with a fully integrated platform especially as we shifted our associates to work remote environments in mid-March.</p><p>We are continuing to manage the productivity of our associates as we typically do with an elevated focus on retaining our most productive associates so we are best positioned to take advantage of the market subsequent to the crisis. We experienced the decline in overall pro forma headcount levels due to the natural performance managed attrition, but we did not and do not expect to undertake any large-scale reduction. We will continue to monitor the business environment and our operating trends and manage or perform our headcount accordingly. As conditions begin to improve, we believe we can take advantage of the capacity that exists in our existing talent, along with the improving productivity gains through our technology investments and greater enablement of our current communication tools that have been so successful for us during the transition to remote work.</p><p>Our experience has been that recessionary cycles result in a shift in the competitive environment, and we believe we are ideally situated to take advantage of the market as conditions recover and what we believe will be an accelerated digitally led expansion. I greatly appreciate the trust our clients, consultants and candidates have placed in Kforce, and I couldn't be prouder of our team's efforts, executing in a fully remote capacity by managing through these remarkable times. We are well underway in assessing any adjustments to our future operating model brought to the forefront by this pandemic, including, but not limited to, our future real estate footprint, internal talent acquisition strategies, technology investments, among others.</p><p>I will now turn the call over to Dave Kelly, Kforce's Chief Financial Officer. Dave?</p><p>DAVID M. KELLY, CHIEF FINANCIAL &amp; ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER AND SECRETARY, KFORCE INC.: Thank you, Joe. Revenues of $343 million in the quarter grew 1.2% year-over-year and earnings per share of $0.47 declined 28.8% particularly due to a decline in gross margin and higher SG&amp;A costs related to retention of critical infrastructure and resources. Our gross profit percentage in the quarter of 28.4% decreased 140 basis points year-over-year primarily as a result of a lower Direct Hire revenue mix. Our Flex gross profit percentage of 27% improved 10 basis points year-over-year despite the negative impact from the higher mix of revenues from the COVID-19 business, which carries a lower overall margin profile. Flex margins in our technology business increased 70 basis points year-over-year primarily as a result of lower payroll taxes and consultant travel costs. Spreads in our technology business remained flat year-over-year and sequentially as improved spread from new managed services business has offset any pricing concessions provided to certain strategic clients during the pandemic. Flex margins in our FA business declined 240 basis points year-over-year, though approximately 120 basis points of this was driven by the lower-margin COVID-19 business. Spreads in our core FA business were down slightly essentially. Average bill rates in our technology business of $80 per hour increased 4.6% sequentially and 6.2% year-over-year. We believe this increase was driven in part by business mix as our clients are retaining the more highly skilled consultants given the scarcity of talent and the assignments that were ended at the onset of this pandemic were lower skilled areas, which were less capable of working remotely. New assignment adds in the quarter, inclusive of the increasing mix of higher bill rate managed services business, were concentrated as well in higher bill rate skill sets. We saw a similar story in our core FA business, where average bill rates of $40 grew 4.6% sequentially and 9.5% year-over-year.</p><p>As we look forward to the third quarter, we would expect continued stability in our bill pay spreads in our technology and core FA business versus second quarter levels and for overall margins to be stable. Our strong results and the improvements we've made in associate productivity are allowing us to sustain or accelerate expenditures on strategic activities, such as technology investments, acceleration of efforts to reposition our FA business and retaining critical resources through the pandemic. These actions as well as other discrete costs related to the pandemic led to an increase in SG&amp;A as a percentage of revenue in the second quarter of 50 basis points year-over-year. We expect SG&amp;A expense to decline in Q3, which, in addition to increased revenue, will have a significant positive impact to earnings per share. Roughly 80% of our SG&amp;A expenses are variable in nature, which allows us to significant -- allows significant flexibility to manage our cost structure.</p><p>We have also gained significant operating leverage over the last several years. This leverage, along with recent cost-containment actions, and our quality revenue stream has put us in a position to navigate the current crisis without taking drastic actions. We've continued to make investments in our business that we believe will position us well to continue to outperform the market as the crisis subsides.</p><p>Our second quarter operating margin was 4.5%. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 29.4%, which was slightly higher than we anticipated as a result of certain true-ups.</p><p>Next, I'll spend a few minutes discussing our operating cash flows and liquidity position. Operating cash flows in the second quarter were $36 million, an increase of $25.4 million year-over-year due to continued profitable growth. We also benefited from the deferral of approximately $12 million in payroll taxes under the CARES Act in the second quarter. Our accounts receivable portfolio continues to perform well as days sales outstanding was flat from Q1 2020 levels. We have a very strong balance sheet, which provides ample liquidity to operate the business even in extreme conditions and flexibility to opportunistically allocate resources. Our working capital balance as of June 30, net of cash on hand, was approximately $140 million, which serves as a reliable source of liquidity if revenues were to contract. We have a $300 million revolving credit facility that matures in May 2022. Our trailing 12-month EBITDA as of June 30 was roughly $87 million, which currently provides incremental borrowing capacity, should we need it, of roughly $140 million. We had approximately $52.4 million cash on hand at the end of the quarter. And net debt as of June 30 was approximately $48 million or roughly 0.5x trailing 12-month EBITDA.</p><p>Looking forward into Q3, we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow, which we plan to utilize to further reduce net debt levels. Our current cash flow expectations suggest that we could be effectively net debt-free by the end of 2020. We believe we are in an enviable position due to our low debt levels, healthy cash flows, high-quality accounts receivable portfolio and resilient revenue stream. The strength in our financial position allows us to be flexible in making continued investments in our business, deploying capital in other areas, such as acquisitions, and returning capital to our shareholders.</p><p>We are resuming guidance this quarter, but with wider ranges given the continued unknowns and the unpredictability of our COVID-19 revenue stream. Our billing days are 64 days in the third quarter, which is the same as Q2 2020 and the third quarter of 2019. We expect Q3 revenues to be in the range of $352 million to $362 million and for earnings per share to be between $0.72 and $0.80. Gross margins are expected to be between 28.2% and 28.4%, while Flex margins are expected to be between 26.9% and 27.1%. SG&amp;A as a percent of revenue is expected to be between 21.3% and 21.5%, and operating margins should be between 6.3% and 6.7%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 21 million for Q3, and the anticipated effective tax rate is 26.8%. This guidance does not consider the potential negative impact on the demand environment from a significant increase in COVID-19 cases, the effect, if any, of charges related to any onetime costs, costs or charges related to any pending tax or legal matters, the impact on revenues of any disruption in government funding or the firm's response towards regulatory, legal or future tax law changes.</p><p>Kforce outperformed the market during the great recession, and our results thus far during this pandemic have been encouraging. At that time, technology only comprised 50% of total revenues versus approximately 80% today. We believe we are in an even better position to outperform as we navigate the current economic and health crisis.</p><p>Lastly, I'd like to extend a sincere thank you to all of our teams for their efforts over the last 5 months to ensure that we are living up to our brand promise of providing great results through strategic partnership and knowledge sharing.</p><p>Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Josh Vogel with Sidoti &amp; Company.</p><p>JOSHUA DAVID VOGEL, ANALYST, SIDOTI &amp; COMPANY, LLC: Pretty impressive results in this environment. My first question is, do you see any sort of scenario that even after the economy recovers that the government decides to keep some of these programs intact longer-term unless you can sustain a level of this work, too?</p><p>JOSEPH J. LIBERATORE: Josh, this is Joe. I'll take that question. Obviously, it's hard to say what's ultimately going to play out. I mean that's the trillion-dollar question, right? But what I would say from what we've been able to capture from the government support, we're kind of comfortable where we are as a percentage of a mix of our overall revenue. So we're not currently actively pursuing additional opportunities. Mainly, as we've stated in -- for quite some time now, our investments are going towards Tech with an emphasis really on that higher value-add, managed services, solutions-oriented type project work along with continuing to further evolve our FAs and the skill areas that are really synergistic with our Tech footprint in and around data and business intelligence in those areas. So how long this will run out is a question that we really can't give you an answer to, but I wanted to give you a little bit more of that backdrop.</p><p>DAVID L. DUNKEL: Yes. Joe, this is Dave. I would ask the question, if you could tell me when all of this ends that Ican probably give you a better clue. We've been watching this go up and down for so long. The one thing that's very clear is that nobody knows. And what we are seeing is the continued uncertainty is bringing additional flexibility. So because of our unique capability to be able to deliver at scale, what was approximately 5,000 people in 4 weeks utilizing our centralized delivery, as Joe pointed out in his prepared remarks, and also some of our own innovative proprietary technology, I mean what a remarkable story that is. And so overall, we're very pleased with the way everything is balanced and not knowing how long it's going to last. I think we're very well positioned, as Joe said, that if, in fact, we do see an economic recovery, that's only going to feed the core business and technology anyway. So we're in a good spot. Thank you.</p><p>JOSHUA DAVID VOGEL: Great. Shifting to Tech Flex. You had the business update in early June. I think you said it was down about 2% year-over-year but 3% for the quarter. So am I right to think that it was -- it declined at a 4% to 5% clip in June? And if so, what drove that?</p><p>DAVID L. DUNKEL: Josh, I would say that was a point in time when we gave that, and that was very early on into COVID. So we experienced a little bit more deterioration kind of mid-quarter and then started to really improve as we moved to the back end of the quarter. So as we exited the quarter and as we enter Q3 here, we're pretty much in the same ZIP code of where the full quarter was. So I think it's just really the timing of where things happened in the quarter.</p><p>JOSHUA DAVID VOGEL: Understood. And you said July or through early August, you were trending down about 2%. Is that in the earlier comments?</p><p>DAVID L. DUNKEL: Correct.</p><p>JOSHUA DAVID VOGEL: Okay. Great. The -- when we look at the expectations built into your guidance and understanding it's a fluid situation and you're only giving quarterly guidance, but maybe if you could give any sort of directional commentary when we think about Q4, and let's just say hypothetically that the COVID-19 work is no longer contributing. Do you think that this will trend back up to historical levels as a percentage of revenue? Or what -- or how much do you think you could sustain of these cuts longer term? And what could be like more of a long-term run rate of G&amp;A?</p><p>DAVID M. KELLY: Yes. So Josh, this is Dave Kelly. A couple of things. You'll note and I think we provided some data in the release that shows you the gross margin profile of this COVID-related business. And as you'd expect, the profitability levels of that business are not at the levels of our Tech and our core FA business. But if you look forward, to your point about historical operating margins, actually if you look at a revenue composition that I think Joe stated, we expect to be between $45 million and $55 million for that COVID revenue in the third quarter and you look at the operating margins that we put out there relative to the revenue in the third quarter, not the fourth quarter, but earlier than in the fourth quarter, we actually are approaching the profitability levels that we had had pre-pandemic. So we're very pleased with -- even at this composition of business, how we're operating and obviously, as the business mix for us changes and Tech starts to grow, relatively speaking, and FA, which is certainly a more profitable, higher bill rate revenue stream, we're in a very great position to continue to improve profitability. So you mentioned in the fourth quarter, I think, important to take a look at the third quarter and the profitability levels we're expecting even in the third quarter.</p><p>JOSHUA DAVID VOGEL: Okay. And just lastly, you did talk about debt repayment, but can you just talk about your capital allocation strategy in general, where it stands today in terms of properties?</p><p>DAVID M. KELLY: Yes. So I'll restate what I said in the prepared remarks as we think about the near term. We certainly want to be cautious. We are in a position with very low debt levels. But I'd indicated as we look to generate cash, again, strong cash flows in the third quarter, we expect to continue to pay down debt. But we've got great flexibility. We think it's good right now to be cautious in terms of capital allocation, all those things, as we have always talked about in terms of returning cash to shareholders, acquisitions, thinking about opportunities on the table when we think the time is right. But we think prudent right now to be cautious.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.</p><p>TIMOTHY MICHAEL MULROONEY, GROUP HEAD OF GLOBAL SERVICES &amp; ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to build on one of the previous questions that was asked, but not on the top line trends but rather the bill pay spreads. Can you just talk about how the bill pay spread moved sequentially through the second quarter and into July?</p><p>DAVID M. KELLY: Sure. Happy to do that, Tim. This is Dave Kelly. So if you look at -- I made a commentary here on Tech, in particular. Again I think a very positive story. As we look sequentially, we've seen increasing bill rates because of, as Joe mentioned, a higher concentration of higher skill set business. But in spreads themselves, as we look sequentially, we're actually stable. We had -- I talked in the last call as the pandemic started that we had had some requests from strategic clients for some near-term concessions. I haven't seen a lot more of that, but obviously, that impacts spreads in the second quarter, and that has been offset completely if you think about flat spreads with some of the higher-margin new business that we've had. So we feel very good about where spreads were in the second quarter sequentially. And our commentary suggests we think those are going to be stable as we move in the third quarter for Flex -- for Tech Flex. Obviously, FA, the spreads in the aggregate are impacted by the COVID business. But feel good about the stability as well in the historical core FA business for spreads to remain constant as well as move into the third quarter.</p><p>TIMOTHY MICHAEL MULROONEY: Okay. That's encouraging. And on that COVID-related revenue, $45 million to $55 million I think you said you expect to see in FA Flex in the third quarter. Is that a continuation of the $35 million of the government work that you did in the second quarter or are these completely separate projects and clients?</p><p>DAVID M. KELLY: Yes. No, they're the same projects that we've been working on, that you're just selling the full reflection of those projects being fully staffed for the quarter.</p><p>TIMOTHY MICHAEL MULROONEY: Okay. Lastly, just a broader question. So you talked a lot about how digital transformation is driving incremental business right now, which makes sense. I was wondering if there were any concrete examples that you could provide of the type of work that's being done right now to support client needs as they try to support their clientele and their employees?</p><p>JOSEPH J. LIBERATORE: Yes. It's a great question. And I wouldn't say that this is a near-term incremental, so I want to be clear there. Because I think what you really have to do is you have to look back to 2008, 2009 as that was really a turning point with the advent of smartphones coming about, areas such as mobility, cloud, along with the security ramification, they were in their infancy back in 2008, 2009. So I mean, the entire world has moved online, and I'm not talking just Internet online, but the way that all businesses are interfacing with their customers, their distributors, their vendors, how they're even interfacing with their internal people. I mean we're personally experiencing this front and center. So I think you almost have to think of this in terms of the customer journey and leveraging technology in a mobile cloud base and interfacing wherever there's possible opportunities to really enhance or optimize that client experience, whether it's acquisition of a product or service, how you're processing payments, billing, all those dynamics, the support, I mean. So it's really an end-to-end experience. So these -- what's happened with COVID is it's really only accelerated what was already underway in terms of data -- this whole digitization. And then on the back end of this, you have the whole data aspect, which is really -- everybody is trying to figure out how do I get after my data to enhance my decision-making, how do I get after that to enhance the overall customer experience. So I'd really say to sum it up, this has really just been an accelerator of all these digitization activities. I mean we continue to see clients they're hiring, what I would really consider more transformational roles with the high percentage of these being really more senior level, and they're directly linked to accelerating that digitization experience and it's really that consumer direct-type relationship and then enabling the whole remote work environment with mobility and cloud at the forefront. So it's much broader than something that's incremental.</p><p>DAVID L. DUNKEL: Tim, this is Dave Dunkel. I want to add something to that, too. I mean, another major factor is the disruptors that have come in to the various industry verticals. So some of the traditional operators within those verticals, and obviously, you can use retail as an example on the disruption that Amazon brought, many of those retailers are now in an arms race, if you will, to upgrade their own digital capabilities and their interfaces with their customers, mobile ordering platforms and so -- and this is going to go on for quite a while. So that's just one industry, for example, where you see another disruptor that has triggered a response from some of the more traditional operating entities within the vertical. And this is going to continue for quite some time.</p><p>JOSEPH J. LIBERATORE: Yes. It's this whole creating a frictionless experience is really what it boils down to. When you look at some of those disruptors, whether it be the Uber's of the world, the Lyfts of the world, what did they really do? They took something that was traditional, brought it online and created a frictionless experience and a much more efficient overall operating environment. And this is what every business in the land is after.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulations on the strong resiliency. Wondering if you can talk a little bit on the IT side. Obviously, you referenced there are certain verticals where clients are being impacted. But obviously, others are continuing to accelerate what their work was. Can you give us a sense for the percentage of clients that were expanding their usage versus those that were pulling back a little bit? And how broad is the client base that you're seeing with the expansion right now on the IT side?</p><p>JOSEPH J. LIBERATORE: Yes. So I would -- I'll kind of answer that in 2 parts. One, I'll give you a sense for our customer base, and then I'll give you a sense for what we're seeing across broader industries. So Mark, the way that I would say is, 7 of our top 10 industries that where we do business, they either grew or remained stable sequentially or on a year-over-year basis. And I'd say year-over-year because some of them had very difficult comps. So there's great momentum in there. The 3 industries that were more challenged were those that were more directly impacted by the current crisis. Retail, health care, transportation and leisure. I mean outside of these industries, we've really seen stability and in the normal course of business, outside of -- you always have unique client dynamics. But within those industries, all those other industries seem very stable and a subset of that, when I look at our top 25 clients that we do business with on the Tech front, I mean 17 out of 25 of those clients grew on a sequential basis. So that's from Q1 to Q2 and realized Q1 did not have a full COVID impact. So that just gives you some feel for the overall market, hopefully.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: It does. That's very helpful. And those 17 of the 25, how much do they comprise of the overall IT Flex?</p><p>JOSEPH J. LIBERATORE: Yes. I mean, our top 25 customers here for a number of years now typically make up almost half of our overall tech revenue footprint. I mean, it will bounce around. Sometimes it will be -- it might be mid-40% or it might bounce a little bit closer to 50%, but it's all pretty much been in that ZIP code for quite some time now.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: Great. And then it sounds like, you gave really good color with regards to the bill rates on the Tech Flex side in terms of its -- a greater level of concentration on some of the higher skill set. On a skill set for skill set basis, apples-for-apples, what sort of bill rate increase did you end up seeing if you were just looking at comparable skill sets, roughly speaking?</p><p>JOSEPH J. LIBERATORE: Yes. I don't know that it's very easy to parse that, Mark. I would say generally speaking, there's a scarcity of talent. There certainly is an acknowledgment of that in the marketplace. And so for skill set to skill set, certainly, the bias is increasing bill rates.</p><p>DAVID L. DUNKEL: That's right.</p><p>JOSEPH J. LIBERATORE: Yes. I would say it is increasing. It is increasing bill rates, but the shift in our portfolio because of the lower skills not being as remote capable so when that business comes on, I mean you artificially involve numbers. It takes up those bill rates. And so it's really the combination of those 2 things.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: Okay. And then with regards to managed solutions, can you talk a little bit about some of the types of projects that you're doing there? And what percentage of your mighty Flex it's currently comprising? And what sort of growth you're experiencing there?</p><p>JOSEPH J. LIBERATORE: Well, we haven't really broke out the percentage of revenue because it's a nominal percent of our revenue at this point in time. But I would say our teams are continuing to make really nice strides in building out our capabilities, the overall operating model. I mean our efforts on this from a revenue growth standpoint, they are outpacing the traditional tech offering. I think as you hear from others as well, because of just some of the market dynamics that are going on. I mean we've actually redirected a number of our best people that are now fully dedicated to pursue this type of business to leverage because what we're really doing is, we're leveraging existing relationships, and those clients are pulling us upstream. So our objective, and I think Dave put it out there in one of our earnings calls in the past was really within probably the next 4 or so years for this to comprise 20-plus percent of our overall Tech Flex footprint. So the types of work that we're doing within this is very similar to the other types of work that we're involved with the customer. It still ends in and around a lot of digitization. It's the same type of work, it's just that we're playing a more significant role and/or having greater responsibility for what those engagements are versus just putting in staff odd people on those same types of engagements. So it is not like it is a different business that we're in. It's just the nature of how we're performing the work within those clients.</p><p>DAVID L. DUNKEL: Mark, this is Dave. We'll break out that business when it gets to a significant level. And I'm going to tell Joe on this call to hurry you up and get to that 20%-plus level. So you've heard it here first, but we're making great progress there. And by the way, those business projects that we're taking on are also at higher bill rates, which is another reason the bill rates are going up.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: Great. And then can you talk a little bit about, obviously, COVID and the impact towards digitization is having an impact. But can you also talk about some of the other factors that are impacting IT work in the current environment? So obviously, with the administration putting pressure with regards to offshore work and then some of the technical difficulties that have occurred and then also some of the changes in terms of potential legislation around H1Bs and restrictions. Can you talk about those impacts and how we should think about them going forward?</p><p>JOSEPH J. LIBERATORE: Yes. I would say in terms of the impacts to the stem work or the Tech specifically, I mean, you have to look at with the overall makeup of the Tech workforce is, there is a very high percentage of 4 nationals, which is why you see the big tech companies, whenever this comes about, they come to the forefront because you start impacting that world, and you're going to bring tech to a screeching halt and what's been driving the market over the better part of the last several years, I mean it's the tech companies. So in terms of what we've seen from the administration because we track those things very closely in terms of the different visa situations because it is unique based upon type of visa, we see very little risk in our business at this point in time based upon what's out there. I mean I'd say that would apply to many others out there. Because again, remember, a lot of this legislation is going after those global providers that are basically trying to offshore or bring people onshore to replace droves of people from an outsourcing standpoint, not necessarily the people that are inside these IT organizations working on very specific projects. So I mean from -- that's really what's happening from that standpoint. And in terms of just the overall tech, we've just seen tremendous stability across our entire customer base.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: Great. And I mean, it should create some opportunities as well, no?</p><p>JOSEPH J. LIBERATORE: Well, are you talking about the opportunities because of the -- what was going on with India and the inability for India to potentially service things from an offshore standpoint from a work-from-home because...</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: Precisely.</p><p>JOSEPH J. LIBERATORE: Yes. That was out there when that first happened. I'm sure when you read the reports of all the global outsourcers that have reported, that's not being reflected in their reporting to date. And we -- while on the front end, we had certain clients that were starting to raise potential issue. I don't think they saw the same ramification. I would say, actually, more of what we've heard is -- and I don't want to call out any one specific, but more is in and around the data breach that took place, which I would say is a much more isolated situation versus this massive, what used to be offshore is now coming back onshore. I mean, there's going to be mission-critical situations that may have been identified, but I don't think that's materialized to the extent of what it was believed that it might be.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: Great. And then can you just talk a little bit about the efficiency improvements that you've had? You've got the talent management system that's going to be -- it's still in the process of being rolled out. What will that do? Also, what percentage of capacity are you currently running at with the existing number of recruiters and account managers that you currently have? And lastly, David, you talked about potentially changing your office footprint. What are the implications from a margin perspective longer-term as you reimagine what work-from-home could be like relative to kind of the more standard traditional way that we've worked?</p><p>DAVID L. DUNKEL: I'll let Joe answer the first part, and then I'll comment on the end. Go ahead, Joe.</p><p>JOSEPH J. LIBERATORE: Yes. So from a technology investment standpoint, as I mentioned in my comments, our first step was to decide who did we want to partner with long term. And that decision was made with Microsoft just because of just how integrated and seamless things could be with them, leveraging dynamics. So we started down that journey. We went after our CRM platform first. And now, we're on the back end of going after TRM, which will provide us a fully integrated seamless platform. Because you have to remember, when you're inside one of these platforms, 1 day somebody is a client, the next day they're a candidate, but it still is a person and that's the value that we get out of the dynamics platform. So what we've really been focused on, because I would say CRM, TRM within dynamics is just one element of what we've been after from a technology and innovation. As we've mentioned in the past, we entered into a strategic relationship with another party from a joint venture standpoint, where we're applying some very innovative technology. In fact, that technology is what was a key driver in our ability to staff over 5,000 to 6,000 roles in less than a 30-day period when we picked up the COVID business. So what we're really honed in on is on the recruitment side is everything from identification to match and where can we apply innovative technologies to remove people out of that equation, so the technology can do the things, technology can do better, and then our people can do only those things that people can do so that they can be much more proficient in interacting with people because the relationship is still a huge piece. So that's what I would say from the technology front. From a capacity standpoint, we're very comfortable with where we are right now that we have ample capacity in our existing associate population and as the market indicators are there, that's when we'll start to handle future hiring when those conditions are warranted. So we've continued to selectively hire into areas where productivity warrants, where we need to be adding people to certain teams. We've been doing that a lot within our managed services and solutions group just because of how quickly the revenue has been expanding there. But our most productive 4-plus year population, it remains at all-time high in terms of the amount of people that we have that are with us over 4 years as well as the percentage of our overall population. And that group has continued to really, even through COVID, maintain very strong levels of performance, and we believe with the addition of everything that we've been investing from a technology standpoint that, that only provides us more capacity for productivity and for us to be able to help those people to take their performance even to the next level. Dave, I don't know if you want to jump in on the real estate one or do you want me to address that?</p><p>DAVID L. DUNKEL: Yes. Well, you can editorialize when I'm done. I want to respect, we have a few other folks in the queue for questions. But the one thing I will say related to the real estate is we don't have the answer yet. We just know that it's going to be different. And we are going to test different models. But I think for just about everybody, work-from-home certainly opened up a lot of different ideas and greater flexibility. There's still a desire for people to have fellowship and to gather and to interact. But it's no longer necessary to have large-scale footprint of real estate in what was a traditional office setup. We can't say today what the future is going to be. We just know that it's going to be different. And we just know that the likelihood is that the real estate footprint is likely going to be smaller with a much better flexibility. Joe, do you want to add to that?</p><p>JOSEPH J. LIBERATORE: No. I think you really -- you captured everything there, Dave. I mean the reality is that the office of yesterday is not going to be replicated. High probability will not be replicated in the future. If you remotely believe that social distancing is going to be one of those remnants that remain to any extent after this because I just don't see organizations doubling their real estate footprint to accommodate social distancing. And most companies that you talk to, that's where most people are. They can only accommodate about 50% of their historic population in their legacy real estate footprint. What</p><p>[Audio Gap]</p><p>to step back and really look at, how do you really repurpose, how you're using office space to take advantage, by the way, of all of these innovations that are coming about. I mean, if you read any of the acceleration and adoption of these video platforms, whether it be Zoom or Teams, those are going to be remnants that are also left behind, and everybody is going to be rechallenging, where did I get efficiencies through this, how do I integrate that into my standard operating model, what does that translate to my real estate footprint.</p><p>DAVID L. DUNKEL: And people have changed the way that they're working. I mean you've got families at home now, 2-income families, teaching their children at home. And so that's going to change as well depending on what happens with the school openings and so forth. So we do believe that there is much greater operating leverage now for us from a real estate footprint and I think the technology, as Joe said, it's going to continue to enable people do the fun part of the job and not have to do some of the more mundane aspects of it.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist.</p><p>TOBEY O'BRIEN SOMMER, MD, TRUIST SECURITIES, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Could you describe some of the occupations that you said are sort of high end now and in greater demand and driving the bill rate increases as well as some of the occupations and categories that are seeing decline?</p><p>DAVID L. DUNKEL: Yes. I would say the decline would be the logical ones that you would think of, which would be more like the support-oriented roles, where somebody really had to be physically on site to help do certain things, so what -- really what we call the lower end of the tech spectrum, which is heavily involved in the operations or the really the day-to-day things where they have to physically be there. That's where we saw some of our fall off. Obviously, when you get into whether it's the help desk and those type support things, those are more capable of being moved to remote. But in terms of the skill set, the acceleration, I'd really say, Tobey, what it's really been is it's not anything new that we're doing. We're just doing a little bit more in some of the higher-end skill areas. A lot of the people that are in the UI/UX area with heavy understanding of mobility that can come in and really from an architect standpoint, so really help evolve things versus just laying code or something of that nature. And so I'd say that's just one area where we've seen some of the shift mix take place. And then you also -- this has driven a lot of need for your project managers, your program managers, which, again, are areas where we've always played, but as a percentage of our overall makeup, it's becoming a little bit larger percentage. So that's what's driving up some of the bill rates.</p><p>TOBEY O'BRIEN SOMMER: With respect to the managed services growth you said accelerating faster, could you quantify that? Do you think that you're going to be able to grow your business there organically sufficient to meet your longer-term goals?</p><p>DAVID L. DUNKEL: Yes. And I think I said this in the past is we're totally confident that we can obtain our goals organically. However, that doesn't mean that we're not going to look for the right opportunity that could accelerate some of our move into a given skill area. So we have -- we were and we still continue to look at strategic opportunities on that front. We just haven't found the right fit. So the good news is that we don't have to do anything from an acquisition standpoint to hit the targets that we've laid out there. However, if the right opportunity comes about, it's a good cultural fit, they're in the right skill areas that are going to allow us to accelerate within an area that we've already designated that we see long-term market opportunities, then we're going to pursue those.</p><p>TOBEY O'BRIEN SOMMER: And could you quantify what sort of growth rate the faster acceleration was in the business here recently?</p><p>DAVID L. DUNKEL: It's significantly more than our core Tech business has grown. We haven't broke that -- we haven't broke that segment out nor have we reported growth rates because to talk to about a growth rate without understanding what the revenue base is, is kind of meaningless.</p><p>TOBEY O'BRIEN SOMMER: Okay. Curious, in the F&amp;A side, you've certainly shielded what otherwise would be kind of a downside in the core Flex business. Do you think you've got something structural in place that can shield a downturn? Or did you just kind of land a great contract? How should we think about that over the course of time?</p><p>DAVID L. DUNKEL: Yes, I think I mentioned it earlier, and it was in my opening comments as well. The opportunities that present themselves were from past relationships on business that was won by partners that we had worked with in various other disaster recovery relief programs. So it was the right place, right time. Part of that was the strategic relationship and our ability to deliver at scale. So obviously, they wanted to trust a partner that they knew that if they were to push this amount of work that it was going to get delivered upon in very compressed time lines just because of the pace that was required because of the nature of the crisis to get people on board. But in terms of structurally, as we look forward, and I had mentioned this in one of the questions that was asked earlier, we're really looking at our FA footprint to try and create as much synergies with our Tech footprint as possible, because there's this whole gray zone that sits between the finance organization and the tech organization that's blending. And those are the areas that we see the long-term prospects for us, as Kforce, just because of the nature of our Tech footprint, what we're doing in Tech and then how that can transcend into other areas within an organization outside of the IT organization into the CFO organization, into the CMO organization, because, again, everybody is looking at how do I get after this data and how do I leverage this data, and there's a lot of finance expertise that's required there as well as a lot of technology expertise to make those things come together.</p><p>TOBEY O'BRIEN SOMMER: If I can just sneak one last one in. With respect to your capital deployment, I'm curious why you're paying down the debt given how resilient the top line has been and not just buying back stock?</p><p>DAVID M. KELLY: Yes. I think, Tobey, one, I think, important, we're continuing to make investments as well to grow the business, right? So we've got the opportunity to do that, whether that be technology or otherwise. And I think for us, where we are today, we think caution in being -- discretion is a better part of our here in these uncertain times. It's as simple as that.</p><p>JOSEPH J. LIBERATORE: Yes. I would just complement or comment on that as well. Tobey, if you look at what's happened, I mean, with the recent outbreak accelerating again, there's still some question as to whether there's going to be a second derivative and a fall outbreak. So we're going to play a conservative at this point, unless something is so compelling that we need to act on it because it's still going to give us all the power that we would need to do something. So as we'll watch over these next 2 quarters or so to get a sense for where this is going, we'll be able to give greater clarity.</p><p>OPERATOR: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to David Dunkel for any further remarks.</p><p>DAVID L. DUNKEL: Well, thank you. It's been an amazing time. And I just want to take this opportunity again to congratulate our team and thank our team. You guys were spectacular. And for our customers and our consultants, amazing resiliency. The word unprecedented doesn't really do justice to what we just went through in this quarter. Yet at the same time, as we look ahead to Q3, we're really excited about all the good things that are happening. And the resiliency of Kforce and just the talent in our team are just such an encouragement to all of us. So thank you. And so for the rest of you all on the investment side, thank you for your interest and support for Kforce. And certainly unprecedented times, and thank you for your support and standing with us. And we're excited actually about what lies ahead, and we'll be diligent stewards of Kforce in the future. Thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Martin Mucci, please go ahead.</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, PAYCHEX, INC.: Thank you, and thank you for joining us for a discussion of the Paychex Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2019. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about 1 month.</p><p>On today's call, I will review the business highlights for the second quarter, Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2020, and then we'll open it up for your questions.</p><p>Financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 reflect good progress on our key initiatives. Total revenue growth was 15% for the quarter, management solutions revenue grew 6% and PEO and insurance services revenues grew 57%, including the results from the Oasis acquisition.</p><p>We have been investing significantly in the area of sales, marketing, service and technology. These investments are paying dividends as we've seen continued momentum in new sales, efficiencies, in operations and the introduction of new and enhanced products. Paychex is being known much more as a provider of innovative HR technology solutions than ever before. Our investments in demand generation and sales are contributing to solid growth in new sales revenue and in particular, we are pleased with the strong performance of the mid-market space aided by greater attachment of our broad suite of HCM SaaS-based software solutions, such as our time and attendance and HR administration products. We are now in the main selling season. We believe we are well positioned for continued momentum.</p><p>We are also continuing to experience improved efficiencies in our operations through the use of self-service functionalities and our robotic process automation efforts. By automating more routine processes, we are reducing operating costs and providing more time for more high value client service interactions with our team. The evidence of high-quality service by our teams is demonstrated by our client retention and satisfaction scores, which remain consistent with record-high levels. We have seen continued increases in Net Promoter Scores, most notably in the mid-market space.</p><p>Let me touch briefly on what we are seeing in the small business environment. The Paychex IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch showed hourly earnings growth at its highest level since 2011, while job growth has been holding steady. Wage increases are beginning to reflect the tight labor market for small businesses. The constant battle for talent highlights the importance of having a partner like Paychex, who can provide solutions to simplify HR recruiting and on-boarding and a competitive benefits package to attract and retain top talent. We are currently operating in an unpredictable regulatory environment. Compliance with the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape is one of the many reasons employers choose Paychex for their HR needs. We're proud of our leadership role within the industry, partnering with regulatory agencies, keeping our clients informed and quickly updating our systems to be in compliance and support changes as they become effective.</p><p>Just this month, the IRS released the final version of the new Form W-4 to be used by all new employees and for all adjustments effective January 1, 2020. By remaining actively engaged with the IRS and providing feedback throughout their process, we were able to have the new forms and related calculations integrated into our systems within minutes of the issuance by the IRS. The workplace continues to evolve both in technology and the way people work. And we are very proud that Paychex has been included on the Fortune Magazine's future 50 list of companies that are best positioned for long-term growth. In addition to solid financial results, Paychex was recognized for its commitment to innovative technology offerings designed to meet the needs of the evolving workplace. We continue to focus on enhancing our product offerings and the use of technology to remain a leader in this industry.</p><p>Last quarter at HR Tech, we discussed some of the newest products being introduced. This month, we launched one of those products, Pay-on-Demand, which enables workers to access wages they have already earned before payday. This pay option is a great tool for recruitment and retention of talent as it allows employees to be paid when they want, allowing flexibility -- more flexibility than the traditional weekly, biweekly or monthly pay schedule. Other companies in the industry offer similar services on a smaller scale, but our solution is unique in that it provides our clients flexible payment options, including direct deposit, pay card and digital payment into Amazon or PayPal accounts; however the client employee wants it.</p><p>The other exciting products we demonstrated at HR Tech are progressing on track and will be launching in the coming months. We continue to focus our investments in emerging technologies such as wearables, real-time payments, product integrations, data analytics and artificial intelligence.</p><p>We are proud that Paychex' commitment to tech innovation has been recognized by industry experts. We were very proud to earn the awesome New Technologies for HR award at the HR Technology Conference &amp; Expo in October. This recognizes the enhancements and increased flexibility of our Paychex Flex service product. We were also named to the HRExaminer 2020 watch list for artificial intelligence and HR. This recognized our innovation using AI tools and machine learning to strengthen existing operations. Our Flex Assistant chatbot currently answers over 200 commonly asked questions, spanning the Flex suite of products and seamlessly integrates with real-time live chat capability with a Paychex service agent 7/24/365 days a year.</p><p>In addition, we have intelligent tools within Flex architecture that deliver a more personalized user experience through learning individual user preferences over time. That can be listing out how to do something or even watching now short videos to learn how to use the Flex product. Paychex Flex also won a gold award for excellence in technology from Brandon Hall Group in the category of best advance in HR or workforce management technology for small and midsized businesses. This is the fourth straight year that Paychex Flex has been honored with a technology excellence award, which validates our tech vision, investment in that vision and the value tech brings to our clients. We are proud of the experience our Flex platform (inaudible) and their employees enhanced through automation we have built into the application based on individual patterns and preferences.</p><p>We also continue to see increased utilization of our industry-leading, 5-star rated mobile app. During the quarter, we experienced an increase of over 50% in the number of mobile sessions and a 35% increase in the number of mobile-only users. This increased mobile usage by clients and their employees has led to efficiencies internally and higher Net Promoter Scores. We are serving clients and their employees the way they want to be served.</p><p>Shifting to our PEO business. The acquisition of Oasis was the largest acquisition in our history and doubled the number of worksite employees we serve in our PEO. As with any significant acquisition, the integration efforts can cause some initial disruption in sales cadence and some operating inefficiencies as we realize the expected synergies. As we discussed last quarter, we realized some of this in the first part of this fiscal year as we went through that process.</p><p>That has led to slower-than-anticipated revenue growth for the year. However, we believe we are in a good position now as we progress with full sales rep headcount and our operation teams continue to focus on what's most important. That is serving our clients and providing them the right combinations of solutions to help them succeed. We are excited about the continued strong demand for PEO services in the markets that we serve.</p><p>In summary, we continue to focus on growing our business by making things simple for our clients. Our innovative technology allows us to service our clients in a way that they want, when they want and where they want. We're focused on continuing to introduce innovations to our technology-enabled service to improve business efficiency and drive even more value for our clients. Our full suite of HR solutions has been the recipe for growth and positions us for continued growth going forward. The efforts of our employees and our commitment to our clients are definitely making a difference. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA, SENIOR VP, CFO &amp; TREASURER, PAYCHEX, INC.: Thanks, Marty, and thanks to everyone on the call. I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements, refer to the customary disclosures. In addition, I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures, such as EBITDA, et cetera, again, refer to our investor presentation, press release for a reconciliation of second quarter to related GAAP measures. I'll begin by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter, and then I'll follow up with some greater detail in certain areas and wrap up with a review of the fiscal 2020 outlook.</p><p>As you saw, total revenue growth was 15% for the second quarter; Oasis contributed approximately a little bit less than 9% to this growth. Expenses increased 18% for the second quarter to $649 million. Similar to last quarter, increases in compensation-related costs, PEO direct insurance costs and amortization of intangible assets contributed total expense growth. Total expense growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of Oasis. Operating income increased 11% to $342 million.</p><p>Operating margin was 34.5% for the second quarter, and EBITDA increased 16%, and EBITDA margin was approximately 40% for the quarter. The EBITDA margin increased slightly compared to a year ago, while operating margin declined due to the amortization of intangibles associated with the Oasis acquisition, as you all know.</p><p>Other expense net for the second quarter of $5 million includes interest expense of approximately $8 million related to long-term borrowings.</p><p>As a reminder, we borrowed $800 million bonds to fund a portion of the Oasis purchase price. The effective tax rate was 23.2% for the second quarter compared to 23.8% for the same period last year. Net income increased 10% to $259 million and adjusted net income increased 8% to $254 million. Diluted earnings per share were up 11% to $0.72 for the second quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.70.</p><p>We received a little over $0.01 of benefit from stock-based comp payments during the second quarter, which is included for GAAP, but we exclude it for adjusted diluted EPS.</p><p>Let me provide some additional color in certain areas. Total service revenue was up, as I said, to $971 million, 15%. Within service revenue, management solutions revenue increased 6% to $727 million, and PEO and insurance services increased 57% to $244 million. Management solutions revenue growth of 6%, which actually exceeded our expectations, included a contribution from Oasis of slightly less than 1%. The remaining growth was primarily driven by increases in our client bases across many of our services, along with growth in revenue per client. Revenue per client improved as a result of higher price realization and increased penetration of our suite of solutions, particularly time and attendance, retirement services and HR outsourcing, and this has been a focus of our efforts over the last several years. And if you chart our growth in revenue per client, you've seen a pretty steady increase. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value participant funds. PEO and insurance services revenue growth of 57% was largely due to the acquisition of Oasis, which contributed 47% to this growth.</p><p>In addition, the increase reflects growth in clients and client worksite employees across our existing PEO business. Insurance services revenue benefited from an increase in the number of health and benefit applicants, partially offset by the impact of softness in workers' compensation premiums, as we've been discussing all year.</p><p>Interest on funds held for clients increased 9% for the second quarter to $20 million, primarily as a result of higher realized gain, average investment balances and interest rates. Funds held for clients' average investment balances were impacted by wage inflation and increases within our base, offset by changes in client base mix and timing of collections and remittances.</p><p>Turning to our investment portfolio. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield now of 2.1%, average duration of 3.1 years. Our combined portfolios earned an average rate of return of 2% for the second quarter, up from 1.9% last year.</p><p>Quickly looking at year-to-date results, total revenues up 15% to $2 billion. Service revenue, up 15% to $1.9 billion, with management solutions reflecting growth of 6% to $1.5 billion. PEO and insurance is reflecting growth of 57% to $491 million. Interest on funds has grown 14% to $40 million. Operating income, up 10% to $691 million and net income and diluted earnings per share each increased 9% to $523 million and $1.45 per share, respectively. Adjusted net income increased 7% to $511 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.42 per share.</p><p>Let me walk through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash, total corporate investments of $708 million. As of the end of the quarter, funds held for clients were $3.7 billion compared to $3.8 billion as of the end of last year, May 31, 2019. Funds held for clients, as you know, very widely on a day-to-day basis, and averaged $3.7 billion for the second quarter.</p><p>Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $39 million as of the end of the quarter compared with $20 million as of the end of last year, May 31, 2019. Total stockholders' equity was $2.6 billion as of November 30, 2019, reflecting $444 million in dividends paid and $172 million of shares repurchased during the first 6 months. Return on equity for the past 12 months has been a stellar 42%.</p><p>Cash flows from operations were $565 million for the first 6 months, a robust increase of 14% from the same period last year. So strong performance on cash flow. The increase was primarily driven by higher net income and noncash adjustments. Increase in noncash adjustments was primarily due to higher amortization expense, largely driven by intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of Oasis.</p><p>Let me talk about 2020 guidance. I remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes. Though we have reflected the impact of the 3 interest rate cuts that have already occurred this fiscal year, I'll provide our current outlook and some color on a couple of areas.</p><p>We provided update to the guidance, as you saw. Our management solutions revenue has been trending positively. And now, we anticipate it to grow in the range of 5% to 5.5%. This is raised from the previous guidance of approximately 5% growth, and we're doing well in almost all of the buckets that comprise that revenue stream.</p><p>PEO and insurance services are now anticipated to grow in the range of 25% to 30%. As Marty previously mentioned, we got off to a slow start with the Oasis, slower than we anticipated. We still maintain a strong long-term outlook and continue to execute on our plans to integrate our PEO business. Interest on funds held for clients is now anticipated to grow approximately 4%, modified from a range of 4% to 8% we started the year, and this simply reflects the most recent federal fund rate cuts. And diluted earnings per share growth has been increased to a range of 9% to 10% growth, raised from our guidance of approximately 9%. Other guidance remains unchanged as followed: total revenue, 10% to 11%; operating income as a percent of total revenue, approximately 36%; EBIT margin for the full year expected to be approximately 41%; effective income tax rate expected to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%; net income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are all expected to grow at approximately 9% for fiscal 2020.</p><p>Now let me provide a little color on the back half of the year. As I indicated, PEO and insurance revenues are now anticipated to grow in the range of 25% to 30%. While the second quarter results were within the range provided, 56% to 60%, we have taken a more conservative approach for the back half of the year given our current trends. In particular, we've continued to experience lower compensation -- lower workers' compensation insurance rate that have moderate our insurance -- moderated our insurance services growth. We anticipate that this trend will likely ease as we enter the next fiscal year. We're also seeing modestly lower at-risk insurance attachment in the PEO.</p><p>In addition, this change reflects impacts from the slower start from the Oasis acquisition. We now anticipate that growth for the third quarter of PEO and insurance will be approximately 10%. Management solutions guidance was increased to a range of 5%, 5.5% growth from our previous guidance of approximately 5% due to favorable trends that we've seen in the first half of fiscal 2020. This incorporates the higher-than-anticipated growth achieved in the second quarter and assumes that third quarter will come in the full year range.</p><p>I refer you to Slide 16 in our investor presentation, which shows the impact of the reclass in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 of an immaterial amount of Oasis revenue. Please note that the as-adjusted numbers on this slide represent the base on which we apply the growth rates we are guiding to in management solutions and PEO and insurance revenues. And the reason I call that out is when I look at your models, 2/3 of you do it that way, and 1/3 have split between third and fourth quarter. Please look at that number, so that you can adjust your models correctly.</p><p>Operating margins, which for the full year anticipated -- for the full year, are anticipated to be approximately 36%, do vary quarterly. Our margins for the second quarter exceeded the guidance we provided in the last call, which was a range of 33% to 34%. That beat was impacted by delays in hiring related to the tight labor market. We still anticipate margins of approximately 38% for the back half of the year. We expect to continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing in the back half of the year while still achieving our target of a full year operating margin of approximately 36%.</p><p>And with all that, I'll turn the call back over to Martin.</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Thank you, Efrain. We'll now open the call to questions, please.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays.</p><p>RAMSEY CLARK EL-ASSAL, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to ask about the trend and the lower workers' comp insurance rates, and I just was trying to get an idea of your visibility to how those rates trend. How do you -- what gives you confidence about those rates over time going into next year? I think you indicated sort of becoming more favorable. What type of reads do you gain on that rate?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Well, I'd say a couple things. One is that because we had an insurance agency and our pricing policies on a virtually daily basis, we get a sense -- a pretty clear sense of where that pricing is trending. That's one part. The second is it's influenced by what state Workers' Compensation Board, where they're setting pricing, and we know we have a pretty good sense of what states are contemplating or have contemplated changes in workers' compensation insurance. So I think the combination of those, and then the final thing is we're looking at the mix of revenue quarter-by-quarter, and we know that we started the year with a strong compare, and it starts to ease as we get into the back half year a little bit.</p><p>RAMSEY CLARK EL-ASSAL: Got it. Okay. And then could you talk about your retention trends and the degree to which those trends are, I would imagine, moving in the right direction, giving you confidence in terms of raising the management solutions segment guidance for the year?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. We're continuing to see pretty much near-record levels on retention across both small and midsized clients. We're seeing very good retention numbers, and so they've been very solid. And you know how conservative we are, as we look forward, we still think they're going to -- we're going to maintain that going forward. So we feel that the value of the products, obviously, and along with the needs of the clients during this -- particularly this kind of tight labor market, I think are really keeping the retention. And we're not seeing out of businesses really increase either. So all -- both from an environment and from our performance, I think are both keeping our retention numbers at record levels.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p><p>KEVIN DAMIEN MCVEIGH, MD, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Seems like the organic growth, particularly in managed services, is settling in at higher levels despite much tough comps. Can you just frame out like how much of that is retention? Because -- and Marty, I know you mentioned kind of maintaining those levels. Is it possible you kind of set a new level based on more the SaaS offering as opposed to the traditional service? So maybe just the sensitivity on SaaS for service, and what that can do to the retention over the course of time?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I think it certainly does. I think we're appealing to the clients the way they want to be served, as I mentioned earlier, and their employees. The employees are playing a pretty strong role these days, more than, I think, ever in the past. As you see the mobile app, 70% of the usage of the mobile app is the employee of the client. And so they're having a bigger impact on retention, and we started talking about that a couple of years ago.</p><p>So I think that, that does have an opportunity. The issue, though, is still when you see improvement, particularly on the small client bases, there are so many businesses that go out of business every year, and we've been in this a long time, and it hasn't changed that dramatically. So what I think where you do have room for improvement is certainly from a service value standpoint. I think the need for clients' small businesses, midsized businesses to have software-as-a-service, to have mobile apps, to have self-service available to their employees, all those things are making them more valuable and stickier, I would say, to a client.</p><p>So we certainly see some -- we're optimistic, but we still also know that so many businesses start-up and go out of business on the small end.</p><p>KEVIN DAMIEN MCVEIGH: And then just to follow up on that, Marty, real quick. If it's -- if you're bumping up at that 82% level, any sense of how much of that is failures versus maybe other parts that are driving the attrition?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: I think if you put all together, kind of no employees, out of business, bought or acquired, it's typically been 50%-plus a little bit. So that accounts for about half of it, and a little bit more even sometimes, and then the other pieces are price and it's still just as competitive as it's always been, hasn't really increased. But that number has been pretty consistent and then service value kind of stuff. So I'd say 50% to 60%, if you rolled all those things together, are kind of out-of-control type of thing.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of James Berkley with Wolfe Research.</p><p>JAMES ROBERT BERKLEY, RESEARCH ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH, LLC: So just a quick question on the PEO side. Would it be possible just to break out in more detail, just kind of that segment, PEO and insurance separately? How bookings have been trending on the PEO side? And maybe how much of the guidance drop was attributable to Oasis, which you expect to turn around?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Well, let me start, and I'll have Efrain jump in. I think what we've seen there is, one, we have our -- we think the market is still very strong for PEO in particular. So the demand continues to be strong. You're still seeing a very tight labor market, so they're looking for help in recruiting and retaining employees. They're looking for benefit packages that will retain employees and HR, kind of mobile app and strength to not only recruit but retain in that mid-market -- small-ended market. The other thing is that the integration of Oasis certainly has impacted this somewhat. We got off to a slower start. We mentioned it in the first quarter last year. We really began the active integration around June, so about 6 months ago. And once we started aligning underwriting procedures, sales comp models, service processes and those things, it kind of slowed our sales cadence down at Oasis, and it was definitely impacted by underwriting. We've always been very tight on the underwriting side. We wanted the processes to be very tight, and so that gave a slower ramp-up to the sales, and then we had to ramp up the sales headcount, and that was a little slower than we expected. Now we're at that full -- near that full ramp-up of the sales headcount, and also, we got through a couple of insurance renewals. It's always important to kind of see where we're coming out for the first time with a major integration like that with insurance renewals, and we came through fine. But that and the underwriting, I think certainly, it impacted some existing clients. Now that all -- we're that -- we're through that, we have a much better sense of the first year of Oasis and where we're going to come out for this first fiscal year -- the remainder of the first fiscal year. We think the market is very strong. Our organic PEO business, non-acquisition, was very strong year-to-date. And so we feel still very strong about it. We just got off to a slower start than we thought, and that's going to impact the full year's performance.</p><p>JAMES ROBERT BERKLEY: I guess asked another way, if it's okay, would -- if you didn't do the Oasis acquisition, would have organic PEO growth been in line with expectations? Like would that have been unchanged?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: I think it would have been pretty much unchanged. I mean when you look -- because we feel very -- we're actually performing -- sales have been stronger than we expected in our organic PEO business. And so yes, I think it would have been stronger. I mean this is -- we really feel like this is kind of around first part of the integration, and although we've had the company -- we purchased the company in December, we kind of let the fiscal year play out. We had a number of things we were organizing around, running some synergies than in our beginning of our fiscal year, we kind of put new processes in place. And frankly it had a little bit stronger impact than we thought in slowing things down from a sales and even retention perspective. Now we've kind of got that turned around, and we just wanted to make sure we're conservative kind of on the rest of the year and how that'll come out. But we feel very good about the market, and yes, it would have been stronger. If you just look at without the integration, we certainly would have been above, I think, our expectations on PEO-only side.</p><p>JAMES ROBERT BERKLEY: That's great to hear. And obviously doing really well on the merchant -- I mean on the management solutions side as well. And so just last question on that point. Just given the tight labor market, any thoughts -- incremental thoughts on kind of where we are in the economic cycle? How you think about things like labor participation rate, how much slack there might be left in that? And room for you guys to run on the small business side?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I think we're still feeling pretty strongly about how the market is -- how the market outlook is. The optimism still, it bounces around a little bit, business optimism, but what we're seeing is the wage increases are the highest, as I said, since 2011, from small businesses under 50 employees. This is what's in that watch. And the hours worked are up also for the highest in like 3 years. So we look at that as demand for the employees. So the business is -- the toughest thing for small, in particular, small, but midsize businesses right now is, I can't find the people to finish -- to get the work done for the demand I have. That, to me, points to a pretty strong economy still, and that's how it feels to us. When hours worked are up and the wages are up, it's because, hey, I've got the demand and -- from client -- from customers that want that. So I think that's very good. The tariffs and the trade issues, we've seen impact roughly 1/3, maybe 25% to 1/3 of small businesses. Most of those are much more regional, and so they're not going to be impacted by that. The 1/3 -- 25% or 1/3 that are impacted by tariffs and so forth have had a harder time, but most small businesses are not impacted by that.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT, SENIOR MD, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Good to see the strength in bookings in the quarter. Could you perhaps dimension the rate of growth that you've seen, Marty, both in the small business managed solutions market and also mid-market? And then you called out strength from a macro standpoint. Any additional color about which solutions are getting the most traction, where you think you might be gaining market share?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I think one, retirement continues to be very strong, and I think the SECURE Act, I think most of you probably know, got through the House yesterday and it's headed for the Senate. If that gets approved, that's giving tax credits for new retirement plans. And I think that would continue to be a boost for small businesses starting retirement plans. And we continue to be just very solid on retirement services, both what we would call large market and small market, generally are doing very well. Time and attendance, when you think about the overtime changes that have been recently made in providing overtime to more, it's hitting more employees of our clients. Time and attendance continues to be very strong double-digit growth as well. And we're -- we try to stay -- we've really stayed, I think, ahead of even the market from a technology standpoint. So it's not just the old punch cards, it's finger scan, which has now gone to eye scan, which has gone to face scan, and now wearables, we'll be introducing very soon that you can punch in and punch out on your on your watch. And these are all things that are being demanded by clients. So I think time and attendance, retirement, certainly HR overall, and the technology that goes with that, meaning I want to see data analytics that help me as a small or midsized business compared to other businesses. We have that database that other clients -- our other businesses don't have. We can use data from 600,000-plus clients that say, hey, here's what your turnover looks like compared to others, here's what your wages look like. So I think data analytics in HR and all of those things all are pretty strong. And so overall, we see pretty good growth. Now we're heading into -- we're in the selling season, so it's too early. We really need third quarter to kind of give us that look on sales. But so far, year-to-date sales have been good, and particularly in the mid-market, we feel very strong about the pickup that the products have done in the marketplace.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>STEVEN MATTHEW WALD, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: So just maybe going through the pieces of the revenue guide. I know you guys didn't change the overall revenue guidance. But if I look at your adjusted numbers, I believe, Efrain, we talked about this after last quarter, the 2 different adjustments you made there and sort of map out those pieces of your segment guidance. Sort of getting to a 9% to 11% range, at the bottom and top end of those pieces added together, is that generally how we should be thinking about it? It sort of seems like at the midpoint, you'd be at the low end of your prior 10% to 11% guidance, that's not changed.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. I don't think you're far off, Steven. I think that, that's fair.</p><p>STEVEN MATTHEW WALD: Okay. Cool. I just wanted to make sure I understood that. And then -- because I know this caused some questions last quarter. The Oasis components, I know that you reclassified a piece of it last quarter as to how to think about it. But I think in the press release, you said it added about 1% to the management solution. So should we think about it as Oasis minus $7 million to $8 million is all in the PEO and the rest goes into management solutions?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. I'd have to -- I'm doing mental math really quickly. I think it's a little bit lower, maybe $6 million to $7 million, but I'm not looking at the detail, but I don't think that's far off.</p><p>STEVEN MATTHEW WALD: Okay. Yes. Just wanted to make sure I was clear on those things.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.</p><p>ANDREW OWEN NICHOLAS, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just wanted to talk a little bit about technology in the PEO business. I was wondering if you could talk maybe about your plans for Oasis, and maybe even HROI from a tech perspective. Are both businesses still running on a third-party software? Or are there plans to transition to an internal proprietary software in the near to medium term? And then maybe relatedly, I was just wondering if you could maybe speak to big tech capabilities of your PEO business relative to the competition?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I think the capabilities -- well, first of all, yes, they're both on third party and license software. And so far, that seems to be going very well. So we're watching that closely, but we're not looking to necessarily move to any quick integration or client conversion to disrupt the base or anything like that.</p><p>So we think that the third-party software is doing fine, and in fact, gets upgraded pretty consistently, and so we feel good about that. The integration, we're tying it in as much as possible to our products as well.</p><p>So I think the technology that we're focused on with the HROI and Oasis is how to tie it into our -- for our retirement integration, into our retirement, time and attendance and so forth, so that they can benefit most from those products, and that's going well. And so we'll determine over time whether it makes sense to get them to our PEO in-house product or not. I think you never want to necessarily move clients through a conversion if you don't have to and if that's taking care of it, we're still continuing to watch that. It's not a focus right now. Our technology on the PEOs that we feel is very competitive. We can see, as I said, the demand is good in the street, and we're selling well, particularly on the organic side, if you look kind of non-acquisition and integration, we're doing very well on the organic PEO, and in fact, are ahead of sales. So I think our product is performing very well competitively in the marketplace.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Just to add a little bit more color there, Andrew. So our -- we run on both the Flex platform for our PEO business and we also run on a third-party software, which many of you know what it is. But it's a customized instance of that software. So there have been a lot of upgrades and adjustments -- enhancements made to that system. And I think the challenge, as Marty mentioned, is with those customizations and enhancements over time, we want to figure out what the right decision is in terms of bringing all one -- on our internal platform, and that will take a little time to sort out.</p><p>ANDREW OWEN NICHOLAS: Makes sense. That's very helpful. And then maybe sticking with the PEO space. Just wondering if you could update us on your appetite for M&amp;A there. And maybe more broadly, how you would characterize pricing in this space? And last thing there would be, does some of the slower-than-expected start with Oasis tied to kind of integration issues change that appetite at all?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. Let me start at the end and go back. I think, yes, with any integration, when you update -- and they -- and remember, Oasis has had a number of companies as well, and so we had to go across the number of companies that they had acquired as well. We wanted to be sure that we felt comfortable with all the underwriting processes, the sales comp models, getting tighter process on service. When we pull all that stuff together, you have some consternation that goes on and some slower ramp-up of hiring of the sales folks, et cetera. And we really think that was tied to just getting things all aligned, and we really didn't push those things until about June into the summer, and so that put us a little bit behind this year as far as starting out. So think it was really geared around that.</p><p>M&amp;A, still very interested. Certainly always looking at what opportunities are there. From a -- when you talk about pricing, if it's pricing of the M&amp;A, the valuations are still, I think, pretty high, but it all depends. There's so many PEOs, it's such a fragmented environment, but there's a lot of opportunity, I think, out there, and we're just trying to make sure that we get the right valuations. From a pricing -- from the market standpoint, I think we're extremely competitive. I don't think the competition in that market has changed very much, and I think we're very competitive, and we're seeing that by being above sales -- our sales forecast in the first part of the year with our organic PEO. So where there's no distractions or anything at the beginning of the first half of the year, we've seen very good sales results from our organic PEO.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG, MD IN US EQUITY RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to ask a follow-up, just on Oasis. Just so we have the numbers right. I think originally, the expectation was for Oasis to generate $335 million to $375 million in revenue this year. Can you just help us get a sense of what the new range would look like, obviously just given the integration challenges that you talked about?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: I think, Jason, we're still in that range, but we're certainly towards the lower end of that range.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: Okay. Got it. And then just on the sales force side of Oasis. I mean, I guess as you went through the integration process, was there any unexpected uptick in voluntary turnover among Oasis salespeople?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes, Jason, I think we lost a few. It was a very -- we started making changes to underwriting process and sales comp and things like that at the beginning. It's pretty minor number. But we lost a few, because at the same time you had some PE firms buying up a couple of other small companies that were trying to attract sales reps. So I think we lost a few. I wouldn't say it was -- it was not a big number, and then that put us a little behind ramping up the sales force to the number that we wanted, which we're back at now. So that's a bit of what we encountered at the beginning.</p><p>JASON ALAN KUPFERBERG: Okay. And then just a final clarification, Efrain. Just on the EPS side, I know, because there's a couple of EPSs out there. So diluted EPS, you did uptick, but your adjusted EPS growth expectations are unchanged, correct? And I think that's the number you focus on more.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: That's correct. Because -- yes, that's reflecting -- well, we focused on both, Jason, but that's reflecting taxes. I mean look, I get the question frequently, why do you guys call that out? I think in an effort to be transparent about what we think is underlying operating performance and what's underlying financial performance. Underlying operating performance, we exclude the impact of stock comp. Not everyone does, we do. And then financial performance is what it is. So that's what we're trying to be clear on.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG, SENIOR ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: The ancillary services. Can you give us an update on penetration from the services like time attendance and retirement services? How much more room is there to go?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Tien-Tsin, sorry for the mispronunciation, but for some reason, at the beginning of the question, we didn't -- you didn't come in.</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: You cut out. Yes.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: So we didn't hear the full question. So to answer it, if you -- could you repeat it? You mind repeating it?</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Yes. No, happy to. Hopefully, this is a little better. Just the penetration rate of some of the ancillary services? Like time and attendance, retirement services, I think both were called out as being positive. Where are you in that?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. We're definitely picking up. We don't give detailed penetration rates on those, but we definitely are picking up penetration across the baseline time and attendance, retirement continues to go up. The other thing on retirement that has been very helpful to us is in the mobile app, we've not -- we have released probably 6 months ago, where you could sign up on the mobile app, I think I've talked about it before, as opposed to all of the paper that employees of our clients would go through. So the participation rate is up and that's now retaining more 401(k) clients that otherwise would have dropped out because they didn't have the correct participation of their employee base. So we're -- not only are the sales stronger, but the retention of 401(k) and retirement is stronger as well. Health and benefit insurance up -- ticking up a bit as well. Of course, we're still strong on the insurance side, and we've linked the PEO to our agency. Being a top-20 agency we have -- if you don't qualify for underwriting in the PEO, we take you over to the insurance agency to write you. We have a very unique offering at that point by the ability to do that. So I think all have picked up pretty strongly. Those are certainly the best that I can think of right off hand right now.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. So Tien-Tsin, we fully update those at year-end. But I think just to underscore what Marty said, we're trending above where we ended last year. And if you look at it from a revenue standpoint and break out the revenue on each of those areas that we called out time and attendance, HR and retirement services, those are trending above where management solutions as a whole is growing. So we're experiencing good results. And by the way, just want to make sure that it's clear. That is our strategy. Our strategy is to approach a client and sell them on the full bundle, which is why we present the revenue in the way we do.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Right. Yes. No, it's been clear you want to drive up revenue per. So I get that. So just as a quick follow-up then. And I know, Marty, you mentioned -- I remember last quarter you talked about improving enrollment on 401(k), what have you. So sensitivity to AUM and asset value, given some of the move up here, I'm curious is there an update or any rule of thumb we can use? Because the equity market has been strong, it sounds like that that's helping you quite a bit here, maybe.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. That's a good question. So it's really assets under administration, Tien-Tsin. We'll have to come back. It's not a huge number, so we wouldn't anticipate a significant change. But in the back half of the year, as we get into -- thinking a little bit about next year, we'll talk about it. Right now, I don't think it would be a significant -- unless it was something dramatic in the market, wouldn't be significant, in the order of pennies in terms of EPS, but we'll update as we go through the year.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.</p><p>BRYAN CONNELL KEANE, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes, to me, it sounds like the Oasis, a little bit of an integration challenges, more onetime in nature. So I'm trying to think about what the normalized organic growth rate for Oasis might be post 1 year out?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. So when we bought them, people asked me this, they were growing kind of mid- to upper-single digits organically. That's where they were. They -- we expect that we will be able to bump that growth rate with additional salespeople. Obviously, as Marty mentioned, we're off to a slow start there. But our expectation is we can get it growing above those rates in the future. We've got to get through this year, get through the disruption of this year.</p><p>BRYAN CONNELL KEANE: Yes. Guessing that the growth rate this year will be a little bit below their historical average as a result?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. It will.</p><p>BRYAN CONNELL KEANE: Yes. And then 1 follow-up I had on the revenue per client increase. It also sounded like you're getting a little bit of higher price realization. Just trying to figure, is that normal higher prices? Or is that something that you're seeing a little bit different, a little bit more pricing power than usual?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: I think we've had a little bit more pricing power this year than other years. I think that we do a lot of work on the analytics side to understand how to price each client. I think we've done a good job on the pricing side to do that. So you hope every year, there's opportunities to do it. Obviously, we hope to hold that kind of pricing power, but every year brings another set of challenges. And it also depends on competition. So while I think the level of competitive intensity remains high, it certainly has dramatically increased. And one thing we haven't talked about, Bryan, which I think is important is we're having a really good year to begin the year in our mid-market business, which also helps management solutions. So a continuation of those trends in the back half of the year going into next year then has a solid, I was going to say buoyant effect. That's a little bit too strong, but a positive effect on management solutions revenue.</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: I think the investments are really paying off that we've made in the product and the technology on the HR side, the mobile app, those things are paying off. And as Efrain said, mid-market is really coming on strong. We've had a couple of years where it wasn't as strong as we would have liked, but we're feeling this year -- well, certainly, we're seeing this year, the first half of the year, and now -- we can tell you more after this quarter, but it feels really solid about the performance there on the sales side and retention side.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.</p><p>KARTIK MEHTA, EXECUTIVE MD, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, PRINCIPAL &amp; EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, NORTHCOAST RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: Efrain, just to maybe get a little bit more color on the pricing comments you made for the payroll business. I'm wondering, from a competition standpoint, have you seen a change, are your competitors getting less aggressive? Or is this strictly a Paychex issue where you're able to raise prices? And maybe the competition for new business is still the same?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: I think it's primarily internal. I think we have -- I think our algorithms internally get better and better every year. And I think we understand what clients are okay with certain price increases and what clients are not. I think you have to be very -- do it with a great -- a lot of care. If you raise prices carelessly, you end up creating shopping behavior. I think the other part is that there are -- I think the strength of our model permits us to understand because of the level of customer intimacy we have, permits us to understand what segments of the client base we can get better pricing out of. So I think it's more internal than it is external, but I think it's important in that equation that the rest of the market is not acting irrationally from a price standpoint.</p><p>KARTIK MEHTA: And then, Marty, just on the PEO M&amp;A question, I know you said obviously, valuations are everywhere. But just from a Paychex standpoint, you said Oasis, you want to get this integration done, maybe it didn't go as smoothly in the beginning as you wanted. Has that slowed down, maybe M&amp;A? Would you wait a little while and get Oasis running to the point you want before you acquire another PEO? Or do you think you're in a position where, if an asset came up, you'd be -- you're ready to acquire it?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: No. I think, Kartik, we're very much in position, and we really feel like Oasis is in good shape now. It was really this kind of first half of the year that was most of the integration, kind of just a lot of changes that we had to make that always cause some slowdown. But I think, no, we're very much ready. And in fact, looking at a number of things today that are out there and available. And no, I think from a management leadership standpoint and our organization. Now we're very much ready. Remember how large -- Oasis was the largest private PEO in the country. So you knew you were going to have some integration there that we had to do more, but as far as everything else from HROI to all the acquisitions we've done, we've had a very solid track record from integrating and then hitting or beating the numbers that we expected from those acquisitions.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS, PARTNER, MOFFETTNATHANSON LLC: First one for me is on the rollout of the Pay-on-Demand product. You called out, I think that you just launched one of them in in the prepared remarks. But if I recall correctly, I think you're launching 2, right, one that's more targeted toward employers and one targeted at employees? Can you just give us a little more color on the exact timing and the monetization models for those 2 products?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. Sure, Lisa. The one we rolled out this month, a few weeks ago, was the one for employees. That was the basically Pay-on-Demand. And as I mentioned, it's an expanded, we think options better than most have out there. This is -- you can not only select when you want the money but not only -- and not only put it in your bank account, but you can put it on a pay card if you want. You can put it in your Amazon account, you can put it in your PayPal account. We think this has the broadest selection of options and flexibility that we've seen in the marketplace and we get a percentage. Obviously, we're doing that with a third party, and we get a percentage of that back into the business. And we think, for the most part, though, that the monetization of that is really in the retention of the clients and their employees that we're adding another thing to get to employees that's going to want them to stay with Paychex, stay with the mobile app, stay with the pay flexibility, et cetera, which is going to be good for the clients in a very tight labor market. In the real-time payments, which is really more geared toward the clients, as you mentioned, that's geared toward the end of the first quarter of the calendar year, as it consistently has. It's right on track, and we feel that we'll be one of the first to offer real-time payments. There will be a charge for that, as we've mentioned in the past. We're still working through all of that in looking at the marketplace and so forth. But as we get closer to rolling that out, on schedule, then we'll -- we can talk about the monetization of it.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Terrific. And then second one for me. Maybe, Marty, can you comment on how the new -- it looks like this, the AB5 law impacting gig workers in California is going to go into effect. Can you comment just on how you see that type of law impacting Paychex? And what -- how you'd handicap your expectation that, that spreads across the country?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I think -- it's funny, 2 years ago, the gig economy was very big and expected to kind of take over employment, and then it really has kind of quieted down to a certain degree. I think those laws and similar ones will come up. I think it's the flexibility that we want to give employees. I think it'll be picked up by states, like you said, like California and New York, places like that first. I think we'll be ready to handle that. And I think, frankly, having a mobile app, having Pay-on-Demand, having flexible retirement plans things like that, we're very well -- we're pretty well geared for that, and we're continuing to look at our product set to see how we can do things more -- even more around an employee versus an employer, which has obviously been our model for many years. So I'd say it's still early stages, but it's still pretty early on the gig economy too, that seem to be the -- it was going to be the wherewithal -- it was going to be everything a few years ago, but it's quieted down. I think we're able to handle some of that now, and we're continuing to look at our product set with our Head of Product to see what else we can do to make it easy and to be able to comply with any new employment laws that come out.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Okay. Great. Yes, and I guess just to like completely clarify. I think this law impacts like workers that'll be classified as like W-2 full-time employees versus ones that are classified as contractors. But you currently essentially cover or process payroll for both of those, right? I mean, does this...</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Yes. Yes. So it's sort of a neutral effect?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. Correct. Neutral effect right now. Yes, that we -- I was thinking more of a wider look at that issue of the whole gig economy, and there's a real opportunity there. But you're right, yes, we cover both of those now, whether they're contractors, 1099s or W-2s, either way.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen.</p><p>BRYAN C. BERGIN, DIRECTOR, COWEN AND COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Wanted to ask on margins, so the maintained margin guide following a good first half here, is there a ramp in the investments absorbing this somewhat in the second half? Or maybe is it a function of just getting Oasis back on the path you expected? Or is it more broad than that? If you can just go into some of the moving pieces?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: I think, Bryan, when you look at first half versus back -- I'm sorry, second half versus first half, the key thing that occurs is that in Q4, you have your highest margin quarter. So you have expenses that are -- that don't ramp anymore because now you've anniversaried Oasis. And so expense growth is more moderate, but then revenue is higher, particularly in the third quarter where margins typically are going -- approaching or above 40%. So I think that's what drives it. That quarter is unique in terms of the amount of revenue that it has, and then the fourth quarter also has a high revenue and expenses aren't ramping along with the revenue in driving margins higher.</p><p>BRYAN C. BERGIN: Okay. I wanted to follow up then also on the on-demand pay product. Can you just talk about some of the early adoption levels on the employee side? And how should we think about the funding mechanisms of these pay products and any potential impacts to the full portfolio?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: No, it's all done through third parties. So there won't be any impacts on our float. We're not taking any of the risk on it or anything else. We're just getting a percentage of the fees that are paid. And it's very early -- Bryan, it's very early in the adoption. I mean we've heard certainly the demand for it, but it just -- we rolled it out a few weeks ago. So it's really too early to say. But there seems to be a great demand for it. And again, I think this is the most full-featured from our full flexibility from an opportunity. So we're anxious to see how it goes. I'd be able to give you a better read after the next quarter.</p><p>BRYAN C. BERGIN: Okay. That's fair. And Efrain, just a last one on Oasis. You lapped acquisition over, I guess part of the third quarter. Anything to call out in the expected contribution of Oasis to 3Q? Anything seasonal in that mix between the 2 segments to note here?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Nothing that's not contemplated in the guidance. Yes, nothing significant.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies.</p><p>SAMAD SALEEM SAMANA, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: So the company has mentioned mid-market strength multiple times in the call this morning. I was curious if maybe you can give us an idea of what the average number of employees for new deals in the quarter look like? Just to see if it's -- how much it's impacting the mix versus the historical average closer to about 16 employees? And then I have 1 follow-up question.</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: It definitely is much larger than that. So it would pull that mix up. We don't normally give that number out, Samad. But I mean it's much -- it's -- I would say look, somewhere between probably 50 to 150, give you a wide range, but the average is somewhere under 100 kind of thing on a client ID perspective. So it's much larger than that 15 or 16. That's what pulls that up.</p><p>SAMAD SALEEM SAMANA: Yes. I guess I was wondering more about what the overall average then would have been for this quarter? Just to kind of get a sense of how much it's pulling up the overall average?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: It's -- right now, it's pretty consistent. So I don't think it's moving it enough. I think we -- I don't know if we really give that out other than annual, if that. But it has some -- I think it would have some adjustment, but not much, pretty consistent.</p><p>SAMAD SALEEM SAMANA: Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-up, as I think about the sales headcount investments that you're making. Is there -- other than the products that you guys have rolled out, as I think about the mid-market, are you also hiring reps that are more geared toward selling to that 50 to 150 employee type of customer? And should we see, as we think about the ramping investments in the back half, should we continue to see that trend in terms of the type of salesperson you're hiring as well?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes, I think we definitely are. We're promoting some from within and from a career path standpoint, and we're always excited about that. And by the way, that market goes anywhere -- I don't want to get you the sense that, that's only to what that market is. That market goes anywhere from 20 -- frankly, 20 or 30 employees these days to 1,000. But I would say it's primarily in that 20 to 500 space, but it goes pretty broad. Yes, we're hiring people with more experience, some from competitors, some from other industries and then promoting some as well from internally, and we'll continue to invest in that. We're pretty much up to full -- up to full hires where we are now, but we're always looking for good people and I think success is helping us, from that standpoint, recruit as well. That always helps.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.</p><p>JEFFREY MARC SILBER, MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: I know the call has been going long. I just had a quick follow-up actually for Efrain. I know you don't give a fiscal '21 guidance. But at least in terms of tax rate, is the tax rate that we're using or you're guiding for this year, is that something we should use for next year as well?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes, Jeff, look, I'm going to say right now, I don't see significant things that would change it. State taxes and stock comp expense move it, but it's probably not a bad proxy right now.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel.</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL GROSSMAN, MD, STIFEL, NICOLAUS &amp; COMPANY, INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: So each of the PEOs reported some issue in the most recent quarter, and while each was different, there was typically some element of health insurance involved. So can you provide some context to -- in contrast to what you're experiencing and what may or may not be happening industry wide?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I guess I'd say, I don't think -- when we look at it, if you looked at retention in particular, and now we're through a couple of renewals, I would say it was a pretty fair -- I think there's always a combination of underwriting and tightening up where we want our performance to be from a medical loss ratio, and we're pretty conservative and careful on that and what we're -- and our underwriting standards. And so I think that had some impact on retention. But I don't think we had any necessarily abnormal impact on the rates that we got themselves. I think we got pretty fair renewals overall from the carriers, and then we have our own self-insured plan. I think we're performing pretty well there, and I don't think the carriers gave us anything that was that difficult. I think we just -- we have a little bit tighter underwriting standard that we wanted to put in place or, I guess, tighter than what -- at least what it was, and that had some impact on some clients. On the other hand, David, the nice thing about us is we can take some of them over then to the insurance agency and write them through the carriers as opposed to taking the underwrite -- or the -- some of the risk on ourselves. So I don't think -- I think in contrast, I don't think we saw anything. I don't feel like we saw really anything that abnormal from the carriers in the renewals themselves, which bodes -- to me and for us, I think bodes well for the future. There was no abnormality there that should continue or anything.</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL GROSSMAN: Got it. And then just going over into the mid-market, and I know that has come up several times. But if you just had to isolate one thing that's changed most that may have impacted the momentum in that business, what do you think that is? And do you think you're gaining share? Or you just think you're doing a better job of retaining your clients as they migrate into that kind of mid-market category?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I think the one thing is definitely the technology investment. I mean look, we had a solid sales force and great sales leadership there and operational and service performance. And -- but I think the biggest change has been the technology investment over many years now, but it's really come to fruition the last few years, in particular, as everything has come together, the mobile app, the HR administration, the data analytics, the artificial intelligence work, everything that has come together now. We have a fully integrated solution for a mid-market that is very simple to use. And we're -- I think that has really shown in the sales performance, particularly this year, but we could start it the last half of last year and then the first half of this year, the sales performance is better and the retention as well. But I really think it's the technology on top of good sales and operations leadership and performance. And by -- and just to tell you, I think we are taking some share. But I -- you do know -- as you know, that is a growing market for all players, and we just haven't gotten as much of our fair share in the last few years, in my opinion, as we should have, and we had to get the technology really to all pull together. We kept introducing good products, but now we pulled it together. And we also now have moved to say, hey, if you want a product integration, if you want something, if you have the best HR, time and attendance that you think is better than ours, we'll build the product integration for you as well, or we have the product integration already through APIs. And so I think all of that has really helped, but I think the technology would be the #1 biggest thing.</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL GROSSMAN: Right. And just can you help size it for us? Or just give us some context so that we can think about how impactful it can be to the overall growth rate?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: What do you mean, in terms of revenue, David?</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL GROSSMAN: Yes. Yes.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. So mid-market revenue, if you look at it in terms of total payroll revenue. And we give you payroll, so I'm not giving you a number you can't figure out. It's been running about 25% or so of our overall payroll revenue. So you can figure out management solutions, you know what percentage is management solutions. You can get a sense of that bucket within management solutions. So if it accelerates, it's helpful. And I think that where it is helpful, and I think there was a discussion earlier about this. If you see continued trends, then over time, you see average client size go up, and that's positive. But also you have more opportunity to attach ancillaries when you get those clients.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a few follow-ups. First, just on the PEO side. When you talked about the carriers and what you're doing in terms of your own self-insurance on the health care cost, what rate of increase are you typically seeing as you go into next year for a like-for-like type plan?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. I think, Mark, I would say, no one's giving you the exact increase. I would say it's pretty competitive with the market, in some cases, a little bit below. So part of -- following up on what Marty was saying, because we try to manage the book very conservatively, we ensure that we manage those losses tightly so that we can go out to market with rates that are competitive in the market.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: Right. I appreciate that. And then with (inaudible) I'm not sure if you're hearing that.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes.</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. You cut out a little bit there, Mark. Go ahead.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: With regards to the percentage of the clients that you're -- what percentage of your PEO clients actually are taking your insurance where you're self-insured for it?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. So I'll flip it around. We don't give the exact clients. But if you look at PEO revenue, PEO revenue includes at-risk revenue of 35% to 40% of that revenue, and you can get to that because we give you a breakout [front row] as with any cost. So that gives you a sense. We don't break it out by specific client.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: Got it. And then with regards to the mid-market, you're obviously doing really well there. Can -- in terms of the new sales, is there any change, Marty, in terms of the composition of who you're getting those new clients from? Or how we should think about that with regards to -- there's still some -- a surprising number of companies out there with really old legacy systems versus some that have transitioned to newer systems. What's the composition look like in terms of the new sales that you're getting?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Yes. I think it's been a combination of taking some from competitors. And I would say I think it's probably this year, I would guess, it's run 50-50 on old legacy systems going to -- moving into a new platform, a software-as-a-service platform of ours and really moving up the technology, and then probably the other half is more something they didn't like from a competitive standpoint. So I think we're taking some from market share and then some from -- as the market expands itself, and it's probably roughly around half and half, I'd say, at least this year-to-date kind of thing. Because you know, that market, it does continue to expand and it's growing across -- it's -- the market itself is growing of those who just see the need, particularly in this tight labor market to have something that's going to help them hire and onboard with all of that, doing it paperlessly, then retaining them with integrated benefits and a mobile app and retirement plans, and so they're seeing a need that they have to go up that it's -- it definitely is more critical to them in a tight labor market to move onto a more modern system. And I think ours is appealing to a number of those prospects.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: Okay, fully appreciate that. And then 2 longer-term questions. One would basically be, you started off the whole presentation basically by talking about some of the effectiveness that you're seeing in terms of your sales and marketing efforts coming through and sales, SG&amp;A actually ended up declining as a percentage of revenue despite the strong sales growth. So I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the longer-term implications for the increased efficacy with regards to your sales efforts and what you're seeing there. That's the first question. And then the second question is basically, how we should think about the effective yield for next year through the float balance and the duration?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: Okay. Let me take the first one and then Efrain will take the next one.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. Yes. That's fine.</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: I think, Mark, the interesting thing is, it's a sales and marketing kind of combined look and you're seeing, as we've talked about, I think before, a shift more toward marketing. Many times today, most people are buying or making their decision, they're 70% or 75% of the way through the decision before they ever talk to anyone, and they're looking for much more online approach. They're being marketed to online, the way you market to them, the way you get leads the way you nurture leads and then the way you sell. And we're trialing a number of things that will make us even more efficient from that standpoint, where you're spending marketing dollars because a lot of the marketing is really the sales now. We certainly still have a lot of field reps that we count on that are building relationships and getting referrals in the field and talking to clients, but particularly the smallest clients who are starting up businesses are going online and looking to look, buy -- demo and buy -- and even buy online, and we're preparing for all of that. So I think we're looking for efficiency, but even more so, what's the best way to market and sell to a prospect or an existing client that's in business and try to be as efficient as we can. But it's really looking at how is that shifting from web to -- from live person to web, telephonic to e-commerce and positioning ourselves well for the future on that. And I think I think we have a pretty good handle on it, and we're trialing a number of things now that seem to be successful.</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Great. Mark, on the yield question, I'd say that the yield, we go out this year, this meaning the fiscal year is probably the yield that we have -- we will plan for next year, given that, apparently, the Fed has decided that it wants to hold. We do have a little bit of play there in terms of float balances, which have been increasing slowly. And we do have a little bit of play with duration. So but for planning assumptions, that's what I would assume.</p><p>MARK STEVEN MARCON: Just to be clear, the yield year on is basically the year -- is basically what we should plan on for next year, not the average for this year?</p><p>EFRAIN RIVERA: Yes. I think it's going to be slightly lower. But I'm just saying the back -- the yield we have in the back half of the year is probably -- is the yield we go into next year with. So I can't -- and we have a little bit of play with duration. You saw this year -- this quarter duration was 3.1. We can extend it further, but it'll depend a little bit on the -- or it'll depend on the shape of the yield curve, how far we want to go out.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have time for one final question, and that question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill with Autonomous Research.</p><p>MATTHEW CASEY O'NEILL, PARTNER OF PAYMENTS AND FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: I know it's a long call. Most of the things have been asked and answered. I was just curious, has there been any noticeable evolution in the kind of lead-gen sources, maybe moving a little bit all away from the CPA channels and more towards the online channels? And sort of as a follow-up, if that's true, is that something that drives kind of more price-sensitive customers or not really any change on that side of it?</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: No. I think, Matt, it definitely has moved some. I mean we still rely a lot on being out in the field and building those CPA relationships. They're good partners with us as well as current clients, but definitely, as I said, a lot of -- today, everybody is doing their research online. Even if you're giving a referral, in the old days, you'd just call us. And today, you're going online, you're searching our website. Our investments have been in the website and in being able to demo the product, whether it's -- you can demo it right on your mobile app, if you download the mobile app. And so it has been about how do you get those leads, and we put a lot of investment in that from a marketing standpoint as well as how do you then nurture those leads, if they're not ready. That's different than it used to be. That's a whole nurturing piece that we have put in place for the last few years now about how to get information to clients and make sure when they're ready, they come to us. And then we're moving to more of an -- even in e-commerce, where you can buy online, particularly with SurePayroll or other options you can buy online. That also lowers some costs, it increases marketing costs, but sales costs come down and balance a lot of that out as you're selling either online or through telephonic means, you're giving them more tools telephonically to help demo a product to a client and then sell it to them. So we're definitely seeing that change, and I think that will shift cost from marketing -- or from sales to marketing, they become all kind of one pot of cost that you look at to be the most efficient. But it really is about how do you best sell to clients, and they are definitely searching, demoing and even thinking about or buying online, and we're into that already, and we're looking -- we might -- we'll find ways to expand that as well.</p><p>Operator, so I think that's the last question, correct?</p><p>OPERATOR: Yes. That's correct.</p><p>MARTIN MUCCI: At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it'll be archived for approximately 30 days.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Evan Masyr, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, SALEM MEDIA GROUP, INC.: Welcome and thank you all for joining us for today on Salem Media Group's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. As a reminder, if you get disconnected at any time, you can dial back in or listen from our website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.salemmedia.com\">www.salemmedia.com</url>.</p><p>Joining me on the call today are Edward Atsinger, Chief Executive Officer; David Santrella, President of Broadcast Media and David Evans, President of Interactive and Publishing. We'll begin in just a moment with our prepared remarks. And once we are done, the conference call operator will come back on the line to instruct you on how to submit questions.</p><p>Given the current circumstances, we are all working remotely and that may cause some extra coordination during the question-and-answer portion of the call. Please be advised that statements made on this call that relate to future plans, events, financial results, prospects or performance are forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, and reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance. We do not intend and undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, including forecasts of future performance, the potential for growth of existing markets, the opening of new markets or the potential growth from future acquisitions.</p><p>This conference call also contains non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G, specifically station operating income or SOI, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. In conformity with Regulation G, the information required to accompany the disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.salemmedia.com\">www.salemmedia.com</url>.</p><p>And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Edward Atsinger. Ed?</p><p>EDWARD G. ATSINGER, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, SALEM MEDIA GROUP, INC.: Thank you, Evan, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.</p><p>The second quarter was certainly a difficult quarter, and I will begin my prepared remarks focusing on the financial results and the challenges we face due to the coronavirus pandemic, and then I'll turn the call back to Evan to provide more detailed information on Q2.</p><p>For the second quarter of 2020, total revenue declined 18.3%. Expenses were down 8.2%, which resulted in a 72.4% decline in adjusted EBITDA. On our last call, we outlined a number of steps that have been taken to reduce expenses in the light of the current economic environment, including -- which included layoffs, across the Board salary cuts and the elimination of the 401(k) match. Beginning in May, these steps resulted in a monthly expense savings of approximately $850,000.</p><p>Let's take a look at the results by division to get a little better understanding of our performance. For the second quarter, broadcast revenue declined 19.6%. By month, broadcast revenue was down 24.5% in April, 24.7% in May, but only 8.7% in June, which of course indicates that business was starting to improve as the economy was beginning to reopen. However, with the recent increases in the COVID cases and further lockdowns, it's a little difficult to really know how that trend will play out.</p><p>We might wait -- Evan might give a little bit of pacing for July, but beyond that we really, we -- it's anybody's guess at this point. According to Miller Kaplan, in the markets where we operate, the industry was down 55.9%. Our strong outperformance relative to the industry shows the relative strength and resilience of Salem's business model. Historically, we have focused on paid national and local ministry programming, as well as direct advertisers. This revenue source is very stable, and many of these advertisers and programs have been with us for decades. Recently, we made investments in digital, including Salem Surround, a multimedia advertising agency with a focus on digital advertising. And we launched SalemNOW recently, an on-demand pay-per-view video streaming platform. Together, both of these have provided results that help -- that helped us provide results that helped us outpace the industry in Q2.</p><p>National Christian ministry block program revenue, which represents approximately 30% of broadcast revenue, was down less than 2%, providing an important foundation for our broadcast business. And we had another good quarter of growth in our local digital business primarily because of Salem Surround. Local digital was up 54% or $2 million. We're pleased with this growth, especially in these challenging times, and we're encouraged by the importance of both Salem Surround and SalemNOW. Both are certainly contributing to our overall revenue mix. Local spot revenue was down 42.8% in the quarter, and national spot revenue was down 36.7%. These declines, of course, are related to the pullback in advertising revenue that the entire industry has experienced.</p><p>Political revenue did not play a significant factor in the quarter. We recorded $600,000 in political revenue in the second quarter of this year and $400,000 in the second quarter of last year.</p><p>Additionally, miscellaneous revenue declined 45.1%, principally due to the absence of live events. Most of the miscellaneous revenue is associated with live events of one kind or another. Broadcast expenses were down 12.2% due to lower commissions and, of course, the cost control measures that I mentioned earlier. Our revenue in our national digital division declined 5.2%. This decline is entirely related to our Christian websites, which experienced a 16.5% reduction in revenue due to lower advertiser demand and lower programmatic advertising rates,</p><p>Revenue in Townhall media, our collection of conservative news and opinion websites, actually increased 19.2% due to the revenue from the Townhall VIP subscription product, which was launched in November of last year. Expenses in the digital division increased 0.1%, a minor increase due to the increased expenses associated with the rollout of Townhall VIP, much of which was offset by the previously mentioned expense savings.</p><p>Finally, revenue from our publishing division was down 29.8%. This can be attributed to the fact that the majority of bookstores in the country were closed. And Amazon began making decisions to prioritize the shipment of essential products and delay the shipment of books. In terms of our self-publishing book sales, they were down as many authors chose not to buy books, which they typically buy from us on demand, as they could not promote their books at live events. So publishing expenses were down 3.6%, but certainly not enough to offset the decline in revenue.</p><p>Additionally, corporate expenses were down 11.1%. And with that, Evan, I want to turn the call back to you for additional details on the quarter.</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: Great. Thank you, Ed.</p><p>For the second quarter, total revenue decreased 18.3% to $52.9 million. Operating expenses, on a recurring basis, decreased 8.2% to $50.1 million, which resulted in a 72.4% decrease in adjusted EBITDA to $2.8 million. Net broadcast revenue decreased 19.6% to $39.5 million and broadcast operating expenses decreased 12.2% to $33.1 million resulting in station operating income of $6.4 million, a decline of 43.9%.</p><p>On a same-station basis, net broadcast revenue decreased 17.4% to $38.7 million, and SOI decreased 43.9% to $6.5 million. These same-station results include broadcast revenue from 95 of our 99 radio stations in our network operations and represents 98% of our net broadcast revenue.</p><p>I will briefly review revenue performance of our strategic formats. 37 of our radio stations are programmed in our foundational Christian teaching and talk format. These stations contributed 42% of total broadcast revenue and decreased 14.4% for the quarter. Our 32 news talk stations had a decrease of 19.7% in revenue for the quarter. And overall, these stations contributed 17% of total broadcast revenue. Revenue from our 12 contemporary Christian music stations contributed 13% of total broadcast revenue and decreased 47.8% for the quarter.</p><p>Our network revenue decreased 14.7% for the quarter and represents 11% of total broadcast revenue. Revenue from our national digital media businesses decreased 5.2% to $9.4 million and represent 18% of total revenue. Our publishing revenue decreased 29.8% to $4.0 million and represents 7% of our total revenue.</p><p>As of June 30, we had $216.3 million in bonds outstanding and $19 million drawn on the revolver. We also had $19 million in cash. Our leverage ratio was 8.96%. As Ed mentioned, due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the current economic environment due to COVID-19, we will not be providing guidance for the third quarter. But while we're still closing the books for July, I can tell you where total revenue looks like it will be. It should be down around 2%. Broadcast revenue in total was essentially flat and even up a little bit on a same-station basis. Local spot advertising was down 19% and national spot advertising was down 9%. Local programs were down 22%, while national programs were down 2%. Local digital revenue was up 132%. Our broadcast division was also aided by strong sales at SalemNOW. Revenue in our national digital division increased 2% and publishing revenue declined 28%.</p><p>And this concludes our prepared remarks, and we would now like to answer any questions. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate that. Operator?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We will first go to Mike Kupinski with NOBLE Capital Markets.</p><p>MICHAEL A. KUPINSKI, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AND SENIOR MEDIA &amp; ENTERTAINMENT ANALYST, NOBLE CAPITAL MARKETS, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: A couple of questions here. First of all, the revenues were a little bit better than expected. And I know that it's been a sacrifice on all of you guys in terms of your employees going through this crisis and hats off to you guys to manage through that crisis. And hopefully, we're largely on the back end of this now. But I did have a couple of questions. Regarding your block programming, how are the ministries doing in this environment? Do you think that -- I know that you have typically regular rate increases as you cycle into next year. Do you think that they're healthy? Are they doing okay? Or do you think that there might be some concessions as you need to go forward here with them? Just -- kind of just a general outlook for that portion of the block programming.</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: I can certainly take part of that. Ed, you might want to speak into it as well, Michael, but we check in with our ministries quite regularly. We have a great relationship with them, and so we're on the phone with them weekly. For the most part, most of the ministries are reporting a relative stable donor base during this time. And so none of them have kind of raised their hands and expressed some real concern. I think as we go into next year, we'll certainly need to be mindful of the environment that we're in, as we make decisions on what the proper rate increases will be for the coming year. We did that back in 2010. And we looked at things and decided to do a lower-than-normal ask on rate increase. And we'll look at that environment again as we go into 2021. But the relationships are strong, and so far, they seem to be relatively stable.</p><p>MICHAEL A. KUPINSKI: And then in terms of the publishing side, certainly, that portion of the business, even though the revenues were a little bit better than I expected in the quarter, it still looks like that business has kind of suffered more than some of your other lines of business. Is it reflective of the fact that maybe some of these authors are not just not buying the books, but are they just delaying the titles at all? Is there any, just given the weak markets at this point, obviously, it's not the best environment to kind of launch your book. Just kind of give me some general trends in terms of the outlook for the number of titles that you anticipate in the back half, are they the same as you originally thought? Or you're kind of delaying some of these books?</p><p>DAVID A. R. EVANS, PRESIDENT OF NEW MEDIA, SALEM MEDIA GROUP, INC.: Well, there certainly have been books delayed. With many, many bookstores closed, with Amazon prioritizing essential shipments and not taking delivery of books, it was necessary to delay some releases. Even the books that were released, with our political titles, it's important to have publicity for those authors on news talk radio stations, news TV stations, and with COVID, all of the shows were 100% focused on the COVID crisis, and really weren't interested in talking with authors on books on other subjects. So it was kind of in Q2, it was kind of a perfect storm of no traction on any of our books.</p><p>In terms of looking ahead to the rest of the year, frankly, it remains unclear what the rest of the year is going to look like. There are still many bookstores closed. Yes, I'm certain that the election, it's going to get a lot of coverage. So election-related books have good prospects, but it nearly is very dependent upon what happens with COVID. So it's difficult to give you any feel for what the rest of the year is going to look like.</p><p>MICHAEL A. KUPINSKI: Got you. And then Evan, can you just kind of reiterate what you just said in terms of local digital. How much was it up in July? I don't know if I got that number correct.</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: Sure. The national digital division was up 2%. And I was talking national or in local, in broadcast, local was up 132%.</p><p>MICHAEL A. KUPINSKI: Okay. That's what I was -- I guess, and that's largely the Salem Surround and Now, right? That's reflected in that -- those numbers.</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: Correct.</p><p>MICHAEL A. KUPINSKI: Yes. And then, I guess, in terms of the digital business, typically, in election years, you get a little bit of traction, traffic kind of picks up. And of course, it's a kind of a weird environment where traffic to many sites were up anyway. Could you just kind of talk a little bit about the traffic trends in July, and how -- now that the economies are starting to open up, are the traffic trends still being pretty strong? Or what -- can you just kind of give us an outlook on how the traffic to your site is performing?</p><p>DAVID A. R. EVANS: Yes, so traffic on the conservative sites is at record levels. People, they want to visit news websites, news opinion websites because they want to know what's going on with COVID from voices they trust. And then we've got the election at the same time. So all of our concerns in opinion websites, the traffic is fantastic, and continues to be fantastic. That is offset, of course by the fact that programmatic advertising rates have dropped substantially at the same time. So it's not all good news.</p><p>On the Christian side, the traffic is, it's closer to flat. It took a very nice bump up in April when the crisis first hit, but it has come back down to more normal levels and rates continue to be depressed.</p><p>MICHAEL A. KUPINSKI: Then just a couple of last quick questions. Political advertising, do you have any visibility on how that's shaping up? Is that being booked at this point? Any thoughts there?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: On the broadcast side, I can tell you that it is picking up, Michael. We've seen more political activity in the last couple of weeks. It was pretty quiet for a while. We've seen a little bit more political activity picking up both on the terrestrial broadcast side as well as even through our ad-injected streams.</p><p>DAVID A. R. EVANS: And the same is true on the digital side, the political advertising has picked up in recent weeks.</p><p>MICHAEL A. KUPINSKI: And is it presidential money, or is it just mostly kind of Senate, House races? Where do you see the lion's share of the political dollars?</p><p>EDWARD G. ATSINGER: I'll probably need to get back to you with a more accurate answer. I'm not sure right now if it's as much presidential money as it is pack money out of mine. But I think, Michael, I can follow-up later on to wish you on that.</p><p>MICHAEL A. KUPINSKI: Okay. Perfect. And I just had one final question. And this is kind of more of a macro thing, I know that Big Tech was before Congress, recently about any competitive practices. And I know that there are some other countries that have measures in place whereby many of these big tech companies have to pay for content and maybe be a little bit more competitive, I guess. And I know that in the past, David, you have indicated that the likes of Facebook had been largely anti-competitive, how they direct traffic and so forth. Are they -- are you seeing a better environment as it relates to -- because of their scrutiny? Or do you think that Congress is going to have to act? Or what are your thoughts in terms of just the competitiveness of the marketplace? Has it gotten better or worse?</p><p>DAVID A. R. EVANS: Hasn't really changed in terms of kind of what we see in terms of traffic from Google and traffic from Facebook. There continue to be issues and challenges in relation to, I guess, what I'd call content censorship. And certainly, the algorithms continue to change. I wouldn't -- I think overall, the amount of traffic we're getting is looking changed.</p><p>OPERATOR: All right. We'll take our next question from Lisa Springer with Singular Research.</p><p>LISA SPRINGER, RESEARCH ANALYST, SINGULAR RESEARCH, LLC: Looking out beyond this COVID-19 thing, I was very interested in the, during this announcement, Quu. I wonder if you can talk about that a little bit in terms of strategically and where that might take your broadcasting business?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: Lisa, I had a little trouble hearing you. Can you repeat that, please?</p><p>LISA SPRINGER: Yes. So I wanted to ask you about the Quu deals and in terms of strategy, how that fits in with everything you're doing?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: Yes. Well, look, I think radio needs to be as competitive visually as some of our audio competitors are, the user experience on Spotify or for that matter, SiriusXM or Pandora, currently it includes album art, aired artist and title. And so I think on radio, our ability to provide a better user experience on the dashboard, the visual experience on the dashboard is important from a competitive perspective. And so certainly Quu or Q as they're called, offers that. But then on top of that, it offers the ability to interface more with our advertisers. So when we're running a spot for McDonald's, at the same time as that spot's running, it can say across bottom in the screen, 2 Big Macs for $5 till 5:00 tonight. And so we can reinforce the selling message that they're hearing on the radio and provide just better results for our clients. And so a better user experience, better results for our clients that we could also charge them more to receive, to me was a good idea and something that strategically from a long -- for the long term, I think all radio's going to need to get there.</p><p>LISA SPRINGER: And I know you're rolling it out in 28 stations initially. How are you going to measure the success of this effort?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: Well, first of all, rolling it out everywhere we have, where we have full market FM radio stations, so not on FM translators, but everywhere where Salem has an FM radio license, radio station, is where we're rolling it out, because it's really a service only for FM radio. So from a testing perspective, once we roll it out, and we have sales packages on the street, which will be synonymous with the rollout. So at that point, we'll start to measure the success of it and take it from there.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We'll next go to Michelle Lim with New York Life.</p><p>MICHELLE P. LIM: Just a quick one. I joined a little late, so I'm not sure if I got everything. But your liquidity, you mentioned that $19 million was drawn on the revolver, it's a $30 million total commitment. Is there any more availability on that?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: Yes. We do have some availability. It's a function of, as you know, of our receivables, the payments and value we get on our real estate. It's about $22 million, $23 million in total availability. So we still have a little bit of excess that we could draw on.</p><p>MICHELLE P. LIM: Okay. And then you generally -- and you think you have generated a lot of cash during the quarter, much of it from working capital. Can you just talk qualitatively about how you were able to generate cash during the quarter?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: Yes. Certainly, one of the things that we disclose in our 10-Q, we have gone to a couple of our largest ministry clients and had some advanced payments from them, while offering them the small discount, in lieu of, or in exchange for getting payments early. So they paid their May through December airtime bill in the month of May. And we did that just to make sure we had ample liquidity for the June 1 interest payment. And you may have heard, we have right now -- at the end of the quarter, we had $19 million in cash. I can tell as of today, we have $18.5 million in cash. So we seem to be holding our own on the liquidity perspective.</p><p>MICHELLE P. LIM: And so is that what I'm seeing in terms of the cash flow, about $7.1 million of contract liabilities situated through the ministry?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: Yes. We -- I have to see what that number was in June as far as what they have in advanced payments, but it was $8.3 million in total that we got in advanced payments from the ministry. So it's probably the end of June, it's in that $7 million range, if that makes sense.</p><p>MICHELLE P. LIM: Okay. Great. And then my last question is -- was on asset sales. I think you have talked in previous quarters about valuable real estate assets and other assets that you could potentially monetize. Can you talk about through -- or give us an update on how that process is going? Or if much of it has been kind of delayed or postponed during COVID? And is there any other sort of opportunities to monetize other assets?</p><p>EDWARD G. ATSINGER: As far as the real estate goes, we've got active about 3 or 4 locations that aren't progressing. There are, in some cases, entitlement issues that will maximize the value and will facilitate the transaction. And so we've initiated a lot of those procedures, but there are at least 2 or 3 that are fairly far along in the process where we have very active interest and where we can monetize a real estate asset without in any way diminishing our broadcast capacity. So we don't -- I don't want to get into too many details now, it's a little premature, but there are at least 3 that are progressing and that we feel fairly optimistic that within the next -- by the end of the year, we probably will be able to have more clarity on it, but I wouldn't be surprised. I'm speculating that I wouldn't be surprised if at least 1 or 2 of those are completed.</p><p>MICHELLE P. LIM: Would you be able to disclose sort of magnitude of the opportunity there?</p><p>EDWARD G. ATSINGER: Yes. I mean I think it would be a little premature. I mean, we have one site that we're working a situation where we can, with a modest investment, relocate our towers to one part of the property and then spend the rest of it all. And it shouldn't add something. $6 million, $7 million, something in that category.</p><p>OPERATOR: All right, and we'll take the next question from Howard Rosencrans with VA.</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS, FOUNDER &amp; CHIEF RESEARCH ANALYST, VALUE ADVISORY LLC: I was trying to -- I just want -- Evan, I must have tailed off, I didn't catch it. If we just focus on the broadcast division, the other ones are kind of small, but what did you say about the broadcast for the month of July?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: The broadcast division for the month of July was essentially flat. But on a same-station basis, it was up just a little bit.</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: Okay. And what was the big number you gave out of $130 million, what business -- of 130%, what business was that?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: That is the digital division -- or the digital revenue within the broadcast division.</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: Okay. So that's just a small piece.</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: (inaudible) in SalemNOW.</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: Okay. So the -- okay. So this is -- have you started to -- I know, the first question I wanted to ask you was about the cadence stirring. Can you give us an idea of what the cadence was April, May, June, and you said it was flat in July. Can you tell us how it ran April, May, June? Broadcast. Just the broadcast division, the rest of probably (inaudible)</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: Yes. Correct. Broadcast in April was down about 25%. May was also down around 25%. June was down 9%.</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: Okay. And so how much of June or July was -- is political? If you were to go ex political, how did those months flow -- again, you can just ballpark it?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: Not significant. Certainly for -- now, the second quarter, we only had $600,000 political compared to $400,000 in the second quarter last year. So political is really not...</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: Okay. Okay. That's good. Okay, and how much political did you guys do in -- you probably have a pretty good idea off the top of your head, I'm going to guess. How much political did you guys do in, let's say, August, September, October, in the first few days of November in '16?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: I don't have that in front of me, but I think I do have Q3 of '16. So if we're just looking at one quarter, Q3 of '16, we're at $1.5 million in political.</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: Okay. All right. Not that much. Okay. It's nice to get $1.5 million, but not that much. Are there any -- so your leverage ratio is in the 8s, and that's -- is that trailing 12 months?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: That's correct.</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: Okay. So is there -- so your leverage ratio is, in all likelihood, going to go up because, unfortunately, this thing never seems to get a lot better. But anyway, any issues with -- you got the advance -- I mean, no covenants on the $220 million stuff and the revolver is all tied to some sort of receivables? So we don't have to think about anybody -- any banks or -- so we don't have to think about that stuff. Is that fair to say?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: That's correct. So the bonds have, in current tests, on leverage, that's if we want to take on any new debt. As long as -- so there is no maintenance covenant, so we're not worried about that. And the receivable and certain other assets secure the ABL and there's a fixed charge covenant test that's only applied if we borrow in excess of certain amounts.</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: Okay. So it sounds like it probably wouldn't mean you'd go to market now. So unless you guys went to market, we're okay. That's what it sounds like.</p><p>EDWARD G. ATSINGER: Yes, I think that was a fair statement.</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: Okay. And I didn't exactly catch what David said in terms of he's mentioned of a few real estate projects. And is it that collectively they're worth $6 million or $7 million or that was just one of them?</p><p>EDWARD G. ATSINGER: That was just one. I said that there are 3 that are sort of in a very active stage of marketing the properties, and we've got lots of interest, but to maximize them, we're taking steps to modify the zoning and bring them closer for their maximum entitlement. And -- but we have interest now. But we want to maximize. And in some cases, we're, in the one case I mentioned, we can reorient the towers we have on the site in a way that maximizes their efficiency, doesn't diminish their coverage and allows us to sell-off the bulk of the property.</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: And that's just one of the properties, and then you have another 2. Am I -- did I hear you correctly?</p><p>EDWARD G. ATSINGER: Well, we have the -- of different magnitudes. One is it's a little -- it's going to take a few more months. And one is a smaller property that's available now. We just -- we're taking a look at the entitlement to see if we can maximize the value.</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: Okay. So the biggest one is the $6 million or $7 million thing, yes?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: Yes. Well, there are others...</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: In terms of...</p><p>EDWARD G. ATSINGER: I'd say there are others that will approach that magnitude as well.</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: Okay. Okay. But those are not amongst the 3?</p><p>EDWARD G. ATSINGER: No. Well, we've got property all over the country. I mean, one of the things about particularly AM radio sites is they take a lot of real estate. So we have 3 sites in Dallas, 3 or 4 sites in Dallas, 1 is 60 acres, another one is -- yes, we got big tracts of land that -- it's always nice to own some real estate, it might give us some options in the future.</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: Okay. That's certainly good to hear. That's certainly good to hear. The -- all right. Well, I surely hope for you and for all of us that as the environment starts to improve, you guys are an integral part of the conservative world. And I'd like to see all the -- as you mentioned, the strength of the listening audience, I'd like to see hopefully start to get better reflected in the ad rates.</p><p>It's -- how much of your business is sort of programmatic these days? And how much is -- I mean, I guess, the stuff that -- obviously, it's stuff that you have the -- dropping the word, the -- you have one part of the business, which is the churches and the other part is the non churches. But how much is -- how much of your business closed again, just within broadcast? How much flows through programmatic and how much flows in other areas?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: A fair amount, Howard, of our new business on our streams, on the streams of our radio stations now is programmatic. So we're generating tens of thousands of dollars a month now in an injected revenue on our regular station streams, and that's mostly programmatic advertising.</p><p>DAVID A. R. EVANS: On programmatic, I think percentage of total broadcast is very small.</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: So okay, I guess I misconstrued that. Okay. good. Well, since the ad rates aren't very good, then we'll worry about that less. Anyway, thank you for all the color...</p><p>DAVID A. R. EVANS: We would much rather sell direct. The rates are much higher when we deal directly with the advertisers.</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: Okay. And how much -- what would you say is the flow-off today vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis or in July, whatever time -- what would you say is the flow-off now versus pre-COVID. Is that what's sort of represented by the flattish year-to-year number that, Evan, you quoted? Is that sort of represented in that? I mean, be pretty good at that rate, it was sort of flattish year-on-year? Is that...</p><p>DAVID A. R. EVANS: So let me talk about the digital side of things because that's really what programmatic comes into play, is on our digital division. I would say programmatic rates are down 30%, compared to previous...</p><p>HOWARD A. ROSENCRANS: Okay, but that's really affecting the digital division, but digital division is relatively small in the context of everything. It's the broadcast that's -- so if you were to look at the broadcast division, how would you say rates are year-to-year?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: Well, rates for terrestrial radio right now, Howard, are down. They're down in general, probably a 15% demand is down. But again, what's helping Salem right now do better than our competitors, are 2 things: foundation and then -- and innovation. And the way the company was founded, was on the assumed very stable block programming sales. And a lot of direct sales to advertisers, coupled with all the innovation through Salem Surround and SalemNOW and those two things right now have come together to help us do significantly better than most broadcasters.</p><p>OPERATOR: And that's all the questions we have at this time. So I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Atsinger for any additional or closing remarks.</p><p>EDWARD G. ATSINGER: Thank you, operator. And again, thanks to all of you for joining us. We look forward to visiting with you on our next report when we give the results for the next quarter. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: And that does conclude today's conference.

Thank you.</p><p>THOMAS HEATH, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER &amp; HEAD OF IR, SINCH AB (PUBL): Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Good to have you dial in today's conference call discussing the second quarter 2020 results of Sinch AB. My name is Thomas Heath. I'm Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Relations -- Head of Investor Relations, and with me on the call today, though not, of course, in the same room, is our CEO, Oscar Werner; and our CFO, Roshan Saldanha.</p><p>And with those introductory remarks, I'll hand the word over to Oscar.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER, CEO, SINCH AB (PUBL): Thank you, Thomas. So welcome to -- welcome again to this quarter report. And so we'll try to give you the information on the quarter and also answer any questions that you may have.</p><p>So can I go to Slide 2, please? So this slide we've shown many times before. We are now up to SEK 6 billion revenue in the past 12 months and an adjusted EBITDA of SEK 708 million in the past 12 months, with the acquisitions that are closed, but not counting the ones that are not closed, 822 people and present in 37 countries.</p><p>And what we do is customer engagement through mobile technology primarily in messaging, voice and video, where messaging is the largest. And we do some 40 billion engagements per year. We're serving 8 out of 10 of the largest U.S. tech companies, so a large portion of the West Coast's large tech titans are our customers.</p><p>We believe this is a very interesting market. We believe it's a growing -- a global multibillion-dollar U.S. -- multibillion-dollar market. And we believe this market will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. And therefore, we're trying to position ourselves as one of the leaders in this space.</p><p>We have been profitable since foundation in 2008. So we're very proud of that. We work very hard to keep -- obviously keep up profitability even during tough times. And we have had a solid growth since our IPO since 2015.</p><p>So can I move to Slide 3, please? So we have, as you see, had a track record of profitable growth, and we focused both on organic and M&amp;A-driven growth. In this quarter, we had a 43% in gross profit in Q2 2020 and a 55% growth in EBITDA, in our adjusted EBITDA. We focus on gross profit since the revenue has a lot of pass-through fees, and they vary between countries. So looking at revenues and this type of investments would skew -- skew your analysis, so therefore, we only look at gross profit both external and internal. And then this quarter, we obviously need to say that the acquisitions of Wavy, SDI and ACL Mobile will add significantly to our scale and profitability. You can see the impact both on the gross profit level in the yellow bar and on the adjusted EBITDA level on the purple bar on the trailing 12 months -- on a trailing 12-month basis on the graph.</p><p>So as you can see, we're -- with these acquisitions, assuming closing, we're taking a major step up both in profitability and gross profit, and we think it also puts us in a very strong strategic position.</p><p>Operator, if you go to Slide 3, please -- or Slide 4, please. And to put this in context, both the organic growth and the M&amp;A side, we're only showing messaging and CPaaS here. We're not showing the figures for voice and video in order to make it a little bit shorter. But the messaging market is a -- on the A2P SMS side, the biggest part market and the market where the majority of the revenue is a $17 billion market globally. Other estimates vary between $15 billion and $50 billion. And the business uses of SMS is continuing to grow.</p><p>But then you also have very high-growth rates in next-generation messages like next-generation messaging channel like WhatsApp and RCS and Viber, KakaoTalk where you're seeing above 100% growth rates in the market. So this is a market which is combining the size and the profitability of the existing text messaging market and the high-growth and system of the next-generation channels like WhatsApp and RCS, which I think -- which we think is very interesting.</p><p>The other thing that is happening in the market is on the CPaaS side. We're basically adding software on top of actually delivering the message or terminating the voice call to deliver various forms of software services, which may be an AI service, an NLP service, which the Chatlayer acquisition is an example of or maybe other forms of software that you add on top. And there, you charge more in a SaaS model where you charge a -- for those services a 90% margin, but -- because it's a full cloud service. And those markets are growing fast as well, ranging between 30% and 50%, again, depending on the various estimates that you may choose.</p><p>Slide #5, please, operator. And as a consequence of this, we have a -- taken a playbook for profitable growth where we both focus on the connectivity side, that is terminating the voice call or making the video call or actually making sure the message deliver or the Software-as-a-service on top, which are the value-added services on top. And we focus on both of those. The majority of our business is on the connectivity side, even though we grow the Software-as-a-service side, both organically and by M&amp;A.</p><p>So let's go to Slide 6, please. And as you know, we have been making quite a few acquisitions lately. In this quarter, we have added 3 relatively sizable ones, Wavy in Brazil; SAP headquartered in the U.S., but large operations in Europe as well and also present in Asia; and ACL, the second largest player in India. So we feel that this quarter, we've really taken a stance of becoming a really global player in this industry. And we're now a leader in both Europe, U.S., Latin America and India for the reason being the biggest message -- or one of the biggest messaging providers in all of these regions. And we believe no other messaging players -- player is that deeply entrenched in all these markets, and so we think we have a very strong position there, and we think that sets us up very well for the future.</p><p>So operator, if you go to the next slide, please, Slide 7. This is a case for the acquisitions on the -- to show you what happens when we do acquisitions on the technology and go-to-market side. So we have the strategy on scale and profitability, but also technology and go-to-market. In technology and go-to-market, we buy typically smaller companies that have a specific technology or go-to-market ability that we think we can scale globally.</p><p>And one of those that we acquired a couple of quarters ago was myElefant. myElefant has a way to deliver what we call Rich SMS. It's basically some SMS with a landing page -- to mobile landing page. And they have a software so that people in marketing can actually create those messages themselves without any help from a developer.</p><p>And we -- Sinch had a customer called Nationwide, it's a financial institution or a bank, you may say, in the U.K.. When -- and then we took the myElefant service and pitched to the Nationwide, they had the best use case. So Nationwide wanted to do payment holidays for credits, so basically prolonging payment terms for credits to their consumers. And they wanted to find an efficient way of when that payment holiday or extended credit was ending, the term for that was ending, sending a notification and reminding people to start paying. They're doing this via regular mail. They're doing it via e-mail, and they were doing it via text message. But then they saw, all right, well, this service from myElefant or now Sinch seems like a really good way of increasing the engagement rates of our consumers so that more people actually start paying or take action when the payment holiday ends.</p><p>They did a run here. They saw a 4x click-through rate compared with the bank and financial sector average. So the click-through rates on this particular message or this particular campaign was 4x what they have seen before on any other campaign. And it was 98% engagement rate. And that means when anybody clicks on the link, 98% of the people actually clicked on the next button in this message. So you can see the first button here is \"If you can start making a payment again.\" So 98% -- 91% of the people that click through to the message actually clicked on it.</p><p>Nationwide believe this is an extremely successful campaign, and they believe they can -- they really increase the engagement rate and they increased the number of people who took action, and therefore, it makes it easier for them to start getting payments again or putting the people on a new payment plan, basically. So very successful campaign.</p><p>To the left here, you see how the messages actually look when you get to the link and landing page, and you can see how interactive this becomes compared to a normal text message with full graphics, action development and things like that. So this is very much representing the move you see in this industry are moving from simple texting messages to an interactive message where enterprises have a much higher value, but they also require more software, and that means that we can charge a higher fee per transaction that we could if we just send a normal text message. So that's one example of what we're doing here with the new acquisitions.</p><p>If we then, operator, move to Slide 8, just a short reconnect of SAP Digital Interconnect that was executed during the quarter. So the deal rationale here is we're getting close to 1,500 enterprise customers and some of the world's most valuable brands, and it diversifies our customer base. It's a highly accretive deal, as you've seen, so it fits our scale and profitability category. It significantly strengthens our U.S. presence. We go from some 100 people in the U.S. to 200 people in the U.S. We also get strengthening in Asia Pacific and Europe. And it gives us very strong operator relationships and [as data sets'] trusted vendors to hundreds of carriers around the globe given that SAP also have a P2P and operated business basically.</p><p>So we think this data is very good. We're now in integration planning. We're going through and hoping for closing in Q4. And we're targeting closing in Q4. We're going through integration planning, and we're very satisfied with what we have seen so far. So it's on track, and we're working hard in order to get to closing here.</p><p>And then operator Slide 9, please. And so ACL Mobile, a little bit of a recap. So ACL Mobile is the leading cloud communications provider in India and Southeast Asia. I think they're #2 in India by volume and on messaging. They've got a very strong customer base, with a leading position in banking and finance. So a large portion of the private banks in India are now customers of ACL and, soon to be, Sinch.</p><p>They've got very significant scales, with 47 billion business messages handling in the past 12 months. And if you can compare that to Sinch's 40 billion, you can see that the volumes in these type of markets are huge. You can also see by looking at the revenue numbers, the revenue or gross profit per transaction is obviously much lower. But entering into these type of markets with a very high mobile-first -- or a very large mobile-first population where the number of transactions is very high is obviously very interesting for any company that wants to be a leader in messaging globally, and that is our goal. And therefore, we believe India is a very strategic market to be in. And they have 288 employees in India, UAE and Malaysia.</p><p>This gives us significant scale in one of the -- in the world's second largest mobile market, more than 500 large enterprise customers. It's also a highly accretive deal. It's a scale and profitability. We get direct operator connections in India and the competitive cost structure for further expansion into Asia. The direct operator connection in India are important, obviously, to both our Asian and our -- and to our U.S. data customers who all have large volumes into India. That really truly adds to our delivery network in those regions.</p><p>So operator, next slide, please, Slide 10. So India -- India's just a little bit, you know this, but the second largest mobile market in the world, 1.2 billion mobile subscribers and a 50% smartphone penetration. It's interesting that we see a lot of innovation coming out of India now. So with the world's highest data usage per smartphone at 9.8 gigabyte per month. And it's also a very rapidly digitizing economy, second only to Indonesia, if you look at various reports.</p><p>It's also the world's largest WhatsApp market, which is interesting in -- when the new services come. So from the consumer perspective, it has 400 million users in July 2019 for WhatsApp. So it's a very active WhatsApp market also in terms of business messaging.</p><p>All right. Slide 11, please, operator. So with that intro, if we look at Q2 2020, we saw gross profit rising 43% to SEK 460.3 million compared to SEK 321 million the year prior. We saw adjusted EBITDA rise to 55% to SEK 176.5 million compared to SEK 114.2 million the year prior. And adjusted EBIT, if we exclude acquisition-related amortization, which is noncash flow-impacting was SEK 161.7 million. So as you can see, the -- and profit after tax being SEK 37.7 million. And the large portion there is obviously the acquisition-related amortization.</p><p>And we also -- we're happy to see that our strong cash flow, EBITDA to cash flow, that strong ratio is continuing, and that's what you -- that's what you obviously can see on the adjusted EBIT, excluding acquisition-related amortization. Organic gross profit grew 24% in local currency, so excluding the currency effect. COVID-19 was causing reduced voice traffic and length and sales cycles. But you also see that the high scalability in the business, you can see -- truly see this when you see the message volumes going up. You can also note that EBITDA grows faster than gross profit despite increased OpEx to handle the greater business volumes. So that's a little bit of the headlines.</p><p>And now I'll go into a little bit more of the detail. So operator, Slide 12, please. So the key growth drivers in this quarter is volumes -- volume growth and new use cases with large U.S. tech companies, as we have seen many quarters before. We saw the acquisitions of TWW, myElefant and Chatlayer contributing well to growth. And then we have a very strong performance in general in Brazil, and it's the third gross performer here. And we're growing both with new and existing customers.</p><p>So Slide 13, please, operator. We're investing in 4 areas. We're investing in organic growth. So we have this two-pronged agenda of doing M&amp;A and organic at the same time. So we're continuously focusing on driving the organic growth and driving that upwards. And I'm happy to see that we have had a good organic growth the last quarters and also this quarter. And we're seeing a continued investment in platform scalability, and we're seeing support -- supporting growth with existing customers. Just the sheer volume growth obviously takes some investments in order to keep up with. And we see a greater focus on new gen and new sales and continued increased focus on that each quarter-by-quarter.</p><p>Operational efficiency is a big area. So we've got something in COGS efficiency and internal automation. So we see a lot of the initiatives that we kicked off 12, 18 months ago are now coming up in automation. So very happy to see that that's coming out now in Q2, Q3, Q4 of this year and also seeing client self-service tools. New technology, a large area as well. Software on advanced, interactive messaging, new channels like WhatsApp and RCS. We're focusing now on a cross-channel Conversation API, so our customers can have 1 API and then reach every channel in the market. We're investing in RCS-as-a-Service and SMSF for mobile operators. That's the partnership we announced with Ericsson.</p><p>And integration is a large focus area, of course, so both on TWW, myElefant and Chatlayer, where we're -- they're closed and are focusing on action doing the integration. And then you have ACL expected to close in Q4, SDI pending regulatory approval and Wavy pending regulatory approval, and there we do integration planning, but obviously not integration or execution. But that's a big area and will be a growing area, of course, going forward, and we're right now working hard to set ourselves up to do this integration in a good way.</p><p>So operator, Slide 14, please. The messaging performance in this quarter is very good. U.S. tech companies continue to fuel our growth here. We also see generally in market the rising volumes as businesses shift from e-mail to mobile messaging. myElefant and the TWW are included since mid-October 2019 and Chatlayer since April '20. And we see investments in software for next-generation messaging. But in general, if you look a little bit closer to numbers, the growth in gross profit and EBITDA in this quarter in messaging alone is very strong, showing the strong performance in our core market and core product.</p><p>Operator, Slide 15, please. So you see the rising message volumes. As you see on the graph, we had a spike in early '20, and we said in the -- I think it was March 2020, and we also noted there, we thought that was COVID-related early. And that was going to go down. So we saw that spike going down as we reported at the end of the Q1 report. And we saw that happening, but now we're seeing also message volume picking up again in the tail end of Q2, which we think is good and strong. And we see 58% growth in transactions and 32% growth in gross profit in the messaging segment.</p><p>So operator, Slide 16, please. Gross profit per transaction, so OpEx per transaction, gross profit per transaction, this is a graph we're monitoring closely. Obviously, you want to see this a little bit like a crocodile gap or crocodile mouth. In the end, we want to see them increasing. Over last quarter, we have seen that. And this quarter, we see that graph being on the solid level or even increasing a little bit. And this is obviously how we try to manage our OpEx to our gross profit. And as you know, we're trying to always keep our OpEx in line or at a slower growth with the GP. And we sure have been able to do that this quarter. You can also see the reduced OpEx per transaction due to economies of scale.</p><p>All right. Operator, Slide 17, please. This is the other graph we're monitoring closely. It's in our core business, the messaging EBITDA per gross profit. As you can see here, we're dropping close to 50% of our gross profit down to EBITDA. So this truly -- I think this is a truly testament for the scalability of this type of business. Being able to, in the cloud business, drop 50% of the gross profit down to EBITDA is a strong testament to our scalability and efficiently of running this operation.</p><p>Slide 18, please, operator. Then coming out to the headwind areas in this quarter, as we reported in Q2, we saw strong headwinds in voice and video. Voice and video are 2 segments, partly it's verification, which is trading fairly well; and then it's the actual ride-hailing segment, which, obviously, during lockdowns and COVID has a strong headwind. We saw that in Q1, but then the COVID effect was only 1 quarter. And now in Q2, we see a full quarter's effect of the COVID impact. And then you can see the gross profit levels and the revenue levels and the EBITDA levels on the voice and video segments to drop. And obviously, this is not what we want to see, but this is, as you know, a smaller portion of our business. So -- but this is the area which is strongly -- most strongly affected. And we expect this to turn back up as the COVID effect releases and as we are able to sign the new customers.</p><p>We should though say that we have a positive underlying trend in the number verification business. So this is, as I said, 2 parts, the number of locations doing well while the ride-hailing segment, obviously, much more negatively affected. Here, we are increasing OpEx to ensure quality and service and adding functionality. And we're continuing on a solid level here in order to make sure we have the solid -- the quality as message -- as core volumes come back.</p><p>So operator, Slide 19, please. So we also have headwind in the operator segment. We see lengthened sales cycles with lower operating investments due to COVID-19. We also have currency headwinds, and we also signed a very attractive 5G SMSF deal with Ericsson. This is to enable IoT or wake up IoT devices in the 5G networks. The best way to do that is via text message. And therefore, we, together with Ericsson, we have developed the software. And together with Ericsson, we're taking it to market to the largest carriers in the world. And here, we see a great future potential. And therefore, we're taking more investments here than normal because we think this case is interesting as such.</p><p>We're obviously not happy at all with the negative EBITDA impact in operator, and we're working hard in order to turn that trend.</p><p>That said, I'll leave the word to our CFO, Roshan Saldanha. So operator, if you go to the next slide, please.</p><p>And Roshan, if you could please continue.</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA, CFO, SINCH AB (PUBL): Thank you, Oscar. Thank you, Oscar. Good afternoon to all of you taking time on this summer day. And some of you even from your holidays to join us on this call. Happy to present some comments on the financials for Sinch in this quarter where we continue to have enterprises digitalize their communication.</p><p>Operator, please turn to Slide 21 for the condensed income statement.</p><p>Consolidated net sales grew by 38% in the quarter to SEK 1.6 billion. The growth rate in the quarter was positively affected by the previous acquisitions of TWW, Chatlayer and myElefant and as well as the depreciation of the Swedish krona primarily against the Euro pound and dollar. The organic growth of net sales in local currency was 27%. We see a strong continued development of adjusted EBITDA per share, which was SEK 2.9 for the quarter versus SEK 2.1 for the same period last year. On a rolling 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA per share increased to SEK 12.6. For the messaging segment, especially adjusted EBITDA, was a record high at SEK 214 million for the quarter versus SEK 112 million last year and SEK 177 million in Q1 of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA in the other segment was also decreased or affected negatively by SEK 12 million due to increase in provisions for social insurance costs related to the company's outstanding long-term incentive programs.</p><p>In addition to that, in adjusted EBITDA, we also have a negative ForEx effect of SEK 11 million, which varies, of course, from quarter-to-quarter depending on the foreign currency movements. Moving to EBITDA, which came in at SEK 146 million this quarter, it was -- it is reduced by nonrecurring items of SEK 31 million compared to adjusted EBITDA, of which, SEK 26 million are acquisition costs related to the recently announced acquisitions, mainly SDI and ACL. EBIT came in at SEK 88 million versus SEK 73 million in the same period previous year. Acquisition-related amortization, which does not affect cash flow, was SEK 43 million. The amortization relates mainly to planned amortization of acquired brand customer and operator relationships as well as software. Adjusted EBIT excludes both items affecting comparability and amortization and of acquisition-related intangible assets since these do not affect cash flow. Hence, we consider adjusted EBIT to be a better measure. And it amounted to SEK 162 million this quarter versus SEK 104 million same period last year.</p><p>Operator, moving to Slide 22. Slide 22 shows a bridge explaining our underlying gross profit development. Significant part of our revenues are passed on as cost of goods sold to mobile operators. We pay them to send messages and place calls, but the rates they charge vary greatly between markets.</p><p>Since pass-through revenues do not contribute to our profits, we focus almost exclusively on gross profit when we assess and steer our business. Changes in our gross margin often reflect changes in geographical mix rather than underlying performance or competitiveness. And over time, we aim to improve gross margin through also delivering additional value-added components to customers.</p><p>The bridge explains the different components in our gross profit growth and organic growth. Consolidated gross profit rose by 43% during the quarter to SEK 460 million versus SEK 321 million last year, same quarter. Positive exchange movements contributed were explained, SEK 4 million or roughly 1% of this increase. The acquired companies, which are then TWW, Chatlayer and myElefant, contributed 19% of this increase. Therefore, organic growth in gross profit in local currency and comparable units was at 24% for the quarter.</p><p>When looking at the segments, gross profit growth in the messaging segment was particularly strong, coming in at 59%, of which, organic growth in local currency was 35%. Acquisitions contributed 23 percentage points and currency fluctuation is an additional 1 percentage point. Adjusted EBITDA over gross profit in the messaging segment also came in at a record of 52% for the quarter as we benefit from increased scale. Gross profit declined by 40% in the voice and video segment. And I think Oscar has talked about sort of the reasons behind that as well as 13% in the operator segment, which are both affected by muted demand due to the ongoing pandemic and the related economic [result].</p><p>Operator, please turn to Slide 23. On Page 23, you see a summary of the number of resources at Sinch. We continue to invest for continued growth. And Oscar already talked about the main areas of resource addition, which are driving internal operational efficiency and quality, increasing our sales and marketing efforts as investment in new technology, and finally, of course, integrating the acquired business.</p><p>I would just briefly touch upon the size of the investment and what we believe will deliver growth during the coming periods. Our headcount is distributed in many different locations across the globe, but the main locations for us are Sweden, the USA and Poland in U.K. being other significant locations. We have grown headcount in the company with 47% during the previous 12 months. Note that these numbers are quarterly averages. And at the end of Q2, we ended at 822 FTEs in the company.</p><p>A lot of the work that has been done is, of course, to support our gross profit growth in the current periods, but there are also investments, among others, in conversational messaging using channels such as WhatsApp. These investments are taken through our income statement as OpEx, and we have very limited capitalization of resource costs, which we believe to be prudent.</p><p>Please turn to Page 24. On Page 24, you will find a bridge from adjusted EBITDA to cash flow before changes in working capital. To explain the effects between these items, we see a delay in paid taxes in certain jurisdictions, primarily in the United States, benefiting short-term cash flow. In the quarter, we have significant acquisition costs related to the announced transactions of SDI and ACL as well. Despite this, we see a cash flow generation from operations of SEK 127 million or 72% in relation to EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>Please turn to Page 25 for the cash flow statement. And the cash flow statement, the cash flow from operating activities was SEK 264 million, which is aided by a strong swing in changes of working capital. Change in working capital can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter because many of our customers maximize their liquidity and also that our rapid growth consumes working capital. So in this quarter, we are especially aided by the low growth in the voice and video and the operator segment, which actually helps our working capital position.</p><p>Due to muted growth in -- yes, and of course, then we also did the new share issue this quarter, which we're very thankful for the continued support from the shareholders, contributing SEK 700 million to fund announced acquisitions.</p><p>Moving on to Page 26. Just to briefly summarize the status of our ongoing acquisition and integration processes. In the case of Wavy, SAP Digital Interconnect, we are pursuing the regulatory approval and performing other steps. I mean in both of these cases, there's also carve-outs to be performed. So that is also being worked upon in parallel. And we hope to be able to close both of these during the second half of 2020. In the case of ACL, we're expecting to close in the current quarter in Q3. And then, of course, once we have closed both SAP and ACL, we will review our synergy assessments that were done preacquisition as well.</p><p>In the acquisitions done earlier and already closed such as TWW, myElefant and Chatlayer, we're happy to see continued progress in all of these businesses. TWW, I think, had a strong gross profit development also in Q2, contributing SEK 48 million in gross profit this quarter. In the case of myElefant, we've actually completed the first stage of the U.S. launch and continued integration with the Sinch platform is ongoing. And in the case of Chatlayer, we continue to work on the integration execution into the Sinch platform.</p><p>Moving to Page 27. Sinch had a positive cash position at the quarter end of SEK 1.5 billion. I would like to state that the net debt-to-EBITDA is ended at 2.1x or negative 2.1x. The financial targets for the company are unchanged from what we have previously stated. We aim to grow adjusted EBITDA per share at 20% per year and keep net debt to adjusted EBITDA under 2.5x.</p><p>Operator, please move to Page 28. Page 28 summarizes our financial leverage pro forma upon closing the announced acquisition. As announced, we believe that our underlying business performance will enable the timely deleveraging, enabling us to meet our financial goals.</p><p>I'm happy to report that at the end of Q2, our pro forma leverage is already below our financial target, although this is subject to future business development and current fluctuation until the time of closing these transactions. We -- at current levels, we expect pro forma net debt over adjusted EBITDA upon closing all of the transactions to be at 2.2.</p><p>With that, I would like to hand back over to Oscar to summarize today's presentation. Oscar?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: So thank you, Roshan. Operator, if you could move to Slide 29, please.</p><p>So the key priorities ahead are obviously -- I mean continue to grow with U.S.-based global tech companies, obviously, a key focus for us. We're also increasing our investments to broaden growth across the base in many different areas. We've done so both organically over the last quarters, and obviously, to a large extent, M&amp;A-driven. And that's an initiative which we'll focus a lot on going forward and have been focusing a lot on.</p><p>Closing of pending transactions is obviously key and integration planning for ACL, SDI and Wavy, and obviously, starting execution once those transactions are closed and right now focusing on the prior integration of the prior -- the transactions that have closed in prior quarters.</p><p>We're also continuing to strengthen our connectivity offering in various areas, both on the voice side and on the messaging side. We're investing in SaaS product for advanced next-generation messaging in order to catch the growth curve that is obviously coming. I mean you only need to look at the nationwide case to understand that pretty much any of our customers is -- will have benefits from moving to the next-generation messaging. It will improve their business performance, and it will improve our ability to charge them because they will need more software and more services in order to move there.</p><p>That said, I want to thank you all for listening so far. And I want to open it up for questions.</p><p>So operator, are there any questions for us, please?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The first question is from the line of Daniel Djurberg from Handelsbanken.</p><p>DANIEL DJURBERG, RESEARCH ANALYST, HANDELSBANKEN CAPITAL MARKETS AB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulations to strong Q2. Question is to Oscar first. You mentioned some messaging volumes were taking up again in the tail of Q2. I guess that came from societies opening up and so on. And do you also have seen this in the end for voice and video, i.e., has ride-hailing, scooters, renting, et cetera, coming back a bit? If you could comment a bit on that as well.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Well, in voice and video, we see the verification business trending fairly well, I should say, and that has been during all of Q2 -- all of COVID. Ride-hailing a bit, but so far, not the major effect, I would say. So yes.</p><p>DANIEL DJURBERG: And if I may, another question on -- you mentioned work on the unified cross-channel API. Can you comment a bit more on this project for your -- and how important it is if you consider yourself an early mover or ahead of your Norwegian colleague, et cetera, and the technology risks involved, et cetera, would be great.</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA: We believe this will be a very important project. We're fairly well advanced. So we're now trialing it in what we closed -- what we call as a close-bid trialing with a set of customers and then coming closer to a launch. So we're well-advanced. We think it's a very important project because we believe that, as we said many times before, companies and customers will want to reach their consumers via any channel, via the channel where the consumer is. And obviously, they don't want to make 10 integrations to someone like us to do that. They want to have 1 interface. We think this is one of the bread and butter APIs going forward.</p><p>As compared to the market, I think we are not an early mover, not extremely late, maybe in the mid in this area, but there are a couple of companies like -- couple of companies like Twilio are out before. On the other hand, we think we are learning from what we've seen in the market and learning from the experience that we're doing and coming out with a solid interface.</p><p>DANIEL DJURBERG: Okay. And would you need additional functionality, you think, e-mail or payment or whatever to put in this cross-channel API or are you quite satisfied with what you have?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: I'm never satisfied. You should know that by now, right? So -- so do we -- I believe there are -- I believe the basis is definitely there. I believe there will be new channels to be added. E-mail or not, I won't comment on, but I definitely believe there will be new channels, and there are multiple channels. And so yes, we'll focus on adding channels to it. I also believe that there are new functionality that can come, and that can come both in the terms of payments is a very interesting area where when enterprises want to do payments in the messages or 2 payments in the voice call, so integrating that in a seamless way into your APIs is interesting. We're not going to be a payment provider, but integrating those type of services. That's definitely an interesting future area. And there are also other interesting areas, such as adding more machine learning functionality into those interfaces or adding more software on top in order to let our customers code less. So I believe there's going to be a continued development of new solid features into these interfaces and other areas.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from the line of Predrag Savinovic from Carnegie.</p><p>PREDRAG SAVINOVIC, RESEARCH ANALYST, CARNEGIE INVESTMENT BANK AB, RESEARCH DIVISION: First one on the Voice and Video segment. And I understand your customers in this segment are having a tough time, and you would clearly see why volumes should be down Q-o-Q. But I'm a bit curious here on the gross margin. It comes down by quite a bunch in year-over-year terms as well while if we look in volumes or at least net sales terms year-over-year, it's pretty flattish. It used to range well above 30%, now at 24%. Can you explain a bit on what happens with the margin here in this segment in this quarter?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Roshan, would you care to take that one?</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA: Yes, just coming off mute here. So I'm happy to comment on that one. I guess, sort of when you're looking at the Voice and Video segment as a whole, I think you have to look at sort of the -- as we always say, I mean, we have the mix between our products verification, number masking, which are the 2 primary products we're selling in this area as well as the mix between sort of the markets where we are selling them, right? And just as we always comment, I mean, gross margin is a factor that very often what the operators charge to face calls in different markets. And therefore, it's more related to that rather than to our own sort of delivery capability.</p><p>PREDRAG SAVINOVIC: That's super. And then another question, then we've seen in several industry reports here on the messaging side and on communications in general that discuss that the adoption of messaging and conversational services as a complement to customer support in general has increased by quite a bunch in this environment. I'm wondering whether you see this adoption, too. I mean you did mention the Nationwide example, but I'm sure Chatlayer, TWW, myElefant as well, there should be more. And what kind of trends do you see here for the services that you have?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: No. That's a very good question. No, we definitely see it. We see that in -- obviously, in the Wavy acquisition. They have a lot of business in that area. So they have a very fast-growing business primarily focused on the customer care side. On SDI, we actually get a unit which is an SDI software unit. It's not really what you talked about, but we see the combination of the Wavy Chatlayer and that unit to be very interesting, but it's actually a full contact center in the cloud. And then we see on the Chatlayer side, large demands on their side, but also large demand on from our existing customers of the Chatlayer service. We just came off a call from the ACL people who wants to sell Chatlayer, for example. So it's very interesting in that area.</p><p>And I think it's driven very, very -- if you just drill it down what it is. I mean a call to a contact center costs around about $5, and you can automate that via -- and you can do that via messaging. And then you can -- and messaging is very easy or it's very suitable for automation because you get the information in the short text format. So basically, you can maybe automate 50% of the incoming calls and, therefore, take down your cost in your call center or contact center to a large degree. So I think that's a very interesting area going forward for many of these businesses. And that's kind of the core area, but then it's also the wider area, which is well doing what -- that's kind of handing incoming calls to contact center, right, where I think a lot of the core volumes will move from voice calls to messaging actually in the core contacts in the world.</p><p>But then you got the wider area, which is more the Nationwide example, which is they want to do customer communication. How do they do that? And you may do proactive communication, sending out the message to inform somebody in order to avoid the call or to actually to drive the calls into them, and that type of combination is not really contact center per se, but it's customer success, right, in the wider area. And that's also an area we see a lot of activity and also a lot of interactivity between the voice business and the messaging business. So 100%, correct. We believe a lot in this area in general.</p><p>PREDRAG SAVINOVIC: That's very encouraging. And again, on the messaging side here, very impressive numbers here from this segment. Can you say what kind of traffic you're seeing growth in terms of maybe by use case? And I know in Q1 there was discussions on airlines, some from health care in general in the U.K., for example. But now in Q2, what is the big driver in year-over-year terms? Because I can assume that airline traffic has come down potentially also from the healthcare side. 2-factor authentication, e-commerce related, can you share some flavor here?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Yes, I mean, it's obviously a lot of transactions. It's a little bit hard to know. But the major drivers here is obviously it is, like we said, I mean, the U.S. big tech, but the U.S. big tech is then -- it may be in turn selling to other companies. So -- but U.S. big tech is definitely one. Then it's obviously banking, banking and finance going strong. And you also have the e-tail -- the e-tail sort portion is obviously also picking up very well. That's the 3 segments I should probably highlight as of today. Yes, that's the 3 larger growth drivers, I think.</p><p>PREDRAG SAVINOVIC: All right. And then finally maybe one for Roshan. In terms of the negative SEK 11.4 million revaluation that impacts EBITDA. And I'm aware the monthly valuation of the balance sheet happens, but I'm not fully grasping what creates this revaluation item impacting the fee here.</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA: There's 2 -- I think there's 2 items. So just we separate those out, right? I think -- and these are 2 items affecting adjusted EBITDA. I think, firstly, one is sort of as the stock prices developed during the quarter, where every month we're doing an evaluation or every quarter we're doing an evaluation of all sort of social insurance costs related to the outstanding options, long-term incentive programs, where we have such social insurance costs in certain markets, and we make a provision in our books for that. And obviously, given the strong share price development, which we're, of course, very happy about. But that leads to a quite large sort of post into -- affecting adjusted EBITDA this quarter, which was around SEK 11 million.</p><p>In addition to that, there's another, I think, around SEK 11 million, which we talked about, which is sort of revaluation of foreign currency. And that is, again, a recurring item that does come every quarter. There's 2 parts to that. One is the -- as we pay sort of accounts payable and receive money from customers, there's a difference in the foreign currency valuation between what we -- what we have on our books and what we get in, and that's sort of all realized gains and losses. And then the other part is unrealized, because everything that's on our balance sheet, we need to revalue at the end of every quarter as well as for the current exchange rate. And the combination of those 2 is another sort of negative bit of SEK 11 million in this quarter. So there's 2 of them.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question is from the line of Ramil Koria from SEB.</p><p>RAMIL KORIA, ANALYST, SEB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a few questions from my side. Starting off in the very short-term here on the OpEx side. This is the second quarter in a row that you commented you are going to halt recruitment to some extent. I can imagine that you have some lag to that. Some processes are already underway in Q1. But how should we reason now or how should we reason now going into Q3 and onwards on the OpEx side given employee benefit expense being such a large part of total?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Yes. You're correct. I mean yes, you're correct about the -- yes, it has a lag. So we did much more conservative recruiting in Q2 than we were in Q1. But obviously, the people coming in, in Q2 were the ones we actually recruited -- signed in Q1 and Q4 and Q1. So I mean there is that type of lag, so you're 100% correct about that. And what we will do in our strategy is, obviously -- I mean seeing the COVID effects and riding those out and understanding those. And therefore, we wanted to be conservative in making sure we can continue to deliver good numbers. As the months pass by now, we feel gradually more and more secure about what do we believe the COVID impact will be for us. Even though it's hard to judge what is the second wave, what's going to happen with the long term, economic downturn, upturn, whatever. Obviously, for us and probably for you as well, hard to judge.</p><p>But that is the strategy. I mean keeping it tight until we see the effects and then setting a new strategy after that. We're still at that stage. So we're still holding tight, but we're then obviously specifically releasing some OpEx for integration. We cannot do this amount of -- or cannot do this amount of M&amp;A without actually taking care of the acquisitions once they come and making sure we can reap the benefits from synergies, et cetera. So there, we have 1 -- we've made 1 round, together with the Board, of releasing a set of OpEx.</p><p>Long term -- or medium term, I think you should think about we will match our OpEx to our gross profit development. So we will -- as long as we see growth, we will let OpEx trail the gross profit development. If we see weaker growth, we will keep OpEx tighter. So that's very much our strategy, along with the lines of the -- or the gross profit per EBITDA -- or EBITDA per gross profit type of growth and keeping that at base or at -- we've been around 45% to 50%. And that's our strategy going forward as well.</p><p>So as long as we hit and continue to hit our OpEx targets, then we'll let up -- our gross profit targets will continue to trail OpEx to that. Was that clear?</p><p>RAMIL KORIA: Clear. Yes. Yes, super clear. Just a follow-up on that. I mean shorter term, if you do halt investments -- and I reckon there's nuances to being tight on recruitment. If you do, say, halt recruitment in the shorter term, and you obviously have a tailwind with especially U.S. big tech, presumably, you'll see a margin expansion in the coming quarters unless you sort of start unwinding. You being tight on the recruitment side is -- or am I sort of thinking -- am I missing...</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: No. Yes, you're correct. You're correct in [see -- and yes,] in practice. On the other hand, we're then saying, all right. When we see the volume increase with those areas, what do we need to support? We have a discussion with the Board and saying, what are the investments we needed to take in order to support the growth and then we kind of release smaller chunks in order to support that growth, and that's very much focused on near-term gross profit growth, if you will. But yes, you're correct. On the other hand, I think maybe the more important one is to kind of -- that we're actually trailing OpEx to GP in the longer term. But you're correct in that sense, yes.</p><p>And then you have -- then as you need to say in that context, you have the M&amp;A playing in as well, right? So -- which is, okay, we need to take care of those. We need to reap the synergies, so therefore, we need to be aggressive on that side even though we're conservative on the other side, if you will. Which will also, of course, skew the short-term picture a little bit because -- yes, so you just don't come quarter 1, basically.</p><p>RAMIL KORIA: Yes. I see we're running out of time, but let me ask a few more, if that's fine. Just on the transaction volumes, in Q1, you were quite clear that March was an exceptional month. We're seeing a pickup now in June. Should we consider that fair to extrapolate? Or was there anything extraordinary in that number?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: I would say -- I mean June was a good month. So it depends what you extrapolate. But what we're seeing -- we're expecting volume to increase in the trend that we have seen before in the more -- in a little bit more long term, yes. But then of course, extrapolating, it's a -- it depends what point you mean. But we don't see anything specific get weird in June.</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA: I don't think we should take a lot of conclusions out of 1 month's traffic trends.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: No. That's (inaudible).</p><p>RAMIL KORIA: Okay. And then on the U.S. big tech side, could you say anything about share of wallet with your biggest accounts right now? And perhaps if the growth we've seen in the last few quarters here is driven by a larger share of wallet and how much is driven by growth with the customer as such? Any flavor on that would be very helpful.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Flavor is both. I think we are both growing with the customers as their volumes are growing. But we also see opportunities, and -- but we're also growing share of wallet. And we see that share of wallet, it's possible to continue to grow with share of wallet. I mean these companies are extremely large. Like I said before, I mean just the 5 largest is the same size as the entire German stock market. So it would be to have every single German listed company as a customer and they would all be heavy customers of your users -- of your services. And that's only the top 5, and we're talking 10 here. So very, very large companies. There are definitely room to grow, but it's obviously hard fight for any revenue dollar or gross profit dollars that you get. I mean this is also very well-known brands and competitive situations.</p><p>THOMAS HEATH: I think we'll need to move on to other questions from other askers, if there are any more in the queue? Then we have some on the conference -- on the web call as well.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next one is from Fredrik Lithell from Danske Bank.</p><p>FREDRIK LITHELL, SENIOR ANALYST, DANSKE BANK A/S, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. My questions have been answered. I hope you have a great summer. I can say that.</p><p>OPERATOR: The line of Predrag wishes to ask a question again.</p><p>PREDRAG SAVINOVIC: I have 1 follow-up on the partnership with Ericsson. I think in this report, you make quite a number of this more so than you've done before on the partnership on 5G SMSF. And I think when you first announced this, it was a bit vague on what kind of economic value you would make here. And now you're sounding kind of bullish on this. Have you gotten more clarity on this side as you do seem more optimistic on the generation you can make? Can you say anything on how this partnership is structured and how that will impact you financially?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Thomas, maybe you want to answer this. I think you're a little bit closer to the people delivering this.</p><p>THOMAS HEATH: Absolutely. I think what we're seeing, generally speaking, is a very positive and good collaboration with Ericsson around this project. And I think it's clear that Ericsson is a leader in this space doing very well. So in that sense, we think there's a positive trajectory here. There are lots of assumptions to sort of -- you have to draw it to gauge the financial scope, what this could result into in terms of how operators choose to enable SMS functionality in 5G networks. There are different routes and different parts of the tech stack that an operator can use to power these services. So I think what we're seeing is that a little faster than expected and very positive early feedback, but too early to quantify in a meaningful way.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: And what's happening right now, it's being pitched to the large operators in the world. That's the status, and we need to see what's happening. On the other hand, you should also -- I mean context-wise, you'd put it in the context of the operator business, right. So you just have the context of the size here. It's not affecting the main business of Sinch. It's kind of more on the operator side. But it's a very good deal for that side of the business.</p><p>THOMAS HEATH: I think we have a few questions from the conference call I wanted to bring up.</p><p>First, we have [RR]. I think that's close to an anonymous asker, but we'll put your question through. Saying, you said you're a leader in North America. How do you see your competitive position compared to Twilio, what we understand is the leader not Sinch? Oscar, I think I'll leave that with you.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: So yes, Twilio is the largest player in the CPaaS market in general. So yes, that's true. I think we are a leader, one of the leaders in North America, Europe, India and Latin America. And I'm by that not saying are we exactly the largest, but one of the absolute leaders in those markets. And yes, we're definitely at those volumes together with all the acquisitions we've made. Compared to Twilio, Twilio is, if you would compare the 2 companies, we said this many times before and we respect Twilio, we think they're a great company. Twilio is stronger than us on the developer go-to-market and marketing generated lead funnels. They're much stronger on that side. They have a much wider base of customers and a much wider base of small customers. Twilio has a lot of large customers as well. But if we do in general where they're stronger than us, so they're stronger than us on that side. Twilio also has a broader product portfolio. So they have more software services. They also acquired an email company and et cetera. So they have a broader set of software services and also into email and a set of other segments where we are not.</p><p>Where we are typically stronger than Twilio is high-quality international delivery. Twilio does not own their own network. They don't own the operator connections to a lot of operators around the world. Actually, they don't own operator access even into the U.S. So on international, high-quality delivery, we typically stand up very well to Twilio, and that's why you can see, obviously, the growth -- our strong growth on the largest companies in the world because when these companies want to find the suppliers, they typically want to go to the source. And then, there we are a very strong contender.</p><p>Then, I mean, obviously, Twilio is moving in this direction. They're strengthening the network, and we are moving in the other direction. So it's not black and white. But if we stylize it, that's the main difference.</p><p>Yes. And I would also say, I mean, I think good competition -- I mean having good competitors is always good. I think there will be a set of leaders in this industry, a set of winners in this industry. And I do believe that Twilio will be out there, and I believe -- I do believe that Sinch will be out there. All right, Thomas.</p><p>THOMAS HEATH: All right. The last question, I think, we'll answer this jointly. The question from [Casper Urskin] is, what percentage of revenue is currently generated from U.S. tech companies? And how does this develop over time and what additional services can be sold into this base?</p><p>And I'll start with the first part, just saying, we don't give the specifics on the size of different customer segments. But perhaps to give some color on it without the numbers, Oscar?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: So could you repeat the question again? I missed the last part of that question.</p><p>THOMAS HEATH: Yes. So first, it's basically, how does the U.S. tech companies, our business with U.S. tech company, how does that develop over time? And what additional services can be sold into this space of customers?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Yes. So to -- yes, it's obviously -- I mean like we're reporting over several quarters, it has been developing very well. It's one of our growth engines. And I think when you sit with those type of large companies and you're delivering a good service and you're doing that quarter-by-quarter, you get the chance to pitch for new businesses. And we have a strategy to do that, and we see that happening all the time. So -- and we obviously hope that will continue.</p><p>The type of services that these companies want are similar to some others, but not all others. But they typically -- they're very data-driven. They typically want automation in any form because their volumes are so large. So they typically request APIs to do different things than to send messaging. It may be APIs to set up accounts, APIs to get the data in a specific format, APIs to understand the performance of the delivery since they actually automate the routing based on performance. So various forms of APIs to automate their own business and their own purchasing and so they understand what they buy from us is one category.</p><p>They are obviously then interested in the quality. So moving from selling just this message is delivered to moving to sell in your verification space. You move to sell this phone number is verified to may -- add the kind of data-driven analysis before it, so you actually can sell on a higher level. You sell the quality and you don't sell only the message delivery is another category. Then we see increasing interest on the new or next-generation messaging side where we do see interest from all of these businesses from some parts, but not from other parts. But that's another area which is interesting. And we see an increasing demand on the voice side from quite a set of those companies. That's probably the major areas as of today.</p><p>THOMAS HEATH: And that was a good list. I think we're a bit over time. And I think we have some questions in the queue coming back again. So I think we'll finish up at this stage.</p><p>Thank you, everyone, for participating. I hope to keep you posted in the future as well.</p><p>And with that, I'll leave for some closing remarks to you, Oscar.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Thanks a lot. I'm very happy to have you listen to our quarter report this quarter. I'm happy to report strong numbers. And we are looking forward to work hard to continue to do that and continue to report strong numbers in the future.</p><p>That said, I want to close this call. Thank you all for listening.</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. That concludes your conference for today. You may all disconnect.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p><p>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Lucy Rutishauser, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. You may begin</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, INC.: Thank you, operator. Participating on the call with me today are Chris Ripley, President and CEO; Rob Weisbord, President of Broadcast and Chief Advertising Revenue Officer; and Billy Chambers, COO and CFO of Local Sports. Before we begin, Billie Jo McIntire will make our forward-looking statement disclaimer.</p><p>BILLIE JO MCINTIRE, DIRECTOR OF IR, SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, INC.: Certain matters discussed on this call may include forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, future operating results. Such statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results in the future could differ from those described in the forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors. Such factors have been set forth in the company's most recent reports as filed with the SEC and included in our second quarter earnings release.</p><p>The company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. The company uses its website as a key source of company information, which can be accessed at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sbgi.net\">www.sbgi.net</url>. In accordance with Regulation FD, this call is being made available to the public. A webcast replay will be available on our website and will remain available until our next quarterly earnings release.</p><p>Included on the call will be a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, specifically adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow and leverage. The company considers adjusted EBITDA to be an indicator of the operating performance of its assets. The company also believes that adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by industry analysts, investors and lenders as a measure of valuation. These measures are not formulated in accordance with GAAP, are not meant to replace GAAP measurements and may differ from other companies' uses or formulations. The company does not provide reconciliations on a forward-looking basis. Further discussions and reconciliations of the company's non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on its website, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sbgi.net\">www.sbgi.net</url>.</p><p>Chris Ripley will now take you through our operating highlights.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, INC.: Thank you. Like many of you, we eagerly await discussing the state of the company without the backdrop of COVID-19. The past 5 months have certainly been challenging for the country, the economy, the industry and us as we face the pandemic's impact on businesses and consumers alike.</p><p>First, I want to say how very proud I am of our employees who have done a tremendous job of adapting quickly to a new way of doing business. Is there -- it is through their hard work and perseverance that we've been able to operate our business seamlessly without sacrificing the quality that defines our company. We are already identifying learnings that we can take away from this period of time that can make us a stronger company going forward.</p><p>With regard to the second quarter trends, as we move through the quarter, we did begin to see signs of improvement in the advertising market, just as we anticipated and guided on our last call. After a very challenging April, in which core advertising for our broadcast and other segment declined 43% year-over-year. June improved to a 26% decline, resulting in second quarter core advertising performance for those segments to be down 36% and in the middle of our guidance range. Our decision to give you second quarter guidance on the May call was driven by our commitment to be as transparent as possible, while also acknowledging the limitations that giving guidance for the entire year was impractical due to the wide range of variance that could result from uncertainties in timing, pace and magnitude of recovery.</p><p>While we are still faced with many of those same challenges and changing dynamics around the effects of the pandemic, making forecasting more difficult than usual. We have decided to once again provide guidance for the upcoming quarter. As a reminder, we are starting to enter the peak political season, which is still expected to be a record political year and will help mitigate the weakness in core advertising space.</p><p>We are pleased with the professional sports leagues that have resumed their schedules, although they are shortened. It is very clear that viewers are excited as well with ratings for the first day of the MLB season, up 32% on our RSNs as compared to last year's opening day viewership. And as we've discussed previously, our contracts with the sports teams already contemplate scenarios where there may be shortfalls and the number of live games delivered to us. And in such cases, we are entitled to remuneration from the teams for any games falling short of the guarantees that are defined in the contracts. And conversely, we have distributors to whom we guarantee minimum games of live games in contracts with us.</p><p>I will leave it to Lucy to explain some of the ramifications of the timing and impact of rebates due to and from Sinclair as a result of the shortened 2020 season. I want to emphasize that contrary to reports out in the public at this time, we do not expect the rebates from the teams to be greater than what we pay out to distributors. Given differences in the way rebates are calculated in the team versus distributor contracts and other variances in the contracts.</p><p>Speaking of our sports business, there are a lot of exciting things going on behind the scenes of Sinclair. As we announced several weeks ago, we hired Steve Rosenberg, a highly accomplished broadcast and programming executive as President of Local Sports. Steve, along with Billy Chambers, who is the Local Sports COO and CFO, will report into Rob Weisbord and help fill the void left by the upcoming departure of Jeff Krolik, who is retiring as the head of our RSN business at the end of this month. I want to personally thank Jeff for all his assistance and hard work in helping integrate the RSNs into Sinclair. He has been a valuable resource to me and the rest of the company, and we all wish him well in future endeavors.</p><p>A few words about Steve. For over 25 years, Steve has been a dynamic force in broadcasting, excelling in a number of key sales, marketing, distribution and executive management roles. During his career, Steve has been a true pioneer of innovative and creative sales, marketing and programming efforts. Steve will play a key role in growing our sports business. His ability to challenge the status quo and bring about innovative ways to monetize opportunities will be fully utilized by Sinclair. One of his first priorities will be to use is programming expertise to help elevate our nongame programming on the RSNs and our stadium network. The majority of the programming hours on these networks does not involve live games. So there is a significant opportunity to improve our viewership and revenue-generating capabilities in these time periods.</p><p>I also want to mention that Scott Shapiro has taken an additional role of Chief Strategy Officer of Sports, and we'll focus on some of our larger growth opportunities, such as those associated with legalized sports spend. We have other exciting developments in our Sports business coming up as well with a number of significant growth opportunities on the horizon. As consumer viewing habits continue to evolve, we are committed to giving them an exceptional experience when and where they choose to watch us.</p><p>We're expecting the sports app that is in development will give yours an experience unlike anything they've encountered in the past with enhanced graphics and sound as well as the ability to interact with the content in numerous ways, including with advertisers and free play games. We spent a lot of time meeting with many of the major players in sports betting, and we expect to be able to more fully detail our plans in this area later this year. As the exclusive provider of local sports content for more than half of the MLB, NBA and NHL teams, we believe we are in a unique position to monetize the significant sports betting opportunity that exists.</p><p>Other highlights in the quarter include next-gen TV launches in multiple markets, including Las Vegas, Nashville, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City and Portland, Oregon, with another 10 or so Sinclair markets targeted by the end of the year. It is exciting to see this groundbreaking technology in action. There has been a great deal of effort within Sinclair for many years to create and bring this technology, the future of broadcast TV to the marketplace. Its impact, however, will be felt far beyond traditional broadcasting applications.</p><p>Yes, next-gen TV will deliver significant enhancement to television broadcast quality, but that just scratches the surface. The new platform gives broadcasters significant flexibility in using their broadcast spectrum. For starters, it dramatically increases spectrum capacity, allowing for more channels and targeted content to be sent over the existing spectrum band. Those signals will reach deep into buildings, moving vehicles and eventually people's phones, opening up a wealth of opportunities for applications, diverse targeted advertising, data delivery, premium content or sending advanced emergency information, all in a mobile and portable manner. The signals also have interoperability with the Internet, including 5G, creating even more ways to satisfy consumer needs and to monetize the new technology.</p><p>I applaud all of our employees who have been involved over the many years to make this game-changing technology a reality. Innovation is the lifeblood of this company, and it never ceases to amaze me the accomplishments of our talented employees at Sinclair are able to achieve.</p><p>In July, we came to terms with Comcast to renew distribution rights for all of our businesses, including our broadcast stations, tennis channel, the RSNs and yes, as well as a full launch of Marquee in time for the Cubs' first game of the season. The narrative that has been on the street regarding fears around completing the deal with Comcast or that terms would be unfavorable to Sinclair or that our broadcast stations will be dragged down by the RSNs was just incorrect.</p><p>As we've said, we are -- we were confident that we would reach an agreement with Comcast that was positive for us, and we are happy with the outcome in all regards. This agreement is another example of the benefits that come from negotiating for a large, diverse set of very popular programming assets in this business, and it is an undeniable affirmation, the importance of local news and sports, which consistently get high ratings and are highly valued by distributor subscribers.</p><p>It is also important to note that our deal not only includes the launch of Marquee, but expanded viewing coverage of the new RSN beyond where the Cubs RSN was previously carried. This is something Comcast doesn't do for its own RSN in the Chicago area and didn't even in the past when the RSN included the Cubs. This was accomplished without giving up carriage of other assets in our portfolio and while still achieving what we believe are favorable rates throughout our portfolio.</p><p>With the completion of the Comcast agreement, we have now locked up almost 85% of the RSNs total subscribers for at least 2 years and beyond.</p><p>Also during the quarter, we agreed to a multiyear renewal for 8 stations with ViacomCBS. And on the Sports side, we have an agreement principle with one team that expired at the end of last season. In June, we announced we would be launching a new headline news service in early 2021, focused on breaking new stories as they develop and sourcing them from our comprehensive local news resources. Think of it as breaking meaningful local news stories on a national level. In its initial phase, the new service is expected to be launched on approximately 50 of our CW and myTV network affiliates and will be broadcast from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. each weekday as well as on our free ad-supported app store.</p><p>On the community front, we awarded our annual broadcast diversity scholarship to 10 talented students who are pursuing a career in the broadcast industry. And in July, we launched a new campaign with the American Red Cross for urgently needed blood donations utilizing our news production resources to create messaging and awareness of the urgent need and to encourage viewers to donate blood. The campaign's day of commitment was held on June 30, with the campaign continuing through mid-August.</p><p>Finally, I want to discuss -- I want to address the initiatives around our capital structure that we continue to evaluate and act upon. We continue to believe our securities are significantly undervalued. This belief is reflected in our actions, including the continued repurchase of our equity during the quarter. Since February of this year and through to date, we have repurchased approximately 19 million shares, representing 21% of the total shares outstanding as of the beginning of the year. While our proposed exchange of Diamond's unsecured notes resulted in lower participation than we expected, we believe the lender's decision not to exchange indicates their belief in the long-term positive value of Diamond. As indicated previously, we continue to engage with financial institutions on ways to optimize the capital structure to delever and lower our cost of capital.</p><p>Now I'll turn it over to Lucy to discuss our financial performance.</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: Thank you, Chris. First off, I want to echo Chris' appreciation of all of our employees who have done a terrific job of navigating the current environment and enabling us to perform at a high level as a company. Keep in mind that the inclusion of the Sports segment this year, which was not in last year's first 8-month numbers is responsible for many of the larger changes in our actual results versus the same period last year. Therefore, in many cases, I will be speaking about results versus prior year pro forma, which is a much more meaningful comparison and assumes we own the RSNs in those periods.</p><p>Before getting into the results, let me walk you through the accounting for the distributor and team rebates and the sports rights amortization as a result of the fewer professional games played. Pursuant to GAAP, we are required to accrue the total estimated rebate amount owed to the distributors across Q2 through Q4 of this year, which will reduce distribution revenue in each quarter. The cash outlay to the distributors, however, is not expected to occur until after 2020.</p><p>On the team side, the rebate associated with the overpayment for the fewer games to be played in the season, is expected to be realized in part in the third quarter with the majority in the fourth quarter of this year as lower sports rights payments. Therefore, adjusted EBITDA for the year is expected to reflect both the team rebates to us and our rebates to the distributors. And as Chris mentioned, we do expect rebates from the teams to be greater than what we pay out to the distributors. However, there will be a timing as it pertains to the cash flow with us realizing the benefit of the lower sports rights payments this year in advance of the distributor rebates being made in -- after 2020.</p><p>Sports rights amortization, which is included in the media and programming production expense line and which is noncash and not factored into the calculation of adjusted EBITDA, gets recognized over the applicable sports season. So in the second quarter, there were no professional games played and therefore, sports rights amortization was minimal. We expect sports rights amortization for the third quarter to increase nearing the high level of sports games currently scheduled in the period.</p><p>For fourth quarter, the sports rights amortization is expected to be much lower with Baseball's regular season likely completed and with NBA and NHL games for the 2021 season likely starting later in the quarter than normal.</p><p>All right. So turning to the consolidated company results. Consolidated media revenue for the second quarter increased $539 million due to the inclusion of the local sports segment, which was not in last year's second quarter results. On a pro forma basis, total media revenues of $1.260 billion were down versus last year's second quarter media revenues of $1.710 billion due to a number of factors, which we have previously discussed, most notably, the weakness in the advertising market due to the pandemic, the absence of live sports, the associated accrual for the distributor rebates and the absence of DISH carriage fees. As compared to guidance, media revenues came in below the range we gave on our last earnings call by $119 million. However, this is important. This is due to the $124 million of the distributor rebates that we accrued during the quarter, which was not included in our guidance last quarter because at that time, we didn't know how many games were -- the leagues were going to schedule. So if you exclude the accrued rebate, our revenue would have been within our guidance range.</p><p>Media revenues of $669 million for our broadcast and other segments, which excludes the RSNs, were within our guidance range with both advertising and distribution revenues coming in as expected. As Chris mentioned, the advertising market improved as we moved through the quarter. June ended with our broadcast and other segments declining 26% over the same period last year, which was a significant improvement over the 43% drop in April. July has seen the improvement continuing, finishing down 20% for the month. And even as political ramps up in the third quarter and is expected to displace other advertising categories, we still expect to finish the third quarter down 15% to 22% in core advertising, which is an improvement over the second quarter performance.</p><p>Subscriber churn in the second quarter across all of our segments was 7% on a year-over-year basis, that's slightly higher than the trend over the past few quarters, but understandable given the impact of COVID on the economy and the number of people that are unemployed in the country.</p><p>Consolidated media operating expenses of $569 million were down 50% on a pro forma basis compared to last year's $1.139 billion, and that's due to the absence of the live games, the lower sports rights amortization and proactive cost controls. Our focus on managing our expenses during the quarter drove the $11 million positive variance to guidance.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis increased 31% to $254 million due to the inclusion of the local sports segment. On a pro forma basis, adjusted EBITDA declined $391 million, driven by a $330 million decline at the local sports segment and a $61 million decline at the broadcast and other segments.</p><p>The Sports segment adjusted EBITDA of $110 million was down from last year's pro forma $440 million, and that's due to the distributor rebate accrual, the absence of DISH, which was in last year's numbers and the impact of COVID on the number of games. It is important to keep in mind that unlike GAAP, the results for the Sports segment which included minimal amortization due to no live sports being played, local sports adjusted EBITDA reflected the continuation of sports payments made during the quarter.</p><p>So just to put this simply. The Sports segment results during the quarter reflect the approval for the rebates to the distributors, but no benefit from the expected rebates from the teams, which are expected in the second half of the year. Again, excluding the accrued rebate, we beat total company adjusted EBITDA on additional cost controls at the broadcast and other segments.</p><p>Consolidated adjusted free cash flow, excluding the nonrecurring legal ligation COVID transaction and regulatory items of $9 million was $46 million, that's $79 million below the lower end of our guidance. But again, excluding the rebate accrual, we have -- we exceeded our guidance slightly. For the first 6 months of 2020, adjusted free cash flow was $156 million. And using our estimated share count through yesterday of approximately 79 million shares outstanding, that reflects additional shares that we bought back here in the third quarter, that results in free cash flow per share of $2.11 in the 6-month period.</p><p>Diluted earnings per share on 81 million weighted average common shares at June 30 was $3.12 in the quarter, or $3.21 when adjusted for nonrecurring items. Our liquidity position in both credit silos is strong, with neither silos revolver drawn, and both silos having ample cash on hand. During the quarter, we launched an exchange for all of the outstanding Diamond 6 5/8% senior notes, $66 million of the aggregate principal amount or approximately 4% of the outstanding issue was exchanged for $31 million of new 12 3/4% notes and cash payments of approximately $10 million. In total, the transaction reduced our debt by $35 million.</p><p>Now while we would have liked to have exchanged more of the bonds, the feedback we received was that the noteholders agreed with us that the bonds are undervalued, and so chose to hold on for the future upside. As Chris said, that is a strong message for all holders of our cap structure.</p><p>We continued our stock buyback program during the quarter, repurchasing over 5 million shares of our common stock at an average price of just over $16 per share. So far, for the third quarter-to-date, we have repurchased over 4 million additional shares. Since the start of the year, 21% of the total shares outstanding and 29% of the float have been bought back.</p><p>During the quarter, we continue to execute on our plan to reduce costs with savings both for the short-term and the longer term. We continue to scrutinize all spending, delaying or eliminating nonessential expenses, including open positions, media and promotional spend, T&amp;E and CapEx, in addition to the variable expenses to come with fewer games and lower revenues. And we continue to look for additional opportunities. We are confident that we can handle a prolonged period of weakness by executing the opportunities identified as well as additional steps we could take, if necessary.</p><p>Turning to segment details for the Broadcast and Other segments, media revenues decreased 7% versus the same period a year ago as advertising revenue was significantly impacted by the pandemic. A 36% decline in core advertising revenue was partially offset by higher political revenue and an increase in distribution revenue. The broadcast segment's revenue also benefited from $25 million in management incentive fees paid by the local sports segment that was not in last year's Q1-- Q2 results, and gets eliminated in consolidation. We came in at the middle of our revenue guidance range in $12 million over the high end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance.</p><p>For the Sports segment, media revenues of $616 million decreased 38% versus pro forma results of $992 million in the second quarter of last year. Much of the decline was expected and was due primarily to the absence of DISH, the lack of advertising revenues related to the postponement of the games, subscriber churn and the accrual distributor rebate. Excluding the accrued rebate, we were very close to guidance.</p><p>Media expenses in the second quarter were $106 million, an 84% decline to last year's pro forma $659 million. As explained, this is primarily the result of minimal sports rights amortization being booked in the quarter due to no professional games being played. As compared to guidance, media expenses were slightly higher as a result of slightly higher-than-expected production programming expenses.</p><p>Local sports adjusted EBITDA of $110 million for the quarter was below pro forma results of $440 million last year, and below our guidance range of $190 million to $202 million, again, due to the distributor rebate accrual and if you exclude the rebate accrual, we would have beat our local sports adjusted EBITDA guidance. So hopefully, you're seeing a trend here as it relates to the distributor rebate accrual. If you back that out, we were -- we either met or exceeded all of our guidance in the second quarter.</p><p>So now turning to the consolidated balance sheet. The consolidated cash at the end of the quarter was $622 million, that includes $171 million at STG and $436 million at Diamond. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $12.399 billion, and the net leverage ratio for consolidated for Sinclair at quarter end was 6.4x. Sinclair Television Group's first-lien indebtedness ratio on a trailing 8 quarters was 2.6x, on a covenant of 4.5x. And 4.5x on a net leverage basis through the bonds. Diamond's first-lien indebtedness ratio on a trailing 4 quarters was 6.5x on a covenant of 6.25%, which, again, only springs if the revolver is drawn over 35%. On a total net leverage basis through the bonds, Diamond was levered 8.5x.</p><p>In terms of guidance, there is still much uncertainty around the resilience of the economy and COVID's impact. Our guidance will, therefore, be limited to the third quarter. Keep in mind that any change to the expected plans in the sports leagues could cause our reported local sports results to deviate meaningfully from our guidance.</p><p>For our broadcast and other segments, our third quarter media revenue guidance is $777 million to $805 million. That is up approximately 6% to 10% from last year's pro forma $733 million. This is driven by higher political and distribution revenue, which is partially offset by a projected 15% to 22% decline in core advertising. Adjusted EBITDA for the broadcast and other segments is expected to be between $187 million and $211 million compared to $216 million pro forma last year.</p><p>For the Sports segment, third quarter media revenue is expected to be $718 million to $727 million. That's down 15% to 16% to last year's pro forma $858 million. The projections include the impact from the distributor rebate accrual. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $402 million to $410 million as compared to $425 million pro forma last year, with the decline primarily due to the distributor rebate accrual, the absence of DISH carriage fees and subscriber churn, offset by lower rights payments to the teams.</p><p>I do want to point out that there is a sizable increase in GAAP media expenses in Q3. That is as a result of MLB, NBA and NHL sports rights amortization being expensed in the quarter, again, reflecting when the games will be played. While this increases expenses on a GAAP basis, it is a noncash item that does not impact adjusted EBITDA, which is based on sports rights payments, not the rights amortization. As mentioned before, the sports rights payments reflect the offsetting benefit from the teams on the fewer games with some of that partially reflected in Q3 and the majority in Q4.</p><p>For the consolidated company, third quarter media revenues are expected to be $1.460 billion to $1.497 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $589 million to $621 million, and adjusted free cash flow of $374 million to $411 million. Based on our current share count of approximately 74 million shares, this equates to free cash flow per share of approximately $5.05 to $5.55 in the third quarter.</p><p>So with that, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Aaron Watts of Deutsche Bank.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: I have a few questions I wanted to run through quickly. I guess, first, on the television station group. Encouraged to see the improvement month-to-month in core advertising. Are you seeing any fits and starts on that in your market that are seeing some ebbs and flows of COVID cases? And also, are the bookings coming in a lot later relative to where you've kind of trended historically or at least in the prior year?</p><p>ROBERT D. WEISBORD, PRESIDENT OF BROADCAST &amp; CHIEF ADVERTISING REVENUE OFFICER, SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, INC.: Yes, I'll handle that. This is Rob. We are not seeing the fits and starts. It's been pretty consistent. You're correct. It's being booked a little bit later. They're holding on to it to see how the COVID is affecting the different DMAs that we're in. However, we've been encouraged through our virtual trainings, virtual sales presentations that we've been able to communicate in this new norm and being able to handle it, and that's why you're seeing the positivity and the pace moving forward.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS: Okay. And in terms of bookings coming in later or early?</p><p>ROBERT D. WEISBORD: No, the bookings are coming in later. Growing more month-to-month than they are quarterly, semiannually or annually.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS: Okay. Got it. And then as best as you have clarity on today, can you give us the latest on the stability of the underlying sub base for your station group and the RSNs? And has your near term, medium-term outlook for cord-cutting changed at all based on what you're seeing right now?</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: Yes. So I'll take that one. So Aaron, as we -- as I mentioned, we saw across all the platforms, subscriber churn year-over-year, down about 7%. Again, that's really coming from one primary MVPD. But we have -- what you're going to see in our guidance for Q3 is that we have pretty much mirrored that level of churn, and that's really based on some of the public commentary from the distributors themselves here recently as well as just really not having a lot of visibility as to what's going to happen with the churn. As we talked about, there's 2 schools of thought that are out there. One is that people currently may churn just because of the status of their employment and the economy. But on the other hand, right, you do have government assistance for those people. You also have the fact that, again, the TV is really the only form of entertainment that's out there right now. And especially right now with the games, people not being able to go to the games in order to watch their favorite team, local team, they would have to see those on the RSN. So 2 divergent views there. I really don't know where it ends up. So to be conservative, we have forecasted our Q3 to mirror the Q2 levels.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a couple of questions from me on the Diamond Sports side. With the Comcast renewal now inked. I assume you have a pretty large percentage of your distribution locked up over the next few years. Is that a fair statement? Do you have a percentage that you could give us of kind of what is locked in now? And for how long?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: So 85% of the RSN subscribers are locked in for 2 years or more.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS: Perfect. And Lucy, I just want to make sure I was clear on your comments, and I appreciate all the color around kind of the rebates and the refunds from the teams. If I'm just specifically thinking about cash in, cash out, to be clear, when do you expect kind of cash in from the teams in terms of the rebates there? And I think you said the cash out to the MVPDs will happen next year. Am I hearing that right or thinking about that right?</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: Yes. So contractually, with the distributors, the -- because of the measurement periods, the cash out would occur after 2020. Each contract is different so I'm not going to get into the whens after that. But the rebates and the overpayments for -- to the teams, all occurs this year, some in Q3, but the majority really in Q4 once we get through the full season.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS: And in the end, those cash in, cash out obviously, differences in timing, but you're saying that those should be relatively equal or even the rebates from the teams to you should be greater than what you have to pay out to the MVPDs?</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: Yes. So what I'm saying is the amount that we get in will be greater than the amount that we pay out, and that's really because of the variability, the differences in how the minimum games are all calculated from one contract to the next.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS: Okay. Perfect. And last one for me...</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: Aaron, just to be clear because, again, there are -- there's a lot of misinformation on the street as it relates to this with people modeling that Diamond is going to pay more than what they get in. And as Chris said, those are just not correct. We expect to get in more than what we will pay out because of the differences in the calculations.</p><p>AARON LEE WATTS: Okay. Perfect. I'm glad. Last one for me. And again, appreciate the time. You repaid your revolver outstanding balance. It sounds like you're comfortable with liquidity. How do you think about that liquidity now going forward as you look at where your bonds are currently trading? I don't think I heard anything about more bond buybacks this quarter. I know you also still have preferred stock outstanding. How do you kind of weigh the order of importance of attacking those different opportunities? And that's it.</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: Sure, Aaron. So look, so we have -- our first and foremost, right, is the priority to continue to grow Diamond, right, whether it's through acquisitions, investments for the growth opportunities. But we are also committed to strengthening the capital table, lowering our cost of capital and deleveraging, right? So as we previously have discussed on other calls, and we will continue to look for ways, right, to deploy the cash and to capital -- optimize the capital structure. So look, everything is on the table right now. We're evaluating a lot of things. So it could be anything from redeeming the preferred, additional debt exchanges, receivable financings, designating subs is unrestricted as well as looking at new acquisition opportunities and again, investing for all the growth opportunities, which is the reason why we bought Diamond. So all of those things are being evaluated and on the table.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is coming from Dan Kurnos of Benchmark Company.</p><p>DANIEL LOUIS KURNOS, MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, THE BENCHMARK COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just so we're, I guess, maybe all clear in terms of some more granularity just around Comcast and Marquee. Just -- Lucy, thanks for the color around subs, it helps all part of the equation. Just trying to understand sort of the timing of when -- Marquee, was it all just when the Comcast deal was done? I'm just trying to sort of understand the distribution delta from 2Q to 3Q on the RSN side? Or if there's some other rebate, increased rebate nuance that we might be missing?</p><p>And then on the core side, maybe, Rob, you could just give us some more color just on sort of category improvement and sort of where you're seeing the particular pockets of strength? And what gives you the confidence that we kind of continue to sequentially improve throughout the year?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Okay, Dan, I'll speak to Comcast, and Rob will speak to the core question. In terms of changes, not much changed with Comcast at all. They continue to carry all the RSNs. They previously carried all of the Tennis Channel, our broadcast stations, the only real change was Marquee, and they picked up marquee the moment they signed the agreement. And as I noted in the prepared remarks, Marquee ended up getting into new geographies that the cuts were not previously distributed on. So we're very happy with that outcome.</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: And Dan, let me just answer your question on the dollars. So with the -- so there, we do have the distributor rebate accrued in Q3. As we said, that will hit Q2, Q3 and Q4. So you are seeing that delta. As well as, remember, the RSN contract doesn't actually come up until the end of the quarter. That's when it expires. So you would not see the Comcast impact in the Q3 numbers.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: And just a side note there, so you understand, even though the RSN contract was renewed early and it doesn't actually expire until the end of September. That's because we did this all as one deal and everything will be coterminous on the other side.</p><p>DANIEL LOUIS KURNOS: Rob, before you answer, just, Chris, just on that, does that -- the TV side then is pushed back to the RSN start date now? Because I think that's a bit of nuance that might be missed there.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: No. Actually, the TV side is going forward to the RSN expiration.</p><p>DANIEL LOUIS KURNOS: Okay. And then, Rob, your comments on core?</p><p>ROBERT D. WEISBORD: Sure. Yes. On the strength, we continue to see services perform well. We have pharmaceutical that has joined the strength, and we're seeing the education category pick up as well. We expect in the back half, towards the end of third quarter going in the fourth quarter to see auto getting healthier than what we've seen it. They've had a supply chain issue. We expect that to be fixed as the plants have been reopened. And the '21s, we'll be hitting the dealerships.</p><p>So again, we've become less reliant on the auto business to drive our revenue. And as in the past, I'll reiterate that we've gone from ourselves being [generalist to] specialists, and that continues to lead to a better performances.</p><p>DANIEL LOUIS KURNOS: Got it. That's helpful. And Chris, I apologize if I missed this. Did you give us an update on where you're at with the DTC?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: No, we haven't -- that was not in my remarks. There's a lot of work going on in DTC right now, it's definitely going to be an important part of the future for the RSNs for tennis and also for broadcast. And it's too early right now to give specific guidance, but we are busy adding that feature to our new digital reboot, which will come out next year, and it will be complementary to the MVPD product that we have today.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is coming from Davis Hebert of Wells Fargo.</p><p>JAMES DAVIS HEBERT, DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR HIGH YIELD ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I want to ask on the current accruals and the rebates, I understand, I think, the cash flow piece. How firm are those rebate levels, I mean, to the extent MLB stops and starts or maybe further under-delivers on those live games?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Yes. So the numbers could obviously change if the number of games change. And it's really just a mathematical calculation. And the sort of hedged nature of our contracts would continue to apply as the games continue to shrink.</p><p>JAMES DAVIS HEBERT: Okay. But would it be fair to say that if there are -- if you delivered -- under delivered, it's not going to be material to what you've already accrued for?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: It shouldn't be material to our actual EBITDA at the end of the day, but it could certainly increase the amount of rebates from the teams and the amount of rebates to the MVPDs.</p><p>JAMES DAVIS HEBERT: Okay. Understood. And then on the team payment side, is all that getting taken care of this year? Or have you had negotiations with the teams to perhaps, smooth that out over a longer period of time? Or are there other negotiations going on?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: It should all happen this year to the extent some teams have issues from a cash flow perspective, we'll have to see. We have no indication of that so far. And what we've been doing is essentially withholding current payments right now to chip away the balance.</p><p>JAMES DAVIS HEBERT: Okay. And then, Lucy, you mentioned a lot of different liability management possibilities. I wondered, would a tender offer, perhaps, be in the conversations in capture discount in Diamond sports bonds, just thinking you'll be sitting on a decent amount of cash at the political, maybe that's an open win versus an exchange. But just curious your thoughts on something like that.</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: Well, so the political revenues are really belong to STG. And again, we've said in the past that each silo would be self-funded. So STG's political has really gone to shareholder returns, whether it's the dividend or the share repurchases. And Diamond's cash flow is there to fund Diamond. So we would not look to pull STG's cash over to Diamond for that. But again, when you're talking as much debt as diamond has outstanding, anything we do, I think you should expect would be a bigger type transaction.</p><p>JAMES DAVIS HEBERT: Okay. And then my last question is, I believe you had a year to rebrand the RSMs. I'm just curious, the timing on that or if you got to reprieve with the COVID-19 situation.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: We have [still] more than a year on that. And the new name will be announced and released early next year.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our next question is coming from Steven Cahall of Wells Fargo.</p><p>STEVEN LEE CAHALL, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: So maybe if we've learned one thing about the RSN business. It's just that the earnings power may be a little lower. And so the debt level that you originally decided was appropriate, might be a little too high. And Davis asked and, we've talked a little bit about ways to renegotiate that debt level down. Just a really big overhang on what's otherwise a really good TV broadcast business. So if you kind of step back, how do you really think about just steps that you can take to remove that overhang from the debt on the RSN business so that you can capture more of the fair value in the TV business?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Well, as we mentioned, we're busy looking at several alternatives for -- to delever Diamond that we think there are many options there. And as I've stated many times that we see these entities as independent and self-funding. So we don't see any reason for value or cash to be going from one silo to the other. And really, we are looking at our valuation, and should be done on some of the parts basis.</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: Yes. And Steve, look, what I would add is, I think what people are missing is the investment thesis of why we bought the RSNs in the first place, right? So as we look ahead, right, you've got it -- including all the growth opportunities and the synergies, which, again, is the reason we bought the RSNs. We love the business. It is a good business. Are we -- is leverage here in the near term more elevated? Yes. I think that's probably though for just about any company that's out there in the U.S. today as a result of COVID. So we have some elevated leverage. It will take us a little bit longer to get down to our target leverage, but we are focused on getting down to the target leverage. But part of how we're going to do that is through all the growth opportunities, again, whether it's the production programming synergies, cross-promotion, cross-programming digital opportunities, legalized sports betting, rebranding and selling all of our digital impression, so much there that we haven't even started to mine with Diamond.</p><p>STEVEN LEE CAHALL: Great. And then maybe just on the retrans side, you've done some recent station renewals with Viacom, CBS and with Comcast, as you pointed out, do you feel like you have the ability to maybe give us either a qualitative or quantitative outlook on net retrans growth for 2020?</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: So as you know, we do not have full year guidance on the table. So at this point, we're not ready to put that out there. As I said, there's a lot of variability in what's happening in the pay TV universe, so -- which is a factor that would go into that. So at this point, no full year guidance.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is coming from John Janedis of Wolfe Research.</p><p>JOHN JANEDIS, MD &amp; SENIOR MEDIA ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH, LLC: I'll be brief. One is a follow-up on the ad side, (inaudible) ways of COVID across the portfolio. What impact are you seeing or do you expect to see on back-to-school spending? And is that typically a swing factor come into that at [later] day? I think you separately given the where we are on the political side. Increasingly, we end up seeing -- we do see a democratic sweep in the fall. How does that change the regulatory landscape and any purpose for your businesses?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: (inaudible)</p><p>ROBERT D. WEISBORD: Okay. Go ahead. Sorry.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: No, no, I was just going to say, hopefully, you heard that, John was a little muffled. But Rob, why don't you handle the back-to-school question, and I will handle the regulatory.</p><p>ROBERT D. WEISBORD: Back-to-school typically is not a large revenue driver for the company. But with COVID going on and the hybrid learnings of some markets going back, some hybrid, some school from home. We're in the midst of launching several creative non-traditional programs to generate revenue that we typically wouldn't be thinking of.</p><p>So in that space, we expect to be able to scale several concepts across our platform. So we do think we'll be able to capture revenue that we probably haven't had in the past in regards to back-to-school.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Okay. So in terms of your question around the election and the regulatory environment, I think it's worthy to note that broadcasting has significant support on both sides of the aisle. You saw that with letters from both, a very large amount of both Democrats and Republicans, supporting local media and promoting its survival is vital to the communities we serve. So we feel, as an industry in good shape with bipartisan support. So we're not concerned about a change in administration and the notion of reregulating broadcasting would be akin to picking on the little guy. I do think some of the bigger companies like [big tech] will have more regulations in the future. But our industry is so small and fragmented, it just -- it wouldn't make sense.</p><p>JOHN JANEDIS: Got it, Chris. If I could sneak in one more. Just a follow-up on Comcast. And maybe a bit more broadly, look, as you said, the market's been negative RSNs. Can you give us an update on how you're doing the landscape? Obviously, you talked about 85% of the subs being locked in, but have distributors in those negotiations -- have they taken a harder look at that business? Any change in tiering up or anything else to highlight?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Sure. So we have seen in all of our negotiations, essentially, status quo environment in terms of terms, tiering, pricing, all the various elements that go into a distribution agreement. So really -- and we've now cycled through all the major and small MVPDs. And say, for one, Dish, we found what we expected, which is that this is very valuable content to the distributors, it drives subscriptions. And we have achieved what we set out to achieve with them, which was status quo renewals.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Ripley, President and CEO, for closing comments.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Thank you. I would like to conclude by thanking all of our employees, customers and stakeholders for their patience during this unprecedented time. We are comfortable that the actions we are taking are not only helping us manage the challenges in the short term, but are also positioning the company for continued to test in the future.</p><p>Thank you for participating on our earnings call this morning. If anyone has any additional questions, please feel free to contact us.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event.

Without IDFA, and mobile ad IDs in general (everyone\u2019s waiting for Google to drop the other shoe), it becomes difficult for Facebook to match its own data with users when they show up in third-party apps.    Wehner has been warning for some time that ad targeting-related headwinds may cut into Facebook\u2019s ad business. These headwinds include privacy regulations, Facebook\u2019s own privacy-related tools \u2013 and privacy-focused changes made by mobile operating systems and browsers.          When Wehner first started ringing that alarm bell more than a year ago, IDFA restrictions were just a rumor. But here they are \u2013 and Facebook\u2019s advertisers are asking about it. They want to know how they can maintain their performance. The answer? \u201cWe\u2019re working on it,\u201d Wehner said.    Facebook specifically called out the IDFA changes as a factor impacting the company\u2019s Q3 outlook. Since iOS 14 won\u2019t be released until the end of Q3, however, the most pronounced effects will not be felt until the fourth quarter.    Still, Facebook is forecasting roughly 10% growth in Q3.    In the first three weeks of July, which would or should include the effects of the Stop Hate For Profit advertising boycott, Facebook\u2019s year-over-year ad revenue growth rate was roughly the same as for its Q2 results \u2013 around 10%.    And about that pandemic \u2026 Facebook grew overall revenue, ad revenue and average revenue per user (ARPU) in Q2.    Facebook\u2019s total revenue for Q2 was $18.7 billion dollars, $18.3 billion of which came from advertising. ARPU for the quarter was $36.49, up from $34.18 at this time last year.    In terms of user metrics:    Facebook daily active users were 1.79 billion, a 12% YoY increase;  Facebook monthly active users were 2.7 billion in June, another 12% YoY increase;  DAUs for Facebook\u2019s family of apps, which also includes Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, clocked in at 2.47 billion, a 15% YoY increase; and  MAUs for the fam were 3.14 billion, a 14% YoY increase.    Facebook said that its Q2 DAU and MAU totals reflect increased engagement due to shelter-in-place orders. As these restrictions continue to ease around the world, Facebook expects its daily and monthly active user counts to be flat or slightly down in most regions in Q3.    \u2026 but wasn\u2019t there an historic antitrust hearing or something yesterday?    Although Facebook reported its Q2 earnings the day after CEO Mark Zuckerberg donned a suit to testify along with his big tech CEO bros in front of a congressional antitrust subcommittee \u2013 incredibly, not a single investor asked Zuckerberg about his appearance.    And the advertiser boycott barely got a mention, although Wehner pointed out that the Top 100 advertisers make up just 16% of Facebook\u2019s ad revenue and falling.    According to Zuck: \u201cSmall businesses are the biggest part of our business, not the largest businesses. \u2026 We want to serve everyone, but if you as investors or analysts or anyone is thinking about our business, the really accurate way to think about what we do is we are in the business of serving small businesses.\u201d    In that vein, Facebook announced a milestone on the call: It now has more than 9 million active advertisers across its services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42725635342</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GG-3091-F07F-84F4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"691\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Ad Exchanger</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Now, I will turn the meeting over to Sara Buda, Vice President Investor Relations. You may begin.</p><p>SARA BUDA, VP - IR, LIONBRIDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.: Hi, and thank you everybody. Welcome to the Lionbridge investor call to discuss financial results for the third quarter of 2010. During this call we may make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws and which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements.</p><p>We've disclosed in greater detail in our form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 13, 2010, the factors that may cause such differences. And now I'll turn the call over to Lionbridge Chairman and CEO Rory Cowan.</p><p>RORY COWAN, CHAIRMAN, CEO, LIONBRIDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.: Great. Thank you, Sara, and good morning everyone. As is normal, today I'll begin with a summary of our third quarter. I assume many of you have seen the release. Then I'll provide some perspective on our current demand environment and our plans for accelerating revenue in 2011. But first let's talk a little bit about the quarter. Revenue was just over $99 million at $99.2 million, within the range we provided you in the last call. And this is reflective of our traditional Q3 seasonality, but there's also some additional lower Microsoft revenue this quarter, which we'll talk about throughout the call today.</p><p>Gross profit was about 32% at $31.9 million, which significantly is about 80 basis points higher than last year at Q3, and it's clear that we just have a much more efficient cost model today. All the work that we did in the past 18 months is beginning to come through. So we are lowering our breakeven point, to lowering our fixed expense thresholds. We're just running a better business than we were 12 months ago, so this really provides a better platform as to accelerate profits as our revenue continues to grow.</p><p>Speaking of continuing to reduce our costs, you saw that we had about $4 million of restructuring expense this quarter. And this is a bit higher than our past quarters. We're in the process of closing one of our European offices and shrinking a number of other locales. With a 12-month or so payback there's still more cost to come out of this business and very simply as we moved the cloud and offshore, we're just doing more with less real estate, less fixed expense. And this is -- we're nearing the end of our previously announced $18 million restructuring that we announced last year.</p><p>Excluding these restructuring expenses we are slightly positive on a GAAP basis. We had another positive quarter of -- we had another quarter of positive cash flow from operations, even after continuing and actually in some cases accelerating investment in our software products strategy. In fact, this has been our sixth quarter of positive cash flow, sixth consecutive quarter.</p><p>We continue to be net cash positive with almost $30 million in cash and less than $25 million in debt. And speaking of our debt, Don and his team refinanced our revolving credit facility well in advance of its maturity this quarter. And the new terms are much more flexible and very favorable, which really reflects the underlying strength of our business and how well we managed in the bank size during the downturn last year.</p><p>So in sum, Q3 was a pretty solid quarter. Don will give you more details on the financial results by segment, but let me touch on our customer environment first. During the past few quarters we've ramped a number of large new accounts such as Genzyme, Caterpillar, Dell and Rolls-Royce. Each of these is now a multi-million dollar recurring revenue customer. And we've been emphasizing, as you can see, the non-tech space to get out of maybe some of this product cycle volatility that seems to be so common in the tech world.</p><p>We know how to manage complex global programs and the market leading organizations continue to rely on Lionbridge for their most critical products and content. We expect a similar ramp for our new wins this quarter, which should grow into multi-million dollar clients during the coming year. With this new momentum and expected growth from existing accounts, we're building a very solid platform for 2011.</p><p>In the short term, however, as we look forward to -- as we look ahead to Q4 and Q1 it's clear that our recent client wins and strong pipeline of new business are really just offsetting a down-release cycle from some of our major customers, specifically Microsoft. Last week our largest customer, Microsoft, as you saw, reported a very strong quarter of sales growth from new product releases. We tend to get the product-related activity three to six months ahead of the public release, which really correlates to our strong first half.</p><p>In fact, for the second half of this year it looks like our Microsoft revenue could be down, I don't know, 15%, 18% or something from the first half. We're clearly offsetting this release cycle, their release cycle with new business. In fact, we have over 150 individual requisitioners with -- inside of Microsoft, over about 27 individual business units throughout the organization. So it's a very deep and pervasive relationship.</p><p>So we're in the process of planning for the next Microsoft release cycle over the next several quarters and expect to rebound, as has happened, during early to mid-2011. Our relationship remains very strong, in fact we were once again a finalist for Microsoft's Vendor of the Year Program, and you may remember there are tens of thousands of vendors whom Microsoft assesses and scores on their performance. We didn't win, but being one of the top finalists -- we won last year, of course, and being one of the finalists I really think it really underscores our deep relationship with them.</p><p>But in the short term, their pipeline of new product and content releases just seem spaced a little further out than we've seen before. There's just more time between these release cycles. In fact, it feels as if a lot of tech companies are just managing costs by maybe stretching out their upgrades, all that startup cost with releasing a new product cycle or perhaps with all the acquisitions going on people are a little bit more focused on integration than upgrades.</p><p>In addition, for revenue, Europe is really a tale of two cities. It sort of reflects -- our experience reflects what you're reading in the papers. Economies like Germany are seeing a very clear and strong rebound. I was with our sales team there a couple of weeks ago and I've not seen such confidence in Germany in years; sharp contrast with Spain, Ireland, and France. They just don't seem to have their mojo back in those countries.</p><p>On the other hand, China remains very strong for us. In fact, we saw a 30% increase in demand for Chinese compared to last year, so it seems that the export markets, European and American companies exporting to China, that really seems to be getting some strength. Eastern Europe is also growing nicely. So we have a view of global demand that I think a lot of companies don't have. A relatively firm demand from non-tech exporters in the US, Germany is very strong, France, Ireland, Spain continue to be weak, and a lot of demand for China.</p><p>So let's talk about what we're doing for next year to accelerate our revenue growth. First, we're ramping our sales teams to accelerate the growth. I have been talking about this for a while and you're beginning to see it coming through the numbers. We decided to increase our spend in the sales and marketing line, and given that it takes about nine months to get a salesman up and spinning and about a nine-month close cycle, that's about right because we've been upgrading our sales force during the past few quarters.</p><p>So for 2011 we are reiterating our 5% to 10% revenue growth and this stems from really three specific revenue-oriented actions. First, our sales force reconfiguration. We're adapting our sales strategy to capitalize the demand from large enterprises for integrated offerings that span all of our services, from development to testing to translation. And finally, after many years, it's clear that clients are now ready for this integrated or horizontal one stop shop for products and content. We have a number of proposals out that integrate all of our services.</p><p>This has always been our strength but customers used to unbundle our services and now people are realizing the cost savings by integrating them. So we now have select enterprise sales teams that will sell these fairly complex integrated solutions, and this should drive bigger deals with longer term relationships.</p><p>The second action that we're doing to accelerate revenues, really we want to shorten the time to close for new opportunities. Given that these are more complex opportunities, the sort of sales engineering or solutions architect, whatever you want -- however you want to call it, but it's a lot more complicated. So, we've established what we call a deal desk, which is a unique team dedicated to putting the right operational and sales teams together for each unique opportunity.</p><p>We have 30 offices in about 25 countries, and it's a very complicated global decision making unit so getting all of our customers' global needs together, aligned with our global capabilities, only for these larger opportunities, that's really our second action.</p><p>The final action we're taking is really accelerating the integration and use of our cloud-based technology offerings. Over the past several years we've continued to invest in our technology. In fact, even during the downturn I did not cut R&amp;D. This investment is paying off. We now have two related Software as a Service, or SaaS offerings.</p><p>First, of course, Translation Workspace, which is the productivity technology for translators and agencies, and the second is Custom Real-Time Translation, or CRT, the automated translation technology for enterprises, which is based on our partnership and joint development agreement with IBM.</p><p>So today we're beginning to see strong market traction for both. In fact, Translation Workspace now has over 2,000 monthly subscribers in over 80 countries in just its first few months. And this is before we begin to release this upstream to large enterprises, and we have a couple of betas going on with large enterprise applications as well. And the real-time translation offering from IBM or CRT, also has several market leading companies as beta customers. And truly a couple of dozen others waiting for general availability as we want to narrow our betas until we get the release and support capabilities well-honed.</p><p>These offerings not only expand our market with the highly profitable SaaS-based revenue as many of you have been asking about, but we're also finding that we're seeing new opportunities for traditional translation services coming out of our technology offerings. It seems that the technology deepens the relationship and then the services -- the maintenance of that content begins to grow as well.</p><p>So you can see the benefit of adding these innovative SaaS products to our well-established service offerings. And as we said, we expect a sort of $5 million to $10 million run rate for our SaaS products as we leave 2011, but with much more upside in 2012 as you all know how SaaS revenues models come into revenue, recognized revenue.</p><p>So in summary we're well positioned for 2011. Demand remains firm. But as I mentioned, it's geographically uneven. We're offsetting product release cycles from existing clients with new business. We're configuring our sales teams to capitalize on large integrated opportunities, and we have the industry's most advanced SaaS technology offerings that are really giving us a competitive advantage.</p><p>And I'll turn the call over to Don and he can give you the play-by-play on the quarter.</p><p>DONALD MUIR, SVP, CFO, LIONBRIDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.: Thanks, Rory, and hello everyone. Today I'll provide a financial overview of our second quarter -- our third quarter I should say, and then I'll give you an outlook for Q4 in 2011. Revenue for the quarter was $99.2 million, in line with the guidance we provided. This is up 1% or about 4% in constant currency year-on-year.</p><p>Sequentially, the quarter is down about 5%, driven primarily by two factors, traditional Q3 seasonality and lower than expected Microsoft revenue. For the first nine months of the year, revenue was $305 million, representing growth of over $20 million, was 7% and up about 8% in constant currency. Gross margins for the total company was 31.9%, which is about 80 basis points higher than last year's third quarter. On a segment reporting basis, gross margins in our GLT language business grew 170 basis points year-on-year to about 33% in the quarter.</p><p>This primarily reflects our ongoing cost management, as well as a favorable year-over-year currency impact. Gross margins in our GDT develop and testing business decreased year-on-year to about 32% for the quarter. This reflects work mix changes with an increase in US-based revenue from HP.</p><p>Total operating expenses, ex restructuring grew year-on-year primarily due to higher sales and marketing. This reflects our increased focus on accelerating revenue for 2011. G&amp;A was flat year-on-year. Compared to last quarter, operative expense was roughly flat sequentially. We offset increases in sales and marketing expenses with lower G&amp;A. In fact, G&amp;A is lower by about 4% compared to last quarter. So we are cutting where we should, G&amp;A and investing where we should, sales and marketing to accelerate growth.</p><p>Going forward, we expect sales and marketing to continue to run at about 8% of revenue. G&amp;A should trend down as a percentage of revenue going forward as we continue to manage costs while growing the top line. As Rory mentioned, we had about $4 million of restructuring in the quarter. We're in the process of closing one of our European locations and reducing overhead in others. While we've had a much leaner cost model today, there are still opportunities to reduce costs. This position does well to grow earnings in 2011 as revenue momentum builds.</p><p>As you look below the line at the operating profit you'll see that Q3 other expense was $1.6 million driven by unfavorable currency-related balance sheet revaluations as the dollar weakened by approximately 10% versus the euro. During the quarter we saw this exchange rate go from $1.22 to $1.36. Year-to-date other expense totals $1.2 million or about $400,000 per quarter on average. So as we've said in past calls we have models going forward. We expect our other expense line item to be plus or minus $500,000 per quarter depending upon FX volatility.</p><p>Our tax provision for the quarter was actually about a $300,000 benefit. This benefit resulted in the favorable impact of several international tax adjustments recorded in the third quarter. As we said, for the next few quarters we expect a quarterly tax provision of about $500,000 to $1 million a quarter. And longer term the tax provision should be in the low to mid-20s as a percentage of pre-tax income. On a GAAP basis we had a loss of $0.07. Excluding third quarter restructuring expense we're about breakeven for the quarter. Non-GAAP earnings were $2.4 million or $0.04, about flat with last year.</p><p>Moving to the balance sheet we had another quarter of generating positive cash flow from operations. We generated about $800,000 during the third quarter which is essentially flat versus last year. We've kept global DSOs under 50 days, and we ended the quarter with about $30 million in cash, even after accelerating our technology investments in the first half of the year.</p><p>Debt remained at $24.7 million so we are net cash positive again by about $5 million and our balance sheet remains strong. In fact, we recently renewed and extended our revolving credit facility for four years. It wasn't set to expire until late next year but we decided to be proactive to take advantage of today's rates. And given our strong performance during the downturn the banks gave us a very favorable term including low borrowing cost at about 2% over monthly LIBOR and improved covenant flexibility around restructuring, capital spending and hedging costs.</p><p>This amended credit line will enable us to further mitigate currency exposure impacting the other expense line in the P&amp;L favorably, and it will allow us to invest appropriately and prudently to grow the business long term. We were able to secure this favorable bank line based on the underlying strength of our business. So I am quite pleased with the results of this process.</p><p>In terms of uses of cash, as we've said, we'll use our cash to fund restructuring and invest in our translation technology development. And longer term, we may look at select acquisitions that enhance our business in terms of vertical markets or technology. So our cash management strategy remains aligned with our overall objectives of accelerating revenue and market leadership while reducing our costs.</p><p>So in summary, Q3 was a solid quarter, revenue was in the range of our expectations, gross margins improved year-on-year, net income ex restructuring was positive, and we continue to generate cash. On the business side, we had a number of positive developments in the quarter including market momentum with that new real-time translation technology with IBM and new wins in our language and development segments.</p><p>As we look ahead to our fourth quarter and Q1 2011 outlook, there are two short term factors to consider, slower product releases from technology clients like Microsoft and pockets of weakness in certain parts of Europe as Rory mentioned. We are mitigating these headwinds with new business. On our last call we told you that we expected to be at the low end our 5% to 10% revenue growth rate range for 2010. Given our second half Microsoft revenue level, we now expect to be up about 4% for this year. This would be about 6% year-on-year growth in constant currency.</p><p>Our Q4 revenue range is $98 million to $102 million, and as we look ahead to Q1 2011 we expect to be about flat with Q4 depending on the timing of client projects. As we said, we are the partner of choice for all of our major clients. More than half of their business comes from outside the US. We know we'll get the revenue when they develop products and content. It's just a matter of when we get their activity, not if. So we expect revenue momentum to build starting in Q2 and throughout the rest of 2011. As Rory mentioned, for 2011 we are reiterating our annual growth estimate of 5% to 10% with the understanding that this will likely be a second half biased growth.</p><p>So in summary, I am pleased with our first nine months' to date performance. Year-to-date revenue growth of 7% is solid. In the second half of the year we're executing well in the midst of a slower release cycle from our top customer, and I feel we are well-positioned to accelerate revenue and earnings growth for 2011. Back to you, Rory.</p><p>RORY COWAN: Well, thanks, Don. So just to reiterate what Don was saying before we open the call up for questions, we're continuing to take out overhead costs while investing in sales and technology. We expect to continue this sort of approximately 40% conversion of incremental revenue to operating profit in 2011 because that's the model we've proven.</p><p>Once we add revenue on the top we get great conversion on the revenue, and that's despite our increased investment in technology. We delivered this strong conversion in the first half of '10 and we expect to do it again in '11 and so it's really a revenue story among the techs is the way to think about it.</p><p>We're offsetting these uneven release cycles with our top clients with new multi-million dollar relationships from the non-techs. We have a solid plan for sales expansion that really capitalizes on the strengthening demand for integrated offerings. We're accelerating our technology investments and will be beefing up our sales activities there during Q1 as well, and while expanding broader market opportunities.</p><p>And for sales growth combined with these cost actions I think you'll begin to see a nice financial performance going forward. So within this context, I'm feeling positive about 2011 and our ongoing growth for the company and so now let's open the call up for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). The first question comes from Joseph Vafi, Jefferies and Company.</p><p>JOSEPH VAFI, ANALYST, JEFFERIES AND CO.: Hi, good morning. I thought maybe we could talk a little bit more about the accelerated restructuring here in Q3 and what it might mean for G&amp;A costs next year? I know you gave us some color there on what you think the operating costs are going to be moving forward, but does this indeed accelerate potential margin expansion with the reduced G&amp;A costs?</p><p>RORY COWAN: Yes, I think so. I'll start and then hand it over to Don. I think clearly, as you know, we had two things going on in Europe. The first one was it just takes a little bit longer to work through these works councils, and the second one is our bank line somewhat limited the amount that we could spend on restructuring, Joe. So we've cleared both of those now and as we said, these things, I don't want to say it's dollar for dollar within 12 months but it's darn close in terms of the payback.</p><p>So I think you should see some significant reduction of G&amp;A, but also this restructuring flows through our entire statement. You get some of it in our cost of goods sold line because a lot of our PMs in Europe are in the cost of goods sold line. That's our high cost, our internal cost of sales, as well as then the traditional G&amp;A activities from leases, from finance, IT and other things that are embedded in the statements. So we're feeling pretty positive about this first step, and with our technology getting traction we see even more opportunity for Q1 and Q2. It's really quite heartening.</p><p>DONALD MUIR: Yes, hi, Joe, this is Don. I think as we indicated last quarter we said we expected to see $4 million to $6 million of restructuring over the next two to four quarters, so I think we're being pretty consistent. Maybe a little early, but as Rory said the catalyst there was the new credit facility. That did give us some relief on our ability to take restructuring charges and not include them in some of the bank covenants.</p><p>Over the next couple of quarters we expect another probably $2 million to $3 million of restructuring expenses, and based on where these are in Western Europe you're looking at probably 12 to 18-month type paybacks in some of these. These are maybe a little bit longer payback than some of the initial restructurings we had taken a year ago.</p><p>RORY COWAN: Cash. Cash payback versus --</p><p>DONALD MUIR: Right.</p><p>RORY COWAN: Right.</p><p>JOSEPH VAFI: Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess here on the real-time translation product, thanks for the additional color here. Do we really -- so we feel we can have general availability release here in early 2011? That looks -- would that be a Q1 event do you think at this point?</p><p>RORY COWAN: I think so, Joe. Q1 should look -- we're probably having -- we'll have two betas in production by the end of Q4. We're working now on the customization capability because to remind you of the unique nature of this product is we're able to take this very algorithm heavy technology and customize it both for a particular customer's content, but also for their unique language pairs, and then configure it for the application, meaning real-time chat and technical support or real-time website translation.</p><p>So really it's the customization and configuration process that's holding up the deployment. That's going very well with IBM. As you can imagine, it took us maybe a month or so just to figure out how to get these two companies to work together. And now the code is flowing freely between the two of us and so we're pretty excited about it. So we should begin to see some reasonable revenue in Q1 and Q2.</p><p>JOSEPH VAFI: Okay. And I mean I know you've thrown some numbers out before on what may be quote/unquote \"SaaS-based services and software\" maybe in 2011. How is that factored into that top line guidance you gave us here for fiscal '11?</p><p>RORY COWAN: Yes. It's pretty broad because we know we have a good sense of what's going on in the Translation Workspace, which is the offering created for the individual translators and the agencies around the world. That's going to ramp nicely. That was -- we said we have about 2,000 users now, probably next year, at the end of the year we'll have 3,000, 3,500 users. That's going well. And then the enterprise side of that it could be anywhere for each sale to be anywhere from $100,000 to $400,000 or $500,000. That's on Translation Workspace.</p><p>For the CRT or the automated translation offering we're sort of penciling out also anything from $100,000 to $1 million depending upon language pairs and applications. We think we'll end the year at that $5 million to $10 million of SaaS run rate. It may be better than that but I really want to get some traction on this because these things always take longer than you think they're going to.</p><p>JOSEPH VAFI: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess is there anything else going on with any of the other big tech customers other than Microsoft that we should be aware of in terms of fluctuations in volumes?</p><p>RORY COWAN: I think that we've won a couple of new techs. There's been a fair amount of vendor consolidation, and I think that what I see is that during the downturn all the techs began to manage cost and they're all enthusiastic about consolidating. Then as business picks up a little bit the cost focus tends to soften.</p><p>We have picked up a number of strong tech companies this quarter that -- and more web-based activity, which tend to have a little bit more stability around it, some e-commerce stores and some other things. In fact, HP has been particularly strong with multi-year relationships with us and that may be just Hurd's cost orientation. After two or three years it's working through the whole culture there.</p><p>Google is also been and continues to be very strong and stable for us. As I mentioned, some of the other techs like last year you may recall we had a strong performance with Canon and with Oracle, and I think we've seen some cycle changes there. As I said, Oracle seems to be doing more acquisition and consolidation of existing rather than upgrading, at least the products we're exposed to. So I think what I'm disappointed by, of course, is that the techs have these big cycles. What I'm delighted by is that our sales force is really picking up the slack during the downturn on these.</p><p>JOSEPH VAFI: All right, thanks very much.</p><p>RORY COWAN: Okay.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Rich Baldry, Signal Hill Capital.</p><p>RICHARD BALDRY, ANALYST, SIGNAL HILL CAPITAL: Thanks. Could you talk a little about the linearity of this visibility? Because it seemed like coming out of Q2 you were talking about top 10 customers up 10% year-on-year and the confidence they had and sort of second half cycle. So it seems like something may have changed. So do you feel like that was a late change in the summertime or something else?</p><p>And then this -- in the sales and marketing side can you talk about the increased spending, whether that'll be in sort of the newer translation custom real-time kind of areas or if it'll be kind of balanced across your offerings? Thanks.</p><p>RORY COWAN: Yes, I think so. I think a couple of things here. First, the real focus as you mentioned, you're right to point out the \"what did we know and when did we know it\" kind of issue? When did it work its way through, which is this is really a sort of a July, August kind of thing that worked its way through, particularly with our Microsoft account.</p><p>As you know, Ballmer has been reorienting spend there quite rapidly away from a lot of the more mature products and putting it into a lot of their growth opportunities. That happened fairly abruptly with cost management this summer as they entered their new fiscal.</p><p>So we're engaged with some of the newer players but those products of scale just aren't coming through to the market yet. And as I mentioned Microsoft may be down as much 10% to 15% for us during half two versus half one. And that is quite a -- we expected some softness but not cracking double digits. So I think that's the first one there.</p><p>Secondly, where is the spend -- where's the sales spend going? It's really going across all areas, Rich. We see -- we're beefing up our sales in our traditional services groups. And we're now building a separate sales force for our technology products. So those are the two tasks over the next four to six months that we're working on.</p><p>RICHARD BALDRY: And in the release, you talk about general availability of the real-time platform in early '11. So does that mean literally we should start seeing revenues at the time it goes GA or is there more of a lagged effect, where beta customers allowed -- are kind of attracted by giving them some terms that maybe we won't see their revenue until later. How will we think about that?</p><p>RORY COWAN: Yes, I think that's right. We do have a couple of these -- some of these betas are paid betas on the real-time activity. And the goal, of course, is to approve the technology and then covert those into broader enterprise deployments. So I wouldn't expect to see a step curve from Q1 to Q2. But I would expect it to build throughout the year. That's on the RTTS piece. We're already seeing that as I mentioned with our Translation Workspace, which is for the agencies and translators. And that, too, is building really very nicely on a weekly basis throughout the year, so I think it's going to build throughout the year, Rich.</p><p>RICHARD BALDRY: Thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Richard Davis, Canaccord.</p><p>RICHARD DAVIS, ANALYST, CANACCORD ADAMS: Hey, thanks very much. So I realize we're still in the very early days. But I what I'm trying to figure out is how scalable into perhaps other professions Workspace could be. So the question I have for you is this, is the -- is your competitive advantage in this effort at this moment the reputation and kind of market presence you have with this pool of people.</p><p>Or is there something else with regard to the software that you view as proprietary and/or unique, so that in the future, now this again will probably be not until '12 or something, but in the future when you try to -- if assuming you try to expand into other areas, you could take it there. So that's really the kind of picture question I have for you.</p><p>RORY COWAN: That's great, Rich. And you're right to ask about that because those are -- we haven't been emphasizing the nature of our professional crowd here. Just to remind everybody, we've been focusing in this call mostly on Translation Workspace which is individual translators. We also maintain a community of paid professionals in about 90 countries that do a Web rating or URL rating as well. And so we're applying this capability to recruit, test and pay people in about 80 countries from the cloud.</p><p>We've been focusing on the translation business here, but we're beginning to see a significant acceleration of other applications for this crowd management capability. So for example, we're doing some regulatory management. Accounting laws are changing frequently in all the countries around the world. So people that maintain accounting software need people to monitor this activity. We're now hiring professionals in all of these countries to monitor regulatory changes and feed it back to the product configuration folks at some of these tech companies. Big application for us, that's the crowd that Rich asked about.</p><p>Now, the unique technology in applying it is also correct. Because we are now able to pay people and we know all of the labor laws and regulations for temporary and contract workers in about 80 countries for our translators, for our raters, for our content monitors, we're building that knowledge into the platform.</p><p>We're receiving about 100,000 inbounds a year now of people looking for work on the Web around the world. So this is becoming a very powerful and unique capability. So we're excited about that. I first am focusing right now on getting the Translation Workspace and the IBM relationship done. Then in second half of the year we'll start targeting and moving this capability into other applications.</p><p>RICHARD DAVIS: So is it fair to think about this in some respects as almost a, I don't know, derivative or a second generation? It's almost as if the data collection you're doing is to some degree like open source, which is the theory behind it everyone contributes a little bit to a greater good. And particularly with regard to the regulatory changes and things like that or crowd sourcing, which I guess is a current phrase, too, but is that the right way to think of this business?</p><p>RORY COWAN: You could think of it that way. But I'm looking to make a little more money out of it than just holding a party in the sky here. We have people that contract with us to find proprietary information that is needed for their unique product. So another application we're working on is geographic points of interest. To maintain all of these maps worldwide, you need people with local knowledge contributing to the cloud.</p><p>So rather than contributing that to an open source knowledge of where the construction sites are and what the hours are and what roads have built and haven't been built, individual platforms pay us handsomely for that data to enhance their particular product. So it's reducing their expenses quite dramatically but this is an essential part of their competitiveness.</p><p>So in the translation piece, there is this cloud-based database but that is our customer's content. We do not violate their copyrights. But we do detect patterns in that content to train the IBM software that we've worked with, so there are two different applications there, Rich, contractual [installations] to our customers' competitiveness and then getting derivative data from a database in the cloud in the sky.</p><p>RICHARD DAVIS: Perfect, thanks so much.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Kevin Liu, B. Riley &amp; Company.</p><p>KEVIN LIU, ANALYST, B. RILEY &amp; CO.: Hi, good morning. First question here, your guidance for Q4 here fairly consistent from a revenue standpoint as the prior quarter. But looking at kind of the impacts on margins, one, you guys have accelerated some restructuring so would expect maybe some initial benefits there.</p><p>But beyond that forex seems to be working against you at least for now on a sequential basis. And you guys have also sent out this memo requesting discounts from your translator base. So I'm curious as to your confidence in extracting these discounts and what sort of net impact you expect on the margin line on a sequential basis?</p><p>RORY COWAN: Great, I'll handle some of this and then Don can respond to it. First, I think two things. Let's take these in reverse order. We have gone out to our worldwide translator database and asked for discounts. And the reason for that is is we're finding that what's happening it seems to be with workers in the cloud right now that there's quite a lot of fraud. In a lot of these meeting places and job posting places where small businesses post projects and individuals respond to them, it seems as if there's not a lot of follow through on payment.</p><p>One of the things that we do is, of course, we are very integrity and do pay people, first. Second, we're finding the translators are getting great productivity with our platform. And so I think that we should be able to share some of that -- share in the benefits of that productivity with them.</p><p>So this is -- I think will we get 5% from everybody? That's probably a little aggressive, but it's certainly a nice place to start. And we're also finding that new translators are now coming to us because they find that there are many more translators than there are companies with high integrity buying translation on the Web. So I think that's the first one. Don, anything on that?</p><p>DONALD MUIR: I think to your question, Kevin, on the FX impact, certainly the euro has strengthened here. But we saw on a year-over-year basis in Q3, almost an identical swing where you had a very strong year over last year compared to this year. And that really had a de minimis effect on our margins. So we're almost perfectly hedged at the gross margin line. The impact on revenue kind of offsets the impact on the cost of revenue. And we see a little bit of noise in the operating expense line. But again on a year-over-year basis on a 10% move, it was about $250,000, so not a huge impact.</p><p>KEVIN LIU: I mean I guess I was looking more just sequentially to see if you would be able to maintain the operating margin you posted for Q3 --</p><p>DONALD MUIR: I don't think the FX is going to be the reason that we miss that.</p><p>RORY COWAN: And also our new bank line gives us a little bit more flexibility with some very light hedging. We all focus on the euro-dollar but the currency markets worldwide are really unbelievably volatile. The euro-yen relationship, renminbi, it's become a much more complicated operating environment. And our Treasury group here has gotten increasingly sophisticated and our bank line gives us much more flexibility now to really act on it.</p><p>DONALD MUIR: Yes, and I said in my portion of the call, you're going to see that in the other expense line. That's not going to be impacting your operating profit, the actions that we take on hedging or Treasury.</p><p>KEVIN LIU: Got it. And then the other question I had was just on these larger integrated deals that you were talking about. You mentioned you were out there with some customers already. So just wondering when some of these decisions around the RFPs are going to be made?</p><p>RORY COWAN: Yes, I think a couple of things. We've already seen some of these. In fact we've built for one customer, we've built a dedicated R&amp;D center, a dedicated development and localization center in China for them. And so we're already beginning to see this integration of testing development and language. So that's one that you'll begin to see really hitting its stride in next year.</p><p>So we should begin to see -- we're getting early stages on some of them that we've already won. And as I think I mentioned to you, I brought in some new management in our GDT group, our development and test group. And that's largely based on the need to develop some unique cross selling capabilities.</p><p>One other trend and I think it's early days yet but I think that we're finding that perhaps the Indian outsourcers do not have the command of localization and culture management that perhaps we do. And some projects of two years ago that went to India seem to be coming back to our global cloud.</p><p>KEVIN LIU: That's great. Thanks for taking my questions.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). The next question comes from Vincent Colicchio with Noble Financial.</p><p>VINCENT COLICCHIO, ANALYST, NOBLE FINANCIAL: Can you -- Rory, can you provide an update on sales cycles and pricing trends in the translation side?</p><p>RORY COWAN: Yes, great, sales cycles and pricing trends on the translation side was the question. First, sales cycles for -- as I mentioned for the larger clients, it's still a six to nine-month cycle from when you first knock on the door to when you really have a contract completed, so that hasn't changed.</p><p>On the smaller customers, it's still a little bit shorter. That might be a six to ten-week kind of process or month to two month kind of process. So that hasn't changed at all. Pricing is all over the map. Curiously, the smaller customers focus more on pennies per word. The larger customers focus more on time to market because they realize the leverage, saving $200,000 on a translation job but then being six weeks late to market is probably a pretty poor tradeoff.</p><p>So we're finding that our larger customers actually appreciate our value, our reliability, our technology and just our general ability to work with them as they change at the last moments. Smaller customers probably aren't as sophisticated in their procurement process.</p><p>VINCENT COLICCHIO: It sounds like you've added some non-tech clients and you're also ramping up some tech clients. Could you give us some color in terms of to what extent you're relying on tech versus non-tech to offset the slowdown at Microsoft?</p><p>RORY COWAN: Yes, tech has largely been a slowdown at Microsoft. And I really want to emphasize, we've been here with Microsoft before. This is just a normal -- in fact, I think if anything from a very positive standpoint, is Microsoft is really integrating their worldwide release cycle. It's taken them four or five years to get everything around a real large [sign] wave.</p><p>As you know the problem with the complexity of a place like Microsoft is each unit was releasing products according to their own cycle and business needs, and they were often out of sync. Therefore, end users were constantly dealing with interoperability issues when they would upgrade their software. So Microsoft's getting everything in line and that may be why there's a bigger pause this time than we've seen before.</p><p>Secondly, we're focusing more and more on non-techs. While the techs are where there -- a lot of the content is, our technology RTTS and other, many of the newer applications are outside of the product business within techs and in the non-tech world. So I think if we would look end of the 2011, we'll have more revenue, a greater percent of our revenue from non-techs than we do today.</p><p>VINCENT COLICCHIO: Okay, thanks guys.</p><p>OPERATOR: At this time, I show no further questions.</p><p>RORY COWAN: Great, thanks, everyone and again if you have any other questions, please route them through to Sara Buda. And Sara, Don and I will be able to schedule some time to talk. Thanks an awful lot.</p><p>OPERATOR: This does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nancy Fazioli. Please go ahead.</p><p>NANCY FAZIOLI, IR, DIRECTOR, VERISIGN, INC.: Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us for VeriSign's third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. I'm Nancy Fazioli, Director of Investor Relations. I am here today with Mark McLaughlin, President and CEO, and Brian Robins, Executive Vice President, and CFO. Please note that this call, and accompanying slide presentation are being webcast from our Investor Relations website located at investor.verisign.com. Please refer to our website for important information, including the Q3 2010 earnings press release. A replay of this call will be available on our website within a few hours. Today's slide presentation will also be available for download after the call.</p><p>Financial results in today's press release are unaudited, and the matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements. And as such, are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. I would like to remind you that in light of Regulation FD, VeriSign retains it's long standing policy to not comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through public disclosure.</p><p>The financial results in today's press release and the matters we will be discussing today include non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our press release and slide presentation, both of which can be found on our Investor Relations website. In a moment, Mark and Brian will provide some prepared remarks, and afterwards we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark?</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN, CEO, VERISIGN, INC.: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with the performance of the business this quarter. We continue to see strength in the Internet trends that drive our business. Also the team's ongoing operational discipline and execution, leading up to, and following the close of the sale of Authentication Services is helping to drive positive results. There's still a lot of work to be done, as we transition the Authentication business. We are very focused on a smooth transition, which is on track, and which we expect to be largely completed in the mid 2011 timeframe.</p><p>I'll now cover the highlights of our financial results for the third quarter. Revenue in the third quarter for Naming Services was $172 million, representing an 11% year-over-year increase. Naming Services is comprised of registry services, and Network Intelligence and Availability or NIA services. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.27 cents, compared to $0.16 in Q3 2009. Non-GAAP operating margin was 43.1%, compared to 33.7% in Q3 2009. During the quarter, we utilized $146 million of cash to repurchase 5.1 million shares, leaving us with repurchase authorization of approximately $1.4 billion. In August, we received $1.28 billion dollars in proceeds from the sales of the Authentication business, which brings our cash down to the end of the third quarter to $2.55 billion, approximately 65% of which is held domestically.</p><p>Operationally, in Naming Services, the base of registered names and .coms and .net this quarter totaled 103.5 million names at the end of September, a 9% increase year-over-year. Two million net names were added to the domain name base this quarter. During the third quarter, we processed 7.5 million new registrations, which is a 7% increase year-over-year. The 2010 Q2 renewal rate was 73.2%, up from 72.1% in Q1 2010. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal late for Q3 2010 will be approximately 73%.</p><p>For net domain name additions, we expect that Q4 net names added in the base, to be between 1.7 and 2 million names. Q4 has a larger expiring name base than the third quarter, and an increased of first-time renewing names in the expiring name base. In addition, in some previous years in the fourth quarter, we've seen some registrars do year-end inventory reviews, resulting in some deletions at the very end of the year. While we review accounts on a regular basis, it is possible that there could be some deletions resulting from this kind of activity, that would not appear in our regular account reviews.</p><p>On the infrastructure front, the growth of the Internet that is a positive for our business, will continue to put increased demands on our infrastructure. In the third quarter, we processed on average 66 billion DNS queries per day, up from 63 billion queries on average per day last quarter. Also last quarter, I highlighted exciting developments with the implementation of DNSSEC and the Root Zone, and the forthcoming implementation in the .net zone later this year, and the .com zone next year. This is one of the most significant security enhancements to the DNS ever, and we are proud of our leadership roles there. As we continue to show leadership for next digital decade, we will plan to continuously invest in our infrastructure, to enhance our readiness for any future DNS requirements.</p><p>Finally, as I know it is an area of interest for investors, we will continue to update you with regards to public developments in the case filed by the Coalition For ICANN Transparency, or CFIT against VeriSign. In August, we requested a case management conference with the district court, to begin the process to resolve this matter through summary disposition or trial. That conference was held on Friday, October 22, and the Court established a timeline for the litigation, including among other things, adopting the parties for proposed schedule, summary judgement on certain threshold issues, with a hearing set for March 2011, and for final summary judgement with a hearing set in October 2011. The court also set the trial date for December 5, 2011. Beyond the procedural updates, given that this is ongoing litigation, we will not be commenting further, other than to reiterate that we continue to feel confident about the case, and will defend our position vigorously. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian.</p><p>BRIAN ROBINS, EVP, CFO, VERISIGN, INC.: Thanks, Mark, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Mark gave you the highlights for the quarter, so I would like to just dive into the key financial metrics that we are focused on for the year-- revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth, and free cash flow. As we noted, revenue for Naming Services was $172 million, up 3% from the prior quarter, and up 11% year-over-year. From a continuing operations perspective, we are still on track to wind down the final non-core business, Content Portal Service, or CPS in Q4. The business contributed $364,000 in revenue during the quarter, to bring continuing operations revenue to $173 million. Deferred revenue for Naming Services ended the quarter at $654 million, an increase of $13 million or 2% from Q2, and up 13% from the same period in 2009.</p><p>Non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $98 million, down 2% quarter-over-quarter, and down approximately 5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 43.1% in the third quarter, compared to 40.5% in Q2. As we noted the last quarter, there are a number of moving parts related to the transition of the Authentication Services business to Symantec. We expect to have those substantially completed by mid-year 2011. By the interim, we may see some variability in the operating margins, as we head towards the 45% range in the second quarter of 2011, as we discussed last quarter.</p><p>A quick comment on the Transition Services Agreement with Symantec. We still expect the bulk of the TSAs to be completed in mid-2011. Note that the income from the TSA hits the other income line, and a reasonable estimate is still $5 million for the second half of 2010, as well as for the first half of 2011. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $48 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.27, compared to $0.24 in Q2, and $0.16 in the same period in 2009, a 69% increase from Q3 2009.</p><p>We exited third quarter with a diluted share count of 175 million shares. During the third quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares. Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was negative $82 million in Q3, a one-time impact to cash resulting from taxes owed related to the sale of Authentication Services. Free cash flow was $47 million in Q3, given $155 million in excess tax benefits, and $26 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Year-to-date capital expenditures are running $69 million, which includes approximately $20 million in spend during the year related to Authentication Services. 8% to 10% of the new revenue run rate is still a reasonable way to think about CapEx going forward for the remaining business.</p><p>Just an additional note to clarify this significant increase in excess tax benefits. We would have paid cash taxes related to the sale of Authentication Services, if not for net operating losses-related stock options. Due to the use of the stock option NOLs, the cash flow statement must reflect the classification of $155 million as a use of cash and cash from operations, and a source of cash in the fin -- financial -- financing section of the cash flow statement. In the appendix, our slide presentation that will be posted on the website following the call, we have a cash flow reconciliation that you may find helpful.</p><p>Moving onto guidance. At this point, we believe we are making good progress to achieve or exceed our full-year guidance. Naming Services revenue growth for 2010 of approximately 10%. Non-GAAP gross margins in the 77% to 78% range. Q4 exit non-GAAP operating margin increase to 42% to 43% from previous guidance of 40% to 41%. Non-GAAP other loss net is expected to be $20 million for 2010. Our guidance is based on continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business.</p><p>I would like to express appreciation of our employees during this transitional time in the business. Their hard work has enabled us to keep the transition of divested businesses on track. I am very proud of the operational discipline the team has shown over the past several quarters. Going forward, we believe that we will be able to scale the business to a smaller footprint, while continuing to seek opportunities to grow. Thanks for your time today. Operator, we are ready for the first question.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)</p><p>We will now go to the first question from Todd Raker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p><p>TODD RAKER, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Two questions for you, guys. First of all, could you just talk about the stock buyback. Anything that prevented you in the quarter from buying stock? Were you guys blacked out as a result of the Symantec transaction at all? Just trying to get a sense of what we should be thinking in run rate. And secondly, can you talk about the potential pricing? And I know you are you're guiding, well, I won't call it conservative, but net adds down here in Q4, but the growth profile still seems pretty healthy on a unit basis. What is it likelihood, we get the last price increase announced? Thanks.</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN: Hi, Todd.This is Mark. On the buybacks side, we don't comment on any blackout periods we may be in -- and I can't get into the details about that. All we can do is report what we have done at the end of the quarter, in the quarter. So I really can't give any further than that. And on the pricing side, also as you know we taken three out of four of the cost price increases we could take. We couldn't comment, whether we intend to take the fourth one, or when -- either as well. We do think about those, as we've mentioned before. We take a lot of things into account. So we look at those,a including the economy, and how the business is doing, and how the registars are doing. And some other factors. A lot of positives in the -- a lot of those areas today, but we cannot comment as top if or when we take an expiration (inaudible).</p><p>TODD RAKER: Mark, maybe can help us, because. net auto renew is in June of next year. What is the timeframe, if you wanted to take one more price increase across .net? Can you do it all the way up to June, or is there some timeframe when you have to do that.</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN: We could take the pricing, we could notice the pricing increase in .net, right up to the end of the term of the contract. If you were within a few months, or you noticed, or inside that six-month notice period. Then the increase would take effect, post the renewal.</p><p>TODD RAKER: Okay, thanks, guys.</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN: Thanks, Todd.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.</p><p>ROB OWENS, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I was curious how the new names added this quarter, it slowed sequentially, I think it was the first kind of single digit number you've seen in a while. And do you think this is a function of just of tougher compares, or something you are seeing in the economy or anything from a geography standpoint?</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN: Hi, Rob. It's mark. I think of the new unit thats came into -- we have two million net units which is a strong showing. and on the new site, we had 7.5 million. and if you look back on a historical basis over the last few years, the -- one 3.5 year average on net names in the quarter is about 7.3. So actually it's a pretty strong showing for net units, if you look backwards.</p><p>ROB OWENS: Okay. And then, you filed a couple patents recently, at least I think it was published that there were patents filed just with regard to scoring and ranking of traffic and to domain names. Any comment there, or is that for future potential services you guys are looking at?</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN: We do a lot of electrical property work, Rob, so we have 200 patents on file or that have been issued or being filed. So that is regular course of business for us, to try and protect intellectual property developed. We wouldn't get into specifics, as to what we do to commercialize them, unless we had already done so.</p><p>ROB OWENS: All right. Thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)</p><p>We will now go to our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.</p><p>STERLING AUTY, ANALYST, JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO.: Yes, thanks, hi, guys. I was wondering is there any change in the sources for the new names. You talked about the momentum that is building. Was there any new factors that have helped driving name growth?</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN: Hi, Sterling. No, they are the same. So the big picture around this is, we continue to see good growth in the base itself. And then, you peel it back on the renewals, those are going up nicely mostly because the previously renewed base is increasing. The new units, the sources are continuing to be the same, strong international growth, and inside that growth in the unit standpoint, the BRIC countries continue to deliver very nicely. So there is nothing -- no dramatic shifts in the trends we are seeing.</p><p>STERLING AUTY: And then, on the renewal rate, anything that we should think about in terms of renewal rate as we enter, from a seasonal factor, both the third and fourth quarter, and longer-term into the 2011 timeframe?</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN: The -- we have we had more expiring names this quarter, than last quarter. So we always have to watch how many names are in the expiring names. That doesn't impact the renewal rate, it impacts the math, as a result of those things. In the mix, we had slightly more, or we will have slightly more expiring names, first time expiring names in the mix. So the combination of those things, comes out in the wash on the overall renewal rate. And expiring base, is fairly steady as percentage of the base, but the number gets bigger, because the base is getting bigger. Does that make sense?</p><p>STERLING AUTY: Absolutely. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi.</p><p>WALTER PRITCHARD, ANALYST, CITI: It's Walter. Now that you guys have SLL closed, do you guys have any more clarity on the timing of transition expenses, and how we should think about lumpiness in terms of margins going forward?</p><p>BRIAN ROBINS: Hi, this is Brian. On the -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks the Transition Services Agreements go until mid 2011. And the Transition Services Agreements are broken into things that can be taken out of the business, such as staff that are doing billing, collections and international locations. The majority of it is network services and infrastructure that we are providing that we will keep post transitions. And so we expect that mid next year for that to be complete. And the lumpiness in the margins, you will probably see the next two quarters.</p><p>WALTER PRITCHARD: Okay, and then secondly, on headcount, it looks like you are flat as quarter. Is that the number we should expect the Company to be at going forward, or do you expect it to go up for the next few quarters?</p><p>BRIAN ROBINS: There's a couple puts and takes on headcount. So, where we are trying to manage the business to an overall margin profile, and not necessarily to a particular head count profile. And as we're ramping down on the West Coast, and ramping down up on the East Coast, we will have duplication of staff for a period of time. There's also another headcount to the TSA's, as those roll off the headcount will go on. And then we're also investing back into NIA network inter-operability and availability. There is some puts and takes through the headcount is probably in the next two or three quarters will be, one quarter it may go down, next quarter it may go up, just because of the puts and takes related to the Transition Services Agreement.</p><p>WALTER PRITCHARD: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p><p>CHLOE WAYNE, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Hi, this is Chloe Wayne for Phil Winslow. Can you comment on your expectations for the managed DNS business in the near term, and how should we think about the margin growth profile going forward as you continue to ramp it up? And just as a follow up, when you look at competitors like UltraDNS and [Astral Neustar], what does managed DNS bring to people? Thanks.</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN: Sure. As a general matter, we look at the market opportunity there. We look at the overall market -- it's about a $900 million to $1 billion market that is expected to grow at about 15% on an annual CAGR for the next three to five years. So the market opportunity itself looks attractive. When you get inside that market, it is a fairly fragmented market, as far as who the players are. So we believe that given the network we have, and the experience we have on that network, we have a competitive advantage there, plus some name brand recognition that will help us from a selling perspective. So we have a provided any guidance as to the business itself. It's not material today at this point. But we like the space itself, and we will be involved in the space, and try to grow that business. Relative to other folks at market, from a managed DNS standpoint, other players have a list of services, or a suite of services which managed DNS is one of them, and we have that offering as well. So the idea is to provide ultimately an end-to-end solution for DNS related services that are internal and external DNS.</p><p>CHLOE WAYNE: Great, thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.</p><p>SARAH FRIAR, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Mark, can you talk a little bit about some of the newer things like DNSSEC? What can that mean in terms of an revenue opportunity for next year, in terms of how much you charge customers, and what sort of penetration that you think you will get? And then some of the other things, that I was kind of working on, like the new IBMs, and the new TLD's and how do you think about the revenue opportunity and the potential impact of the core registries?</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN: Sure. On the DNSSEC side, there are two aspects for us. On the core naming business itself, DNSSEC is a cost, it's not a revenue generator, because we have do work in order to implement DNSSEC, it is a good thing for the infrastructure, for the world using infrastructure. On the flip side, the potential revenue opportunity in our NIA business, things like IPv6, DNSSEC. They make the network and DNS more complicated. So there is an opportunity there to help manage that on an outsourced basis, as folks say this is more complicated, and we would like somebody to help us out with that. So there is both a cost and revenue opportunity for us, but they're different sides of the business.</p><p>And on that IBM side, we expect the new gTLD's which we consider the IBM version of common net to go into application process mid 2011 and be granted sometime in early 2012. So that is the time frame, as far as the market expectation. We think these opportunities for us, we are trying to be a bit measured on that given two factors that we know. And this is a rough analogy, the one thing that we know is that the IDNs that are in the com net base today, that are the English IDN, meaning that com is still in English, even though it might have [khangi] in front of it. There is about a million names in the base today, in our base on that. And then, on global basis if you look at ccTLDs, it would be from countries, that would be prime -- the prime suspects, if you will, as far as sales that are in cyrillic, or some other language that are not English. There is about 16 million or 17 million total ccTLDs that are in those languages. So it is a little harder to be specific at this point, as to where it will come in, but we try to use those sort of things as book ends as for what the opportunity might be.</p><p>SARAH FRIAR: Okay, that is helpful for analysis too. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question is from Dan Cummins with ThinkEquity. Please go ahead.</p><p>DAN CUMMINS, ANALYST, THINKEQUITY LLC: Thank you, and as you look out, and I know I heard you say managed DNS is very small and young for you. As you look out though, can you talk about your expectations for the distribution model? Why wouldn't this be another wholesale opportunity to work through the big tech partners like GoDaddy, and Intuit, and Symantec and in small medium business? And would expect it would be a mix of wholesale, and the direct retail relationships at the high end?</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, Dan. I think the answer is yes to all of those. You got the right idea there. This will look like a traditional sales model, where you go to market, from a small field team going to the high end. And then you'd have an inside sales forces getting into the mid market, and then you would have a channel partners at the lower end of the market. And the lower end of the market, is where I would put our natural partners, our registrars who we'd be in with discussions about distributing all these services. But we intend to cover the gamut of the market through those distribution channels.</p><p>DAN CUMMINS: Okay, thanks, great.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions).</p><p>We will now go to our next question from Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please go ahead.</p><p>ED MAGUIRE, ANALYST, CSLA: Hi, good afternoon. I was wonder if you could shed light on any, of your broader thoughts on the potential uses of cash for M&amp;A, or the possibilities of dividend before the end of this year?</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN: In the past, as we've said, we continue to view it this way. From an M&amp;A standpoint, while it's possible that we could do some smaller deals that would help us, from a product road map standpoint where -- a go-to-market standpoint perspective, if we were to do something like that, we would need a few requirements to this core business. It wouldn't be large in size, and it would look that way, meaning it was something on the road map, or the go-to-market would be pretty clear as to why we did that. Speaking in terms of what we might do them, we'd be highly unlikely to do, is large deals, new industries -- it would be unlikely to do anything like that, so from that perspective of the use of cash from an M&amp;A standpoint.</p><p>ED MAGUIRE: Just on the -- as you look at opportunities to provide registry service, when some of the new global -- global TLD come online. I know you talked about these as an opportunity, but do these -- have you done analysis of what the business profile, and the margin profile of these types of services, might how they might compare to your existing?</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, there are two ways to look at, both of them we think are attractive. One is for a new TLD that we might go after ourselves and run. Outside of any marketing that we might have to do around that, from an operational standpoint, we have a lot of economies of scale on the network, to add a new TLD on there. Secondly, we were the back end registry provider for someone else who had the TLD, we would still enjoy the network efficiencies we have by putting a new TLD on a existing large infrastructure. So from a margin perspective, we would expect those two drivers.</p><p>ED MAGUIRE: All right, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: And now for our last question from Craig Nankervis with First Analysis. Please go ahead.</p><p>CRAIG NANKERVIS, ANALYST, FIRST ANALYSIS SECURITIES: For you Mark, the guidance for Q4 net name adds is almost flat year-over-year at the midpoint . And I guess I was a little surprised at that. Are there any factors on the negative side this year that influencing your forecast versus your result of a year</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN: There's a couple things you are looking at there, Craig. One, when we look at the expiring names base relative for third quarter, we have more expiring names in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. And the second thing is, we had a slightly higher mix in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter of names that are up for renewal for the first time. And as you may know, the first time renewal rate is substantially lower than names that have been previously renewed.</p><p>CRAIG NANKERVIS: Right, but I am sort of more focused not on Q3, but on what you did in Q4 last year, versus what you are guiding this year. And I am trying to understand if there is any end of year dynamics that are different this year, than the end of year dynamics this last year?</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN: No, I think the dynamics is the same, we've seen a couple times in the past, like I said in the script, that a few folks might do some deletions at the end of the year, that we might not be aware of, in the account review, that could happen. We're not certain if that could happen or not. But from a dynamic standpoint, everything else looks the same.</p><p>CRAIG NANKERVIS: I see. Okay, thank you. Brian, sales and marketing was much lower than I expected. It was $18 million on a non-GAAP basis. Is that is sort of the baseline going forward?</p><p>BRIAN ROBINS: It will be. There's a couple of things in sales and marketing, in the second quarter we had one time expenses. There was the (inaudible) campaign that Symantec took over in our third quarter, so we didn't recognize that in third quarter, whereas we did in the second quarter. Then also we have a one-time program related to the 25th anniversary of .com in the second quarter. So second quarter had a couple one-time events. And as we -- one of the things we did, when we sold our business to Symantec, they took our enterprise sales force, and we're in the process of building up. So it will be -- you can expect it to be sort of flattish to where it is now, and it will gradually grow over time. But the percentage of revenue will likely go down.</p><p>CRAIG NANKERVIS: Got it, thank you, I appreciate it.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll now go to Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.</p><p>IGNATIUS NJOKU, ANALYST, JEFFERIES &amp; COMPANY: Hi, this is Ignatius in for Katherine. Can you talk about what you are saying in the BRIC countries. Are you signing up more registrars? Thank you.</p><p>MARK MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, the BRIC countries continue to perform well for us. We look at the -- if we get inside the base, about 60% of the base is domestic, and about 39% to 40% is international. If you get inside of the 40% that is international, about 25% of that is what I call emerging, which is primarily BRIC. If you peel that onion one layer lower, then you find out the BRIC countries growth rate of their units, is twice as high as what might be more mature international -- international countries. So it's -- the BRIC companies continue to perform well, but it's off a lower base. But we've seen really good growth there.</p><p>IGNATIUS NJOKU: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Nancy Fazioli. Please go ahead.</p><p>NANCY FAZIOLI: Thank you, operator. I would like to remind you that Brian will be presenting at the Credit Suisse 2010 Annual Technology Conference on Tuesday, November 30, as well as the Barclays Capital Technology Conference on December 8th. And that Jamba! NIA Services will present at Lazard Capital Cloud Computing Investor Forum. The webcast registration details will be available on the investor relationship website. Also, Mark recently gave an interview on the Communicator segment of C-SPAN that can be viewed on cspan.org. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation and continued support. This concludes our call. Thank you, and good evening.</p><p>OPERATOR: This does conclude today's conference call.

My name is Alex, and I will be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.</p><p>And now I'd like to hand the call over to Jennifer Bewley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communication. Go ahead please, ma'am.</p><p>JENNIFER BEWLEY, VP, IR AND CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS, DICE HOLDINGS, INC.: Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. With me on the call today is Mike Durney, President and CEO of Dice Holdings; along with John Roberts, our CFO. This morning we issued a press release describing the Company's results for the third quarter of 2013. A copy of that release can be viewed on the Company's website at diceholdingsinc.com.</p><p>Before I hand over the call to Mike, I'd like to note that today's call includes certain forward-looking statements, particularly statements regarding the future financial and operating results of the Company and its businesses. These statements are based on management's current expectations or beliefs, and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by the statements herein due to changes in economic, business, competitive, technological, and/or regulatory factors.</p><p>The principal risks that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in the Company's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K in the sections entitled risk factors, forward-looking statements, and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. The Company is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by federal securities laws.</p><p>Today's call also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and free cash flow. For details on these measures, including why we use them, and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings release and our Form 8-K that has been furnished to the SEC, both of which are available on our website.</p><p>Now I'll turn the call over to Mike.</p><p>MIKE DURNEY, PRESIDENT AND CEO, DICE HOLDINGS, INC.: Great. Thanks, Jennifer. First, let me welcome you all to the Dice Holdings third-quarter earnings results conference call. This morning we're going to try a slightly different format. First I'll introduce you to John Roberts, our new CFO, and he'll give you a brief business and financial update. Then I'll talk about the transition period and where we stand, including an update on the business and product milestones of our Open Web product. And then we'll open it up to questions.</p><p>John joined the Company a few weeks ago, having being the CFO at a variety of tech and media companies for more than a decade, and having started his career in public accounting. Throughout his career, John has shown a great ability to lead finance teams and to become a strategic partner in improving the operating and financial performance of a diverse set of companies.</p><p>We're excited to have him join us, and it's my pleasure to turn the call over to him.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, CFO, DICE HOLDINGS, INC.: Thanks, Mike, and thanks to everyone for taking the time today to join our call. I'd like to start by briefly sharing why I'm excited to have recently joined the Company. I've known Dice for well over a decade, going back to when I was CFO at Razorfish in the early 2000s. Even then, Dice.com had a tremendous brand and community of tech professionals; and helped us quickly source, recruit, and hire the best technology professionals, all in a cost-effective manner.</p><p>That value proposition is very relevant today, and gives the Company a core principle to build upon by expanding product lines, verticals, and geographically. I was also attracted to the strong financial position of the Company, which gives us many avenues to pursue growth. And, finally, it's clear to me that Mike and the Board are committed to creating long-term shareholder value, a commitment that I share. And I look forward to being Mike's partner during the Company's transformation.</p><p>Given my short tenure at the Company, today I'll focus on giving you a quick update on the business. In Q3, revenues totaled $52.6 million, up 10% or $4.6 million, as compared to the prior year, due primarily to revenues from businesses acquired within the past 12 months. Revenues in the technology and clearance segment increased 12% year-over-year, or $4.1 million, to $37 million. At Dice.com, revenues were up about 1% year-over-year.</p><p>At the end of the quarter, the Dice service had 8450 recruitment package customers, a decline of 200 from the beginning of the quarter. About 7650, or 90% of our customers, are under annual contract at September 30. In Q3, we had approximately 1700 annual customers up for renewal, and the renewal rate was 66% during the quarter. Finally, average revenue per customer increased 2% year-over-year, to $998 per month.</p><p>On July 20, we expanded our online tech recruiting business to Europe by purchasing The IT Job Board from S3. We haven't previously detailed any contribution from this acquisition to our anticipated Q3 financial performance, in part because we had not completed the purchase accounting for the transaction. On a GAAP basis, The IT Job Board contributed $1.1 million to revenues in the quarter, and negatively impacted EBITDA by about $300,000.</p><p>With the inclusion of the written-off deferred revenue, added back, adjusted revenues would have been $1.5 million, and essentially breakeven at the adjusted EBITDA line. In this segment, our challenge continued to be our media proper areas. Slashdot Media contributed $3.7 million in revenue in the quarter as compared to $4.1 million a quarter ago; and $760,000 in the year-ago quarter from the acquisition date, which was in September of 2012.</p><p>Finally, in the tech and clearance segment, is ClearanceJobs. Recruitment activity softened as the quarter progressed, and into the government shutdown. Revenues were down 5% year-over-year, with a sharper decline in billings.</p><p>In our finance segment, revenues were down 9% year-over-year to $8.6 million. By region, and in respective local currencies, revenues in the UK, our largest market, declined 7% year-over-year in sterling. In the Asia-Pacific region, revenues declined 5% year-over-year in Singapore dollars, driven by continued softness in Australia. In continental Europe and the Middle East, revenues were down 5% year-over-year in euros; and 8% year-over-year in North America.</p><p>Moving on to energy, Rigzone's revenues were up 33%, to $6 million in the third quarter, with strong growth in career center, advertising, and events. On the events side, we have a biennial event that impacts year-over-year results. And this year, the event generated about $300,000 in revenue. Even without that impact, revenues were up 26% year-over-year.</p><p>To wrap up the segments, I'll share the Q3 change in billings for our key recruitment brands. On a year-to-year basis, Dice.com was down 3%; eFinancialCareers declined 10%; and billings at Rigzone grew 13%.</p><p>Operating expenses increased 23% year-over-year, or $7.8 million, to $41.1 million. Expenses from Slashdot Media contributed $3.5 million to the overall increase, while The IT Job Board acquisition added $2.3 million, including $820,000 of depreciation and amortization. In addition, we had about $1 million of employee-related separation expenses, including severance. These expenses are reflected in the G&amp;A, product development, and sales and marketing lines; and segment operating expenses, primarily in tech and clearance and finance.</p><p>Those one-time expenses negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA and net income. Adjusted EBITDA was $17.8 million in the third quarter, or 34% of revenues. Net income for the quarter totaled $7.1 million, resulting in diluted EPS of $0.12.</p><p>Moving on to cash flow, net cash from operations in Q3 was $6.1 million. Lower billings from the second quarter, as well as timing of tax payments, impacted operating cash flow during the quarter. Deferred revenue totaled $69.4 million at September 30, up 5% year-over-year. The increase was driven by gains at Dice.com and Rigzone, as well as the inclusion of deferred revenue from The IT Job Board acquisition of $1.5 million.</p><p>Dice Holdings ended the quarter with $44.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $60 million of debt outstanding. A few notable uses of cash in the quarter were, one, the Company purchased nearly 2.6 million shares of common stock on the open market at an average cost of $8.73 per share, or approximately $22.5 million returned to shareholders. We have about $19 million left on our current authorization. Two, the acquisition of The IT Job Board for $12.2 million, net of cash acquired; and, three, we spent about $2.4 million in CapEx.</p><p>Yesterday we entered into a revised credit facility which provides a $200 million revolver and a $50 million term loan, which will expire in October 2018. There are no changes to our interest rates or covenants. We will have quarterly amortization payments on the term loan commencing in the first quarter next year.</p><p>This morning we also filed an S-3. This simply replaces our expired shelf registration, which was in place since March 2010. At this time, there are no transactions planned under the S-3. Before we discuss Q4 guidance, I want to take a minute to reconcile our Q3 performance to the outlook we provided in July, since that outlook did not include a forecast for The IT Job Board.</p><p>In July, we expected $52 million in revenues for Q3. On an apples-to-apples basis, we achieved $51.5 million, with the majority of the shortfall in the Slashdot Media business. On the adjusted EBITDA line, the forecast was $18.5 million. From our reported $17.8 million, The IT Job Board negatively impacted EBITDA by $300,000; and the employee separation costs were $1 million.</p><p>Below the EBITDA line, we had an additional depreciation and amortization of $820,000 from The IT Job Board. Our Q4 guidance includes The IT Job Board and reductions to account for our performance to date. We anticipate revenues for the full year to be $208 million, including $2.9 million from The IT Job Board, partially offset by a lower performance in Q3. And we anticipate adjusted EBITDA of $72 million, primarily due to the previously mentioned employee separation expenses.</p><p>For more, I'll turn the call back over to Mike.</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Great. Thanks, John. I've been here for over 13 years; that's about 5000 days in the organization, but only about 30 of them as CEO. When you spend that much time in a company, you learn a lot of things. Then, when you change roles, you learn even more. Based on what I've learned over the transition period, I'm very excited to lead this organization forward.</p><p>It's a great perspective to have -- familiar with the organization from within, but not wed to the past. I've always been fascinated by what we do; why professionals choose our sites; what employers look to us for; what we can do more efficiently; and how we can serve customers and professionals better. We don't have all the answers, but we're putting a tremendous amount of energy and effort to reposition for growth and instill a sense of urgency throughout our organization.</p><p>I've spent the transition period working with our teams to prioritize our plans, especially in product, and to make a few organizational changes that will help speed us through our Company's transformation. I'm encouraged by the early progress we are making and am optimistic about our value proposition. But I'm fully grounded in the fact that our overall business has slowed, and it will take time for the investments we're making in product and people to show dividends.</p><p>Let we start with where we are and what we're doing. First, there are number of things that we will not change. Our specialty focus offers us tremendous differentiation against our competition. Our deep expertise within our communities offers hiring managers and recruiters of value that's difficult to replicate in a more general service. However, we'll have to get better at using the data we have to deliver our expertise to customers and professionals.</p><p>For professionals, we'll refine our focus to be more valuable to them throughout their careers. Here, we're starting from a position of strength, with targeted communities that are largely continuing to grow. For example, unique visitors on Dice are up 4% year-over-year to more than 2.3 million each month, while Rigzone crossed the 1 million unique visitor threshold for the first time during Q3. That number is roughly double what it was when we bought the company three years ago.</p><p>The goal here is to expand our market opportunity and improve engagement with professionals throughout their careers. Historically, we've used the phrase manage your career as a euphemism for helping you find a job. Now we want to provide tools, information, and a pathway to help professionals manage their careers from beginning to end. Our offerings will expand to satisfy a greater need than visiting our sites when professionals are ready to switch positions.</p><p>We are part of the way there, but there is more to do. Rigzone is a good example. By providing original and aggregated content -- as well as sponsored webinars; rig ownership data; rig movement information -- oil and gas professionals are more informed about what's going on in their industry. In turn, they visit the site regularly and interact on an ongoing basis. That interaction, for instance, leads Rigzone to have email open rates that most companies dream about; and, frankly, make better, more informed candidates.</p><p>On a site like Dice, it could be something as simple as giving technology professionals a look at the behind-the-scenes job market; or information from technology companies about products that make their jobs easier; or offering skills mapping that identifies hot trends that will help them progress. There is a variety of paths to take, and we will enhance our knowledge within those markets we serve to attract professionals regularly.</p><p>Now, switching over to the hiring manager and recruiter side, we'll focus on providing talent efficiently. Efficiency takes a lot of forms -- quickly putting together slate of candidates; understanding who the best candidates are for your company; understanding the likelihood that a candidate actually becomes a hire, which is what we refer to as actionability; or helping companies understand, from a talent perspective, where they should open a new office. Essentially, we want to produce talent for our customers with a minimum amount of effort on their part, and one that makes their recruitment efforts more effective.</p><p>If we do that, our ROI strengthens, and our value to customers is enhanced. On the big-picture strategy, our changes are more tweaks than overhauls. But the products that we develop and focus on to get there will change, in part to utilize our own data better. As a specialist with unique expertise, we have to have the best information, the best data, and the most efficient way to deliver it. Any insight customers or professionals need -- we should be the first stop or their first call. We will get better providing and analyzing data in each of our verticals; which, in turn, is the kind of content that makes us more valuable to professionals and customers.</p><p>As an example, in the third quarter Rigzone launched a product called [Rig Recruit IQ]. This product marries our rig data that we collect and sell, as part of a subscription-based data service, with our recruiting expertise. That gives customers an understanding of when rigs are coming in and out of service, which has workforce and recruiting implications. It's just one of the ways we understand the power of big data.</p><p>Of course Dice's Open Web big data recruiting has been in beta throughout 2013 as we tested new features. And I'm happy to say Open Web is ready for the next stage of development. Customers regularly using Open Web continue to renew at higher rates than a like group not using Open Web. We've seen repeatedly how customers are leveraging the data and candidate insights to gain an edge in tech recruiting.</p><p>And customer events, one early adopter reported filling a CTO role in Silicon Valley with Open Web. Another said that their response rates were significantly higher than other sources. It's these valuable peer-to-peer endorsements that will allow us to continue to drive usage, and move more customers into regular users. And I might add, we hired a developer in Des Moines using Open Web.</p><p>On the product side, one of the big hurdles to driving recurring adoption is to make Open Web part of a recruiter's natural workflow. The first step to being fully integrated with Dice was to harmonize the profiles between resumes found on Dice and the results found using Open Web. Essentially, no more tabbing between a candidate's Dice resume and that same professional's Open Web profile, and making candidate information consistent visually. Regardless of where you started your search, either in Open Web or our resume database, you'll see similar results.</p><p>In October, we rolled that out to a subset of our client base. While this may seem like a small step, it's a big step forward for Open Web to ultimately integrating search. Once that engineering is complete, recruiters will see a combined set of results, including full candidate information with resumes, as well as Open Web profiles. Then all recruiters' normal habits on Dice will also include Open Web candidates, or essentially a complete map of the tech population.</p><p>This is one important step in providing efficiency. Naturally, the level of information is different. A detailed resume in the Dice database contains more specific skill sets, while Open Web profiles contain many other attributes that are valuable. To drive adoption, we need to have recruiters do less work, or for our product to drive the efficiency they want to fully value our product. And we know more adoption of Open Web means more revenue.</p><p>In addition, we've released an Open Web extension for users of Chrome browsers. Whenever you visit a tech professional's profile on a social site, Open Web will show you if that candidate has any other profiles. For those clients using cloud-based ATS systems, Open Web will also give you a profile using an email address. It's an incredibly valuable shortcut to getting the best social information on a candidate, regardless of when they entered the Company's recruiting system. So, essentially, we've opened the front door of Open Web.</p><p>These Open Web milestones are just the beginning. We've committed to constantly integrating our products. This means we'll develop new products and features faster, and there will be more sharing of resources and services among each of our brands.</p><p>We're committed to creating revenue streams in new areas, too. One service where we've accelerated development in eFinancialCareers, as well as Dice and Health Callings, is search, match, and filter. We will do a search; create a short list; and qualify candidates to hiring managers' openings for an additional fee. We have leveraged a database search service that Rigzone has had for a long time and rolled it into the other services. While it is early, we already have had success selling this product.</p><p>At eFinancialCareers, the product has been well received by smaller financial services organizations, like fund managers, who want to take advantage of eFinancialCareers but don't necessarily have the resources to source candidates for themselves. On Dice, we have seen successful clients who have called to purchase a single job posting. It's not that they don't want to use our resume and Open Web database; they simply don't have the time for every role, or they may not have the internal expertise for certain types of searches. This product helps them get the most out of their investment, and makes them more efficient as a recruiting team.</p><p>In healthcare, we are providing a similar service which helps us stand out from the competition; another step in providing talent efficiently. Another area of focus is mobile. We didn't get it right on Dice the first time. But Rigzone's apps, which were launched during the quarter, earned 4.5 stars in the Apple Store, and nearly 5 stars for their Android app. We learn, and then we act.</p><p>So, to summarize, our focus is on expanding our relevance to professionals throughout their career, and to deliver talent efficiently to hiring managers and recruiters. Our promise is to deliver on this proposition with new and better products and features that will be developed faster and be more responsive to customers' needs. We are allocating resources where necessary, taking our strong team and making it stronger, and positioning the Company for long-term growth.</p><p>We have heightened our focus on creating value for shareholders. The creation of shareholder value comes from a variety of sources, including generating organic growth from our existing businesses; acquisitions which expand the Company's market opportunity; and through maximizing our capital structure. And we are focused on all three. I'm excited to take the lead of the Company, and want to thank all of our employees for their hard work through the transition.</p><p>Now, Operator, we're ready for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Tim McHugh, William Blair.</p><p>TIM MCHUGH, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY: Hello, yes. Thanks, Mike. I guess first just the customer renewal rate and the overall customer account for Dice is something I wanted to ask about. And if you can just give more color, and in particular relative to -- obviously the commentary about Open Web has been positive. And the thought has been that, as that grows, that will have a positive impact on renewal rates. So, can you just talk a little bit more about what you saw?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Sure. So, a couple of things. So, Open Web, the renewal rate -- as I said earlier -- the renewal rate for customers using Open Web on a recurring basis is higher than it would have been if there were not Open Web customers. And so that's continued, and the spread's continued. We still don't have significant increase in adoption. We think that the adding of integrated profiles, and making the use of Open Web and the talent match service -- which is a Dice search service -- more efficient, will help the adoption. And that should help retention rates over time.</p><p>I think there's a couple of other things that impact renewal rates and the customer count in total. So, as John pointed out, a higher percentage, again, of total customers are under annual agreement, so we're still struggling a little bit with the shorter-term contracts. But on the annual contracts, we saw a couple of things. One, there was a little bit of a slowdown in September, ahead of the government shutdown. I don't know that, on Dice, that had a huge impact. But it did have an impact. And it mirrored the impact we saw in July and August of 2011, when we had the default looming. And then it bounced back afterwards. So we think that had a short-term impact, and we would expect that to rebound.</p><p>During the quarter, we put in the new CRM system, which temporarily impacted the productivity of the sales teams. I don't think that's a huge item, but it is an item that impacted August and September. And so, I think those are factors. And the last, we've seen something that's not huge, but we have seen customers rolling their contracts forward to sync up with the end of the year. It's something we've seen in the past, too. We saw a little bit more of it in the third quarter, as we are negotiating with customers, setting them up for calendar year renewal. So I think all of those factor into what happened with the retention rate and with billings in the third quarter.</p><p>TIM MCHUGH: Okay, that's helpful. And then, Slashdot -- can you talk about what is the issue there? Is it the market? Is it internal execution? And what have you put in place to try and fix the performance there?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: The literal answer to your first two pieces is yes and yes. The market certainly has declined significantly for traditional display advertising. We were not well positioned to transition from that. We've had a historical reliance on big tech companies as our core customers. And I won't name them, but they are all the ones that you would think. And some of those had either slight drops, or significant drops, or total drops over the last few months in terms of their spend on traditional display. And we were not well positioned for that.</p><p>So, some of it is execution, and some of it is the market. We have changed some of the leadership in the Company. My observation is -- from a content and product and tech standpoint, we performed quite well. From a sales and sales execution standpoint, we haven't. And that's what we're changing.</p><p>TIM MCHUGH: Okay. And then, lastly, the Rigzone underlying growth rate. It seems like Q4, the implied guidance is for a fair amount slower growth rate. And I know there's some lumpiness in revenue. Is there anything -- the bookings sounded solid -- but is there anything, any reason for that, or any underlying challenges that are reflected there?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: No. There is lumpiness in that business from the events, and there are events that take place at different times during the year. It's not a huge part of the business, but it does have an impact on year-over-year growth. And John pointed out the biannual event that happened in September in Aberdeen. And there's events that roll in and out of quarters.</p><p>The other thing I would say -- and you guys have heard me say this before -- so when we give guidance on the individual segments, we use percentages. And so 1 percentage point is $0.5 million, and so there's a fair amount of rounding in there. I wouldn't read anything else into it; I think the business is fine.</p><p>TIM MCHUGH: Okay, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Youssef Squali, Cantor.</p><p>NAVED KHAN, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Yes, hello, thanks. This is actually Naved Khan for Youssef. Just a couple of questions. Since the actual shutdown happened in October, can you guys talk about the trends you saw into this month? And what are you baking into your guidance for the fourth quarter in terms of going forward? And then I have a follow-up.</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Yes, I would say that coming out of the shutdown in the middle of the month, we haven't had enough time to see trends. I think the overall performance of the business, both from a new business rate and from a retention rate, so far in October are what we thought they would be. So there hasn't been much of a change there. And we would expect some of that to rebound coming out of that. But it's too early to see a huge trend, post-shutdown.</p><p>NAVED KHAN: Yes, okay. And then just on the Open Web initiative, how exactly are you rolling this out? Are the customers that are using it are the ones that have renewed? Or are you letting customers sort of test it, and then basically using it as a tool for retention and renewal?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: So, the product has been in beta for a while. We've had different strategies in terms of how we market it, and how we go to market with the product. In the background we've been working on a number of features, including this integrated profiles that I described before; where now when somebody does a search in either place, the profiles that they see for candidates include both candidates that come from the Dice database of resumes and profiles, and then Open Web searches.</p><p>That product has been in development for a while. We tested it with a handful of core customers over the last couple of months. We've now rolled it out to a subset of the customer base. And we expect to roll it out to the rest of the customer base over the rest of this quarter. So we're being thoughtful about how we roll it out, and getting feedback and input -- which we've gotten quite a bit, actually, from the first group of customers.</p><p>So, Open Web itself can be used by any paying customer. But the integrated profiles, which is a really key initiative for us in terms of generating higher usage, is being rolled out slowly over a segment of the customer base.</p><p>NAVED KHAN: I see, okay. And then can you just expand a little bit on the latest acquisition that you just made, and what the opportunity is there?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Sure. So, in July we closed on the acquisition of IT Job Board. The IT Job Board is a collection of a few tech-focused career sites in the UK, Germany, and in the Benelux region. And we view that -- one, we view it as there's good opportunity in each of those markets for them individually. But, strategically, for us, the real initiative has been to use that as a springboard to penetrate tech online recruiting outside North America. And so those plans are in place.</p><p>So, for the moment, the business is running as it was before. We're doing a couple of things with Slashdot and SourceForge to generate traffic and awareness. But there's more to come in terms of the big strategic item, which is to roll out tech in other markets.</p><p>NAVED KHAN: Okay, great. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Jeff Silber, BMO Capital Markets.</p><p>JEFF SILBER, ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS: Thanks so much. I'm not sure if you discussed the pricing environment in your prepared remarks. If you can just give us a little bit more color on that, that would be great.</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Sure. I would say, generally speaking, the pricing environment hasn't changed a whole lot, which I think was probably true last quarter as well. There seems to be relative stability in the market. There aren't as many crazy pricing things that we hear about. And I'm talking about the general market, both North America and non-North America, and across the various verticals that we operate in. So we haven't seen much in terms of pricing that's different from three months ago or six months ago.</p><p>JEFF SILBER: Okay, that's great to hear. Looking at the guidance -- and maybe I'm just reading a little bit too much into it -- but if you look at the guidance for energy for the fourth quarter, it implies flat year-over-year revenue. Is that just a rounding issue?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: I would say, yes, that's a rounding issue. There is some lumpiness from the events that we do, in terms of what quarters they fall in, and how many of them we do, which generate about 10% to 15% of revenue. But I would view most of that as rounding.</p><p>JEFF SILBER: Okay, great. And then, finally, in terms of use of cash, what your plans are going forward.</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Yes, generally speaking, our use of cash plans haven't changed from what they've been in the past, which are -- we generate a fair amount of cash from our operations. We look to use that to either look for acquisition opportunities to expand our market opportunity, or share repurchases. And they are the same.</p><p>JEFF SILBER: Okay, great. Thanks so much.</p><p>OPERATOR: Craig Huber, Huber Research Partners.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER, ANALYST, HUBER RESEARCH PARTNERS: Yes, good morning. Can we just talk a little bit more, please, about the small acquisitions, and the performance year-over-year that you haven't already talked about? What I'm really curious about is, on a pro forma basis for the quarter, assuming you own the small acquisitions for both this year's quarter or full quarter, and also a year ago -- what was the revenue percent change for the small acquisitions year-over-year, please? And also the margins as well, or just the profits. Thanks.</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Yes, so, pro forma, the Slashdot acquisition year-over-year -- revenues were down about $1 million from the period where we only owned it a piece last year; that full quarter of 2012 until this year. And IT Job Board -- I don't recall specifically what it was a year ago. But it was down slightly year-over-year to this year. And this year is impacted by -- for us, is impacted by the deferred revenue write-down.</p><p>From an EBITDA standpoint, Slashdot Media is near breakeven for this quarter. And IT Job Board had a small EBITDA loss for us in this period, in part because -- as you guys who have followed us for a long time know -- we do these acquisitions, we have deferred revenue write-downs. And so we have the impact of that, of $300,000 to $400,000 in this period. So our margin was negatively impacted -- it's small; but negatively impacted by about $300,000.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: If you think -- now I'm just curious, just given some of the issues around the acquisitions, does it give you any hesitation or pause about doing any future small acquisitions here? Or do you think these are just more one-off?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Yes, it does give pause. I think a reflection on any acquisition makes us think about what we'd want to do going forward. I think you're right, that relatively small acquisitions come with their own set of items. I think the Slashdot, SourceForge acquisition used the term one-off. I don't know that I would say it's one-off. But there are unique issues to that business that we knew when we bought it, and they were just deeper and broader than we planned for. And it's taken us longer to fix it. But we're going to fix it, and there's a lot of focus now on fixing it. And we've brought somebody in to help us fix it.</p><p>I think if you look back, IT Job Board is new, but that acquisition is performing just fine for us in the couple of months we've owned it. I think the one -- when we did healthcare, the healthcare business is growing quite nicely. But if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't have bought something that small. So the answer is yes, it makes us think about size of acquisition, and focus of acquisition, for small ones. But, strategically, I think we're doing the right thing in terms of expanding our footprint in a variety of ways.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: And then also if you could please, just the deferred revenue -- can you just speak a little bit further, if you adjust that for the small acquisitions, what that looked like both sequentially, but also year over year -- what's the differences there? Thanks.</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: So, deferred revenue changed by about $3 million. $1.5 million of it is related to the acquisition, so it's about half.</p><p>I'm sorry, Craig, was that your question?</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: Yes, okay, that's helpful there. And then also, just given your new role as CEO -- and congratulations to both of you in your new roles here -- I'm just curious if you could just tell us briefly what you think you may be doing different here in terms of the future of the Company; how you run this, versus how it was run before. Or is it more just status quo going forward here?</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS: Craig, this is John, so let me start. I've been at the Company for a couple of weeks now, so this is week three. And from my perspective, as I said at the beginning, I'm excited to join the Company for a number of reasons. One of them is the strong financial performance that the Company has demonstrated over the years. So I think I come into a CFO role here with a very strong financial organization, with a company that has a strong financial position and underpinning to it.</p><p>And my role, and my objectives and goal, is to try to enhance that and improve that, and drive better performance over the longer-term. I don't come in with a -- thinking that there's a radical change to that, but look for ways to continue to make improvements to it over the next number of years.</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: I'm certainly looking forward to John improving the CFO position, I hope. For me -- and I referred to this earlier in the opening remarks -- yes, strategically, we're going to go down the same or similar path. I participated in that strategy over a number of years, and so I wouldn't have -- anybody should not have expected that it would be significantly different. Yes, my focus is making sure we have the resources in the right place to optimize our performance.</p><p>I think we have to get better at product development; we have to be faster; we have to broader in terms of the things we look at from a product standpoint -- not broader in terms of our business footprint, but broader in how we think about adding product. I'm instilling a sense of urgency in the organization to have it move faster. And we've made some adjustments in how we're aligned, and how we're structured, and how the reporting works; to try to improve that.</p><p>We have a number of great businesses; we have a number of good businesses; and we have one or two businesses that need focus. And we're going to build on the strengths and work on the weaknesses.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: Lastly, if I could just ask please, the $1 million severance of extension you guys took in the quarter, where was that focused at in your business? And is there anything you're seeing differently in the marketplace that made you take that, please?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: So, the $1 million is a couple of things related to changes in the organization. And it spread out in a few different places. It's generally things that I thought we should do from an organization standpoint, and that's the cost of making those changes. There's nothing more to it; we pointed it out because it did have an impact on our EBITDA performance for the third quarter. But I wouldn't view it as anything more than we've made some changes as far as the transition.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: It's not a reaction to what you're seeing in the marketplace?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: No, no, no. No, it's organizational changes.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: Okay, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Michael Purcell, Stifel.</p><p>MICHAEL PURCELL, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS &amp; COMPANY: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. And welcome, John. I'm hoping we can work on the tech side just a little bit more. Got some questions. So it seems to me that, all in all, tech came in, on a like-to-like, about $0.5 million or so below what you expected. It seems mainly at Slashdot. Is that right?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Yes, that is correct.</p><p>MICHAEL PURCELL: Okay. And then so if I just back in the guide, if I estimate -- I don't know, maybe $2 million contribution from IT Job Board in the fourth quarter, if that's about right or not, it seems like the tech outlook is just coming down just a smidge, by $1 million or so. Is that fair?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: I think, directionally, that's fair. I think it's too much on the core tech side. But I think, directionally, it's right.</p><p>MICHAEL PURCELL: Okay. Then on the core tech side, it seems like it met your expectations. The bookings were down about 3%. I think it was about 2% last quarter overall, so it seems like that business is going okay. Mike, I'm wondering, is there any way you can quantify -- we're reading the same headlines us everybody else about some of these large enterprises reducing tech staff, et cetera. I'm wondering if you could quantify how much that may have hit you, versus what you guys were thinking at the beginning of the second quarter.</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Sure. So, I think the first thing I would say is I think you're a little generous in saying it's okay. I think we need to improve. There are things in place -- the new management of Dice has only been in place for about six months, and they're doing some really good stuff in terms of turning that business. So I appreciate the okay, but my view is we need to do better.</p><p>I think from what's going on in the tech employment marketplace, I think there is some impact. I don't think it's huge, though; and I don't think it's new, frankly. So the impact of any one organization having significant reductions in staff doesn't really have a huge impact on us. But I think what's going on overall in the tech market, outside Silicon Valley and Silicon Alley, and some of the other core tech markets, those are strong. But what's going on outside of those markets in middle America, which is still a big employer of tech professionals, has had some impact.</p><p>And we've seen the unemployment rate increase a little bit in September in tech. Although one month up or down tends to move quite a bit from month to month, but it did increase in September.</p><p>MICHAEL PURCELL: Okay. No, I didn't mean to imply that you think it's okay. I'm just really trying to get a sense of the packaged business versus what you guys were thinking in the beginning of the second quarter, where comes out this year.</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Yes.</p><p>MICHAEL PURCELL: And the second thing, on the finance -- it looks like the rate it has declined has mitigated so much. And with your guidance, even though the billings were down 10% or so, it looks like eFinance could be flat this quarter from your guidance?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Yes, so, we said towards the beginning of the year we were beginning to see some signs that it was stabilizing, and we tried to be cautious about how we communicated that because it wasn't stabilizing; but we were seeing signs of stabilization. And I think we have actually now seen that. And so, give or take $100,000, the business has essentially been flat from the second quarter through the end of the year.</p><p>It's not better, but I would say at the end of September and into October, we've heard some things from clients that make it seem like it's getting better, or might get better. So, I'm generally cautious about that market, and especially as you get towards the end of the year. But I think, as you know in that business, billings and revenue tend to track a little bit more closely as opposed to being in front, because we don't bill a lot of stuff up front like we do in the other businesses.</p><p>So I wouldn't focus so much on billings and revenue year-over-year in Q3. But I would say it is flattening, which is something we thought would start to happen a number of months ago.</p><p>MICHAEL PURCELL: Okay, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Randy Reece, Avondale Partners.</p><p>RANDY REECE, ANALYST, AVONDALE PARTNERS: Good morning. I was listening with interest in your commentary about ways you plan to change your value proposition. And what's unclear to me is if this means changing your cost structure, maybe adding more personnel cost, or other fixed cost.</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: I think that's a good question. But I would separate them. So, from adding personnel, we have been adding personnel during this year. We have been building out the product development aspect of our business and focus more on product and systems development, which is something we talked about over the last year plus. So that has been happening. I think the focus on the value proposition -- I don't think, in and of itself, necessitates us adding personnel or fixed cost to it. I think we just have to be smarter about what areas of the market we go after, and how we generate content, including-user generated content or data or other services.</p><p>So, for instance, I referred to our matching service, where historically Rigzone has done -- had a side of their business where they did searches through the database and presented a short list of candidates to customers, for which we charge a premium. And as compared to the single job posting rate. it's a significant premium. And we've rolled that out to the other services.</p><p>But we're using existing people on staff to do that work, because we do some of that work for ourselves and in the background for customers. And so, using that as an example, when we talk about the value proposition, I wouldn't view it as necessitating an increase in people. But to be clear, we have been adding people, especially in product and systems development.</p><p>RANDY REECE: But that doesn't change your expected return on your product development investment. That's just kind of a periodic surge (multiple speakers).</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Yes, it's been an ongoing effort. It's reflected in what our results have been. We need to generate more product development and we need to do things faster, and that has required us to add people. But that's been in the works for quite a long period of time. If you look at our product development costs, we said for a long time that it would increase that as a percentage of revenue. That has happened. But I don't think that's directly tied to other areas where we can increase our value proposition for customers and for professionals.</p><p>RANDY REECE: All right. I'm curious about your transition plan with The IT Job Board assets. How much of their job listings in the past came from the staffing company, directly or indirectly? And how do you get job postings on those boards fast enough to keep from having a big dent in the revenue generation?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: From the staffing company, you mean S3, the company that owned them, specifically?</p><p>RANDY REECE: Yes, yes.</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Yes, so, if you go back a number of years, that number was pretty significant. And IT Job Board itself did not pursue staffing and recruiting companies as clients because of the conflict. What they did a couple of years ago is they separated the organization and started to sell to what's referred to as recruitment consultants in Europe. And so the impact of S3 on the business is not very significant in terms of a change. And part of our arrangement in buying the company was they've committed to be a customer for a period of time under normal terms.</p><p>And so I wouldn't expect any change in terms of what happens with the business. But it does free us up now to be more aggressive in terms of how we go after recruitment consultants and recruitment agencies.</p><p>RANDY REECE: All right. Can you give us an idea of what the investment plan is at -- timing, and when you expect some kind of improvement, and what kind of possible synergies you might be able to pull in?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: I'm sorry, Randy -- from IT Job Board?</p><p>RANDY REECE: Yes.</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Yes, so, we're still developing those plans in conjunction with Slashdot and SourceForge outside North America. One of the synergies we expect to come out of this is, historically we've got a very small organization -- a tiny organization -- selling Slashdot and SourceForge outside North America. So while the majority of the traffic for SourceForge and about 40% of the traffic for Slashdot come from outside North America, the percentage of revenue that we generated outside North America for the two businesses combined, I think, was somewhere between 10% and 15%.</p><p>So one of the things we're going to do is utilize the IT media portion of IT Job Board to sell Slashdot and SourceForge, especially in Europe, and then into Asia. So that's one of the areas where we get synergies from that. From a product roadmap, we're still developing the timing around how we integrate the North American business Dice, together with the international business, so that is to come.</p><p>RANDY REECE: All right. Thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: Bill Sutherland, Emerging Growth Equities.</p><p>BILL SUTHERLAND, ANALYST, EMERGING GROWTH EQUITIES: Thanks. Most of mine have been asked, of course, but I had a couple just a little more color kind of questions, Mike -- on the transactional business for Dice, and what's that doing to the overall growth trend? And associated with that is just wondering about the hiring patterns for the large -- some of your traditional, large enterprise clients. Obviously flattish or certainly not growing as much as they should, and whether the -- because the net growth in the marketplace is potentially more in the small and emerging growth kinds of employers. Whether that's more of a challenge as far as your traditional model.</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Yes. So, on the first piece, the transactional business, certainly we've seen a fall-off in that over the last year plus, and that certainly has an impact. It has an impact in two ways. From a pure revenue standpoint in the short term, the impact on revenue is not great from an initial sales standpoint. What it does impact, though, is the ability to use it as a lead generation tool. So from a Web store, the self-service product, we saw a decline through the beginning of this year. We changed the pricing early on to try to generate more volume. That has now started to happen. But the impact of this lack of urgency around needs for filling positions has translated into less short-term business, which then reduces the pipeline. So we are doing some things structurally to remedy that.</p><p>On the second piece, we haven't seen a huge impact in terms of the patterns of large clients. The largest clients tend to be the big staffing consulting firms, together with the big tech companies. And our arrangements with them have not materially changed. They are not growing significantly, but they're certainly not reducing. And that has contributed to the flattening revenue per customer, which we predicted would happen for two-plus years now, and now it finally seems to have happened. Which is not the worst thing in the world, as long as we generate increases in customer account. But the relationship with the bigger clients has not changed.</p><p>BILL SUTHERLAND: Okay. So the key thing is increasing customer count. And I guess that brings us back to the whole sales -- the structure of the salesforce. I know that that's been a focus for a few quarters, to get the productivity up. So, what are you -- where do you take the efforts -- where do you refocus now to move the needle on sales productivity?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Yes. So, looking at the whole -- and focused on tech and clearance segment, specifically -- so, we've done a couple things. We've brought in a new head of sales for that business in July. We've made some other changes in the organization. I think from a productivity and focus standpoint, we're doing a couple things. One is we're getting the salespeople -- both the inside salespeople, the telesales people; together with the -- what we call the national accounts people, the field sales group -- getting in front of more customers more routinely, which is something we're quite focused on, and has had an impact so far. It's not a huge impact, but it certainly has had an impact on our relationship with customers. So that's one.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, we have put in a new CRM system, which is the first time we've changed the CRM in 12 years -- so, the last one was put in in 2001 -- which should increase productivity and make the sales process more seamless. We have some growing and adoption pains, but the whole sales organization is convinced that it was the right thing to do. So once we get over the adoption pains, we'll be a much more efficient salesforce.</p><p>And we're looking at the organization structure and trying to supplement it with some new people, and that's been in the works for a couple of months.</p><p>BILL SUTHERLAND: But as far as incentives and so forth, you feel like that's appropriately set?</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Yes, I think so. We're always looking to tweak it. And I think having new sales leadership brings some new thoughts and new experiences, and experiences from other places. So I wouldn't say, specifically, that it's set in stone and we're thrilled with it. But generally, I think the structure that we have is pretty good. But I think we're going to try to evaluate whether we should tweak it.</p><p>BILL SUTHERLAND: Okay. Thanks, Mike.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. We have no further questions left in the queue. I would now like to hand the call back to Michael Durney for closing remarks.</p><p>MIKE DURNEY: Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for your time and interest in Dice Holdings. We are here to answer any follow-up questions that you may have. Call us at 212-448-4181, and we'll be happy to answer whatever questions you have.

Please go ahead.</p><p>PAULA SCHWARTZ, IR, ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES INC: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead, Joel.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS, CHAIRMAN, CEO &amp; FOUNDER, ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.: Thank you, and welcome, everybody to the third-quarter call. Today with me are Dean Shigenaga, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Richardson, Chief Operating Officer; Dan Ryan, Executive Vice President; and Tom Andrews, Executive Vice President. Firstly I'd like to start by congratulating the entire Alexandria team on a truly excellent third-quarter, operating and financial results really in all respects.</p><p>Let me turn to the core to start the conversation. We had a very solid third quarter, 96.2% occupancy. We leased over a million square feet. And as you know, with the 4 million square feet year to date is for 2015 the highest in the Company's history with average lease term this quarter of about 8.7 years, very good. I think that really goes to the heart of that the team has successfully executed and taken advantage of this great high demand environment.</p><p>Also 8.8% cash leasing spreads, 4.8% cash same-store property NOI growth, coupled with strong annual escalations in virtually every lease and triple net lease structure in virtually every lease, also has really driven our high margins. So we're very proud of the core.</p><p>Really proof positive our client tenant user base wants to be on Alexandria campuses and in Alexandria-owned and managed Class A buildings because we are the brand. And we take the time and make it our business and solemn commitment to understand our tenants' businesses, their space needs, growth, as well as their challenges. Most of the facilities we deal with are really mission critical facilities of our user base.</p><p>Moving to demand, to give you a sense of what we see at the operating ground level. It's certainly true there's a very supply-constrained base availability in Alexandria's urban campus markets, particularly Cambridge and the City of San Francisco. This tightness of availability has certainly impacted behavior of some tenants in the market.</p><p>Demand for Alexandria's urban campus and Class A buildings is the strongest in the Company's 21-year history. We're really blessed to be in the absolute best locations with the best assets at the intersection of the two most important successful industries, life science and technology.</p><p>Increasing macro volatility, things like China, et cetera, have clearly had an impact on decision-making by some tenants in the market. We believe that Alexandria's best-in-class campuses and facilities, though, will continue to maintain high occupancy and strong rental rates during such volatility.</p><p>The window is open for biotech but has become more selective regarding quality and valuation and undoubtedly will have some impact on certain tenants in the market. Public sector big tech at the forefront of mobile and cloud have had a banner year in 2015. Some, and certainly not all, of the private tech companies with $1 billion valuations and above that are private may have some challenges with sustaining recent peaks in private market valuations which may have some impact, again, on decisions by some of those tenants in the market.</p><p>Moving to tenant strength and selection, something that's really very important here at Alexandria. I think it's great to note that 53% of our annual base rent is from investment-grade tenants, one of the highest in the REIT industry. And our duration of our top 20 tenants comprising almost half of our ABR is 8.6 years. So we have strong solid durable and secure cash flows.</p><p>Our very high-quality science and tech team coupled with our world-class advisors provide us first-in-class research on our tenant industries and also our tenant underwriting. Maybe two examples in point with leases signed this quarter, let's go to Pinterest first.</p><p>We signed 150,000 square foot lease for 100% of our 505 Brannan Street campus project in one of the absolute best locations in SoMa in the City of San Francisco for a first phase of development. We had multiple users looking at this spectacular location but we chose Pinterest because of our longer-term relationship with the management team.</p><p>Initial discussions started in Spring of 2014 when Pinterest had raised $750 million with evaluation of $5 billion. Since then Pinterest has raised an additional $1.3 billion on a valuation of $11 billion, so we try to be highly discriminating in our tenant selection.</p><p>One of our key advisors is deeply connected to Pinterest, which also helped as well. We understand and like their user base and growth prospects. We feel that the B2B business will be even more potent than their historical B2C.</p><p>On the multiple revenue stream aspect, we like the ad revenues, the approach they're using to viable pins, and partnerships with brands that can give them multiple revenue streams. We also like the management team and the investors are first class including Andreessen Horowitz, Bessemer Trust, Fidelity, Goldman and Wellington.</p><p>The financial metrics are also important. We looked at cash on hand and the ability of them to survive in the downturn. We also looked at their cash burn and the ability to cut it in case they need to, and also critically important to all these companies, a reasonable and methodical pathway to profitability.</p><p>Moving on to Bluebird Bio. We signed a lease for 253,000 square feet at our 60 Binney Street property with Bluebird Bio. Overall demand in the Cambridge market at the time of selection of Bluebird for the 60 Binney project was significant. There was a mix of demand, both credit and non-credit as well as life science and technology.</p><p>Space needs and timing vary considerably for each requirement. IBM Watson was in the market and we were fortunate to capture them as a sub-tenant on a 10-year lease at the 75-125 Binney Street. That location and space matched their timing well as 60 and 100 Binney developments would have been delivered too late for their requirement.</p><p>Similarly, Alexandria was also able to fill the requirement for Bristol Myers at 100 Binney, since we had opportunistically begun the project. We also had secured Sanofi Genzyme as our anchor at 50 Binney.</p><p>Bluebird Bio was ultimately was selected based on a number of factors including timing, space needs, relationship. And we have a high degree of respect for Nick Leschly, the CEO, whose father was also CEO of SmithKline Beecham. The quality of the Company, the profile, of the quality of their technology and their prospects, their space needs matched well with the 60 Binney project, which will lead to significant construction cost savings and given the ability to build both 50 and 60 Binney simultaneously.</p><p>Alexandria's also had an important and strategic relationship both with the Company and also its early investors and Board members. We also see the overall mix within the ecosystem to be an important consideration for long-term value.</p><p>Similar to Biogen, Bluebird is a few years away from potential regulatory, as Biogen was a number of years ago from potential regulatory approval of its first product. It would then commence commercial sales soon thereafter and continue to build out the product offering and grow the Company. Both the stage and growth potential of the Company are critical to the overall ecosystem and fundamentally why large pharma companies keep moving into Kendall Square today.</p><p>At the end of the day we had three publicly-traded biotech companies looking at these Binney projects and we ultimately chose Bluebird for 60 Binney. Bluebird has almost $1 billion in cash and marketable securities as of the end of the second quarter. Its current market cap exceeds $3 billion.</p><p>I won't get into the drugs, but it is clearly the leader in the gene therapy area. We believe that their clinical and pre-clinical programs, as well as their partnership, will lead to a very successful Company over the years. The current demand is still solid in Cambridge and new requirements are both early and later stage as well.</p><p>Remember, too, we founded Alexandria 21 years ago on the basis that we could successfully underwrite a complex industry, life science industry, because no one else up to that time had really been able to successfully do it on a national platform. And 21 years later I'd say we're doing a great job of it.</p><p>On our highly pre-leased development and redevelopment this provides very strong protection for future cash flows. Dean will highlight, the 1.5 million square feet at 89% leased to be delivered by the fourth quarter of 2016, page 35 of the supplement. And on page 36 of the supplement, the 1.8 million square feet of development and redevelopment to be delivered in 2017 and 2018.</p><p>We're building to budget with very solid yields and good margins to reasonable exit cap rates, as you can see. We're also very careful about any new starts and will look at each and every one of them very carefully.</p><p>Steve will answer any questions on the new disposition announced, the sale of the partial interest at 1500 Owens. So together with 225 Binney announced last quarter, we secured a very high-quality and sophisticated buyer and long-term partner.</p><p>Excellent price discovery, I think for net asset value and now two of our top sub-markets, San Francisco and Cambridge, and strong price per square foot. I think this demonstrates Alexandria's ability to create value through careful and prudent asset recycling and high-value and high-rental rate development.</p><p>On final comments, couple things. I'd say the recent Congressional budget deal, there will be about $1 billion to $2 billion additional for NIH per year in funding which is a good thing, and increasing the FDA budget which is also good.</p><p>There's been a lot of noise around pharma. I think it's fair to say today the five majors, J&amp;J, Roche, Novartis, Pfizer and Merck, all have met or exceeded their expectations and have broad-based new product pipelines which are very sustainable. They've got multiple multi-billion dollar products in the pipeline as well and I think the noise around pricing is clearly misguided.</p><p>Specialty pharma, all of Valiant and Turing where there's little R&amp;D and very aggressive approach to the market built on M&amp;A and other kinds of different approaches, I think is where the scrutiny should lie. Biotech continues to innovate, solving dreaded diseases and that's really front and center.</p><p>So let me finish before I turn it over to Dean, by a couple of comments about biotech in general. 734 IPOs have been launched over the past 36 years, raising about $35 billion. That investment, more or less, has roughly yielded $850 billion of current value for the sector. The window is clearly open but more selective on quality and valuation, as I said.</p><p>And I think something that's important, the sentiment, not fundamentals, have turned negative as the noise factor is high in a political environment. Sentiment, not fundamentals. Science and medical advances and innovation are accelerating. Cures will clearly save large amounts of money in the future. And there is only one sector that can really address that and that's the biopharma sector.</p><p>Bottom line is the biotech and pharma sector, biotech in particular, is well-financed. Regulators are supportive, innovation is present and valuations are lower, leading to an optimistic outlook. I'll turn it over to Dean.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA, CFO, ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.: Thanks, Joel. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everybody. I've got three important topics to cover today: First, growth in NOI and net asset value through highly-leased value creation projects. Second, prudent management of our balance sheet and our funding strategy. And third, key capital matters for the fourth quarter, including important comments on our self-registration filing this morning.</p><p>Jumping right in, growth in net operating income and net asset value through disciplined allocation of capital into highly-leased development and redevelopment projects really have highlighted nicely in our supplemental. And Joel referenced page 35 and 36; I encourage you to take a look at those two pages.</p><p>But for the fourth quarter of 2016, we're expecting to deliver about 1.5 million square feet by then. It's fairly back-end weighted. This is highly leased at about 89%. And we're going to deliver about $75 million to $80 million of annual incremental NOI upon stabilization of the square footage.</p><p>Additionally, on page 36 of our supplemental we've highlighted another 1.8 million square feet, again highly leased at 71% that is going to contribute another $105 million to $110 million of annual incremental NOI upon stabilization. These are projects scheduled for completion really in 2017 and 2018. All of this square footage, about 3.3 million square feet, is targeted with average cash yields just north of 7%.</p><p>In comparison, we recently announced the partial sale of two Class A properties with one located in Mission Bay and the other located in Cambridge at an average cap rate of 4.6%. Really highlighting the tremendous value we have generated through the ground-up development of these two properties. This also highlights the value creation in process on approximately 3.3 million highly-leased rentable square feet, again to be placed in service in 2016, 2017 and 2018.</p><p>Moving on to the prudent management of our balance sheet and our funding strategy. As we've highlighted, our balance sheet is solid with really well-laddered debt maturities and really limited maturities through 2018. Our debt maturities for 2016 were reduced subsequent to quarter end with the REIT payment of $76 million in October, leaving less than $235 million maturing in 2016.</p><p>Our balance sheet liquidity as of September 30 is over $1.2 billion on a pro forma basis to reflect the $350 million in commitments available under the construction loan for 50 and 60 Binney Street that we closed in October. Liquidity by the end of the year is expected to be approximately $1.8 billion, as we complete an unsecured bond offering very soon and several important sales of real estate.</p><p>We remain on track to meet our net debt to adjusted EBITDA goal of 6.9 times by year end. As you know, we focus on decisions that drive long-term versus short-term performance, including our leverage goals. We continue to execute on improvements in our credit metrics, including net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA in order to further enhance our balance sheet with flexibility.</p><p>In order to provide transparency in various metrics, our disclosures include short-term trends with quarter-annualized metrics and longer-term trends with trailing 12-month metrics. The longer-term metrics eliminate quarter-to-quarter volatility that may appear in the quarterly metrics. We believe our approach provides the investment community better visibility in the trends and various metrics that we disclose.</p><p>Moving on to our funding strategy. You may have noticed in recent years we have generated over $500 million to fund growth through development. The two drivers of this included roughly $125 million per year of cash flows from operating activities after dividends and approximately $400 million primarily from long-term fixed rate debt from the unsecured bond market through growth in EBITDA.</p><p>Growth in EBITDA allows us to fund a significant amount of construction without increasing leverage. We expect to continue to fund approximately $0.5 billion of construction in 2016 and 2017 from these two sources of capital.</p><p>Demand for high-quality core real estate remains strong and has allowed us to sell on average of approximately $200 million per year over the past five years. We expect demand for high-quality real estate to continue into 2016. And accordingly, we anticipate real estate sales to remain an important component of our capital plan for 2016.</p><p>Over the past five years, I think you've noted that our capital strategy execution has been proven to be very prudent on the management of common equity, including our projection for 2015. The proceeds of the issuance of common stock has represented really only approximately 20% to 25% of our total sources of capital. As a reminder, there's been no significant common equity issuance in the past two years.</p><p>Our capital plan on average for the last five years has utilized significantly less common equity than expected for leverage at 6.9 times, primarily due to the benefit of retained operating cash flows, significant EBITDA growth, and sales of real estate. In summary, we will continue funding our growth with the most cost-efficient long-term capital. Most importantly, we will execute these objectives while we also focus on generating growth and FFO per share and net asset value.</p><p>Turning to our capital plan for the remainder of 2015. Most importantly, sales of real estate we have about $600 million in proceeds forecasted for the fourth quarter with approximately $300 million, or 50%, of this under contract to close in the fourth quarter. The other $300 million, or 50%, is moving along quickly and is focused on the sale of a partial interest in a core property while we also continue to pursue the sale, or sales, of other core-like properties. As a policy, we do not comment or speculate on potential sales beyond the current disclosures.</p><p>Next, on our shelf registration statement. You may have noticed our shelf registration was filed this morning. This filing is required, is effective upon filing and simply eliminates one additional filing in order for the Company to issue unsecured bonds.</p><p>The investment grade bond market has shown improvement in recent weeks, as you probably are well aware of, and we do expect to issue bonds very soon. We remain focused on tenure of tenures, since it fits well into our debt maturities.</p><p>Additionally as mentioned last quarter, our ATM expired in early June and we do expect to file the new program. Just to be clear, we do not expect to use the ATM program this year, as we are on track to complete our projected real estate sales for 2015. Lastly, we completed one of the two construction loans anticipated this year and we are focused now on closing the second construction loan in the coming months.</p><p>Moving on briefly to guidance and some closing comments. The detailed assumptions underlying our updated guidance for 2015 are included on Page 3 and 4 of our supplemental package. We are in a great position today with a real estate strategy focused on unique campuses and AAA urban innovation cluster locations. We have one of the best teams in the REIT industry and a top brand that collectively drives demand from high-quality and innovative companies.</p><p>Internal growth is solid and is expected to remain solid in 2016. We generate high-quality cash flows with 53% of our ABR from investment-grade tenants. Our cash flows are stayable with 96% triple net leases. Our cash flows increase contractually with 95% of our leases containing annual rent escalations averaging up almost 3%.</p><p>Demand remains solid for our high-quality buildings and AAA locations, in very supply-constrained innovation sub-markets and is expected to continue to drive very solid cash and GAAP rental rate increases on leasing activity over the next year. We continue to focus on disciplined allocation of capital into our visible and highly-leased multi-year value creation pipeline.</p><p>We will continue to execute on prudent management of our balance sheet and funding of our growth with the most cost-efficient long-term capital. Most importantly, we will execute these objectives while we also focus on generating growth in FFO per share, net asset value and common stock dividends.</p><p>We believe we have the right assets and the right locations that will inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity and success for our highly innovative client tenants. Our team remains focused on continuing to build the best-in-class franchise. Thank you and I'll turn it back to Joel.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Operator, we're ready to go to Q&amp;A, please.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)</p><p>Our first question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Hi, guys, good afternoon.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Hi there.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Just thinking about marketable security sales as a potential source of equity, how are the changes in the biotech stock markets change the way you think about selling or holding on to your marketable securities there?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, I don't think they've had that much influence. As you know from this past quarter, we did have a number of sales and will continue that over the coming quarters. We still have significant built in gains so we're comfortable and I think the quality of the holdings that we have is high. We feel very good about the position we're in and we try not to be just pure market-timers.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Joel, you guys disclosed the amount of those gains. What was the underlying balance that you sold to get to those gain numbers?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Bear with us one second.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: I don't have the proceeds right in front of me, Manny. I think that's what you're getting to right?</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Yes, the actual sale amounts exactly.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: I don't have the actual proceeds. I think the investment dispositions this quarter probably netted out a slight positive in overall investing activity, meaning dispositions net of reinvestment. So maybe it was a small net cash receipt at the end of the day for the quarter.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Can we think about it in terms of multiples? So was the gain 2 times? Was it a 2 times gain? Was it flat to what you held? Can you give us some idea of just magnitude?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Well, to put it into perspective, Manny, what we are looking at is on the $104 million or $105 million of unrealized gains we have as the quarter end, I think we only have about a $30 million investment.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: My other question was so there's been some recent news on Biogen cutting its workforce. Has that impacted yours? Or do you think it will impact (technical difficulty) your in?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, I'll ask Tom to speak about it.</p><p>TOM ANDREWS, EVP, ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.: Yes, it was reported that Biogen might cut about 800 heads in Cambridge and Eastern Massachusetts. Recall they lease or own about a million square feet in Kendall Square. And they lease about 350,000 square feet in Weston on Route 128, which is 50% subleased to another company. But we see no evidence that's relatively small layoff, in terms of the total headcount and space occupancy, is going to impact Kendall Square at all.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: That may impact their future need for space here in the short to medium term. But certainly they're not abandoning space that they have. We own their headquarters building together with TIAA, so that we're in great shape with that building.</p><p>MANNY KORCHMAN: Thanks, guys.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p><p>JAMIE FELDMAN, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Thank you. So you had commented that when you chose Bluebird there were several biotech companies that you opted for Bluebird over. Can you talk about across your major markets, how many types of conversations like that you're having? Like when you have a space the multiples of tenants that are interested that space?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Oh, I think it's very common. Both Steve and Tom can give you color on that, but I think in virtually every case these days, there are multiple users for the same space. Obviously timing, rental rate, quality of tenant, and a whole lot of things factor into that.</p><p>STEVE RICHARDSON, COO, ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.: Jamie, hi, it's Steve. We do. We have more demand than we have supply certainly in the market. We're tracking 22 different tenants in excess of 100,000 square feet in San Francisco alone. And then at another 6 million square feet of demand in the Greater Stanford area. So we are being very selective and we do have a number of options that we choose from when we're selecting these tenants.</p><p>TOM ANDREWS: Yes, and it's Tom. As Joel mentioned, we do have multiple parties pursuing the space that we ended up selecting Bluebird for. We have multiple parties looking at the remaining space at 100 Binney where we're working to do some additional leasing on the remaining 180,000 or so square feet which delivers in late calendar 2017. It's not uncommon at all for us to have multiple prospects and we are managing carefully to try to optimize our tenancy there.</p><p>JAMIE FELDMAN: Okay. And so those three tenants, I assume that's who you're talking to for some of the other space?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, one of them, yes. They are all three public. One is an existing tenant -- well two were existing tenants and one is not. But yes, the answer is yes.</p><p>JAMIE FELDMAN: Okay. Then can you talk about -- I think in the supplemental there's still no total cost projection for 400 Dexter or 100 Binney. Can you talk about what the final costs on those and why it's not in here?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Jamie, what we try to do is as soon as we announce a new development to give as much information that's available at the time new projects commence. Occasionally 400 Dexter, as an example, is going through a few different iterations. But we do have a general sense of where we're going to fall out but until we feel comfortable that the disclosures will be final, we prefer to wait until some of the moving pieces are resolved. I can tell you that generally speaking -- give me one second -- generally speaking, I think, in Cambridge you're probably looking roughly high-level $900 a foot all-in at completion on 50 and 60 Binney as an example, as a baseline. There's some different attributes at 100 Binney.</p><p>As we round out our budget we'll disclose both the cost at completion and the returns. But I would say that you should keep in mind that returns are going to be very similar, directionally, with 50 and 60 Binney. Again, I gave you overall returns for all of these projects that are delivering in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and it's just north of 7%. So I hope that gives you some comfort that we're building solid projects and we'll provide these disclosures in the near term.</p><p>JAMIE FELDMAN: So you said $900 per square foot in Cambridge. What about in Seattle?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Let me not comment specifically, because it may not be applicable to that project right now. Suffice to say, Jamie, that our overall average yields on a cash basis are just north of 7%.</p><p>JAMIE FELDMAN: I'm saying cost per foot.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: I know. Well, if we were prepared to disclose that, Jamie, we would have put it in the sup. So let us refine the budget and when we're prepared to provide that disclosure, we will. But it falls right down the fairway from a yield perspective.</p><p>JAMIE FELDMAN: Got it, all right. Then thinking about next year. Do you think your same-store NOI will be higher or lower than what we've seen in 2015 based on what you have coming up?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Well Jamie I think the way we would like the community to think about same-property performance, I think over a long term of cash same-property performance has probably averaged about 5%. I think the way you build up to that number is -- keep in mind you've got triple rent leases which drive stable cash flows, but you've got annual escalations that are approaching 3% embedded in our leases. So your cash NOI will grow close to 3%. Your marketing to market, roughly and I'm going to use simple math for the next step. Roughly 10% of the portfolio will be in mark-to-market and we're marking that close to 10% right now. So you get 1% dropping down to NOI on top of the 3% of annual escalations.</p><p>And then you've got the opportunity to early renew and if you have leasing activity, the leasing activity's easily 2 times the expirations. So we are getting ahead and capturing some rental rate growth, call it somewhere between 1% to 3% dropping to NOI. 3% would be just a home run year, but if you pick up 1% to 2% now you've built up a 5% to 6% base cash same-property NOI performance. I don't want to get into guidance for 2016 which we'll do in December. But I think overall, core performance is going to be very solid for 2016.</p><p>JAMIE FELDMAN: Okay, thanks, that's helpful.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore.</p><p>SHEILA MCGRATH, ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI: Yes, good afternoon. Joel, I was wondering if you could help us understand for newer companies like Bluebird or Pinterest or Stripe, do you underwrite such that the development yields would be a little bit higher? Or higher rent for these newer tenants? Or do you charge the same as a strong pharma, credit pharma, tenant?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, I think that depends on the -- and I'll ask Tom and Steve to comment -- I think it depends a lot on the particular building, the particular rental rate in the situation, their particular program. Because every tenant and every lease is actually different. It isn't vanilla like there's three vanilla choices and they are all pretty similar. They are actually somewhat different in each respect. But I'll ask these guys to give you an on-the-ground comment.</p><p>TOM ANDREWS: Sheila, it's Tom. I think as Joel said, each of these transactions is different, so it's really hard. You really can't compare them as if they are vanilla deals. There's always a nuance to them.</p><p>Sometimes, for example, even a more credit-worthy company we may be able to get them to pay more because of the particular situation that they're in with respect to that particular deal. I wouldn't say that there's any -- that you could consistently assume that we get more money from a tenant who might be less credit-worthy than another tenant that might have been a candidate for the space. It really comes down to specifics of the negotiation and the transaction.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: And certainly security deposit is different but, Steve, you could --</p><p>STEVE RICHARDSON: Yes, just to add to that, Sheila, it is a very dynamic environment. The tenants are moving very quickly to lockdown space. So I think what's really important when you step back is really the tenant underwriting and how we go about valuing the companies and looking at their long-term tenancy and partnership in the building with them. So that's where we really focus our attention.</p><p>SHEILA MCGRATH: Okay, great, that's helpful. Joel, also you have a well-leased development pipeline for 2016, 2017, 2018. Should we assume that you're remaining patient on other land development opportunities because you have enough on the plate right now? Or are you in the market looking for additional development opportunities?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, I think in my prepared comments, Sheila, I mentioned that any new developments we would be looking at pretty carefully. We've got the 1.5 million square feet that Dean mentioned on Page 35 and the 1.8 million on Page 36. That's a pretty robust pipeline for 2016, 2017 and 2018.</p><p>I think there are opportunities that will come to us, whether they come through current campuses for example, in San Diego or other locations. And certainly in New York we're in discussions on the new building. But we're not -- I wouldn't say anything -- we're not looking at kicking off anything imminently at all. Anything we do, do, we would be mindful of the macro-market environment and then obviously, the demand in the market and then just our overall cash usage for that particular year. So it's kind of a complex equation there that we look at.</p><p>SHEILA MCGRATH: Okay, great thanks. One last quick one on construction costs. Any worry that construction costs or labor moving higher? Labor costs?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Certainly New York is a big worry. I think today we're very fortunate when we kicked off the West Tower back at the end of 2012 and early 2013, we hit a really great price point in the New York market. Today I don't think that would be true, so that's certainly an important factor. Again, Dan and Tom and Steve can comment on pricing. Up until now I think rental rate increases have out-stripped construction price increases, but it's something to pay attention to.</p><p>DAN RYAN, EVP, ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.: Yes, hi, Sheila, this is Dan. Yes, we're seeing some pressure on some construction materials, particularly glazing, that is being offset by savings in structural steel due to the Chinese drop off in usage. So on balance, we're cautious, we're trying to really primarily focus on some of these long lead items to be able to lock that in today. But we don't think that it's a super material impact. I don't know how you guys feel in your markets?</p><p>TOM ANDREWS: Yes, this is Tom. I'd say that we've got major projects under way for where we've done a vast majority of the buy-out in prior months. I think we are certainly very comfortable.</p><p>As Joel was saying, the rental rate increases that we experienced in the market certainly out-strip the construction price increases that we were seeing when we were buying out these jobs. But we do watch it very carefully, curtain wall, as Dan mentioned is a tough trade right now. There's so many projects going vertical in the Eastern cities with curtain wall, so it's tough. But we've got that well managed on our projects in Cambridge.</p><p>STEVE RICHARDSON: Hi, Sheila it's Steve. Finally, I think we're seeing pricing pressure from subcontractors. I think they are very busy in the Bay Area in particular with both the residential and life science and technology construction under the way. What we do, though, for each of these projects, especially as we get into 2017 and 2018 deliveries, is have a very clear annual escalation in construction pricing. So that is well baked into the pro formas and the anticipated yield. We don't think we'll be surprised beyond that we've already got already baked in.</p><p>SHEILA MCGRATH: Okay, great, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.</p><p>RICH ANDERSON, ANALYST, MIZUHO SECURITIES CO., LTD.: Thank you. Dean, you mentioned about some of the long-term average and same-store. I know you don't want to get into 2016 guidance, but do you think that the 8% to 10% re-leasing spread that you've been getting this -- or you're guiding to this year is a sustainable number for the next couple of years? Or do you see that trailing down based on where the re-leasing is going to be happening in future years?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: I think, Rich, what's important to keep in mind on leasing performance, at least going out for the next 12 months, is that we are dealing with some of the best buildings in the best locations in very, very supply-constrained markets. So we're in a good environment where the best, most innovative companies are looking to be in the best facilities in the best markets. I would think that leasing activity is going to remain very robust going out for the next 12 months. I would not be surprised to find guidance falling fairly close to our expectations for 2015.</p><p>RICH ANDERSON: The reason I ask is I'm looking at 2016 expirations and you have Research Triangle, Canada, Maryland whereas this year it was San Francisco, if I'm reading this right. So just wondering if the geographical footprint will play a role.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Well it's a little bit of that, but you also have to keep in mind that the leasing activity in a given year also benefits from renewals that you can't identify from the supplemental, which is I believe page 24 which shows our expirations by category. That's also an important driver, so getting ahead of some expirations that are beyond 2016 will also contribute. I would say, big picture, the market drivers are fairly obvious that the two top markets are big drivers of leasing activity. But I think the top five all contribute very nicely to 2016.</p><p>RICH ANDERSON: Fair enough. You mentioned and I understood the road map to funding development. And you got it covered, so to speak, to $500 million. But are there any situations that you see where the funding of development would meaningfully exceed $500 million in any of the next couple of years?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Well that's kind of been true this year and it's been true last year and possibly the year before. So I think it's safe to say that it will. And we do have a fairly robust pipeline, so yes, Rich, it will exceed that.</p><p>RICH ANDERSON: Okay. I'm looking at the guidance and it's in the $500 million, $600 million range for development spending this year?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Yes, and it's important to keep in mind the strategy that we've used over the last, call it, five years. And our approach going forward is very consistent with that. We want to minimize the consumption of common equity to the extent possible and focus on asset sales in an environment when private-market valuations are attractive capital.</p><p>RICH ANDERSON: Okay, thanks. Do you guys -- if you had a choice between the two and you had to make a choice, would it be FFO growth or NAV growth as a guiding strategy?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: I would say first NAV, but we can't ignore the investors that do focus on FFO. I think they're, bottom line, both important but we're not wed to one or the other in particular. We're looking for long-term decisions for the long term that will drive both of those metrics but more importantly hopefully total return performance.</p><p>RICH ANDERSON: Okay and then last question, maybe for Joel. Do you have any comment about the BioMed deal?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: I think it's a very good positive for them. The truth be known, analysts like you guys followed both of us. But in most of the sub-markets that we're in, we actually virtually don't compete with them outside of some assets in Cambridge.</p><p>Seattle very little competition. In San Francisco, very little competition. San Diego, even though they're based there, hasn't been a lot of competition. And New York, not the same thing. So as a macro Company, yes but on a sub-market basis. But I think it's a positive for them.</p><p>RICH ANDERSON: And do you think it could result in some activity coming your way vis-a-vis Blackstone? Or is it too early to say?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: You mean assets that we might be interested?</p><p>RICH ANDERSON: Yes.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, I could say publicly we have no interest in any of their assets.</p><p>RICH ANDERSON: (Laughter). Thank you very much.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: You're welcome.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group.</p><p>JIM SULLIVAN, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Okay, thanks, good afternoon. A similar question to one Rich asked, but maybe asked a little bit differently. Joel, if we have entered a period of significantly weaker capital formation are there any geographic markets in which Alexandria has a presence which are likely to be more affected than others?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, that's a tough question to answer because, number one, we're, as you know, very highly leased both in our operating portfolio and in the development and redevelopment side. Each market's different.</p><p>Seattle tends to be tech and institutional; San Francisco tends to be biotech, pharma and tech; San Diego tends to be more biotech and pharma. Maryland has been a broad base of different types of companies, a lot of service companies and things. Research Triangle is turning out to be ag-tech mecca. New York, we just landed Nestle, their skin care group and Lilly up for another building, but it seems broad-based in the life science area. And Cambridge is heavily biotech, pharma and tech.</p><p>So each market really has its own dynamics, but at the moment we haven't seen any dramatic change in any specific market that I could give you. I tried to characterize what we're seeing on the ground. There are some tenants that, because of lack of availability, are sometimes giving up expansion or just looking maybe at different locations. But at the moment I'm not sure I could give you anything specific.</p><p>JIM SULLIVAN: And it would sound like, and I don't mean to put words in your mouth, but what's happened over the last 90 days does not appear to really have had an impact in terms of your disposition strategy.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: No not at all. But I do think that people are paying attention to the capital markets. Obviously, pharma doesn't need to because they don't finance through the capital markets. Big tech also doesn't so much finance through the big capital markets.</p><p>But obviously the private guys on the private side in tech and obviously the biotech market are focused on the capital markets. So people are paying attention to the shift that's happened over the past couple months. There's no question about just boardroom talk.</p><p>JIM SULLIVAN: Okay and then final one for me. Alexandria has been a selective investor in private funding rounds for various companies at early stages, and you've been through a few cycles. Can you characterize the slowdown in activity over the last 90 days? Has it stopped or slowed materially? If you have a guesstimate on where it's going to go in the next 12 months.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Okay, so that's an interesting question. And the answer is it has not slowed down appreciably at all. We tend to like big idea companies, big platforms, multiple shots on goal with products, great management teams, great syndicates. I would say we have not seen any slow-down in the pace of new opportunities that have been presented to us at all, believe it or not. What is slowing down is the exit of the pipeline, not ours, but the biotech pipeline.</p><p>Having gotten through the really high-quality companies, there are some companies that haven't been able to get out. But there's also a new crop of pretty high-quality companies that I think you'll probably see file, either have done silent filings or will be filing ahead of JPMorgan Healthcare. So I think you'll see a pick-up in that. But we've not seen a slow-down on the private investment on the biotech side at all.</p><p>JIM SULLIVAN: Okay that's great, thank you.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Kevin Tyler with Green Street Advisors.</p><p>KEVIN TYLER, ANALYST, GREEN STREET ADVISORS: Yes, hi. High level one for you, Joel, tying back to your opening comments. You talked about a sentiment shift and not really a fundamental shift towards the biotech sector. But how does the fundamental shift, if there is one, affect the MITs, NYUs, Data Farmers, the more academic government-based tenants that are in your stable?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Well, I think the budget deal that appears worked out between the Republicans and the Democrats, and it looks like the both Houses will be on board and ultimately the President is on board, I believe. I think will be a net positive for the institutional side of things a bit, providing incrementally about $1 billion to $2 billion more annually to the NIH.</p><p>I think Tom can comment on the ground. But I think one thing that surprised us and I think we've said on our past calls, is the slow-down in institutional activity like in Longwood. Whereas Cambridge has been on fire and a lot of Cambridge tenants won't go to Longwood. It's kind of surprised us there hasn't been more activity.</p><p>TOM ANDREWS: Yes, just to echo what Joel said. We expected more growth and more demand out of the Harvard-affiliated Longwood institutions. We're at about 63% leased, I think, on that asset. We've got some groups kicking around but not really moving very swiftly on the remaining 150,000 feet or so that we have to lease there.</p><p>We're hopeful that this potential budget deal that Congress is talking about could result in some additional NIH funding and instigate some additional activity. The other area where funding comes to these institutions commonly is through philanthropy. And there are some potential demand drivers from some foundation groups that are looking to invest over there. But we haven't seen any real estate activity out of that yet.</p><p>KEVIN TYLER: Okay, thanks. And then your guidance, Dean, suggested you're not really planning much more in the way of acquisitions for the current year. I was wondering if that's based more on a change in cost of capital? A vote more on development at the current time? Or perhaps just more color or insight into the state of deal pricing currently in the market.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Let me just comment. I think if you go back to our total acquisitions for the year, at the beginning of the year we probably couldn't have told you that this was the array of acquisitions we would be pursuing. The MIT acquisitions, as we mentioned, came up really quite by circumstance.</p><p>The deal that Dan executed with Qualcomm and retenanting that building with Lilly, again, came to market kind of serendipitously. It presented a great opportunity to expand our campus. But months before that, we didn't have any idea of planning for it. So I think our primary external growth platform has been focused on development. So we haven't really been focused on some benchmark for acquisitions. I think that's probably true of, without getting into guidance for 2016, I think that's probably true of 2016 as well.</p><p>KEVIN TYLER: Okay, that's helpful color. The last one I had, can you give us any insight into the inquiry that you may have received from other institutions interested your properties? Hence eventually your sales or dispositions. But has it increased at all since the BioMed news has surfaced?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Well, I'm not sure we get -- we did a pretty methodical set of meetings back about a year and a half ago when originally looking potentially for a JV partner on some developments which morphed into a different kind of an approach. I would say I personally did like 15 or 16 101s. I think virtually every single group we met with, all brand names, expressed high levels of interest for the quality of the location, quality of asset, quality of management and quality of tenancy.</p><p>I think even today, we still do have a number of people that do approach us about getting involved in, whether it's an asset sale or potentially partnering on development. So that's kind of ongoing. I don't know that the Blackstone deal either increased or somehow hastened it. I think its been pretty consistent over the last two years since we've been moving in that direction.</p><p>KEVIN TYLER: Okay, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Baird.</p><p>DAVE RODGERS, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; COMPANY, INC.: Good afternoon. Maybe for Tom or Steve, wanted to follow-up on an earlier question. Particularly regarding any pushback you're seeing in Cambridge or San Francisco on rent levels. I'm thinking particularly from biotech or pharma companies that are just getting priced out from some of the more tech office, heavy, dense users of space. Are you seeing that in the market? Or is there just that many more tenants on the tech side taking space than there are on the lab side today?</p><p>STEVE RICHARDSON: Yes, hi, Dave, it's Steve. No, not necessarily. We are actually seeing the converse. The tenants really want to be in these locations. It's an essential must-have business imperative for the life science tenants in Mission Bay to be surrounding UCSF, for the technology tenants, be in this Mission Bay SoMa cluster. So to the extent rents have risen to the price level they are at they are sustainable, they're acceptable. And we've seen just the opposite, that the tenants are really prioritizing location over some potential price sensitivity right now at this level.</p><p>TOM ANDREWS: Yes David, in Cambridge, as you know, much more of the demand that we've seen there has been on the life science side. But its been both lab and office space, much more of the recent growth both lab and office space. There certainly are some younger companies who are getting queasy at the rental rates and are looking elsewhere. But as I said, we've got multiple parties looking at the remaining space that we have.</p><p>We have multiple parties looking at that 60 Binney when we transacted the Bluebird deal. We have multiple parties looking at 100 Binney. So we're not seeing a great -- we're not seeing people withdraw from the location because of pricing.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, it's also in those locations, it's a fundamental question of recruitment and retention, too, that really underlies that and that's almost like a cost of doing business as opposed to just a rent number.</p><p>DAVE RODGERS: Fair enough, thank you. And maybe with regard to Joel, or if Dan is on the phone too, the redevelopment pipeline I think is about 525,000 square feet, plus or minus. Looks like some of that is going to go from lab to more tech office. Can you talk about the returns on that? And then the second part of that is do you see more assets moving into the redevelopment bucket over the next year or so?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: So I'll have Dean comment for the moment.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: So I guess the redevelopment -- the bulk of the -- the biggest project you have disclosed are there, the other two aren't quite as large. But you have $240 million roughly of completion on Campus Point which is probably the largest project there.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: That's going from an office to a lab.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: And so all of these are in pretty good shape. We're working on lease-up of 11 Hurley and 9625. Just a bit -- I'm sorry, 11 Hurley is under negotiation, 9625 we're working on. It's just premature to talk about the status of those negotiations, but we do have ongoing negotiations. Again, I think your overall returns are going to follow on average here, 7%-plus on the initial cash yields.</p><p>As far as the future pipeline, we do have a little bit that's disclosed in the supplemental and the expiration schedules that's potential, but it's pretty small. I don't see anything in the portfolio today that represents a redevelopment over the next, call it, year or two.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, so again just to be clear, the Campus Point acquisition is going from office to lab. Hurley is going from whatever it was before to a lab. Looks like we have a deal for that whole building. And then 9625 we're not certain, it could go lab or it could go office but that remains to be seen.</p><p>DAVE RODGERS: Great, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have a follow-up question from Manny Korchman with Citi.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: It's Michael Bilerman with Manny. Joel, I take it when the proxy comes out for BioMed, we will not see a REIT then in any of the disclosure, given your comments?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: We won't see a what?</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: A REIT. We won't see a Company Alexandria mentioned in there?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: I don't think so (laughter).</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: Dean, and I'm sure you probably have this at your fingertips, thinking about deb to EBITDA as you're going to embark on this fixed-income unsecured issuance, I'm sure the fixed-income investors are going to look at your Q3 numbers on an annualized basis. They'll back out the securities gains; they'll back out the FAS income and they'll get to 7.9 times debt to EBITDA and they're going to ask you if you have a target --</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: I'm not so sure about that.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: Well, they may. Because they tend to be -- in fact they tend to be --</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: That's fuzzy math, Mike.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: Well it's not fuzzy math, they are going to -- see they're not going to annualize securities gains, right?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: I think what they are going to look at what our target is at year end and is it achievable?</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: Correct. And that's where I was going, right? Because maybe you can -- and getting there, you got $600 million of sales, $300 million that are done, $300 million that are in the works. You also have $200 million of construction spend offset by $30 million of free cash flow.</p><p>You get to seven times, but that doesn't take into account the lost EBITDA. The debt balance at the end of the year is going to be lower because you have $600 million of sales. But you'll still be earning income on most of the assets so there will be a slight tick back up.</p><p>So maybe you can just bucket getting into 2016 getting down to that 6.5 target. The EBITDA from all of the development and redevelopment, how much is coming online next year versus the incremental capital spend that you will have in furthering the development pipeline for the 2017 and 2018 starts. And then how much -- what is the plug effectively, if any, in terms of sales to get you to the right 6.5?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Yes, so Michael, just to clarify. Part of my comments during the prepared section of the call was to really focus on less quarter-to-quarter variations and metrics which we all know tend to be volatile versus more long-term metrics. And we are going to hit 6.9 by the end of this year and once we get beyond 2015, we will start to migrate closer to 6.5. There's no expectation for us to hit it in 2016, just to be clear. But we will make the move towards that over the couple years following 2015.</p><p>There's a lot of moving parts, as you highlighted, in our business because we have a tremendous pipeline of development opportunities that are highly leased. But we have a very disciplined approach in funding that, as I outlined in our prepared comments. And so we'll provide as much color, I think, that makes sense at Investor Day to help investors navigate or at least follow our path on leverage. But beyond leverage, our overall goals that we want to accomplish in 2016. I don't think anybody will find it a mystery for us to maintain leverage sub-7 as we go into 2016 and then continue that downward on average over the next two years.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: And how much NOI do you have lost in the fourth quarter from the $600 million of sales? So if that $600 million is, call it, about a 4.6% cap, so about $28 million of annualized NOI, how much are you suffering from a dilution standpoint in the fourth quarter in your guidance?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Well, Michael, why don't we wrap up the fourth quarter because we do have $600 million of dispositions. Half is under contract, the other half is not yet, so the timing of those transactions are still pending.</p><p>But you're right. There will be EBITDA loss through the dispositions. But you're talking about very low cap rate transactions on average, which is attractive capital that's funding our business. And because it's a low cap rate, overall average disposition for the fourth quarter, it is attractive from a replacement to common equity.</p><p>I think we're making, as you probably can appreciate -- the math works out from the ability for us to replace the need for common equity in a manner that is cheaper. Had we had the need to raise the equivalent of whatever the equity proceeds of that $600 million was, Michael, in common equity, it probably would have resulted in even more dilution because it would have had a higher cost of capital applied to that.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: Agreed. Lastly, on the security sales. If I go back to last quarter, at least a lot of the conversation was of this $225 million of projected remaining asset sales. At least I was led to believe that a majority of that would have been the public securities that were sitting on your books.</p><p>It sounds like the sales in the third quarter perhaps were only about $30 million if it had the same book-to-gain ratio and doesn't appear as though there's anything set for the fourth quarter. So had there been a change in the way that you're looking at liquidating the securities book at all?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: No, not at all Michael. I think my commentary over the last two quarters, at least the last quarter if not the prior to that, had indicated that it would probably take time for us to monetize the gains, partly because some of its locked up for a period of time. So there wasn't any expectation of an immediate monetization of it.</p><p>I think you'll see us continue to monetize some of those gains as we look out over the next 12 to 24 months. But we feel really comfortable with -- these are a very short list of companies that generate the $100 million-plus of unrealized gains, and they are solid companies. So we're not concerned about the gains vaporizing overnight, but we do plan to monetize some of them.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: I guess you'll put that back in the sup next quarter in terms of the sales proceeds so that we can track it a little bit? That would be helpful.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Yes, we can definitely help you guys with that disclosure, but it's --</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: It will be in the quarter, at least for the supplemental it would be good to have.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Its been relatively small, so we haven't really highlighted it much, Michael, but we can think about that.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: Okay, thanks.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: It appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Okay, thank you very much. We're five minutes over, but we appreciate [that] and we'll look forward to talking to everybody on the fourth-quarter and year-end call. Thanks, everybody.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes today's call.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.</p><p>Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.

Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST INCORPORATED: Thank you, April. Thank you for joining us today and welcome to our third-quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments. John Eudy and Erik Alexander are here in attendance for Q&amp;A.</p><p>This past quarter John Burkart assumed leadership of our Asset Management and Operations functions and, thus, he will provide commentary for those activities today and in the future. Also, as you know, Angela became CFO on October 1 upon Mike Dance's retirement. Please join me in welcoming both of them to their new roles on the quarterly call.</p><p>I'll cover the following topics on the call. First, Q3 results and activities. Second, an update on rent control discussions. Third, review of investment markets and, fourth, comments on our 2016 preliminary market forecast. On to the first topic.</p><p>Yesterday, we were pleased to report another impressive quarter driven by strong West Coast economies. As expected, demand from robust job growth led to continued high occupancy for apartments and significant increases in for-sale home prices. Thus our reported results for same-property revenue, NOI, and core FFO per share growth exceeded our expectations and led the multi-family industry. As to the quarterly results, I would like to recognize the Essex team for their tremendous effort and for exceeding expectations once again.</p><p>With a few exceptions, rents at B quality property and locations are growing faster than As, exemplified in the Oakland Metro with 12.7% same property revenue growth, the highest in our portfolio. Despite the fact that the Oakland Metro generated only 2.2% year-over-year job growth for the nine months ended September, that significantly lagged San Francisco and San Jose at 4.6% and 5.5% respectively. This occurred because affordability and commute time are two critical considerations for most apartment seekers. With traffic congestion growing, the accessibility to major employment centers has become incredibly challenging and more people are doubling up, living with relatives, or moving to less expensive areas. Thus, we believe that B locations closest to jobs and public transit will continue to perform best in 2016.</p><p>In recent investor meetings we have heard concerns about tech hiring and changing housing preferences favoring homeownership. As to tech hiring, we closely follow tech job growth, especially in the current environment given broader economic issues such as the strength of the US dollar, weak commodity prices, weak global growth and the divergence and performance of key sectors of the economy. The Essex portfolio will normally experience softness in traffic and pricing a month or two before slowdown in hiring is picked up by the data vendors. This is complicated to some extent by the normal seasonal slowdown that is typical in the apartment business this time of year. At this point, we have not experienced a slowdown beyond normal seasonal patterns and reported job growth has been excellent. Perhaps the best way to demonstrate the current condition is the 2% improvement in loss to lead at the end of Q3 from 5% at the end of September 2014 to 7% at September 30, 2015.</p><p>As to the home ownership rate, we continue to focus on the relationship between the number of new homes, both rental and for sale, that are being delivered compared to household formations estimated from employment growth. We have heard some economists use national data when discussing this relationship, which we believe is often misleading. Apartments are a local business and therefore, our valuation of supply and demand is regionally focused. For a variety of reasons, including the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and related law, we continue to expect very muted production of for-sale housing in the coastal metros of California as cities implement an urban village housing concept accessed by a robust public transit system. This new concept is likely to take years to implement and will favor apartments and condos. Therefore, we believe it is the unlikely that there will be a significant increase in for-sale housing production that is necessary to materially increase the home ownership rate in Coastal California.</p><p>On a second topic, rent control. I commented last quarter that proposals for local rent control ordinances are being discussed in several West Coast cities, particularly in California. Cities are generally protective of their rental stock and voters that live in apartments, and there is a growing concern that high-income tech workers will displace other residents that have not received large increases in compensation. I have commented on previous calls about Richmond, California, which is the first city to approve in preliminary form a draft of rent control ordinance. Opposition lead by the California Apartment Association has been able to force the Richmond rent control proposal to the voters in 2016.</p><p>For context, California State law supersedes city ordinances. Fortunately for landlords, state law mandates vacancy decontrol and prohibits rent control on apartments completed after 1995. We have also seen some cities and community organizations focused on the long-term impact of inadequate housing supply, particularly at lower income levels, and acknowledge that rent control has unintended negative consequences and ignores the real issue, that is the shortage of housing production.</p><p>Our view is that there is no near-term solution to the housing shortages, especially in Northern California, because cities are generally not supportive of pro growth strategies. Entitlements for new housing continue to be challenging and costly to obtain, and construction costs have spiked around 10% in each of the past two years. Therefore, we don't expect the rent control discussion to end any time soon. We encourage landlords to self-regulate by considering these factors as part of their lease renewal strategies.</p><p>Third topic, investments. As commented previously, we've become more selective as to our external growth activities, although we continue to be very active in our search for both acquisition and development deals. As noted previously, construction cost increases are pressuring developing yields and some development deals are likely to solve. The flip side of a more selective acquisition market is a better market for property sales. You should expect to see the level of dispositions increase modestly in 2016.</p><p>Cap rates remained low throughout our markets. Using the cap rate methodology of the most active buyers, our best estimate is that the highest quality property and locations trade around 4% cap while B quality property and locations trade around a 4.5% cap rate. Lesser quality properties trade at higher cap rates than periodically and aggressively under written or trophy property will trade in the high 3% cap rate range. Some buyers make more aggressive assumptions that can add 25 to 50 basis points to the cap rate, compared again to the yields underwritten by more active buyers.</p><p>On to the fourth topic, which is our market outlook for 2016. Page S16 of the supplement provides an overview of the key housing supply, demand, and economic assumptions supporting our market rent growth expectations for 2016. As before, we assume each of our West Coast metros, except Ventura, will outperform the national average job growth assumed to be 2%. While we are not projecting the continuation of the exceptional job growth that we have enjoyed in 2015, we have no specific reason that hiring is going to moderate other than the concerns about the global economy noted previously. Note that we do not need extraordinary job growth to generate favorable supply/demand relationship and great results. Should job growth continue at the pace experienced in 2015, we are likely to exceed the forecasted results for market rents shown on our market outlook.</p><p>Finally, the 2016 same-property revenue growth expectations for the Essex portfolio are likely to exceed the forecasted 6% economic rent growth on S16 due to our healthy loss to lease and other factors, all of which will be discussed as part of our 2016 guidance on the next call. This concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call today. I'll turn the call over to John Burkart.</p><p>JOHN BURKART, SENIOR EVP, ASSET MANAGEMENT, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST INCORPORATED: Thank you, Mike. I really appreciate the hard work the Operations and Asset Management teams this last quarter, executing our plan which has enabled our great results. Third quarter was robust and we continue to have a positive outlook for all our markets. Higher than expected job growth continues to be the primary catalyst for increasing rents and high occupancies throughout the portfolio. The strong demand pushed economic rents higher, leading to our fourth consecutive quarter of 10% increases in same-store property NOI growth.</p><p>Gains from renewal activity increased 6.6% portfolio wide in the quarter, and our turnover was down across the portfolio from 63% in 2014 to 60% this quarter. As of yesterday, the same property portfolio in all regions had occupancy at or above 96% with a 30-day availability of just over 4.7%. All of our markets are benefiting from the combination of strong job and income growth and insufficient supply to keep up with the demand. According to Axiometrics, market rent growth was stronger in September 2015 year-over-year than last year at this time in each of our regions, Seattle, Bay Area, and Southern California. So while we're not giving guidance for next year, we conclude from this that our markets are as strong or stronger than last year at this time, which bodes well for next year.</p><p>Ramping up our redevelopment pipeline has been a major focus for 2015, including the restart of the program for the legacy BRE properties. Our renovations team completed over 1,000 apartment home renovations during the third quarter, an increase of 50% compared to the third quarter of 2014. A little over 30% of the unit renovations are currently focused on the legacy BRE portfolio, which negatively impacted occupancy during the quarter.</p><p>We continue to make progress on our merger integration Phase II and Phase III as outlined in the June NAREIT presentation available on our website. The Resource Management efforts, renovation, and refinement of the Revenue Management Unit amenity pricing are ongoing efforts that will continue for the foreseeable future. We're making good progress on Phase III which is focused on improving our customer experience, growing our employees, and increasing our efficiency, the results of which will be realized after 2016. Now, I will share some highlights for each region, beginning with Southern California.</p><p>Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Diego continue to be strong performers this quarter driven by job growth of 2.3%, 3.3%, and 3.2% respectively, all exceeding our initial expectations and US averages. Personal income growth continues to grow well above the national average in all three metros. Northern California continues to perform above expectations due to exceptional job growth in San Francisco and San Jose which was reported for September at 4.6% and 5.5% respectively. The robust personal income growth in the Bay Area forecasted to be 4.6% in San Francisco and 6.5% in San Jose is enabling the strong market rent growth with a limited impact on affordability.</p><p>Oakland continues to perform well due to its strong income and job growth, as well as its proximity to both San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Uber purchased Uptown Station in downtown Oakland and was expected to accommodate 2,500 to 3,000 employees beginning in 2017. Several other tech companies are following Uber's path having announced that they are moving or expanding to Oakland to take advantage of the lower cost office space and shorter commutes for their employees, a trend that we expect to continue over the next several years.</p><p>The exceptional demand in the Bay Area is evident by the strength of our lease ups. One South Market in downtown San Jose has averaged over 40 leases per month, Epic has averaged about 39 leases per month, and MB360 Phase II in San Francisco, which is close to being rebuilt following the tragic fire in March 2014, is already 26% pre-leased with the first move-in scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year upon completion.</p><p>Finally, in Seattle, the employment growth in this region continues to be strong at 3.3%, and personal incomes are expected to grow 5.7% for 2015, maintaining rental market affordability. CBD Seattle continued to perform with revenue growth about 4% quarter-over-quarter while the other markets, Eastside, Snohomish, and South King grew at approximately 8% quarter-over-quarter; 25% of the 6 million square feet of office development in the region is being delivered into downtown Bellevue with the first tower expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. Sales force has announced that it signed a lease for 75,000 square feet in Bellevue and it plans to double its current workforce in the area.</p><p>We expect housing supply to decline slightly in 2016 as rising construction costs begin to limit apartment development. We are very pleased with our results year-to-date and I think our momentum should position us well into 2016. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.</p><p>ANGELA KLEIMAN, CFO, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST INCORPORATED: Thank you, John. Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results, the revised outlook for the year, and provide an update on our balance sheet. For the third quarter, we exceeded the mid point of our core FFO guidance by $0.06 per share. $0.03 of the outperformance resulted from higher revenue primarily driven by the strong job growth in our markets which accelerated the rate of lease-up absorption at higher than projected rents. $0.02 of the outperformance resulted from lower expenses within our consolidated properties, although part of the favorable expense variance is timing related; therefore, we expect our year-over-year same property operating expense growth to be between 3% to 4% for the combined portfolio in the fourth quarter. Following two previous revenue guidance increases totaling 115 basis points at the midpoint, we are reaffirming our same-store revenue growth forecast and are pleased to report that we are currently tracking slightly above the midpoint of that range.</p><p>Now, turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our net debt to EBITDA has now declined to 6.1 times, which is one-quarter ahead of our target due to stronger-than-anticipated growth in EBITDA. Based on our market rent growth outlook, we expect this metric to decline to the high 5s in 2016. In addition, we are currently evaluating our options to refinance $140 million of Fannie Mae credit-enhanced bonds in the fourth quarter. In doing so, we anticipate potential savings of $1.4 million annually over the seven-year term and we would incur approximately $6 million in write-offs of which $4.25 million is non-cash. These costs would be excluded from core FFO, but included in total FFO, and are shown as non-core adjustments on S14 in the supplemental.</p><p>As for our plans for the $350 million debt maturity in 2016, we have good flexibility with access to multiple options. For example, our $1 billion revolver has virtually no outstanding, and if we leave this debt floating, our variable rate debt exposure will only increase to approximately 10% on a low leverage balance sheet. Although this is not our preference, if we were making this decision today, we favor refinancing most of the maturing debt with a 5- to 7-year term loan and/or a 10-year unsecured public bond execution depending on the interest rate curve and the related threat.</p><p>Lastly, we have classified one property as held for sale, our corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, which we expect to sell in the fourth quarter. We will be moving to a newly leased space in San Mateo. We're presenting the final steps in the office relocation plans which will consolidate the BRE corporate office in San Francisco with the Essex corporate office in Palo Alto.</p><p>I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll now take your questions.</p><p>(Operator Instructions)</p><p>Nick Joseph of Citi.</p><p>NICK JOSEPH, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Thanks. Wondering if you can frame the 7% loss to lease in historical context? You mentioned last year it was 5%, but is this the largest loss to lease you've seen at the end of September?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Nick, hi. It's Mike Schall.</p><p>I don't have that statistic going back each year historically for a long time, but I know that as of July, that typically is the high point of loss to lease as you go through the year and the low point is in December. So July 2014 was 8%, July 2015 was 8%. The low point was December, so December 2013 was around 4%, and -- or I'm sorry, December 2014 was about 4% and 2013 was about 4%, so it gives you some idea.</p><p>Those are obviously during very strong periods of time. I've seen loss to lease at zero at the end of December and at 5% to 6%, I would guess, is probably the more normal high for loss to lease in a typical year. Again, these are from my view extraordinary years, and that metric I think at 8% in July is near the strongest that we've seen it historically in my 30 -- almost 30-year career.</p><p>NICK JOSEPH: Thanks. And just staying with that, the 6% economic rent growth outlook for next year is actually higher than the 5.6% you had predicted at the same time last year. So what gives you the confidence to make that prediction today?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Well, a couple things. If you go back to our original guidance that you noted for 2015, it was based on 2.5% job growth and we are tracking using September year-to-date numbers at 3.3%, so we pretty dramatically outperformed that number. And so we're carrying momentum into this next year, and our view is you add limited amounts of supply -- in other words as the supply/demand relationship is moving in your favor you will build pricing power, so there's a little bit of an incremental pricing power just from the supply/demand situation and the consequent impacts on market occupancy levels in the place where people want to live most.</p><p>NICK JOSEPH: Thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next we'll hear from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc.</p><p>AUSTIN WURSCHMIDT, ANALYST, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS: Hi. It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. You commented that conditions were as strong as they were last year. Is it conceivable to think that you'd be able to push rents at a pace that was higher than what you achieved this year?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Again, this is Michael Schall.</p><p>I would just go back to the job question, and if we exceed the 2.5% job growth that is the basis for our 6% market rent growth then I'd say yes, again we will exceed it once again. We are concerned about affordability. We are concerned about all of the issues with the global economy that were noted before. Although, one compelling factor is the personal income growth that we're seeing, especially in the tech markets, which is in the 5% to 6% range.</p><p>So if you're getting 5% to 6% personal income growth and rents are, let's say, growing at 8% or 9%, it doesn't have that big of impact on affordability. And, again, not everyone is going to get the big increase in income. The personal income growth is driven largely by people, the new tech worker coming in making a lot of money and displacing someone that is not getting a big increase in their compensation, who is then forced to move to a place that's farther away from the employment center. So, this transition is ongoing through the renter pool, but if we bring in high income tech workers in greater numbers than we have projected on S16 then, yes, we would expect rent growth to be higher.</p><p>AUSTIN WURSCHMIDT: Thanks for the detail there. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks also about a decline in housing supply in 2016. I was wondering if you could expand on that a bit and give a little bit of detail by market?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: I don't think that we actually have much of a decline in supply, so I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to. I think that it's very nominal. Who has those numbers? Let's see, 2015 versus 2016. I think the supply decrease is somewhere around like 0.1%. So overall -- so we are not expecting supply to decrease. But, again, we don't have complete certainty.</p><p>We have some factors that would lead us to believe that supply could decrease, i.e., construction costs going up at 10% in each of the last two years, and John Eudy is here and he's looking for development deals every day and he's having trouble with the underwriting, because costs have moved so quickly and pro formas sometimes don't reflect the most current cost structure. So when John and I talk about new deals, we're finding it more difficult for us to underwrite and if we're having trouble underwriting them, I can pretty much assure you others are having trouble as well. John do I have that right?</p><p>JOHN EUDY, EVP DEVELOPMENT, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST INCORPORATED: Yes. Right on. With these actions we are seeing, cities are getting tougher in their requirements. Nothing is going in the favor of over supplying the market.</p><p>AUSTIN WURSCHMIDT: Thanks. And then just on your comments there about the aggressive bidding going on for new deals. You mentioned being a net seller next year by a little bit amount. Are there any markets that you're looking to lighten up in, and how should we think about the assets that you're typing to sell? Are these are more BRE assets, or are they legacy Essex assets?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Yes, just to be clear, I don't think that we'll be a net seller next year, but I don't have complete clarity on that. I think what I said was we will likely sell more next year than we sold this year and so to be clear, the way we look at this is there are two sides of this coin. One is what's going on, on the capital side. In other words, what's the relationship between where REIT stocks are valued and the private real estate markets?</p><p>Is there a disparity there between the two? And if REIT stocks are trading at an evaluation above where private real estate markets are, then we want to be buying real estate. And the flip we want to be selling real estate and our is view is that we're currently somewhere around parity, which means we cull the portfolio. So that's the capital side.</p><p>On the real estate side we have very few assets that we put into the two bottom categories, the two categories we're most motivated to sell, which are substandard operating properties and marginal properties that's trading like good properties for whatever reason that people are forced to take substandard properties. But we don't believe when the economy changes that they will be the beneficiary.</p><p>So, those are the culling assets. And then the other categories of property that we are more interested in selling again if this relationship between REIT stock values and private real estate values is appropriate would be the properties that have some other -- maybe some minor physical or operational impairments and/or the properties that we consider to be market performers. But about half our portfolio just by way of background we consider to be within the in irreplaceable category, which we're unlikely to sell almost at any price. So we have a ranking process that ranks the properties in terms of our desirability of sale, again, within the constraints of how we look at the capital side, and that's how we run our disposition function.</p><p>AUSTIN WURSCHMIDT: Thank you for the clarification and the details.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next we'll hear from Dan Oppenheim of Zelman &amp; Associates.</p><p>DAN OPPENHEIM, ANALYST, ZELMAN &amp; ASSOCIATES: Thanks very much. Was wondering related to the dispositions, would you have more of an emphasis on the pre-1995 community, where there would be subject to rent control if they were to be passed in those municipalities?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Hi, Dan. It's Mike Schall again.</p><p>It comes up as a consideration, but I don't think it's one of the key considerations, primarily because of California State law. Again, in California State law there's vacancy decontrols mandated, so even though you may have rent control upon move out, you're moving people to market at that point in time. We operate in several rent control cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Jose, and so I don't think that that would necessarily change things.</p><p>Our experience in San Francisco, for example, in our rent controlled buildings in San Francisco is that fewer people move out so your turnover rates are lower, which means you can't capture the loss to lease as quickly, and you'd think that might be a real problem. But the flip of that is there are people that otherwise would have moved out of that building if not for the subsidy and bought a home or moved somewhere else, and those people now are occupying a unit which effectively makes the availability of units that are vacating smaller and giving us more pricing power on the other side. So, again, rent control cities are not necessarily horrible for us as long as State law remains in place.</p><p>DAN OPPENHEIM: Got it. Okay. Thanks.</p><p>And other question, wondering about the magnitude of the rent increases and the turnover, which clearly was down year-over-year? But just wondering, in some of the areas with Santa Clara, San Jose where you've seen the higher levels of rent growth, are you also seeing more move outs on account of those rent increases, or is it actually lower based on the strong income growth in those markets, so that it's not actually a function of the rent growth, but it's more the income growth that is driving it so that those rent increases aren't an issue?</p><p>ERIK ALEXANDER, SVP OF OPERATIONS, ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST INCORPORATED: Yes, this is Erik. I would say no that we haven't seen a significant increase due to financial reasons. If you look back over the last couple of years, that number has bounced around between 15% and 18%, as people are citing financial reasons, and so that's where it is today, as well. The one caveat is that there has been some uptick in people citing relocation out of the area as a reason, and we believe that some of that is probably related to financial reasons. But, again, that hasn't moved enough for me to believe that it's significant.</p><p>DAN OPPENHEIM: Thanks very much.</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.</p><p>ALEXANDER GOLDFARB, ANALYST, SANDLER O'NEILL &amp; PARTNERS: Good afternoon, or good morning out there. Angela, welcome to the hot seat. Just quickly a few questions here.</p><p>The first one, Mike, is you said that you were considering increasing dispositions for next year. If we look going back, you have harvested some of your funds over time, unloading of meaningful parts of the portfolio. There's also a focus, I think, of Essex to always grow FFO. So would you ever contemplate a transaction where if you thought that the pricing was so dramatic that you could get to do a sale of properties that would result in earnings coming down because you sold a significant part, even though you may generate huge gains for shareholders? Or, the view is always prune in smaller amounts and leave the larger portfolio stuff to your joint ventures?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Yes, Alex, good question. No, I think if there's a compelling opportunity to sell assets and distribute to a special dividend, I think we would absolutely do that. Again, right now we're in this what I just described as sort of the parity phase on the capital side, where the stock obviously is bouncing all over the place, so maybe in and out of parity. But we're at that point where there's no compelling arbitrage between the REIT stock price and the private real estate values, and so our motivation in that environment is not as great as it would be if, let's say, share prices and private real estate values diverge again as they have over the last several years.</p><p>So there is some concern about whether people will remember -- whether investors will remember that we paid a special dividend and that will properly get factored into our track record. But that's a relatively minor concern and since that is the only reality with respect to selling assets with large gains and distributing money, you obviously can use a 1031 exchange. But if that's a reality and that's the right thing to do then we're going to do it.</p><p>ALEXANDER GOLDFARB: Okay.</p><p>And then switching to Oakland. Last cycle you guys did some investments over there; there is a high rise tower that you got involved in. And then if memory serves I thought you exited the market or weren't as pleased with the results that you got. But at the beginning of the call you spoke highly of the market as far as just the accessibility to San Francisco and the low cost options. So, is this a market that we should see you increasingly invest in, or is it still maybe attractive right now, you may be hesitant to put longer term roots there?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Yes, I think there's maybe a little definitional issue here. The City of Oakland is different from the Oakland Metro. The Oakland Metro includes Freemont and Pleasanton and Walnut Creek, et cetera. And so we're seeing that the Oakland Metro, which is what generated the 12.7% same-store revenue growth is the broader metro and there are places within that metro that are very high quality and are accessible to San Francisco and some of the major job hubs.</p><p>The one thing the Bay Area really got right was the Bay Area rapid transit district, which essentially has trains that go from a variety of locations into San Francisco. And many, many people including myself, I live in Freemont, which is in the Oakland MSA, and getting to San Francisco is a heck of a lot easier than driving. So, it's the one thing they got very right, so there are locations within the Oakland Metro area that we think are high quality, commutable into San Francisco, et cetera.</p><p>We also believe, as John said, that as costs on the office side increase that some employers will start looking at different options that will benefit some of the other metros, including downtown Oakland in this case, but I wouldn't limit it to just downtown Oakland. There could be some businesses, or some parts of businesses that will move up and down the coast, and/or potentially other markets, as well, as the cost of business increases.</p><p>ALEXANDER GOLDFARB: So is downtown Oakland is that something you may revisit, or right now it's not on the radar?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: To be clear just downtown Oakland, we have a high rise building that we built down the street from the one you're referring to, and I don't think that we're looking at anything else in downtown Oakland. It has to be so specific, because there's some areas of downtown Oakland that we really, really don't like and so we would avoid them, but we would be highly, highly selective in Oakland, maybe less, so at some of the other locations within the Oakland metro, the broader metro.</p><p>ALEXANDER GOLDFARB: Okay. Thanks, Mike.</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next we'll hear from Tom Lesnick of Capital One Securities.</p><p>TOM LESNICK, ANALYST, CAPITAL ONE SECURITIES: Hello. Just quickly on the same-store guidance range. Obviously, on the full 43,000 units the ranges were unchanged, but on the 28,000 units OpEx was revised lower, implying that on the BRE portfolio there was a revision higher and hence the range was unchanged. I was just wondering what was driving that?</p><p>ANGELA KLEIMAN: It's not because of that. We revised the Essex same-store because we have realized the savings from the first quarter and we have not revised it for the combined portfolio, because we're still waiting on primarily the taxes. As you know, that's the biggest component of expenses. We've only received 75% of the taxes from the BRE acquisition, and so although that has come in slightly favorable, there's still a quarter of it left and so we're just waiting on that first before we make any decisions.</p><p>TOM LESNICK: Makes sense. That's helpful. And then on the insurance reimbursement accounting. I saw there was about $3.1 million on the income statement and then 1.8 was backed out for FFO and then another 600 was backed out for core, implying that there was a piece in there that was considered core. Could you clarify what that was?</p><p>ANGELA KLEIMAN: Yes, yes, happy to, and we did move the geography a little bit this quarter. And so but the net-net is it's all non-core, and we added a line in our, I think it's in the S or the supplementals, S-2, that shows insurance reimbursements. And so there were -- because of that we did a prior period adjustment, so it looks like some ended up in core, but it's not. But if you want, we can talk after the call and I can walk you through the math.</p><p>TOM LESNICK: Sure, happy to follow up on that. And then quickly, what was the recurring CapEx number for the quarter?</p><p>ANGELA KLEIMAN: The recurring CapEx is about $18 million for the quarter and you'll see that in our Q3 that's coming out next week.</p><p>TOM LESNICK: Alright great. Thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next we'll hear from [Greg Van Winkle], Morgan Stanley.</p><p>GREG VAN WINKLE, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Hello. Going back to your market forecast in the last phase of your supplement. You talked about how job growth versus supply growth still looks really good in all your markets, which is leading to the strong rent growth forecast for 2016. If you had to think about the risk, though, and where you might be wrong, where are you the least certain about your projections and are there any of those markets or forecasts where you think are more at risk than others, whether it be through the upside or the downside?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Hi, this is Mike. That's a good question.</p><p>We think about risk in really two different ways. One is the risk that in a major economic blip it seems like all the job growth across the nation goes to zero, and so the market with the highest overhang of new construction as a percentage of stock is the greatest hit. So Seattle from that perspective at 1.3% has the most overhang with respect to deliveries potentially. In an environment, again, of demand or job growth close to zero across the nation it would have the greatest impact.</p><p>In terms of the supply side of the equation, we expect to do enough diligence to have a very high degree of confidence that the supply numbers in this document are accurate. The one piece is you can throw up or build single-family homes relatively quickly if you can entitle them, whereas the apartments and condos it takes a very long lead time and it takes a couple years to build those buildings. So we should be able to get them 100% right.</p><p>So we feel very confident as it relates to the supply estimates, which leaves us with of course the job forecast. And on this obviously no one has the right answer. None of us have a crystal ball. We try to take a middle-of-the-road type of approach and maybe with an element of conservatism and again last year if you look at how we approach the same document we were pretty conservative. This year we're not estimating that. We're going to continue with this incredible job growth that we've had in 2015.</p><p>We moderated it somewhat, but the reality is we don't know. We think this is our expected case scenario, so therefore we expect the West Coast coastal metros to outperform the nation, the nation at 2%, by what is that, around 20%-25% and I think that's a rational relationship over a longer period of time. So we put this as maybe it tends to be a little bit conservative, and we hope to outperform it. But we view it as essentially a balanced forecast, and I think the risks are really the economy and what happens with the economy. Because that is going to drive whether we hit these job growth forecasts, and whether the nation hits its job growth forecasts, and then would you rank these and say Seattle would be your greatest exposure if you end up with a major economic issue.</p><p>GREG VAN WINKLE: Okay, and absent any nationwide economic slowdown, there aren't any three major geographies for you that are more or less at risk in the job growth side just from market specific issues?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Well, Southern California is a more diverse economy so you would say the chances are that if you're going to have widespread dislocation in Southern California it has to come from a variety of sectors. Obviously we have more tech focus in Northern California and Seattle, so you would say if something happens to technology, you have a somewhat greater exposure there, just as it relates to the components that are driving the economy.</p><p>And I'd say the same is true of all of this divergence within the economy where certain sectors are doing really well and others are doing poorly. Look at what happened with energy, for example. Anything that has a greater concentration of any part of the economy potentially is more exposed.</p><p>GREG VAN WINKLE: Makes total sense. And then last one here. If we think about upside from redevelopment and also optimizing lease expirations in the BRE portfolio, how much of a tail wind do you think that could be to same-store revenue growth in 2016?</p><p>JOHN EUDY: This is John.</p><p>On the BRE on the renovation side we will probably add about 50 basis points to their growth rate toward the second half of 2016. It will still take a little while to ramp up and have the impact at the bottom line.</p><p>As it relates to hitting the expirations in better order and the amenity pricing in better order, that's an ongoing process. That took us several years for the revenue management team. They worked very hard to make adjustments in the system for the Essex assets and we see that continuing on for the next couple of years. I can't quite quantify the impact other than to say as Erik had mentioned earlier we had some issues earlier on this year because of the expirations, and it's not as simple as just solving it at that point in time, as most people in the marketplace want a standard 12-month lease, and so by trying to force a new expiration schedule you don't necessarily get the best results, so you solve that type of a problem through a couple of rentals innovations and it takes a few years.</p><p>GREG VAN WINKLE: Alright, that's great. Thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next we'll hear from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird.</p><p>DREW BABIN, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; COMPANY: Hi. Great quarter. Looking into next year in the BRE portfolio integration in terms of your expense line items, any visibility at this point on which line items we may see shift one direction or the other as the different cost savings initiatives take deeper effect? And also what G&amp;A run rate expectation is -- the same factors?</p><p>JOHN EUDY: Yes, this is John again.</p><p>I'll be careful not to get into forward guidance, but just to give some flavor. Right now Erik and his team worked very hard when he first looked over the portfolio and we ultimately have our expenses with BRE expected on a unit per unit basis pretty close. So from a go-forward basis we don't expect large changes that relate to one portfolio or the other. We are working, as we mentioned on our Phase III of the merger integration, which includes procurement, and we do expect to see some savings there. We don't have our hands around all of that at this point in time.</p><p>We also have benefit of Resource Management, as we mentioned previously, and that is really largely focused on the BRE portfolio. We expect it from the onset to save as much as $100 a unit in utilities as we implement that. That's pretty tedious. It takes several years to implement each of the programs and do it well, so that will work its way into the BRE portfolio over, say, a three-year period, some of which we've already completed.</p><p>DREW BABIN: And any impacts noticeably on the G&amp;A front with the office consolidation?</p><p>ANGELA KLEIMAN: We are in the process of rolling up our 2015 budget, and so on the office front -- let's put it this way. I think G&amp;A as a whole probably would expect a modest increase, but it's not going to be materially different from what we're seeing right now.</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: I think there will be a little bit of a geography difference, because we'll take the proceeds from the sale of the office building and reinvest them, and that will offset some of the G&amp;A that will come in from the office relocation. So we expect the net core FFO impact to be modest, but the geography will be a little different.</p><p>DREW BABIN: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Wes?</p><p>OPERATOR: Wes, if you can release your mute function, we are unable to hear you.</p><p>WES GOLLADAY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Sorry about that. Good quarter, everyone.</p><p>Real quick on the job forecast, how did you derive that? Was that a third party, or are you looking at individual office leasing data that you're seeing and coming up with your own forecast and how granular does it get?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: This is Mike, Wes.</p><p>We use a variety of data vendors, economy.com, Rosen, a variety of others, and so we try to build a consensus as to the US job growth, and from there we look at historical relationships of if the US is doing this, what is the likely impact on the West Coast and our metros, and we have given consideration to specific sectors. So it isn't granular in the sense of we've got an estimate for what's happened at HP, but it starts with the broader macro expectations for the US and then it looks through to the sectors and tries to predict what is going to happen. And then of course we take that information and we create a supply/demand model for our each of our metros, our 25 some-odd sub markets, and then we rank them from the perspective of what we expect rents to do over the next four years. And that's how we make our capital allocation decisions.</p><p>WES GOLLADAY: Okay. And then you mentioned more about rent control this quarter, as well. Quick question for you on that. How much of your tenant base is that customer that you don't want to displace the teacher, the police officer versus the tech workforce, which is growing their income faster than you're growing the rent?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: This is going to be completely anecdotal, but I think that it's a significant part of our renter base. I'm guessing in Northern California, Seattle, it's somewhere in the 40% range, 30% to 40% range and, again, those people -- this is an ongoing process. Essentially people coming in making a lot of money, able to rent that expensive unit, and displacing someone that doesn't get a huge increase in compensation, and they move to next rung out let's say, and so it's hard to tell.</p><p>We've seen this play out many times in the Bay Area. It's not nearly to the extent that I saw in 1999 and 2000. This went on maybe three or four more years and therefore that transitionary effect continues to happen, but it's not limited by any means to California or San Francisco. Look what goes on in New York City, for example. So this is the ordinary operation of the renter pool and incentivizing the people that make the most money and therefore get the choice of where they want to live. So I view it as entirely again normal part of the marketplace, although I do believe that California would benefit itself and the employers and the whole economy if it would find a way to produce more housing.</p><p>WES GOLLADAY: Okay, thanks a lot.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next we'll hear from Nick Yulico of UBS.</p><p>NICK YULICO, ANALYST, UBS: Thanks. Mike, being that you sit in Palo Alto, the heart of venture capital land, I was wondering what you're hearing from people on that end about there's been some data showing venture capital funding, number of deals has been coming down for startups? Are you looking at that as a leading indicator for the economy out there, and what is your take on this discussion of late?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Yes, it's a good question, and we are somewhat concerned about venture capital and we do track it. We're less concerned about the valuations and whether there's an exit into the public markets and liquidity as it relates to those entities. We're more concerned about how many people do they have, how many employees do they have, how many people need housing, and in that light I can't stress how different the current environment is from the internet boom in the late 90s.</p><p>If you take the top 20 unicorns, for example, I believe that they employ somewhere around 26,000 people. If you take five public companies, Oracle, Apple, Cisco, Google, Facebook, they employ 367,000 people. We are obviously much more concerned about the big tech companies, and what they are doing and it's amazing. We're looking at what, for example, Google's doing with the alphabet companies and all of the different technology-related spinoffs, and combined with the fact that they have an enormous amount of capital to deploy into those entities gives us some comfort that tech hiring is not going to fall off a cliff here. And, in fact, that's why we feel pretty comfortable with our expectations on S16 and our market outlook, because it seems like there's a lot of activity out here and there's a lot of money out here that's pursuing that activity, both DC and some of just some of the major corporate entities.</p><p>NICK YULICO: Alright. Good points.</p><p>Turning down to Hollywood. The Nickelodeon site you have, can you just remind us what's the ultimate cost on that project? And a little bit more about where you think the land value is today, because there's a lot of sites trading around there recently or on the market right now for sale? And then just lastly, I want to be clear, whether or not that site is actually listed in your land held for development, or if it's still some other piece of real estate because at one point there was a lease on it?</p><p>JOHN EUDY: This is John Eudy.</p><p>In general, you're aware of the specific location in Hollywood, I would assume. It is a ground zero core Hollywood location. There have been a number of other transactions in the Hollywood address area that are completely different. As far as it being listed as a future, it is still as an investment, I believe. Is that correct, Angela, the Hollywood asset is as an investment because we leased with Nickelodeon?</p><p>ANGELA KLEIMAN: Yes.</p><p>JOHN EUDY: In terms of our basis, we are, we believe, well below what we would be able to trade it for today if we chose to go in that direction. And we are under the radar in terms of the height of the building that we're going offer and less visibility in terms of pushback on the entitlement side. So long and short is, we expect some time late next year is when we would transfer it over from a leased investment to an active land development transaction.</p><p>NICK YULICO: Okay. That's helpful, but anything more you could tell us on the ultimate -- how to think about FAR and because there are -- I know we can look at land comps in the market, but some idea about how much you could actually build on that site?</p><p>JOHN EUDY: Approximately 200 units is what we're going for, and it fits within the FAR fairly nicely. Until we get it all done, we don't like to do a lot of projecting and assumptions until we're ready to announce.</p><p>NICK YULICO: Okay, got it. Thanks.</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our final question today comes from Conor Wagner of Green Street Advisors.</p><p>CONOR WAGNER, ANALYST, GREEN STREET ADVISORS: How meaningful a factor are below-market taxes due to Prop 13 in ranking your potential dispositions for next year?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Hi, Conor. It's Mike Schall.</p><p>It is a factor and Prop 13 gives us a fair amount of wind to our back relative to what buyers will have to pay if they purchase an asset. And so I'd say number one it's a factor. Number two, we are looking for a variety of different transactional approaches to avoid a Prop 13 reassessment. So it could involve selling less than half, 49%, of a portfolio of assets, for example, to an institutional investor. So there are some ways to manage that, we believe, but management of Prop 13 is a factor for sure.</p><p>CONOR WAGNER: And then on the dispositions for next year, is there any thought to condo yet, or is it still too early?</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: I think it's still a bit too early. Again, we can only pull that trigger one time, and so we targeted a 30% to 40% premium to apartment values in order to make it worthwhile to convert from an apartment to a condo, and we're not seeing that 30% to 40% premium anywhere, although in San Francisco and actually a couple of the other Bay Area cities we're starting to see 10% to 15% premiums of condo values over apartments. So we're starting to see that divergence. It has taken longer, not necessarily because condos have done poorly, but because apartments have done so well. So we continue to monitor it.</p><p>CONOR WAGNER: Great. Thank you very much.</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Thanks, Conor.</p><p>OPERATOR: And there are no further questions at this time.</p><p>MICHAEL SCHALL: Thank you. Well, in closing I want to thank you once again for joining the call. We wish you and your families a safe and enjoyable Halloween and look forward to seeing many of you at the NAREIT conference in a few weeks. Good day.</p><p>OPERATOR: That does conclude today's conference.

Bill?</p><p>BILL HUMES, CFO, INGRAM MICRO: Thank you, Damon. Good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another quarter of great execution, highlighted by a 21% increase in earnings per share on a currency neutral basis. We continued to drive efficiencies across our core business and benefit for prior investments in a faster growing, higher margin areas. We are executing on our strategy which combined with a focus on working capital, helped generate $340 million in operating cash flow, bringing our year-to-date cash generation from operations to $965 million.</p><p>Revenue for the second quarter was $10.5 billion. Within our guidance range and representing an increase of 2% on a currency neutral basis. Excluding the negative impact related to exiting portions of our North American Mobility distribution business, as discussed last quarter, worldwide revenue was up approximately 5% on a currency neutral basis.</p><p>The strengthening of the US dollar had an 8% negative impact on revenues in US dollar terms. Our recent acquisitions contributed two percentage points of growth. Gross margin was 6.31%, a 56 basis point improvement over last year. The acquisition of mobility services ANOVO contributed 30 basis points of the improvement and the remaining increase was driven by the combination of stronger value sales across all regions and lower North American mobility distribution sales.</p><p>Non-GAAP operating margin was 1.6% with the highest for our third quarter in more than a decade, increasing 17 basis points over last year due primarily to gross margin improvement and strong operating leverage in our core business across most countries. Non-GAAP interest and other expense of $28 million was up $4.5 million over the 2014 third quarter. Resulting from interest on our December 2014 bond offering and higher foreign exchange costs related to volatility in global currencies.</p><p>Non-GAAP EPS at $0.67 was near the high end of our guidance range, an increase of 21% on a currency neutral basis. Translation of foreign currencies had an $0.08 negative impact when compared to last year. $0.02 greater than our expectations entering the quarter.</p><p>Now, looking at some regional details, North America revenue of $4.5 billion was down 13% in US dollars and down 11% on a currency neutral basis. Continued strength in data center and networking infrastructure particularly for SMB and direct marketers was more than offset by lower mobility distribution as we exited portions of the business that did not meet our profitability objectives. Additionally, demand for PCs and tablets was soft in the region, especially when compared to robust PC growth last year.</p><p>Our focus on value was rewarded as North America delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 2.48% up 42 basis points versus last year. North America had good contribution from specialty and advanced solutions and mobility life-cycle service also added strong profitability resulting from higher volumes in forward and reverse logistics and repairs. Europe revenue $2.9 billion was up 8% on a currency neutral basis. But down 8% in US dollars. Local currency revenue strength was driven by strong iPhone demand and solid sales of advance and specialty solutions.</p><p>Additionally, the acquisition of ANOVO added two percentage points of growth. Demand in Germany, the largest regional contributor, improved in Q3 with strength from corporate resalers in categories including networking, data capture point of sale and mobility. France and the UK also contributed strong growth and Spain delivered double digit growth supported by an uptick to advanced solution sales in both countries and strong mobility sales in Italy.</p><p>Non-GAAP operating margin was 62 basis points. Our European technology solutions business continues to deliver year-over-year improvement with expanding growth in operating margins. However this progress was diluted by our efforts to build out our higher margin strategic businesses including in mobility and to expand our Cloud marketplace throughout the region. Asia Pacific continues to be a standout performer with revenues of $2.5 billion representing an increase of 16% on a currency neutral basis and 6% in US dollars.</p><p>Our acquisitions in Turkey and Saudi Arabia contributed approximately five percentage points of growth. Non-GAAP operating margin of 1.61% was up year-over-year by 22 basis points. Supported by solid demand for higher margin solutions and our recent value focused acquisitions. The region experienced particular strength in infrastructure software, unified communications and virtualization offerings. Strong growth and profitability in India was bolstered by robust demand across most product lines, especially in enterprise end markets.</p><p>Australia continues to post double digit growth above the region's average and China delivered another quarter of solid growth due to strong mobility sales and the addition of new vendor lines. Our Middle East business contributed strong profitability benefiting from a strict value focus and contributions from recent acquisitions. Latin America led all regions in growth with revenue of $582 million increasing 11% in US dollars and 32% on a currency neutral base.</p><p>The addition of acquired distribution businesses in Peru and Chile, along with our ANOVO business in the regions, contributed approximately 11 percentage points of growth. Our largest countries in the region, Mexico and Brazil, each had a robust double digit growth with strength broadly. Profitability in Latin America was solid with non-GAAP operating margin of 1.59%.</p><p>Turning to other financial highlights in the quarter, HP represented 14%. Apple, 12%. And Cisco, 10% of total sales in Q3. CapEx for the quarter was $42 million and depreciation was $23 million. Non-GAAP return on invested capital was 10.6%, above our weighted average cost to capitol by more than 250 basis points.</p><p>At quarter end, our cash balance was nearly $1 billion and net debt totaled $280 million. Working capital days are 25. A two-day sequential improvement which resulted from progress in influencing our working capital improvement program. This improvement helped generate $340 million operating cash flows for the quarter bringing year-to-date operating cash flow to $965 million.</p><p>I'll now turn the call over to Alain.</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE, </nameText></person>CEO, INGRAM MICRO: Thanks, Bill. We had a great third quarter with very solid execution resulting in continued operating margin expansion, robust EPS growth and excellent cash flow generation. We delivered good revenue growth across key areas of our business with broad-based demand globally, for high value specialty and advanced solutions. Particularly for data center and network infrastructure deployments.</p><p>We're generating significant momentum in this important category which is contributing to strong and expanding growth and operating margins. Our performance has established Ingram as one of the leading technology solution providers in this market. In addition to green field investments to build the capabilities and expertise required to secure new height value vendor authorizations, we have also continued to strengthen our position with vendor partners and customers through acquisitions.</p><p>Just last week, we announced our intention to acquire Grupo ACAO, another leading provider of critical value add IT solutions in Latin America. ACAO's key vendor portfolio includes Oracle, IBM, Red Hat, EMC and VMware, to name a few. We expect to realize meaningful vendor and customer cross setting opportunities in the countries we share. As there is very little overlap and together we will have a significantly expanded portfolio of high value offerings.</p><p>Upon close, this acquisition will help us continue to drive margin expansion and it is expected to contribute approximately $0.04 to non-GAAP earnings in 2016. We also continued to strengthen our relationships with core vendor partners to help meet their requirements on a global basis. For example, Dell is strategically relying on Ingram as a key partner throughout the world and in Q3, granted a distribution access to selling to its important federal market.</p><p>In mobility, our position at the center of the mobility life cycle ecosystem is a strong differentiator. Solid profitability is being driven by robust services performance particularly in North America as we expand our business with existing partners such as T-Mobile and TracFone. Our six-month-old acquisition of life cycle services ANOVO is also performing well in Europe and Ingram's global infrastructure is providing opportunities to leverage this business across new markets.</p><p>Additionally, our role as a key distribution partner for top handset OEMs is driving strong growth internationally. Our Cloud business continues to grow over 100% year-over-year on a currency neutral basis and the global expansion of our automated Cloud marketplace is producing strong demand for Ingram's Cloud offerings. We're rapidly becoming a go-to partner for leading Cloud innovators as they recognize the power and ease of views of our proprietary automation platform and increasingly rely on Ingram Microto drive widespread adoption of their solutions, especially in the SMB space.</p><p>As an example, Microsoft has tapped Ingram to play a critical role in business model transformation as we were among the first to be named a key partner in the Microsoft Cloud solution provider for CSP program worldwide. During the quarter, we had very strong Cloud revenue growth in newly entered countries and expect to benefit in Q4 from expansion into India, Singapore and Malaysia which now gives us a presence in 16 countries. Our Cloud business remains an area of investment for Ingram and it is important for us to continue to broaden our services portfolio, global footprint and leverage what we believe is superior technology and first move our advantage to capture market share.</p><p>To borrow from Satya Nadella comments last week, to be a worldwide Cloud player, global scale is a must. Commerce and fulfillment solutions continues to grow at double digit rates supported by recent international wins. Earlier this month, we announced our intention to acquire DOCDATA, one of the leading European providers of order fulfillment, returns logistics and online payment services. Similar to our established business in North America, DOCDATA provides critical commerce solutions to major retailers, brands and promising start-ups.</p><p>While we have been gaining traction in the region on a green field basis, DOCDATA is a well-respected and highly recognized brand in Europe. And this addition is expected to immediately establish Ingram Microas a significant Ecommerce logistics player in the region, providing access to business and request for proposals for which we previously had not been considered. Upon close, we expect the acquisition to contribute immediately to earnings and we're confident that we'll be able to leverage Ingram's presence and strength to accelerate additional growth and profitability in this business.</p><p>In addition to our strong execution, we're delivering on our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. In September, we made our first dividend payment and during the third quarter, we repurchased 6.4 million shares for a total cost of $161 million. Since we re-initiated our share repurchase program in May of this year, we have repurchased a little more than eight million shares for a total cost of $206 million.</p><p>As announced in our press release this afternoon, our next dividend will be paid on November 24 to stockholders of record on November 10. For Q4, we'll continue to see stable markets globally and we expect demand for higher value solutions to continue to outpace average IT Growth rates. In our core business we expect SMB to remain healthy broadly.</p><p>For our fourth quarter, we expect continued strong operating leverage and further improvement in operating margin. While we expect revenues to show historic sequential seasonal growth in the mid to high teens, we're facing difficult comparisons versus last year. Foreign exchange is expected to be at least a 6% headwind or headwind of approximately $800 million in Q4. And as we highlighted last year, our 2014 fourth quarter performance was aided by the addition of our 14th week which added approximately $850 million.</p><p>Also as previously disclosed, we expected approximately $400 million in lower North American mobility distribution revenues. Excluding these impacts, the midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance reflects expectations for approximately 3% growth over last year. For Q4 this year, we expect revenue to be between $12 billion and $12.6 billion.</p><p>Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1 to $1.07. Which reflects a negative impact related to currency movement of $0.10 when compared to last year. And reflects an increase of 12% to 19% over the 2014 fourth quarter on a currency neutral basis. Additionally, we now expect to generate more than $1 billion in cash flow from operations for the 2015 full year, up significantly from earlier expectations of $700 million even as we deploy capital to support sequential revenue growth in our seasonally strongest fourth quarter.</p><p>In conclusion, we're executing well. Margin expansion is being driven by growing contribution from higher value businesses combined with operating leverage. Strong cash flow generation is also resulting from our working capital improvement programs. And we're delivering on our balance capital allocation strategy to continue to grow the business in important strategic areas while at the same time returning value to shareholders.</p><p>I would like to open the call to your questions now.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). One moment while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Alexander with Raymond James. Please proceed.</p><p>BRIAN ALEXANDER, ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES &amp; ASSOCIATES, INC.: Maybe start by talking about Europe and the demand environment given some comments by some of your peer distributors and competitors that -- and even your vendors that Europe remains strong. And i know you were up on constant currency. So if you could talk about demand in Europe.</p><p>And then related to that, it looks like margins in Europe were flat year-over-year, despite growth in constant currency and despite the inclusion of ANOVO. How should we think about European operating margins as you look forward and you get through this restructuring program which I know a lot of that is aimed at Europe. Are we still thinking 150 basis points of margin is possible next year? Thanks.</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: Yes, Hi Brian. This is Alain. I'll pass it on to Paul for some additional color. But let me start with the demand question. We've seen in Europe, pretty healthy demand in Germany, especially for us on the corporate resellers front. But at the same time, the SMB customer base size has also been pretty stable. And I would say strong as well. In addition to that, we had pretty strong iPhone sales across the region.</p><p>And as far as countries, I would add in addition to Germany, France, Italy, Spain, were very strong and to a certain extent, UK as well. So yes, we confirm that in local currencies we're seeing fairly stable if not strong demand in Europe.</p><p>Now, as to your question on margins, that are flat, this is a combination of a couple of things. One is we are seeing good leverage and good growth on our operating margins in our technology solutions business. But at the same time -- and that also was aided by ANOVO -- but at the same time, we keep investing particularly in mobility and in Cloud in order to make sure that we position ourselves well for 2016.</p><p>So if you combine that with our cost savings program which kick in in Europe a little later than the rest of the world which means it will be mostly fully in 2016, we're still aiming at exiting 2016 with 150 basis points or close to. Paul, you want to add anything to this?</p><p>PAUL READ, PRESIDENT, COO, INGRAM MICRO: I think you captured it Alain. We've also -- we struggle to -- the early part of this year with the lack of leverage coming out of some of the PC sales. Through the Q3 quarter and continuing through Q4, there is more sell through of the PCs into the channels. So some of the inventory has been relieved. So that's helped with leverage as well.</p><p>As Alain said, it will balancing out the mix of the business invested in the more higher value businesses whether it's acquisition or organically and I think that will come through in Q -- so in 2016 as well as with the cost reductions, we're still keeping our mind set on 150 basis points.</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: And Brian, you can also count on the data acquisition which will be hopefully fully impacting our 2016 numbers in Europe.</p><p>BRIAN ALEXANDER: And Alain, the 150 was annualized, not a Q4 target.</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: We're trying to annualize it. But it will happen more toward the end of the year than the beginning, obviously given how we enter the 2016 year.</p><p>BRIAN ALEXANDER: Right. Okay. I just wanted to make sure that wasn't a quarterly number. Then my follow-up, so on the 2016 earnings outlook, originally you gave a range of $3.40 to $3.70. That was at your 2014 analyst meeting. A lot has changed since then. The currency headwind is even greater now than it was a quarter ago when you said roughly $0.20 headwind to that range. So I just wanted to kind of level set and see where we're at for next year.</p><p>Are we down to $3.15 to $3.45 given the currency headwind or are we higher than that because of the acquisitions? Maybe if you could just kind of help frame next year relative to your original outlook and just kind of highlight at a very high level some of the major puts and takes to the outlook you gave last year.</p><p>BILL HUMES: Brian, it's Bill. Overall a couple of quarters ago, we had already communicated with the expected impact on foreign exchange back then that we did lower the targets to $3.20 to $3.50 per share. Now currencies have continued to get a little bit weaker since then and had a bigger impact even on 2015 than we originally anticipated and even when we anticipated the impact on Q3.</p><p>That being said, we're not going to adjust the 2016 numbers even further from them at this point. Foreign exchange is a moving target. And we'll re-evaluate the currencies as we close the year and get into 2016.</p><p>BRIAN ALEXANDER: Okay. Thank you.</p><p>BILL HUMES: Sure.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Please proceed.</p><p>MATT SHEERIN, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Yes, thanks. Just following up on Brian's question, it sounds like you're still targeting that $3.30 midpoint EPS, right?</p><p>BILL HUMES: Right.</p><p>MATT SHEERIN: Okay. And on the North America business related to the Verizon dealer program, where are we in terms of the revenue flowing out is there more to go this quarter? And is that it? And how, two quarters, or basically one full quarter into your new agreements and as you get into the busy season where you're going to have, obviously, a lot more volumes, how satisfied are you with the contracts and feedback you're getting from your customers there in terms of how the relationships are going?</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: We're satisfied with the new environment, what I would call new contractual terms as well as the mix of services and distribution, mix of customers. We believe that we're now in a good position to have that business contribute in a way that is satisfactory for us. So I would say Q4 will be stable, new environment for us and we believe that we've done most of the correction course, if you will, in Q3. But, Bill do you have any --</p><p>BILL HUMES: Yes, overall in Q3, there was an impact obviously. As effective at the beginning of the quarter, we did exit certain lines of that business. So we were down a little bit over $300 million year-over-year in the revenues. That's a big impact of what you see in the North American revenue growth rates. Now that amount will generally grow because it is a fourth quarter centric business. But we still expect it to be down, as Alain had mentioned earlier, about $400 million on a year-over-year basis but at better profitability and less capital usage levels.</p><p>MATT SHEERIN: Okay. And then just back to Europe and the margins and the costs that are coming out there. I understand how that flows through. But what about investments that those incremental investments you're making in Cloud, supply chain, et cetera. Are they starting to sort of play out so that you'll begin to get that leverage in the model?</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: I would say, Matt, yes, on the supply chain and e-commerce solutions, particularly as we add DOCDATA, which is the recent acquisition. But not only that, we also had pretty good organic wins on new contracts, especially in the UK, and those are going to be contributing. On the Cloud, we're still in investment mode because we need to get all the countries. And as you know, the complexity of Europe as far as having data being residing in country versus outside of the country, it gets a little more complicated. But we are lighting up several countries next year in order to really have our cloud offering available as broadly as possible.</p><p>MATT SHEERIN: Got it. Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Please proceed.</p><p>ANANDA BARUAH, ANALYST, BREAN CAPITAL, LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate it. I guess just a few from me. In North America, with regards to the portions of the business that you said you're exiting, how much of that -- not quantified, but does that -- well, let me ask you this way, does that include both the Verizon business as well as ongoing PC business that you're walking away from?</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: It is mainly and mostly, is around what we call the Verizon ecosystem. That's where most of it has been exiting. On the PC side, I wouldn't call it the exiting business, I would be qualifying that much more as being selective on which deals we take and which we don't. And that by the way has happened in Q3, which is part of the PC's negative impact, which was driven, not only by the market itself, but also by our own decisions to take or not take those business. But in Q4, it's mostly around the so called Verizon business.</p><p>ANANDA BARUAH: That's really helpful. Thanks, Alain. And on the PC dynamic, you find that it's -- you're having to become increasingly selective or, I mean, I know that we've sort of worked into that dynamic over the last couple few years. Do you feel like you're at sort of a normalized practice of having to be selective, or do you find yourself having to be increasingly selective still?</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: Paul, would you like to take this? You're on mute.</p><p>PAUL READ: Yes, Ananda, hello. Sorry.</p><p>ANANDA BARUAH: Yes.</p><p>PAUL READ: It is a difficult comp, as you know, year-over-year for PCs with the refresh last year. But I wouldn't describe the environment as being increasingly more selective, we've always been selective. And there is softness that we saw in the market out there anyway throughout the quarter and we expect that to continue into Q4, and we will continue to be selective, it's no doubt. If it doesn't have the returns that we need, then we will choose to pass on some of those larger, higher volume deals that come our way.</p><p>ANANDA BARUAH: And how do you guys feel about the channel inventory levels of notebooks now, PCs?</p><p>PAUL READ: It certainly eased definitely in Europe in Q3 with a lot of vendor support on pricing, some of -- a lot of the inventory had moved through. So some stabilizing there of the situation, which was good for us and that's why you saw some leverage there with Europe, and I think that will continue into Q4 as well. We haven't yet seen any real pickup from Windows 10. I'm sure we'll see some of that next year, but so far it's really not been notable.</p><p>ANANDA BARUAH: Thanks. And just the last one from me, Bill. What -- I think you mentioned in the press release there was a $0.02 incremental headwind to EPS from the time you gave September Q guidance, what's the right way to think about what the December Q impact is from the beginning of the September Q, without trying to make it too complicated? And so really what I'm asking is, when we sort of look at where street numbers, where for December Q going into tonight's call, what would be that incremental impact from when you gave the September Q guidance, is it a little bit greater than the $0.02 for December Q?</p><p>BILL HUMES: Yes. I mean, overall, we've disclosed that we expect the impacts on a year-over-year basis to be about $0.10. I mean what it would have been, I guess or expected, when if we were given fourth quarter guidance at the beginning of Q3 in our earnings release for Q2. I mean, it's obviously a little bit larger, but probably in that same ballpark of maybe $0.02 to $0.03 larger overall than what we originally thought.</p><p>ANANDA BARUAH: Got it. That's helpful. Okay, guys. Thanks a lot.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Please proceed.</p><p>JIM SUVA, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Thank you, and congratulations on your results. I have two questions, one on the mobility side, and the other on PCs. First, on mobility, in the past few months, there's been a lot of changes about what the carriers and Apple is doing, specifically with changes to duration of contracts, leasings, get a new phone every year type of programs. Is that having an impact to the Company or should it, like will you have to do more now with second hand used phones, or do you see people potentially going to the OEM Apple directly as opposed to some of the retail shops? How should we just think about that? It's just not Apple, it's also some of the others doing shorter duration. Therefore people are turning in their phones faster. I don't know maybe that actually helps you, or do you then have to find a second hand market for the used phones?</p><p>And then, my question on the PCs is if you compare PCs to earlier in the year, or maybe versus seasonality of what is expected for normal seasonality, have PCs and the inventory demand gotten worse, or in line with seasonality or improved, or how should we think about that? Because I believe that first half of the year was significantly lower than expected. Now, in the second half, seasonality will help, but I'm wondering if it's -- I know it's still challenged, but has it actually gotten worse or a little bit better? Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: Hey, Jim, I'll -- this is the Alain. I'll take the first question on mobility, I'll pass it on to Paul for the PCs question. On the mobility front, you're correct that there are a number of changes out there and it's true in different countries, not only here in the US on what the carriers are doing, what they're not doing anymore, the things that Apple now is taking. I would say, there are two main elements of potential impact to us and, I'd say, impact being positive.</p><p>The first one is that, as there is more and more distribution and open market availability of product, that plays into one of our strengths being extremely good there, not only in distributing those products, but also attaching services around it. On the other hand, we are also very strong with the services to the carriers. So we are on both ends of those two different strategies and when it shifts from one to the other, we benefit in both ends. So there is a transfer of opportunity for us.</p><p>However, on the second and, you alluded to that, the fact that some of these devices now are going to turn more rapidly, really play into our repair services where we have really well established capabilities now and authorizations from the major OEMs. So the more of these devices turn, the better it is for us, the more we have a chance to capture the value and the remarketing of those devices, which has been a growing business for us, can be called a regeneration or can be called trade-ins. We are in all these markets. So it is -- if anything, it will be a favorable impact to us. Paul, you want to answer the question on PCs?</p><p>PAUL READ: Yes, Alain. So, Jim, I think you'd have to look back to last year. We had a very strong second half around the globe on PCs, the first half with the refresh. So I think if you look at seasonality or sequentially, it was very strong last year. So it's fair to say that this year it's a lot softer than last year seasonality or sequentially, whatever way you look at it. There are some pockets of growth, Asia-Pac, Latin America, we actually have had growth. But I've mentioned North America was soft, and I think that'll be soft in Q4 as well, so down seasonality, down sequentially. And Europe was flat, and the flatness really was a lot of support from vendors to sell-through some aged inventory. And that's how we see Q4 going. So it's a little bit of a mix picture, but definitely I think the comment would be down seasonally.</p><p>JIM SUVA: Thank you for your details.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Please proceed.</p><p>LOUIS MISCIOSCIA, ANALYST, CLSA LIMITED: Okay. Thank you. Hey, Paul, could you just expand on that last comment when you said down seasonally. And I guess, where I'm coming from, some -- the very big tech companies, maybe you don't do. But you do some of the data center products, did talk about pauses, whether EMC, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. So just wondering if some of the areas seem reasonably decent for you all. So I was just a bit surprised maybe it's not weaker. So just expand on the comment, please.</p><p>PAUL READ: Yes, certainly. Well, I was just trying to explain that from a PC perspective, last year was very strong for us, first half versus second half, so therefore seasonally high in Q3, Q4. That jump is certainly not as great this year from first half to second half. US has definitely slowed down from what we sell, of course, and Europe is flattened out, and there's pockets of growth in Asia. I think you can break it down also that on desktops and notebooks, it was down for us in the US. Europe, desktops are actually up and notebooks were down for us. So it's kind of flat overall. And then in both categories, Asia-Pac and Latin America, were both up.</p><p>And so what we're seeing is a selling through of some older inventory and not a great pickup seasonally on the Windows 10 or other things that could be driving it. Now, we are seeing strength in tablets, for example, and other products like that, which is driving some demand for us. But we've said no comments. Networking -- network infrastructure and data center software virtualization, all these other products, higher value solutions for us, are growing very, very well, and that's where a lot of our margin accretion is coming from. And that's some investments that we've been making over the last few years that seem to be paying off with some of our major vendors.</p><p>LOUIS MISCIOSCIA: Okay. Last quarter, I think you talked about some modest growth in China. Maybe if you can just tell us what's going on there, given it seems like the economy is slowing?</p><p>PAUL READ: Yes. We've benefited, we've had mid-single-digit growth in a couple of quarters and we've benefited really from some new products entering the market on the phone side and other consumer products as well. So I think the team there's doing a really good job capturing some market share. Q4 won't be as great, I don't think, although, we still see some growth. But we had a good Q3 and a good Q2. So I think they're executing pretty well at that.</p><p>LOUIS MISCIOSCIA: And maybe the last question would be on the Cloud, you talked about it a little bit. Any chance that we could either get it sized, or at some point get it sized?</p><p>PAUL READ: Sizing is required. I'll leave that to Alain.</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: Yes. We're really in the mode of investing and deploying our Cloud offerings there. Clearly, when we have more detailed data that we can share, we would certainly do that. I wouldn't expect us to be able to share Cloud details probably until the end of next year, but without a commencement yet.</p><p>LOUIS MISCIOSCIA: Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck on the rest of the year.</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: Thank you.</p><p>BILL HUMES: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Rold with Needham &amp; Co. Please proceed.</p><p>DAVID ROLD, ANALYST, NEEDHAM &amp; CO.: Hi. Thank you. Just a quick one on the cash flow. Was the improvement just at the mobility working capital freeing up, or was there another component there?</p><p>BILL HUMES: No, I don't know. If you look at -- this is Bill by the way, David. But the increase in the cash flow produced in Q3 really of $340 million, really comes mostly from a sequential working capital day improvement of a little over two days, the rest comes from the overall operating income after tax production. So, overall, it's a working capital day improvement. Now, we do have a very significant by-country working capital reduction or improvement program around the globe and that's what we're driving very hard. So we do expect to continue to drive working capital days going forward down to an improved level</p><p>DAVID ROLD: Okay, great. Thank you.</p><p>BILL HUMES: Sure.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Osten Bernardez with Cross Research. Please proceed.</p><p>OSTEN BERNARDEZ, ANALYST, CROSS RESEARCH: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Real quickly, I was just wondering with respect to the dynamics of your mobility business, you commented that you're expecting that, I guess, the margin profile to remain relatively stable, is my understanding for the fourth quarter. But given sort of the holiday transition and what you expect for -- and what you've learned last quarter versus -- excuse me, last year heading into the March quarter? How should we be thinking about that margin sustainability also in early 2016?</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: If I look at the -- I would assume the comment is on the overall margin stability. And a lot of that comes from, it's a combination of both acquisitions as well as a better mix of value sales and more services. So it is a contribution, not only from the mobility side, but in the mobility side there is, because we have less distribution and more services, which really help our operating margins there, but also the addition of acquisitions whether it's in mobility such as ANOVO, but also the ones we just announced that are more in the value business. So those are improvements that are, I would call it, here to stay, given that they're structurally now included in our fabric.</p><p>OSTEN BERNARDEZ: Got it. But I'm sorry if I'm not making it clear. I guess my question was more specific towards the Verizon supply chain business and how in last year you had the higher rate of returns than expected. I would assume that there will be some returns obviously after this holiday season, and I understand that you have better terms today than you did before. But how should we be thinking about the potential sort of the seasonal impact from a sales and margin perspective, just...</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: Yes. Bill, you want to talk?</p><p>BILL HUMES: Yes. Hi, Osten, this is Bill. Yes. Overall, I mean, when you said supply chain, it's really actually the distribution business on that mobility side in the U.S. Last year, both Q3 and Q4 last year, we didn't see the returns yet coming in. And the profitability, we talked about last year was still pretty good, was roughly around the operating margin of 2%. Now, as we saw a significant amount of returns post year-end, that would have reduced that level of profitability.</p><p>Going into Q4, and also fixing into Q3, we've limited, one, the level of returns that we can, and will accept, as well as where the most returns came in, that business we did exit. So going forward, we shouldn't see the impact as significantly and as unanticipated as we did last year. So it's really -- we really have fixed the business or exited what could not be fixed to the level that we needed it to be. So going forward, it's much more attractive business, it just happens to be smaller.</p><p>OSTEN BERNARDEZ: Got it. That's it from me. Thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please proceed.</p><p>KEITH HOUSUM, ANALYST, NORTHCOAST RESEARCH: Good afternoon, gentlemen. Question for you on, I guess, the dynamics of some of the acquisitions are going on are in the splits. With HP splitting into two in November one, and Dell and EMC getting together. There's been a lot of talk that the channel being a big part of both of those enterprises going forward. As you guys think about the activity with both of those developments, how do you think it's going to impact the business going forward?</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: Yes. This is Alain. I'll let everyone else chime in, if you want to. On HP, in spite of the fact that there is an appearance -- apparently of a very big difference, we have been for many years really working with HP as two separate and two different divisions, both the enterprise side or the printing side. So, today, this change externally is probably not going to have a lot of impact directly into the way we have been working with them. There were separate different contracts, different go-to-market organizations. We had specific teams dedicated to all of these businesses.</p><p>As you can imagine, it's a very large diverse business and we had specific teams aligned with them. And in as much as they had a lot of work, I'm sure to do in splitting their organization, on our end, our organization was already well aligned with those two separate organizations. On the other hand, I think that, as part of their own strategy to grow their business independently now, the channel is going to be a more important piece than it was. And so I would see that more as an opportunity for us to even play a bigger role for HP.</p><p>As far as the Dell, EMC combination, although it's too early to tell what the real impact will be, we believe that this is going to create an opportunity for new products to be sold. And our strategic partnership with Dell is extremely solid, which we count on leveraging there. So without being able today to give you any precise potential impact, we only see potential positives here because of our partnership with Dell and the fact that by integrating those two it helps us offer an even stronger solution set based on their integration.</p><p>KEITH HOUSUM: Great. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Our final question is a follow-up from the line of Brian Alexander with Raymond James. Please proceed.</p><p>BRIAN ALEXANDER: Okay. Just a few quick ones. One is, I assume neither of these acquisitions are in your fourth quarter revenue guidance since they haven't closed. And two is on the cost savings, I think it's $10 million in Q4, is that incremental or is that cumulative? And then I just have one more.</p><p>BILL HUMES: Yes. Hi, Brian, it's Bill. Overall, no, the acquisitions aren't in our fourth quarter forecast, we do expect to close them towards the end of the quarter. So they don't have a significant impact neither way. On the...</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: Savings.</p><p>BILL HUMES: On the cost -- on savings, we realized about $5 million in Q3 and expect $10 million savings in Q4, which would be especially at $40 million run rate then, so it's incrementally about $5 million on top of the $5 million realized in Q3, but cumulatively we should have $15 million for the 2015 year. And then beyond the full run rate or closer to it when we enter 2016.</p><p>BRIAN ALEXANDER: Okay. And then to the extent you get more involved in these return programs on the iPhone as Jim was asking about earlier, I assume that's a situation where you're not going to have any inventory or balance sheet risk. I assume that's really more of a services value proposition, or maybe just help me understand that better.</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: Yes. Most of our business in that -- and I'd say most because there are some cases where we do buy and sell and in our regeneration type of business, but most of that is done on a service, fee-for-service. And so, yes, you're correct that there is very little impact on our balance sheet.</p><p>BRIAN ALEXANDER: And then finally, Bill, you intimated earlier to a question that the cash conversion cycle should come down from where it's been. Could you just maybe give us -- maybe a range on where you think it should settle?</p><p>BILL HUMES: Yes. It's hard to say exactly where in the range, but we do expect year-over-year reduction, whether it's couple of days or whatever, that's definitely something we're targeting and shooting for. And then we expect a further, I'd say, into 2016, we'd expect to be able to strip a little bit more out as well.</p><p>BRIAN ALEXANDER: So just on a go forward basis, I'm not pinning you down to one quarter, but should we be thinking mid-20% is your target or high-20%, what's the right way to think about the range?</p><p>BILL HUMES: Yes, I mean, if you think about in the past, we've been -- we've previously in the kind of 22% to 26% range. Few of these quarters, most recently, we've been over. We're back in that range, and I'd hope to be towards the very end of that or lower range or even a different range. So we'll see as it all pulls -- kind of falls out and we realize it, but we have a significant focus on driving best practices across the globe. We're working on inventory procurement, working on other areas of working capital and working capital opportunity. So we are really driving that with intense focus. So we do expect some benefits and reductions. We're just not ready to say that the level of range, but we do expect improvements.</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: We are at 25 days, and we expect improvements both in Q4, and to some extent also in next year. So that gives you the starting point and improvements from there.</p><p>BRIAN ALEXANDER: Okay. Great job on profitability and cash flow this quarter. Thanks.</p><p>BILL HUMES: Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>ALAIN MONIE</nameText></person>: Thank you, Brian.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.</p><p>DAMON WRIGHT: Thank you, Gloria, and thank you all for participating with us today.

John?</p><p>JOHN KILROY, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, KILROY REALTY CORP: Thank you, Tyler. Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. Let me start by addressing the recent articles and questions related to the strength of the tech sector generally and the San Francisco market specifically. While we are always on the lookout for signs that the real estate market is changing, for both the good and the bad, we currently see nothing on the ground in our discussions with tenants and business leaders or in specific real estate statistics that suggests that the cycle has turned.</p><p>UCLA Anderson and The Economist are forecasting two more years of expansion. Revenue producing technology companies continue to grow and benefit from the proliferation of the internet and mobile devices and West Coast real estate markets continue to build strong momentum, with fundamentals improving in all of our submarkets including San Francisco.</p><p>Quarter-over-quarter, we saw demand increase for large blocks of space due to supply stayed limited and rental rates continue to rise. Sublease space fill in San Francisco and Silicon Valley had a 10-year high in absorption. In our discussions with Executives of large technology companies about their internal studies on head count, they note that San Francisco and Seattle remains the top markets in the US for attracting talent. We see this in recent reports on tech job openings, which remain robust.</p><p>San Francisco reported over 3,500 tech jobs to fill; Seattle reported almost 3,000 and Los Angeles reported more than 2,200 tech job openings. We also saw Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and others recently report stronger than expected earnings. We don't want to sound Pollyannaish, we acknowledge that it's a risk to current economy and we are mindful of the importance of venture capital funding to the tech industry, particularly with the start-ups.</p><p>We just aren't seeing deterioration in the fundamentals. In fact, the level of demand both in Silicon Valley and San Francisco has never been stronger, as evidenced by the data. San Francisco has had 1.5 million square feet of net absorption so far this year, with another 500,000 square feet projected for the fourth quarter. There are currently 26 San Francisco requirements of over 100,000 square feet, up from 15, last quarter and only two spaces of that size are available.</p><p>Silicon Valley has already had one of its strongest absorption years with projections for a very strong fourth quarter and we're seeing demand increase in all of our markets. In San Francisco, demand increased from 7.8 million square feet in the second quarter to 9.2 million square feet in the third quarter, an 18% increased. In Silicon Valley, demand increased to 9.4 million square feet from 8.2 million square feet in the second quarter, a 15% increase.</p><p>Seattle increased about 25% to 30% third over second quarter. With a strong market conditions, we made solid progress during the quarter. We wrote newer renewing leases on 385,000 square feet of space in our stabilized portfolio, putting us just over 1 million square feet year-to-date. We are now 95.6% occupied and 97.2% leased. Rents in our third quarter leases were up 39% on a cash basis and 53% on a GAAP basis.</p><p>We also have approximately 400,000 square feet of letters of intent outstanding in our core portfolio. On an adjusted basis, we produced a year-over-year increase in cash same-store NOI of 5.4%. We delivered 100,000 square feet of office space to NeueHouse at our Columbia Square mixed-use project in Hollywood. We completed the acquisition of 100 Hooper Street, the last fully entitled shovel-ready development site in San Francisco for $78 million. We effectively settled all remaining outstanding issues with our surrounding neighbors regarding the development of our One Paseo mixed-use project in Del Mar and are moving ahead on entitlement and design.</p><p>We completed the sale of six non-strategic properties in San Diego for gross proceeds of $163 million. We completed the sale of $250 million of equity to help fund our current development program and we issued $400 million of 10-year bonds to replace maturing debt, and maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. We also continued to make progress on our development program. In addition to delivering the historic office space at Columbia Square last quarter to NeueHouse, we completed and delivered the first building at our Crossing/900 projects earlier this month. We expect to complete and deliver the second building in early November. The two building 339,000 square foot office property located in downtown Redwood City in the heart of Silicon Valley is fully leased to Box.</p><p>We commenced construction, just two months ago, on our Exchange at 16th project, our 700,000 square foot development project in Mission Bay. We are in negotiations and have significant interest from a variety of tenant prospects both tech and non-tech. Of the roughly 2 million square feet plus of interest for this facility, approximately 60% is non-tech. And I might add that the demand numbers I gave you on San Francisco don't reflect a shadow pipeline where we've signed NDAs with several people that represent millions of square feet beyond that nine-point-some-odd-million square feet of current demand. So we think things are shaping up very nicely for the Exchange.</p><p>So we anticipate and we're confident that The Exchange will be substantially leased well before completion of construction, which is not scheduled until the third quarter of 2017. And earlier this month, cash rent commenced on Phase 1 at our 350 Mission Street project, The 450,000 square foot SOMA office tower is fully leased to Salesforce. Tyler will discuss revenue recognition later in the call.</p><p>With regard to our near-term development pipeline, our four projects remained extremely well positioned for potential starts next year. First is, 100 Hooper Street. As we have previously discussed, we can start construction at any time, but we'll likely wait until we have executed a significant portion of the leasing on The Exchange or on Hooper itself before we break ground. Since acquiring the site three months ago, we are in early stage discussions with a handful of both tech and non-tech prospects, any one of which could take substantial space in or a majority of the project.</p><p>Second is One Paseo in Del Mar, our mixed-use development project that will bring much needed contemporary office, residential and retail space to the very affluent neighborhood of Del Mar. We made significant strides this year with our neighbors and community groups to settle all the issues and let's move forward on the approval process and we anticipate being able to start construction mid next year of one or more phases depending on market conditions.</p><p>Finally, the near-term pipeline includes the Academy in Hollywood and 333 Dexter in South Lake Union, both projects located in strong and vibrant markets. We expect to have final approvals on both projects by the end of the second quarter. Taken as a whole, these four projects represent a near-term development pipeline with a preliminary estimated investment of approximately $1.5 billion.</p><p>Looking further out, we continue to make progress on expanding and designing a world-class destination at the Flower Mart in San Francisco. We recently completed the acquisition of a 0.5 acre site to add to our development plans, Subject to final entitlements and market conditions, we expect to commence construction in approximately two years and estimate the total investment to be slightly over $1 billion, including land.</p><p>In total, our overall development pipeline acquired at a very attractive basis provides a tremendous opportunity to create value over the next several years. Each project is distinctly situated in highly desirable sub-markets that provide the infrastructure we seek, including public transportation, retail, residential and entertainment amenities, as well as communities that embrace historical or iconic elements.</p><p>Turning to dispositions, through the end of the third quarter, we completed the sale of 10 buildings encompassing more than 1 million square feet of space in a land site in Orange County for total gross proceeds of $335 million. That puts us at the high-end of our projected dispositions for the year. But with investors showing strong ongoing interest in acquiring commercial real estate and the continued disconnect between public and private valuations, we continue to look at additional opportunities to sell non-strategic assets and recycle the capital into higher value creating opportunities.</p><p>We are currently working on another relatively large disposition transaction that will likely close in the first quarter and expect to have more details to share on this front on our next call. More broadly, as I said earlier, the fundamentals across our markets remain strong. We believe the markets we operate in are uniquely attractive to growing companies given their access to talent, public transportation and cultural and lifestyle benefits that appeal to a generational force.</p><p>We are taking nothing for granted and are [sober] with regard to the cyclicality of our business. We've operated in West Coast markets for more than 65 years through multiple cycles. And our track record as a public company shows that we develop when it makes sense, we acquire when it makes sense and we just manage our core portfolio when that makes the most sense. We will continue to operate with this investment strategy. On the operational front, we remain focused on our top priorities of leasing, capturing in better rent growth, on-time and on-budget construction, and financial strength.</p><p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for a review of our markets. Jeff?</p><p>JEFF HAWKEN, EVP &amp; COO, KILROY REALTY CORP: Thanks, John. Hello, everyone. Economic conditions across all of our markets remained strong. California continues to add jobs at a robust rate and forecasters now project the state's job and GDP growth will consistently outpace the US through at least 2017. A similar story is unfolding in the Greater Seattle area, where unemployment has now hit an eight-year low and job-creation continues at a rapid clip.</p><p>Let's take a look at the real estate fundamentals in each of our markets, starting with San Francisco. San Francisco Bay Area continues to outperform most other US markets with strong demand and a limited supply of large blocks of commercial space. Sublease space declined in the quarter to 1.2 million square feet or 1.6% of the market, down from 1.6 million square feet in June or 2.1% of the market. Class A direct vacancy remains effectively at 0% in the SOMA district and 8.4% in the South Financial district.</p><p>Silicon Valley had a very strong third quarter with over 1.6 million square feet of absorption. Tech expansion has driven Class A vacancy rates in the region, excluding San Jose down to 3.6%, the lowest in almost a decade. We are currently 98.6% leased in the Bay Area and our in-place rents for the region are approximately 32% below market. In greater Seattle, strong demand has pushed asking rents to their highest level in almost a decade. In our primary Seattle submarkets of Bellevue and South Lake Union, Class A direct vacancy rates are now at both 5.6%. In Downtown Bellevue, Salesforce recently announced it would double its workforce and triple the amount of its leased office space.</p><p>Our Seattle portfolio is currently 97.4% leased and our in-place rents are approximately 10% below market. In our San Diego markets, steady business expansion coupled with limited amounts of new commercial office space continue to drive rental rates higher. There have been 11 new Class A leasing transactions greater than 20,000 square feet in 2015, after only three in 2014. In our Del Mar and Sorrento Mesa submarkets, Class A direct vacancy rates are now 9.4% and 5.8% respectively.</p><p>Our San Diego portfolio is currently 97.4% leased. Our San Diego in place rents are approximately 7% above market. We are seeing strong rent growth in Los Angeles, particularly in markets attractive to creative services, entertainment like Santa Monica, West LA, Beverly Hills and Hollywood. In West LA, the Class A direct vacancy rate is 11.6% and in Hollywood it is 5.1%.</p><p>Across our Los Angeles portfolio, we are now 95.4% leased. Our in-place rents here are approximately 16% below market. Looking at our overall portfolio, we now estimate that our rents are roughly 15% below market. Remaining 2015 expirations total approximately 276,000 square feet with 200,000 square feet now expected to be vacated. This includes Qualcomm's recent announcement they would not be renewing their 68,000 square feet with us in Sorrento Mesa. That's an update on our markets. Now Tyler will cover our financial results in more detail. Tyler?</p><p>TYLER ROSE: Thanks, Jeff. FFO was $0.77 a share in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with stabilized occupancy at 95.6%, down from 96.7% at the end of the second quarter. As we previewed on earlier calls, our occupancy dipped in the third quarter due to lease rollovers in several of our markets. Most of this space has now been re-leased.</p><p>Same store NOI was up 5.4% on a cash basis and 3.6% on a GAAP basis in the third quarter, after adjusting for 2014 lease termination fee. We were active in the capital markets during the quarter. In July, we completed the registered direct placement of just under 3.8 million common shares for proceeds of approximately $250 million and in September, we sold $400 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes in a public offering at an annual interest rate of 4.375%.</p><p>The funds from these transactions were used to fund the $78 million acquisition of Hooper Street and the repayment of two maturing mortgages totaling $90 million. We will also pay off $325 million of maturing bonds next week and use the remaining proceeds to fund development spending. Taking all these transactions into account, we will have a $100 million of unrestricted cash after the payoff of the bond and full availability on our $600 million bank line, which is expandable to $900 million</p><p>Now let's discuss updated guidance for 2015. To begin, let me remind you that we approach our near-term performance forecasting with a high degree of caution. Given all the uncertainties in today's economy, our internal forecasting guidance reflect the information and market intelligence as we know it today and each and every shift in the economy, our market tenant demand, construction cost and new office supply going forward could have a meaningful impact on results in a way that's not currently reflected in our analysis. Projected revenue recognition days for new developments are subject to several factors that we can't control, including the timing of tenant occupancy.</p><p>With those caveats, our assumptions for the remainder of 2015 are as follows. As always, we don't forecast any potential acquisitions or acquisition-related expenses. We anticipate remaining 2015 development spending on our seven projects under construction to be approximately $150 million. On the development delivery front, as John mentioned, we delivered the first building at Crossing/900 in Redwood City in October and we expect to deliver the second building in November.</p><p>While we had anticipated that we would recognize revenue on our 350 Mission Street property in the fourth quarter, given tenant delays in completing TI work, we now anticipate revenue recognition to commence in phases starting in January with stabilization expected in the second quarter. The change of timing has no impact on cash rents as Salesforce began paying rent on about 20% of the building earlier this month.</p><p>Our core portfolio assumptions are follows. Given our continued strong same-store performance, we are increasing our projected 2015 GAAP same-store NOI growth to a range of 3.5% to 4% on an adjusted basis. We are lowering our projected year-end occupancy to approximately 94% driven by Qualcomm's decision not to renew 68,000 square feet in Sorrento Mesa.</p><p>We expect occupancy to be back up to approximately 95% by the end of the first quarter and we now project 2015 FAD payout ratio of approximately 70%. To sum up, last quarter, we provided 2015 FFO per share guidance of $3.30 to $3.40, increasing our mid-point $0.03 to $3.35. This quarter, given the stronger project revenues of roughly $0.04, partially offset by delayed revenue recognition totaling $0.015 of 350 Mission, we are again, increasing the midpoint of our 2015 FFO guidance by $0.03 to $3.38 per share and tightening our range to $3.36 to $3.40 per share. That's the latest news from KRC.</p><p>Now, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) John Kim, BMO Capital Markets.</p><p>JOHN KIM, ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS: Thank you. Good morning. It looks like you have an additional $945 million of funding remaining on your current and near-term development pipeline spread out over a few years. Will the expected asset sale proceeds next year be enough to fund your commitments next year on a leverage-neutral basis?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, it depends on how much we sell of course, but let me - I'll give you a range. We sold $400 million on round numbers this year. We already have about two-thirds of that in the bag for early next year and I think we'll increase that substantially. It could be the number of multiples of that. So I think we're going to do just fine on our funding.</p><p>TYLER ROSE: This is Tyler. On the comment on leverage neutral, as you know, our leverage is very low, debt to market cap is in the mid 20s; debt-to-total assets it's probably 30-odd; debt-to-EBITDA is now down to -- at the end of the year into the low mid-sixes. So we have that capacity as well.</p><p>JOHN KIM: John, on the large disposition that you referenced, can you provide any commentary on what market it's in and whether not it's a developed asset or an asset you acquired?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: I choose not to do that. We have a confidentiality agreement with these people that doesn't really allow us to talk about it. So I've got to honor that. But we signed purchases and sale agreement, they're just completing their due diligence and I'm very comfortable with the transaction.</p><p>JOHN KIM: Okay and on the tenant improvement costs. It looks like they were above where they were last year. Is this a function of more San Diego space expiring this year and are you surprised by the stickiness of tenant incentive?</p><p>JEFF HAWKEN: Yes I don't think there is anything that's really driving that. I think it's just a function of what properties got for leasing and what the market is and the tenant requirements. So there is nothing really a trend or anything that's sort of, year-over-year that's driving that other than the specific tenant improvements of any given building.</p><p>JOHN KIM: So, the rental levels are increasing, you're getting higher releasing spreads, but the TI is still pretty high.</p><p>JEFF HAWKEN: Yes, I think, generally speaking again it's based on each particular space, but again, you're seeing really good spreads on the rents and I think tenant improvements concessions are certainly down in terms of free rent pretty much across our markets. So it's really just a function of tenant improvements.</p><p>JOHN KIM: Okay, and then my final question is on NeueHouse and if you can provide any commentary on how they are operating as far as their own occupancies and if you have any appetite to expand with them in other markets.</p><p>DAVID SIMON, EVP, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, KILROY REALTY CORP: I could take that. So they are open and operating in Hollywood and they have a very deliberate pace on how the membership works there. Hitting or meeting their expectations and coming in and they had a huge lineup of potential membership prior to even openings. So the space is great. They're off and running to a great start in our Hollywood project.</p><p>JOHN KILROY: In terms of the other part of expanding into the other markets, they'd like to expand with us in other markets and we're going to look at each of those individually, see what makes sense.</p><p>JOHN KIM: Got it, thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Craig Mailman, KeyBanc.</p><p>CRAIG MAILMAN, ANALYST, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS: John, your comments were helpful and your views on San Francisco here, but I'm just curious, as you guys look to lease up Exchange at 16th and get interest on the 100 Hooper, is your underwriting of tenant credit changing at all or are you guys trying to maybe fill it up with more non-tech type tenants [this go] around?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, again, we have a bunch of NDAs on that property with just about every tenant we deal with now the substance requires you to sign an NDA. So we can't really disclose who they are, but the tenants that we're working with and there are several of them. Of the 1.2 million square feet to 1.3 million square feet that's non-tech, all of those transactions are very, very long lease-terms with extremely high credit. And it is our goal to make those transactions. And I think we will. I'm very comfortable we're going to make -- we can't make all of them because we don't have enough square footage. But I will say this, non-tech tenants take a lot longer than tech tenants to get deals done with.</p><p>CRAIG MAILMAN: I guess, but the way you are looking at tech credit these days, are you guys scrutinizing it more or less than six to 12 months ago.</p><p>JOHN KILROY: I think we're very thorough in scrutinizing tech credit six months ago and a year ago and two years ago. If you look at some of the tech tenants that were smaller, we had massive letters of credit. And we had great comfort that the buildings, because the buildings were designed by us for unknown tenants as supposed to design specifically for a singular tenants. So we felt very comfortable that we had assets that would perform well.</p><p>There was a pickup with the tenant and we had tremendous credit support. So our underwriting, I think, has been very thorough throughout this cycle. We have not done deals with some of the tenants that we thought didn't have great credit, where we had the opportunity and we will continue to show a lot of scrutiny with regard to our financial review of our customers, whether they are tech or non-tech.</p><p>CRAIG MAILMAN: That's helpful. Then, I guess as you guys walk the space these days, particularly on the tech-side, what does the utilization look like?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: They're just packed in. I mean, Rob, you want to comment, I mean you meet with all of our tech tenants and all of our tech prospects as well as non-tech on a regular basis?</p><p>ROB PARATTE, EVP, LEASING &amp; BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, KILROY REALTY CORP: Sure. Good morning, everybody. We do meet as John said, on a regular basis with all of our tenants as well as prospects and these are well established national and multinational companies and they have very deep real estate teams that do nothing but study headcount, and as John said earlier at The Exchange, with a couple of the tenants we're talking to, it's not going to be a quick decision, just the snap of a finger to take 0.5 million square feet as an example.</p><p>So I think caution has actually been exercised by these companies from 2012 on. It's not a new phenomenon. In terms of them acting in a more pragmatic and slow method and I do feel that they are busting at the scenes with all the planning and all the staff they put in, they've been undershooting the space needs they have. So in the example here in San Francisco that are well known, there are lot of companies that signed leases in June that are now looking for more space.</p><p>And one other point I'd like to make is that we're talking to several companies that are having needs that are 2016 needs, that they are literally I would say scrambling to try and fill now space needs. Once they get those buttoned down, those needs, they have new needs rolling into 2017 and 2018 that are significant.</p><p>CRAIG MAILMAN: And then just lastly, could you guys just run through your mark-to-market expectations by market?</p><p>TYLER ROSE: I think I can do that. So Jeff went through that in his comments I think, we're 15% under market as a portfolio, San Francisco is 32%-plus under marketed, Washington is about 10% under market, LA about 16% under market; San Diego is about 7% over market.</p><p>OPERATOR: Vance Edelson, Morgan Stanley.</p><p>VANCE EDELSON, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Great, thanks. So, John, you did a great job addressing the tech question upfront. One of the more positive things we're hearing is that if VCs are less active, it's only because other investors are nudging them out with hedge funds and others now, trying to invest earlier before the IPO. For example, which would be a good thing for leasing demand if funding sources are growing more and diverse.</p><p>Have you heard anything about how some of your newer early stage tenants are getting funded these days? Do you still primarily here about VC money backing them or are there any signs that it's getting more diverse?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, I'm certainly not an expert on that and I will say this, we have tenants in our buildings like Capital One, which look exactly like a tech company that took two floors at 201, 3rd Street and there in San Francisco, looking like tech companies because they're funding tech companies. So you have the banks in it in a big way now and you have the VCs obviously in it in a big way historically and then you have some of the big tech entrepreneurs that are the household names that have made billions, that are funding other tech companies and going around the VCs. They are, in essence, being their own VC I suppose. So the funding sources seem to be increasing.</p><p>And I just want to point out something here because frankly, I'm a little frustrated with some of the articles that have been written by some of the people that are probably on this telephone call. I understand that we've had five years of terrific growth in San Francisco and Silicon Valley and four years or so in Seattle with the tech-sector. But there are other sectors that are growing tremendously. I wish I could tell you what I know, but I can't find one sector because we have NDAs (inaudible).</p><p>But I think that what we're seeing here is, it seems like there is some hiccups when Twitter said they're going to not proceed with 100,000 foot lease and lay-off 300 people or something or Zynga, a year ago when they have had their problems and it's a bad business model, I suppose for them. These are the natural hiccups that we're going to see. But if everybody and every single tech company have to be doing terrific for people to write positive articles, then by definition, you can't always have a positive article.</p><p>The reality is, I have never seen a market nor have the brokers that I talk to or the people I work with here that have long time been in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, never seen markets stronger than they are today; never seen demand greater than they are today; never seen a supply imbalance greater than it is today, on the positive side, meaning lack of supply.</p><p>There are two major things that are going on. There is a revolution in technology, if this was the Industrial Revolution, it'd 1900. Think about the disruption that's going on, I think Marc Andreessen, the famous VC investor said it very well several months ago, new technologies are devouring entire industries. It's happening at all different levels, Cyber Security, Medicine and Technology, which is in its infancy, Technology and Media, Active wear and wearable's, Fin-Tech meaning financial tech, which is in part to your issue about financing is that major financial institutions, banks and so forth are buying these start-up financial to entrepreneurs that are in the technology side, because they can't develop this creativity themselves.</p><p>That is exploding, in automobiles, driverless cars and in movies, in entertainment, in energy; almost every industry is transformed or will be by technology and we are in the early stages of it. And with that, we are going to have some volatility. I think the way I would characterize it is, we're going to have tremendous growth over the next several years and for many decades, but it will be punctuated at times with some volatility because we're not going to see every company or start-ups go to the moon. And you can tell that I'm frustrated, most of you know me for a long time, I have never seen such a disconnect with what's being written by some and what's going on the ground. And I care more about what's going on in the ground</p><p>VANCE EDELSON: And then just shifting gears for Tyler, the G&amp;A line dipped a noticeable amount, anything unusual there? Or is that a decent run rate going forward?</p><p>TYLER ROSE: Most of that's related to our deferred compensation mark-to-market, so $1 million of that is showing up as a reduction in other income. So it doesn't have any impact on the bottom line of FFO. So G&amp;A is down but the other income is down by roughly $1 million of that and it is a little bit of other things in G&amp;A that was -- the G&amp;A was down, but most of that is related to the deferred comp.</p><p>VANCE EDELSON: And then last one from me, back to some of John's comments earlier, you alluded to the private demand remaining strong. Can you give us any more color on foreign capital flows and the interest in your properties? Would you say it's getting any more or less active with foreign capital looking for a home and is there any movement in cap rates worth mentioning?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: I think to the first part of the question, I have never had more people come into this office that are foreign sources of capital as I have in the last six months, never. Not in the rest of my life up until that time. Everybody wants to be in these markets and then if you take a look at the couple of deals that were just done, the most recent transactions of substance were the Twitter buildings, which went for roughly $970 a square foot and the Airbnb building, which we for about the same.</p><p>And I think if you apply those cap rates and those IRR projections to our buildings -- to most of our buildings which were rented at higher rents, you would have value substantially in excess of that. There is a wall of money trying to buy both foreigners and others in this city and elsewhere. And again, I've never seen it to this magnitude.</p><p>OPERATOR: Manny Coachman, Citi.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Good morning. This is Michael Bilerman. John, maybe just teeing off of that and you talked about this disconnect between public and private market values and I'm just curious where your view is, with your stock where it is today relative to the private market value of your portfolio?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, if you were to apply market values to -- you're not going to have the same cap rate applied to things in San Diego, if you are to things in San Francisco, Silicon Valley. I think, LA is demonstrating very low cap rates. There is just the dearth of product that's available down there. I'm actually frankly surprised with some of the valuations in LA given where the market is on rental rates and so forth. But yeah, I think the value is substantially higher than the market is valuing the Company today, but I am very confident that we will demonstrate some tremendous leasing here on some of the properties that we just started construction on, at blockbuster rates with blockbuster companies.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: And then, how do you balance and I recognize it is a balance, but raising equity at [66] if your belief is that the value of your assets is that dramatically above that selling equity in your Company, arguably at a big discount and taking that dilution, obviously you're using it to fund accretive development. But just walk us through the thought process of doing that, when you're so confident in the asset values and selling assets?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, you're talking about the $250 million we did earlier this year?</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: Yes</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Yes, I mean just take a look at it. We're building to roughly 8% -- going at plus or minus 8% going in ROCs. So I think that the use of the proceeds speaks for itself.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: And I also appreciate all your commentary regarding San Francisco. Outside of research analysts reports that you're talking about, where else do you hear, I mean it have to be emanating from somewhere, I don't agree (multiple speaker)?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, Michael look what's going on, the hedges play the techs and then the play the companies, the real estate companies that are public that do business with the techs. We all know what's going on. Hedge fund industry is out of control in my view. It ought to be regulated, I'm not a big regulation guy but I'm talking about primarily about some of the analyst reports, which I don't think had been very thoughtful. I won't name names.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: As long as it is not ours, do you have any -- I mean you think about the affordability from a rental perspective residential side in San Francisco, clearly that's getting a lot of airtime in terms of people living [what's going on] at Oakland, right and Uber going over there and trying to attract employees. I mean, does it give you any concern at all in terms of the price of entry to attract talent and that talent being pushed out of San Francisco and that potentially affecting the residential market, affecting the office market.</p><p>JOHN KILROY: You know there are things called roads and ferries and BART and Caltrain and that's how people get to work. The lion's share of people that work at San Francisco don't live in San Francisco and the transportation and housing is a regional issue in just about every city in the world, certainly here in the Bay Area. You can't deliver enough houses in San Francisco over the next 10 years to satisfy the number of people that wanted to live here. It's always going to be expensive to live here.</p><p>But what you're seeing is a tremendous number of apartments being built in the city. You're seeing a tremendous number of apartments being built in Oakland. You're seeing them being built in other another areas and people will commute via the transportation systems. That's why we've been such an advocate over the last six years of projects that are near public transportation. These cities don't want cars. They want you to use public transportation and it's sort of a chicken and egg.</p><p>You have to have public outcries that we need better public transportation in order to get people to pay for the bonds and so forth that finances it. Here in San Francisco, they're talking about additional -- they've been acting on it. They got trans-bay terminal under construction; they've got the Central SoMa Subway that will connect BART and Caltrain that will start construction here shortly; they're talking about more BART tubes. Transportation always lags, but housing is generally going to be at the end of those transportation terminals. The city of San Francisco does not have the land area to build everything it needs to build.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: Yes and last quick one. Are you changing your underwriting at all in terms of underwriting tech-tenants or other tenants either upfront deposit or any prepaid rent, has anything changed in your calculus as you are renting space?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, I answered this question to somebody earlier in this call. We've always been try scrutinize -- show a lot of scrutiny and a lot of due diligence and we go through amazing amount of due diligence in underwriting with their CFOs and if there is venture capitals with them and we get huge letters of credit and we make sure that we have rents that are no higher than market and that we have product that is not specific to any one tenant. So I'm not going to say that we're harder on people than we were before, because we've always been pretty hard on tenants.</p><p>OPERATOR: Brendan Maiorana, Wells Fargo Securities.</p><p>BRENDAN MAIORANA, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES: Thanks, good morning out there. Question, I guess, probably for John or Mike Sanford. So, I always felt like in the San Francisco market there was some risk that some of the early stage tech companies, the funding model slows down a little bit, maybe they don't grow as aggressively, but the opportunity for the city in terms of a tenancy seem like it was from the large tech companies that are in the Valley that don't have a big presence in the city. Are you seeing much migration of those tenants into San Francisco that are looking around more now than maybe they have been there in the past?</p><p>MIKE SANFORD, EVP, NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, KILROY REALTY CORP: Yes, hi it's Mike Sanford. Good morning. We definitely have been seeing migration from the Valley into San Francisco. It's all of the things that John and others have been talking about for years. Folks want to be in the city, especially the millennial workers live here in an urban environment. But I think what's really compelling about the statistics is not only is San Francisco extremely strong, this is the fifth year in a row of over 1 million square foot of absorption. It's not a one hit wonder; it's been consistent year-over-year.</p><p>But I think what adds to that is the fact that the Valley is also extremely strong. 1.6 million square feet of absorption in this quarter, which is more than San Francisco for the entire year. The vacancy rates down there, as you heard earlier in the call, excluding San Jose, under 4%. All of the key markets we're in are near 0% to 1% vacancy from a Class A standpoint.</p><p>And what you're seeing is a classic demand and supply imbalance. You heard us talk about the stats, how many tenants looking for over 100,000 square feet, how little supply there is. But those numbers are only sort of part of the story. There is actually more demand than that's being reported, as John discussed. We know tenants that are in the markets that aren't on those lists.</p><p>On the flip side, there is actually a less supply. So a lot of the tenants that are absorbing this space are mostly going to Class A space and leaving space that is practically functionally obsolete for today's users. So the numbers are even better than what we're seeing in the statistics and that strength in both sectors of the Bay Area is the foundation for growth for the future.</p><p>BRENDAN MAIORANA: And Mike, maybe just, as you are looking at rent growth on a forward basis maybe over the next year or so, kind of what do you think -- what are kind of the best expectations of forward rent growth and how does that compare to maybe where it's been over the past year or two?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well just before Mike does that, I want to make it real clear that our underwriting on The Exchange, our underwriting on 100 Hooper, our underwriting on the future Flower Mart has all been done at rates lower than what is currently in the market today. We are very conservative in our underwriting. Lots of contingencies, lots of expectation and generally we've been way over estimating what cost increases might be and so forth, but Mike go ahead.</p><p>MIKE SANFORD: Yes, so historically we've been seeing double digit rent growth both in the Valley and San Francisco and if you look at what we've seen year-to-date, you're on pace for over 10%, again that 10% to 15% range in both markets.</p><p>As John said, we're more conservative as we project out and looking at rent growth when we underwrite. But I think the other important point to note is even though rents now are roughly at where they were during the 2000-cycle there is so much more density in the spaces today, right. John talked about this for years and so from a cost per employee perspective, rents are actually down. And I think that's an important characteristic to remember when you see rental rates on a per square foot basis today. There has been sort of a paradigm shift in how people are using space and they're using it more densely and we're providing the building the service in exiting and the like and the elevator so and so forth to support that density.</p><p>BRENDAN MAIORANA: Okay. That's great. And then just last one maybe for Jeff or Tyler. So you guys mentioned that year-end occupancy down to 94% because of Qualcomm. I think it was 94.5% last quarter. Where were some of the -- given that you are around 95.5% now, where were some of the other tenants that were expected to roll to drive occupancy down by year-end given that your lease rate is substantially higher than that?</p><p>JEFF HAWKEN: Yes, well from the second to third quarter, the rollover there was split fairly evenly, about a third in San Francisco, third in Seattle and third in LA approximately. From third to fourth quarter, most of it is in San Diego. I think there is a 160,000 feet and a 130,000 feet of that's in San Diego and 30,000 feet of its in Seattle.</p><p>OPERATOR: Nick Yulico, UBS.</p><p>NICK YULICO, ANALYST, UBS: Thanks. Just going back to the exchange development, can you talk some more about why you guys went with the optionality of doing I think 50-50 office, life science for the project and going back to over a million tenants that were non-tech that you said that are looking at Exchange, are life science tenants considered non tech?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: We're not talking any life science tenants right now. I mean we've had discussions but that's not in my calculus of square footage that we talked about. With regard to our decision, what we did is we wanted to make sure we had the height floor to floor and that we had the structural capacity to handle a broad range of tenants, whether it's life science or whether it's something else.</p><p>And so we made that decision to incorporate that into the building. We thought that was a good long-term investment because we always look and we're building buildings at locations that are irreplaceable that are world class design and that are LEED platinum and the best in class and we look at these as assets that we get on for the next 100 years. They are certainly going to perform well whether we own or if somebody else for hundreds of years, not for 20 years. So we are a lot different than the merchant builder that simply looks at how do you build it? Kind of get away with it as cheaply as you can, lease it and flip it. We're the absolute opposite.</p><p>NICK YULICO: Okay, so at the end of the day, I mean, do you envision half of that project being life science or is it (multiple speakers).</p><p>JOHN KILROY: No, I said no.</p><p>NICK YULICO: Okay. And then I think Ross had a follow up question.</p><p>ROSS NUSSBAUM, ANALYST, UBS: Hey John, Can you talk a little bit about One Paseo, let's get out San Fran and go south. You got a $178 million in there. I went back in your supplemental from 2011. You had a $120 million into the project four years ago. So I guess the question is having, watched $58 million go in over the last four years. Reasonably speaking, what should we all be expecting for a return given the pretty serious carry cost there?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Yes we're forecasting in the high six percentile or high 6s and we may do better than that. That's [on stabilized] ROC unlevered and remember, about half of that is apartments.</p><p>ROSS NUSSBAUM: And is that on kind of current rent? Are you making any assumptions that market rents are going to keep going up by the time you deliver?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: I believe it's on current rents. David?</p><p>DAVID SIMON: Yes, the office is on current rents. The retail product that we'll be developing will be pretty unique down there. So we feel pretty good about the attractiveness of that and a lot of interest in that and the apartments are on current market rents.</p><p>ROSS NUSSBAUM: And at this point in time, are you going to do the whole thing on your own or are you going to JV any of it?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: We haven't decided.</p><p>OPERATOR: David Rodgers, Robert W. Baird.</p><p>DAVID RODGERS, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD: Yes, morning guys. Jeff, first question for you or maybe Tyler but with regard to the 160 basis point, I think, differential between lease and occupied, any meaningful kind of chunks of new leasing that we should expect to kind of come in through those numbers and kind of timing on that, if you can give us that?</p><p>JEFF HAWKEN: Well, as I mention I think, we expect most of that re-leasing will come in by the fourth quarter but most of it is in the first quarter, so by the end of the first quarter we're projecting to be back in 95% and some of that's in San Francisco (inaudible) and one third in Seattle.</p><p>DAVID RODGERS: Okay, that makes sense. And then, with regard to the kind of tenant reimbursements in the quarter, they seem to be a little bit lower off this quarter. Is there anything unusual or unique in that that we should be thinking about?</p><p>JEFF HAWKEN: No, I think it will revert back in the fourth quarter. There were some basic resets, some [camp abatements] prior year refunds that came through in the third quarter that caused reimbursements to be a little bit lower but also expenses were a little bit lower. So if anything - our numbers were at $0.77, it would have been even better than that if it wasn't for some of those factors. But we'll be back to normal. We project to be back to normal next quarter.</p><p>DAVID RODGERS: Okay. And then, John maybe a question for you on 350 Mission, I think you said that the move in was a little bit slower there. Was that just a build out issue and I guess just on a broader question, are you still seeing a pretty good take up of space as you are completing either tenant space through developments, re-development or just through second-gen leasing. There is a pace at which tenants are kind of filling that space up and I guess should we make any co-relation from the 350 Mission slowdown?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: No, 350 Mission is because they changed who was going to occupy the building. You now have the senior management at -- the Chairman and President and all that stuff taking the top three floors and they've hired a different architect than the one they were using before and have slowed it down.</p><p>OPERATOR: Jamie Feldman, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p><p>JAMIE FELDMAN, ANALYST, BANK OF AMERICA/MERRILL LYNCH: Great, thank you. Can we focus on 333 Dexter for a moment and just talk about progress on the project and then maybe the leasing pipeline?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well in terms of the progress, we've gone through the initial steps for the City and submitting and so forth and we're on line to receive approval. I believe it's right around the end of the first quarter of next year or early the second quarter. So we are confident, they love our design and in terms of re-leasing and so forth, Rob, you want to handle that?</p><p>ROB PARATTE: Sure. As with any ground up development that we do, we have a pretty robust pre-leasing and marketing program that we've started already. We will have and you guys will probably see them in different presentations, upgraded videos and that type of thing that we're doing overtime, anticipating a second quarter construction start. And in terms of marketing, I would say the thing that's really most interesting about it is the level of interest that we're getting from companies outside of the Seattle market in the project and it's also been very well received just in terms of design and some other attributes which I don't want to get into giving our secrets away, but we have local interest as well as outside of Seattle interest in the project already.</p><p>JOHN KILROY: We just hired the broker last month.</p><p>JAMIE FELDMAN: Okay. And do you think it will be more of life science or office and what do you think about the relative returns of both?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: I think it's going to be all office and I think it's going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of what we've been achieving down here in San Francisco which is in that sort of high 7% to low 8% initial ROC.</p><p>JAMIE FELDMAN: Okay. And then did you give an update on The Heights at Del Mar in terms of leasing progress?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: No, we didn't. David, you want to do that or Rob.</p><p>ROB PARATTE: Sure. We're really pleased. We're virtually closed in now at the property. It's unbelievable in terms of the landscaping and amenities that we've finished there. We have active discussions with about 200,000 feet of tenants, some are -- a couple of them actually are looking at the whole building and the rest are multi-tenant and we expect to have some success to announce there soon. But again, Del Mar is the best submarket in that San Diego County area and I think it's an amenity driven market and what we're providing is just leagues above what I think you find in UTC and some of the more dense urban parts of San Diego.</p><p>JAMIE FELDMAN: Okay, so assuming you get leasing done, I assume it comes online not leased or not occupied, like when do you think it will actually --</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Yes, our pro forma was that it would lease up -- it's not really a pre-leased market there. So our pro forma has always been that it would lease up in the year after the Shell is complete and the Shell is going to be complete, I think it's early in the first quarter.</p><p>JAMIE FELDMAN: Okay. And then finally, the demand pipeline for exchange, do you think it will be more single tenant or a multi-tenant?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well that's interesting because again I wish I could share with you, but I can't share with you because we're tied up in non-disclosure agreements. But we have multiple major organizations that want either substantial portions like half or so or all of it. And any one of which we would be delighted to have as our tenants and you would be delighted to see us have as our tenant. And we are talking about long, long, long term leases.</p><p>JAMIE FELDMAN: And some of the color we're getting from the market is that those kind of tenants don't like to share and want their own branding. Can you get that in that building?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: I'm not going to comment on that. I'm very comfortable whether we go multi tenant. Look at this way, Jamie, we could fill that building up with 100,000 square foot tenants, we could have done it already, but the ones that we are talking to, the credit profile is so terrific that it becomes an incredible bond.</p><p>OPERATOR: Jed Reagan, Green Street Advisors.</p><p>JED REAGAN, ANALYST, GREEN STREET ADVISORS: Hey good morning guys. Do you have a pipeline of new acquisition and developments projects out there that you're actually chasing? Do you still feel like there is attractive opportunities out there today or do you feel like you've got enough on your plate at the moment.</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well on the development side, at the fringe little pieces that are next to existing development parcels or whatever are always [venturous] to us. We look at everything. In terms of acquiring existing buildings it's going to be something that we can fix and create additional value just buying at today's cap rates isn't particularly exciting to us.</p><p>JED REAGAN: Okay. And just on Southern California, couple of quick ones. What are your thoughts on Orange County as a Kilroy market these days? Now the area is showing a lot of good job and rent growth and you've got just the one building down there. So just curious how you are thinking about that these days?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: We look at everything. We haven't found anything that we like, that we felt was appropriately priced for what our metrics would want to be, but we look at everything.</p><p>JED REAGAN: So that's a market you could see yourself being in longer term?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Possibly.</p><p>JED REAGAN: Okay. And then I guess related to that there has been some press on downtown San Diego catching some momentum and just wondering if you are getting more constructive in that area and maybe do a little more there overtime and then how about thoughts on downtown LA at this point?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Downtown LA we look at -- we hear a lot of hype, but when we go through the numbers its trading tenants. That doesn't mean there won't' be the occasional building that does a terrific job because it's unique or whatever. But look at a lot of stuff, we haven't seen anything that we would want to act on in term of San Diego, it's true, Downtown and some of the areas has gained some momentum and we're looking at things but again we are looking at it, we haven't had anything that we've come close to pulling the trigger on.</p><p>And to your earlier question about what are we looking at in terms of acquisitions or what is our appetite for acquisitions or development? We do have a couple of major development things that we're talking about. And again, we have NDAs with major companies in connection with what would be basically buildings that we would build for them that would be buildings, Kilroy type buildings and those could be very substantive, but nothing to report at this point.</p><p>JED REAGAN: Across a range of markets or focused on one market?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Let's call it the Bay area and the Greater Seattle market. And then of course within our development things, we're having very good discussions, early discussions on the academy which we should have entitled in the first or second quarter of next year. We have somebody that's interested in all of the office space there, which I think David, the office breakdown of that project is about 270,000, 280,000 square feet, isn't that correct?</p><p>DAVID SIMON: Yes. That's correct.</p><p>JOHN KILROY: So, again it's early stages Jed, but it's encouraging because that market has become a market of great demand and the rents and so forth have gone way up and we're just really pleased that we got in there earlier than most.</p><p>JED REAGAN: And do you feel like the depth there and sort of breadth of that could be to sustain another million plus, 2 million square feet of new development over the next three to five years?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, it about 6 million square feet of demand in the Greater Hollywood market and Rob, it's something like 20%, 25% of that is growth, meaning new demand for the market. And with the type of tenants that we're seeing and talking with, they want to have the environment that has vibrancy, the Kilroy kind of project which is in that market, it's the restaurants and the outdoor areas and the rooftop decks and all that sort of stuff because that's very appealing to the kinds of consolidations that these companies are endeavoring to make.</p><p>Yes, I think it's not a huge market, but it's a great market and the operating cost in that market are vastly lower than downtown LA on a per square foot basis, vastly lower.</p><p>OPERATOR: Steve Sakwa, Evercore ISI.</p><p>STEVE SAKWA, ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI: Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked. But John, I guess I had two. So on the east side of Seattle we just came back from there and there is definitely a couple of new projects that are going up, totals maybe 1.5 million feet and you've also got Expedia that's going to moving to a different campus more in Seattle are how are you just thinking about the Bellevue market longer-term?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, longer term I think it's great, because this is really an area that has all the amenities in shopping and different price ranges and so forth of for-rent housing and condominiums and improving transportation systems and so forth, so longer term very bullish.</p><p>What we saw is when this stuff started, we were looking at some of the development sites there and we didn't ultimately pull the trigger. Other have pulled the trigger on a couple of them as you know, Trammell Crow is underway with -- what is it, 400,000 or 500,000 feet; Salesforce has taken a 100,000 fleet there; and there are going to be some buildings coming on stream. The good news for us is that we saw that coming and we did the long term lease that take us through, what is it, with Concur. I mean the key Bank building is solid for many, many years. The other buildings, the Skyline building that we have out there, where Expedia leases up roughly 100,000 feet from just.</p><p>That we think is an opportunity. We have another tenants that's in there that needs expansion. Hopefully, we'll able to put something together, but then we have a lot of interest in that building. We have rents in that building that are way below current market and way below what the others are going to need in there to be build building. So if it gets to a point where there are -- is a period where there is less demand than there is space coming on stream, I think we're in a very good defensive position with the way we have improved that building and with what our rental structure is there. It could be that we don't get the growth if that were the case in our rents, but our rents are way under market on those leases.</p><p>STEVE SAKWA: Okay. And then just I guess kind of coming back to I guess another part of Seattle, I guess what's your appetite to acquire more land either in South Lake Union or other parts of Seattle at this point?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, we look at everything. We're very focused on 333 Dexter. We think we've got a terrific design and terrific flow plans, as Rob mentioned, we have had quite a few people from the Bay Area and elsewhere take a look -- either real estate departments looking at what. Let me just go backwards. With most of the companies and you can kind of figure out who they are, whether they are tenants or gone tenants of ours. We are regularly in discussions with regard to what their requirements are. Where they see their headcounts going up and so forth in our markets, telling them what we are doing, sharing with them what kind of buildings, what kind of space we are going to have coming on stream at what time. Getting input from them with regard to anything they like to see differently. So we are very good exchange of ideas with these tenants and that's why we know that there are some that really like what we're doing at 333 Dexter.</p><p>In terms of the local market there, most everything that's been started gets leased pretty quickly. We made our beat there. I don't see us buying another big site there unless we had a tenant at least for the near term. But I'm very bullish on that area. I think it is an area that is very, very similar to the SoMa area here in San Francisco. It's has the same vibe and has all the amenities, all the price points at housing. It's just a fabulous area. And the fact is that a lot of people don't want to be in high rises. They want to be in lower rise. Those are two 12 story buildings.</p><p>You got the new transportation or the big berths that dig there, that back in operation. So I think we're going to transportationally advantaged with 333 Dexter versus our competition. It's just got all the stuff that we look for in a terrific site, so we're focused on it.</p><p>OPERATOR: Manny Coachman, Citi.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: Hey, John, it's Michael Bilerman again. I just want to come back to sort of the market overall and totally like your comment, not trying to be pollyannaish about the situation and that you're relying on the data everything you're seeing on the ground. Everything you're seeing from the tenants, but we know no one rings a bell when it's over. So what are the things that investors should be focused on? What are you focused on to understand that turn when thing start to slow before it gets picked up in the data, right. So what are things that we need to be mindful of, clearly it's not the analyst reports of the hedge funds, so what are the things that we should be mindful of?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: Well, I'm not trying to pick on the analyst, I think there has been some -- my sense is that everybody wants to try to be the one that calls for change in the market and we're not seeing that in the data. We're not seeing it in the data with regard to what's being leased, we're not seeing it with regard to concessions, we're not seeing it with regard to demand. And by the way demand is far greater than the 9 million square feet that is the broker show in the third quarter report because I can tell you we're dealing with a bunch that are not -- there is a couple of million square feet out there that's not even reflected in those numbers. But there is a whole bunch of things and you know them as well as I do. You write on markets all the time.</p><p>If all of a sudden we see massive amounts of sub-lease space come out. If all of a sudden we see demand really diminish, I mean, those are going to be pretty strong indicators. But what we're seeing is the exact opposite of that. And I think any of you have to come to see us at (inaudible) that are on these calls or whatever over the years, know that we have always tried to be very conservative with regard to our underwriting and not get over our skies.</p><p>I will admit and to Ross' point earlier, we are lot longer in One Paseo than I ever wanted to be or dreamt that I would be, but we got down there in [the buzz], saw that crazy mirror that got fired and we couldn't foreseen that. But I think if all of a sudden we start seeing people saying they don't want to be in San Francisco, they don't want to grow in San Francisco then that is going to suggest that the market is going to become much more regular than the strong growth that we've seen.</p><p>But I think it was Morgan Stanley that recently came out with a paper, maybe I'm wrong. And it talked about San Francisco and it talked about residential and it talked about office and it said, at half the growth that we've been experiencing, it would still be an extremely robust market, at least I'm paraphrasing them. I think that we will see, at some point, the market moderate, but that doesn't mean that the lights are going to turn out. It just means that it's going to become more normal. One of the things that I'm very encourage by and I wasn't in this market although Mike Sanford was and Rob Paratte were amongst the other people that worked with us up here is that it is a lot different that the dot com area.</p><p>Nobody was talking about profitability in the dot com era. They were talking about growth and how much money and value their company was going to be worth. What we're seeing now is amazing numbers with regard to profitability. But innovation is not going to stop, and all the things I mentioned earlier is that there are more -- many of the discussions we're having with major tech companies are new initiatives they have, that's why you've got to sign an NDA because they have a new group to do something that nobody has ever thought before.</p><p>So that's why I love this market is because we will see ups and downs, we're not going to see everything go to the moon. We're not going to see every start-up survive, we're not going to see every unicorn just instantly become more billions and billions and increasingly more and more billions every six months, but we are going to see an amazing amount of growth from tech sector and you've got embedded here the talent base and the universities and it's where these people want to be. We started out on our comments that tech companies want to be -- their two first choices are the Bay Area and Seattle.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: As you think about, your comments about doing these larger building leases, long duration, high credit versus filling up building with 100,000 square foot tenants, which arguably and probably have weaker credit, is that more so from your belief and you said, I think you mentioned the bond. Do you view yourself as then selling an interest at net assets or selling that asset outright to capture that value in that credit lease, because arguably holding on, there is the value creation you are going to create immediately but then obviously little growth thereafter, how should we think about the strategy that you are going about in doing that versus taking arguably little bit shorter duration, smaller leases and filling it up sooner?</p><p>JOHN KILROY: It's a very good leasing question and you could figure out the answer, but I'm not at liberty to comment on. I'm in the midst of a whole bunch of negotiations. I'm not going to model them up. But you've got a very good sense.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. That's the end of the Q&amp;A ladies and gentlemen. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Tyler Rose for closing remarks.</p><p>TYLER ROSE: Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in KRC. Bye.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you, Tyler.

KETCHUM, CFO AND EVP OF FINANCE, NEXTERA ENERGY, INC.: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks on the third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about the 2017 hurricanes. As you know, residents of the Caribbean and Southern U.S. were recently impacted by the dangerous and deadly effects of hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate. Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been affected by any of these storms with widespread destruction.</p><p>Hurricane Irma was the largest hurricane event Florida Power &amp; Light has ever faced. The powerful storm impacted all 35 counties and 27,000 square miles of FPL service territory, causing more than 4.4 million customers to lose power. In preparation for the hurricane, FPL assembled and prepositioned the largest restoration workforce in U.S. history, which grew to approximately 28,000 at its peak. This preparation and coordinated response, combined with the hardening and automation investments that FPL has made since 2006 to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid, enabled the company to restore service to over 2 million customers in 1 day and to complete the restoration of all 4.4 million customers in 10 days. The efforts of our team resulted in the fastest restoration of the largest amount of people by any one utility in U.S. history.</p><p>Mutual aid in times of disaster is one of the hallmarks of our industry, and this storm was no exception. We are deeply grateful for the assistance provided by our industry partners. I would also like to personally thank each member of the restoration team as well as the contractors, vendors and first responders that supported our efforts for their dedicated assistance during this critical time for our customers.</p><p>To put Hurricane Irma in context, it's useful to compare it to Hurricane Wilma from 2005, which, prior to Irma, was the storm that affected the largest number of FPL customers. Unlike Hurricane Irma, which made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 storm and affected the entire state, Hurricane Wilma was a Category 3 storm, whose primary impacts were to the southern half of the Florida peninsula. Based upon a methodology developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Hurricane Irma had an approximately 50% higher damage potential than hurricane Wilma and resulted in over 90% of FPL customers losing power compared to 75% for Hurricane Wilma.</p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that Hurricane Irma was a much stronger storm impacting a larger portion of FPL service territory, there was an approximately 80% reduction to pole damage and an 80% improvement in the time to energize all substations following the storm when compared to Hurricane Wilma. After day 1, FPL had 50% of its customers restored, also an 80% improvement compared to the Wilma restoration efforts. In fact, 95% of customers impacted by Irma were restored in 1 week. And while the average customer outage from Hurricane Wilma lasted for over 5 days, the average outage for customers affected by Hurricane Irma was roughly 2 days, a 60% improvement.</p><p>The total GDP within our service territory averages over $1 billion per day. By reducing the average customer outage by more than 3 days when compared to Wilma, we believe the avoided economic loss to the state has more than paid for the $3 billion in hardening investments we have made since 2006. Given the size and scale of this hurricane, the Florida Public Service Commission has opened a docket to solicit customer comments and to take evidence on the statewide utility response to Irma, including an analysis of the impact prior hardening activities had on restoration efforts. We believe that the improvement in FPL storm restoration efforts shows that our ongoing transmission and distribution investments, together with our preparation and coordinated response, are providing significant value to our customers.</p><p>In an effort to mitigate a significant bill impact for our customers related to the cost recovery for Hurricane Irma, we currently expect to propose a surcharge equivalent to $4 on a 1,000 kilowatt-hour residential bill beginning in March of 2018, which equates to a step-up of $0.64 from a surcharge related to Hurricane Matthew that rolls off at that time.</p><p>Subject to review and prudent determination of our final storm cost by the Florida Public Service Commission, which are preliminarily estimated to be approximately $1.3 billion, we expect the surcharge to increase by roughly $1.50 to approximately $5.50 per month in 2019 and stay at that level until the storm costs are fully recovered, which is expected by the end of 2020.</p><p>Turning now to our financial performance. NextEra Energy delivered solid third quarter results, and building upon strong progress made in the first half of the year remains well positioned to achieve our overall objectives for 2017. NextEra Energy's third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.11 or 6.3% against the prior year quarter, primary reflecting contributions from new investments at both Florida Power &amp; Light and Energy Resources. Year-to-date, we have grown adjusted earnings per share by 9.2% compared to the prior year comparable period. We also executed well on major initiatives, including continuing to capitalize on one of the best renewal development periods in our history.</p><p>At Florida Power &amp; Light, earnings per share increased $0.08 from the prior year comparable quarter. Strong growth was driven by continued investment in the business to maintain our best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. We earned a regulatory ROE of approximately 11.5%, and average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 9.8% over the same quarter last year.</p><p>All of our major capital initiatives remain on track, including the 1,750-megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and construction of the 874.5-megawatt solar energy centers that are currently being built under the Solar Base Rate Adjustment or SoBRA mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement.</p><p>We were also pleased that the Florida Public Service Commission approved a settlement agreement with the Office of Public Counsel for the early phaseout of the St. Johns River Power Park, helping to further reduce costs for FPL customers and lower emissions for Florida residents.</p><p>At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by roughly 3% year-over-year as contributions from new investments more than offset a negative contribution from our existing assets as a result of poor fleet-wide wind resource, which was the lowest on record for the months of July through September over the past 30 years.</p><p>Following the success of recent quarters, it was another excellent period of new project origination. Since the last call, our development organization has added 760 megawatts of long-term contracted projects to our backlog, including the largest announced combined solar plus storage project in the United States. This continued cost and efficiency improvements in wind and solar technology support compelling renewable economics that remain the primary driver of ongoing customer origination activity.</p><p>Energy Resources continue to advance our wind repowering program as well, adding 514 megawatts to our repowering backlog for 2018 delivery. We also commissioned more than 300 megawatts of repowering projects and closed the first tax equity financing for our wind repowering portfolio.</p><p>Finally, we were pleased to receive the FERC certificate for MVP and look forward to advancing construction activities to support a year-end 2018 commercial operation date.</p><p>Overall, with 3 strong quarters complete in 2017, we are pleased with the progress we are making at NextEra Energy and are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats.</p><p>Now let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2017, FPL reported net income of $566 million or $1.19 per share, an increase of $51 million and $0.08 per share, respectively, year-over-year.</p><p>Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 9.8% over the same quarter last year and was a principal driver of FPL's net income growth of 9.9%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1 billion in the third quarter, and we continue to expect our full year capital investments to total between $5 billion and $5.4 billion.</p><p>Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended September 2017. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. During the third quarter, we reversed $124 million of reserve amortization after offsetting the impacts of Hurricane Irma, leaving us with a balance of roughly $1.15 billion, which can be utilized over the remainder of our settlement agreement.</p><p>We continue to expect the flexibility provided by the utilization of our reserve amortization, coupled with our weather-normalized sales forecast and current CapEx and O&amp;M expectations, to support our target regulatory ROE of 11.5% for the full year 2017, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current settlement agreement.</p><p>Each of our ongoing capital deployment initiatives continues to progress well as we focus on delivering our best-in-class customer value proposition. Construction on the approximately 1,750-megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and under budget. The 8 solar sites totaling nearly 600 megawatts of combined capacity are currently being built across FPL service territory, and they're all on track and on budget to begin providing cost-effective energy to FPL customers later this year and in early 2018.</p><p>We also continue to advance the development of the additional 1,600 megawatts of solar projects that are planned for beyond 2018 and have currently, secured potential sites that could support more than 5 gigawatts of FPL's ongoing solar expansion.</p><p>Last month, the Florida Public Service Commission approved the settlement agreement between FPL and the Office of Public Counsel, the consumer advocate in Florida, regarding FPL's proposal for the early shutdown of the St. Johns River Power Park, an approximately 1,300-megawatt coal-fired plant jointly owned with JEA. The early retirement of the plant, which is expected in January 2018, is projected to provide total savings to FPL customers of $183 million and prevent nearly 5.6 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, adding to the customer savings and emission reductions of our Cedar Bay and Indiantown transactions.</p><p>Earlier this month, we filed a determination of need with the FPSC for the roughly 1,200-megawatt highly efficient, clean-burning natural gas Dania Beach Clean Energy Center. The project, which has a total expected capital investment of approximately $900 million, is a modernization of our existing Lauderdale plant and is expected to begin operation by mid-2022. Consistent with our focus on low bills, we estimate that the facility will generate more than $335 million in net cost savings for FPL customers over its operational life.</p><p>Finally, we were pleased that earlier in the week, the City of Vero Beach City Council approved FPL's purchase of substantially all of the assets of the municipal electric system for approximately $185 million. We are continuing to work on the remaining necessary approvals and hope to be in a position to close the transaction in late 2018. If we are successful, we look forward to Vero Beach's roughly 34,000 customers benefiting from FPL's best-in-class customer value proposition, including rates that are among the lowest in the state.</p><p>Despite the effects of Hurricane Irma, the Florida economy remains strong. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3.8% in September, down more than 1% from a year earlier and the lowest in over 10 years. As an indicator of new construction, new building permits remained at healthy levels. The most recent reading of the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 5.3% from the prior year, while mortgage delinquency rates continue to decline. Overall, Florida's economy continues to grow with the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence near post-recession highs.</p><p>FPL's average number of customers in the third quarter increased by roughly 62,000 or 1.3% year-over-year. For the third quarter, we estimate that warmer weather had a positive year-over-year impact on usage per customer of approximately 1.6% and that Hurricane Irma had a negative impact of approximately 3.5%. After taking these factors into account, third quarter sales decreased 3% on a weather-normalized basis, which reflects continued customer growth, more than offset by an estimated decline in usage per customer of 1.7%.</p><p>With the increased uncertainty and our estimate of weather-normalized usage per customer as a result of Hurricane Irma, we are unable to draw any firm conclusions about long-term trends and underlying usage. We will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage going forward. As a reminder, modest changes in usage per customer are not likely to have a material effect on earnings over the course of the settlement agreement as we will adjust the level of reserve amortization utilization to offset any effect, which would allow us to maintain our target regulatory ROE.</p><p>Overall, despite the effects of the hurricane, the underlying Florida economy remains strong, supporting ongoing customer growth. And primarily due to weather, warmer-than-expected temperatures, we have utilized less reserve amortization than expected through the first 3 quarters. Assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we currently expect to end 2017 with a reserve amortization balance of more than $1.1 billion that can be utilized over the remainder of the settlement agreement.</p><p>Our capital initiatives to further enhance our already best-in-class customer value proposition are also progressing well. These smart capital investments are expected to deliver a regulatory capital employed compound annual growth rate of roughly 8% per year from 2017 through 2020.</p><p>We are pleased with FPL's year-to-date execution, and we'll continue to maintain our relentless focus on delivering low bills, high reliability, clean energy and outstanding customer service.</p><p>Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which report a third quarter 2017 GAAP and adjusted earnings of $292 million or $0.62 per share. Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted EPS increased by $0.02 from last year's comparable quarter. New investments contributed $0.12 per share, primarily reflecting continued growth in our contractor renewables program.</p><p>As I previously mentioned, third quarter fleet-wide wind resource was the lowest on record over the past 30 years at 87% of the long-term average versus 101% in the third quarter of last year. The weaker wind resource in the third quarter was the primary driver of the negative $0.03 contribution from existing generation assets relative to the prior-year comparable quarter. All other impacts reduced results by $0.07 per share, including the effects of increased interest expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, we signed contracts for 760 megawatts of new projects since the last call. In addition to the 566 megawatts of wind for 2018 delivery, we successfully originated 164 megawatts of solar for delivery between 2018 and 2020 and the 30-megawatt battery storage project that will be paired with one of the solar PPAs. This project is the largest combined solar and storage facility in the United States announced to date. The strong quarter of origination activity is consistent with recent trends and are reflective of continued strong customer demand, driven largely by wind and solar economics.</p><p>The combination of low-cost wind or solar energy, paired with a low-cost battery storage solution, provides a product that can be dispatched with enough certainty to meet customer needs for a firm generation resource. Today, we are able to offer this firm wind or solar resource for a lower cost than the operating cost of traditional inefficient generation resources.</p><p>As we have previously discussed, with continued equipment cost declines and efficiency gains as the tax efficiencies phase down early in the next decade, we expect new firm wind and firm solar without incentives to be cheaper than the operating cost of coal, nuclear and less fuel-efficient oil and gas-fired generation units, creating significant opportunities for renewables' growth going forward.</p><p>Our wind repowering efforts also continued to progress. As I previously mentioned, we added 514 megawatts to our repowering backlog, including approximately 241 megawatts of contracted projects that have new PPA extensions in place. Our wind repowering backlog now stands at over 2,300 megawatts, all for 2017 and 2018 delivery.</p><p>During the quarter, Energy Resources successfully commissioned an additional 308 megawatts of wind repowering projects. We also closed our first tax equity financing related to a wind repowering, raising roughly $243 million on a portfolio of 327 megawatts of projects. We continue to expect to invest a total of between $2.5 billion and $3 billion for repowerings through 2020.</p><p>The progress we have made this quarter reflects the continued strong outlook for renewables development. And we believe that by leveraging Energy Resources' competitive advantages, we are well positioned to capture a meaningful share of the wind and solar markets going forward.</p><p>The attached chart provides additional details on where our renewables development program now stands. Beyond renewables, we continue to make good progress on the Mountain Valley Pipeline. Earlier this month, we received the FERC certificate for MVP. We are working to complete final development activities and expect to begin -- expect to begin advancing construction efforts to support a December 2018 in-service date. NextEra Energy's expected investment is approximately $1.1 billion.</p><p>Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2017, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $847 million or $1.79 per share. NextEra Energy's 2017 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $875 million and $1.85 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate &amp; Other segment increased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2016.</p><p>Earlier this month, our transmission team was selected by the New York Independent System Operator to develop a 20-mile 345-kV transmission line and accompanying facilities located near Buffalo, New York. The project is New YorkISO's first competitive transmission award under its Public Policy Transmission Planning Process and will help the state to maximize the flow of energy from lower cost renewable generation. The project is required to be in-service by June 2022, and our investment is expected to total roughly $180 million. We are very pleased with this recent success and although a very competitive business, look to build on that success with other opportunities going forward.</p><p>For 2017, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.35 to $6.85. We currently expect lower growth in the fourth quarter as we are pursuing several refinancing initiatives to capitalize on favorable market conditions that could drive up to roughly $150 million of MPV savings on a cash basis, but will result in a reduction in net income when they close later this year.</p><p>For example, we recently announced the refinancing of $750 million of capital holdings hybrid securities. While this transaction produces more than $50 million of MPV savings on a cash basis, it will result in a net income reduction of approximately $13 million in the fourth quarter. Despite this, we continue to believe we are well positioned to achieve full year results at or near the upper end of our previously disclosed 6% to 8% adjusted earnings per share compound annual growth rate expectations off our 2016 base. For the full year 2017, we expect cash flow from operations to grow above our adjusted EPS growth rate after adjusting for impacts from certain FPL clause recoveries, storm costs and recoveries in the Indiantown acquisition.</p><p>Looking further ahead, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.80 to $7.30 for 2018 and in the range of $7.85 to $8.45 for 2020, applying a compound annual growth rate off a 2016 base of 6% to 8%. With the overall strength and diversity of our growth prospects of both FPL and Energy Resources and based on everything we see now, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our 6% to 8% range through 2020.</p><p>We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share of 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, all of our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including, but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions.</p><p>Although it is still premature to draw any firm conclusions, we wanted to provide an update on the potential impacts of the recent tax reform proposal on our long-term adjusted EPS expectations. We have modeled the scenario, making certain assumptions based on the framework that was released on September 27 by the Trump administration, the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance. Off our 2020 baseline, we would expect the scenario to be roughly 20% to $0.30 per share accretive. We continue to be actively engaged in the tax reform discussion, and we'll provide further updates as the ultimate direction of and progress on tax reform becomes clearer.</p><p>In summary, NextEra Energy remains on track to meet its 2017 expectations, and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future growth prospects. At FPL, our ongoing focus is on operational cost-effectiveness, productivity and making smart long-term investments to further improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do. At Energy Resources, we continue to make terrific progress on our development program and remain optimistic about our renewables' growth prospects as a result of improving equipment cost and efficiencies and ongoing advancements in energy storage.</p><p>Overall, we continue to believe that we have one of the best opportunity sets in our industry and that we are well positioned to continue to deliver on our growth expectations going forward.</p><p>Let me now turn to NEP. Yesterday, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.3925 per common unit, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. We are pleased to announce that following approval by the Conflicts Committee of the NextEra Energy Partners board, NEP has reached an agreement to acquire 4 additional assets from Energy Resources, adding to what we view as an already best-in-class portfolio with an average 18-year contract life and counterparty credit rating of A3 following the acquisition.</p><p>These assets are expected to further enhance the quality and diversity of NEP's existing portfolio and to complete the growth necessary to achieve our previously outlined year-end 2017 adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution run rate expectations. We expect the transaction, which is anticipated to be funded with the issuance of the $550 million of previously announced convertible preferred units and cash on hand, to yield a double-digit return to NEP's unitholders and to be accretive to LP distributions. I will provide additional details on the transaction in a few minutes.</p><p>Building upon the changes we have pursued this year to further improve NEP's investor value proposition, including the governance enhancements, the modified IDR structure, the standalone credit ratings in the mid- to high-BB category and the agreement to issue $550 million of convertible preferred units, NEP demonstrated its ability to access additional low-cost sources of capital this quarter with the issuances of $300 million of 3-year convertible debt and a total of $1.1 billion of 7- and 10-year senior unsecured notes at historically low yields.</p><p>Today, we are also announcing that we have upsized and extended NEP's revolving credit facility to further enhance NEP's financial flexibility and strengthen its standalone prospects going forward. I will provide additional details on each of these financings in just a moment.</p><p>Consistent with our long-term growth prospects, today, we are introducing December 31, 2018, run rate expectations, reflecting roughly 22% and 17% growth, respectively, from the comparable year-end 2017 run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD midpoints. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at NEP and are well positioned to meet our 2017 and longer-term expectations.</p><p>Now let's look at the detailed results for NEP. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $178 million, and cash available for distribution was $47 million, up approximately 2% and down roughly 8% from the prior year comparable quarter, respectively. Poor wind resource had a meaningful impact on NEP's assets. Fleet-wide wind resource was 82%, the lowest third quarter on record over the last 30 years, compared to 95% for the third quarter in 2016. Although still early in the fourth quarter, wind resource has begun to return to more normal levels in October.</p><p>On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by 15% and 10%, respectively. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. As I previously mentioned, and the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.3925 per common unit or $1.57 per common unit on an annualized basis, an increase of approximately 15% from a year earlier.</p><p>NEP completed multiple financing transactions this quarter, further demonstrating its ability to access a variety of capital sources. In early September, NEP issued $300 million of convertible notes due in 2020 at a 1.5% coupon. The notes have the potential to convert into equity at a 25% premium to the September 6, 2017 closing price of $42.29. Consistent with our desire to achieve the top end of NEP's growth expectations, the conversion rate has been structured to allow an approximate 15% annualized growth rate in distributions per unit without an adjustment to the conversion rate.</p><p>Concurrently with the debt issuance, NEP purchased a capped call that provides economic and dilution protection up to a 50% premium to the September 6 closing price. In September, NEP also issued $550 million of both 7- and 10-year senior unsecured notes to refinance approximately $1.1 billion in existing secured holding company debt that had maturities in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>We believe the strong demand for the offering, which was more than 5 1/2 times oversubscribed, is indicative of NEP's superior value proposition, supported by diversified cash flows from long-term contracts with strong creditworthy counterparties. The transaction priced at historical lows, including the lowest spread and coupon for a Ba1/BB U.S. dollar offering on the 7-year tranche and the lowest coupon for a Ba1/BB USD offering on the 10-year tranche.</p><p>As I mentioned -- as I just mentioned, today, we are also announcing amendments to our existing revolving credit facility. In addition to lower borrowing rates, the facility will be upsized from $250 million to $750 million, and the maturity will be extended from July 2019 to October 2022. We believe that the strong demand from 20 banks to participate in the amended credit facility is reflective of the core strength that separate NEP from other infrastructure alternatives.</p><p>We continue to expect a target total holdco leverage to project distributions of 3 to 4x at year-end 2017 and consistent with NEP's credit ratings, total holdco leverage to project distributions of 4 to 5x over the longer term. We believe these leverage targets are supported by NEP's amortizing project debt and long-term contracted portfolio and are consistent with our experience in financing clean energy assets.</p><p>As a result of this financing flexibility, aside from any modest issuances under the aftermarket program or issuances upon the conversion of NEP's convertible securities, we continue to expect that NextEra Energy Partners will not need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest.</p><p>Beyond the new financings, the previously announced NEP governance enhancements, which will give LP unitholders, among other rights, the ability to elect a majority of the NEP board beginning at the shareholder meeting to be held later this year, we also implemented during the quarter.</p><p>As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NEP's portfolio with the agreement to acquire 4 additional assets from Energy Resources. This portfolio is a geographically diverse mix of wind and solar projects, collectively consisting of approximately 691 megawatts, including the acquisition of a 25.9% indirect interest in the Desert Sunlight Solar Energy Center.</p><p>The portfolio has a cash available for distribution weighted remaining contract life of 22 years. The transaction is expected to close by year-end, subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and represents another step toward growing LP unit distributions in a manner consistent with our previously stated expectations of 12% to 15% per year through at least 2022.</p><p>NEP expects to acquire the portfolio for total consideration of approximately $812 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments plus the assumption of approximately $459 million in liabilities related to tax equity financing and considers approximately $268 million of existing nonrecourse project debt related to the Desert Sunlight project. The acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $185 million to $205 million and cash available for distribution of approximately $79 million to $89 million, each on a 5-year average annual run rate basis beginning December 31, 2017.</p><p>The purchase price for the transaction is expected to be funded through the issuance of $550 million of previously announced convertible preferred units with the balance funded with cash on hand as a result of NEP's recent convertible debt financing. Additional details are shown in the accompanying slide.</p><p>Following the acquisition of this portfolio from Energy Resources, we expect the NEP assets to support the previously announced December 31, 2017 run rate expectations, reflecting calendar year 2018 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2017 for adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $975 million and CAFD of $310 million to $340 million. Since we currently expect today's announced acquisition to close later in the fourth quarter, we do not expect the portfolio to provide a meaningful contribution to fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA or cash available for distribution.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, consistent with our previously announced long-term growth prospects, today, we're introducing December 31, 2018 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $1.05 billion to $1.2 billion and CAFD of $360 million to $400 million, reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2018. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense.</p><p>From a base of our fourth quarter 2016 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.41, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2022. With the acquisitions announced today, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2017 distribution, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable on February 2018, to be at the top end of our previously disclosed range of $1.58 to $1.62 per common unit.</p><p>While we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the impacts of tax reform on NEP, we expect that on most reasonable scenarios, NEP's U.S. federal income tax shield, which is currently greater than 15 years, and NEP's earnings of profits balance, which is currently expected to remain negative for at least the next 8 years, will not be materially affected.</p><p>We are pleased with the progress NEP has made over 2017, and we are well positioned to achieve our full year financial expectations. Upon the closing of the announced acquisition from Energy Resources, we have successfully executed on our growth strategy for the year. We believe NEP continues to provide a best-in-class investor value proposition. As we have previously outlined, NEP has the flexibility to grow in 3 ways, acquiring assets from Energy Resources organically or acquiring assets from other third parties. NEP also has a cost of capital and access to capital advantage with substantial flexibility to finance its long-term growth as was further demonstrated by the transactions completed this quarter.</p><p>These advantages, together with the stability of NEP's cash flows backed by the portfolio's long-term average contract life and strong counterparty credit profile, amortizing debt, tax position, enhanced governance rights and long-term growth expectations through at least 2022, all support NEP's favorable position relative to other yieldcos and MLPs.</p><p>NextEra Energy Partners continues to make excellent progress against its strategic and growth initiatives, and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about NEP's long-term prospects.</p><p>That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We'll go to Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley.</p><p>STEPHEN CALDER BYRD, MD AND HEAD OF NORTH AMERICAN RESEARCH FOR THE POWER AND UTILITIES AND CLEAN ENERGY, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to check in on your excess balance sheet capacity and just generally, your balance sheet strength. You've been putting up additional wins in the renewables business, and it looks like there's also upside at the utility. When we think about using that excess balance sheet capacity, do you see significant organic opportunities at the different business units? Or do you think you're likely to still have excess balance sheet capacity through the end of the decade?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Okay. So first of all, the excess balance sheet capacity is about $3 billion to $5 billion through 2020. And when you look at the financial plan that we have laid out through 2020 at the investor conference, the CapEx that we already have planned for the FPL business and the Energy Resources business does not take into account that $3 billion to $5 billion of excess balance sheet capacity.</p><p>So what do we do with it? We have a few options. I think our preferred option would be to find incremental capital investment opportunities that drive long-term value for shareholders and that also help to create growth post 2020, which we view as being strong, given all the potential growth platform opportunities that we have in the next decade, given where we see renewables and also given all the opportunities that FPL has on Eric's side of the business.</p><p>STEPHEN CALDER BYRD: Understood. And just shifting gears to storage. You made some interesting remarks about storage. And I guess, we're hearing that storage solicitations are now a regular part of a lot of renewable procurements. I was just curious, your opinion as to whether we're currently in the right ZIP code that you think many customers will opt for storage linked with renewables or do you think that's a few years down the road? What's your sense of the likely customer appetite over the next couple of years for storage linked with renewables and PPAs?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes. Storage is very real now. And I think -- and as evidenced by the project we announced today with the 30 megawatts tied to an existing solar project, making it the largest combined solar plus storage project in the U.S. But when you look at where storage economics are, storage costs continue to come down significantly, efficiency continues to improve at a rate where we can now combine storage with solar and really beat the pricing, the existing variable costs just to operate a nuclear or coal plant, and be pretty darn competitive even with combined cycle gas facilities.</p><p>And what's the result of that? Because of that, on almost every solar procurement that we are bidding on today, counterparties are asking us not only for solar bid, but also for a combined solar plus storage bid. They clearly understand the benefits that are created by the firm dispatchability of the combined products.</p><p>So the short answer is, we're already here and things should only continue to improve as we go forward and as tax incentives phase down in the next decade, and you can combine storage, which will be even lower cost, even more efficient, with an even lower cost and more efficient solar panel and balance of system cost, we see that as a very viable product going forward, and we also are continuing to look for opportunities to combine solar with wind or storage with wind. And with that, I don't know if Armando has anything that he would like to add.</p><p>ARMANDO PIMENTEL, CEO OF NEXTERA ENERGY RESOURCES LLC AND PRESIDENT OF NEXTERA ENERGY RESOURCES LLC, NEXTERA ENERGY, INC.: Steven, real quick, recall that at the investor conference, what we laid out was the roughly $700 million of CapEx opportunities in the storage market through 2020. We continue to think that's a good number. That doesn't mean that customers aren't significantly interested in what's going on and proactively asking for bids. And even as the cost estimate comes down, we continue to believe that this is going to be a significant opportunity early part of the next decade.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Steve Fleishman, Wolfe Research.</p><p>STEVEN ISAAC FLEISHMAN, MD &amp; SENIOR UTILITIES ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH, LLC: Just one question on the NEP financing for the new drops. Could you just repeat kind of the financing plan that you laid out for the new drops announced today?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes, absolutely, Steve. So for the new drops, remember, right around the time of the investor conference, we completed the $550 million convertible preferred offering at a 4.5% coupon, lowest coupon ever for a convertible offering. That will comprise the lion's share of the $812 million equity price for that acquisition. The balance will come from cash on hand. Now cash on hand is really coming from the convertible debt offering that we closed on in September at a 1.5% coupon, with the up 25% and then the cap [capped] call on top of that given a second [arm of] consideration of up 50%.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Greg Gordon, Evercore Partners.</p><p>GREGORY HARMON GORDON, SENIOR MD, HEAD OF POWER &amp; UTILITIES RESEARCH AND FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI, RESEARCH DIVISION: The first is you've reclassified a significant chunk of your wind assets from merchant to contracted, and there's a footnote that describes why. But can you go into some more detail as to what the underlying assumptions are that -- with regard to profitability of those assets and why they've shifted.</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes. It's really pretty simple. So those are repowering assets that were formerly ERCOT merchant assets. And the way the economics works is that roughly 90% of the gross margin comes from the production tax credits.</p><p>So you can think of the PTC as essentially being a contractual hedge. So every megawatt-hour that we're generating, we're getting paid $24 on that megawatt-hour for 90% of the gross margin. And so given that, and also the fact that some of those projects will carry financial hedges going forward, the more appropriate classification over the next 10 years during the PTC period is as a contracted asset.</p><p>GREGORY HARMON GORDON: Well that makes a pretty underlying strong statement about the incremental IRR you're getting on the repowerings if the vast majority of your return at the hurdle rate is coming just from getting the PTCs without worrying about a substantial energy margin. Is that the right way to think about it?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Well, yes, I mean, remember too -- I mean, it's about half the CapEx and because of -- it's half the CapEx, you're getting the driver from the PTCs and then energy is the upside. That's why we've said the unlevered IRRs are a few ticks up from what we would get on a newbuild wind project.</p><p>GREGORY HARMON GORDON: Fantastic. My second question is, if you would humor us, can you delineate what the basic assumptions you were assuming are on your baseline tax case?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes. I mean, it's really what came out on September 27. So you can think of it as a 20% corporate tax rate, 100% immediate expensing, and then we've made an assumption on what the interest limitation is that I'm probably not going to share on this call.</p><p>GREGORY HARMON GORDON: Fair enough. But the industry EI has been lobbying on behalf of the industry to try and achieve an offramp or an exemption on interest deductibility and bonus depreciation, correct?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: It -- well, I'll let Jim take it.</p><p><person><nameText>JAMES L. ROBO, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, CEO, PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY, NEXTERA ENERGY, INC.: So Greg, listen, I just think on tax reform, it's very fluid right now. Obviously, the industry has been weighing in, I've been spending a lot of time on it, and we don't even have a bill out of House Ways and Means yet. So I think it's too early, really, to say anything about where any of this stands other than you can rest assured, I'm highly engaged on this.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go to Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>MICHAEL JAY LAPIDES, VP, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Guys, couple of questions. One, probably for Armando, which is, can you talk about, when you think about your renewable pipeline, how much of that is the counterparty of -- traditional regulated utility versus how much of it is a corporate entity, whether a big tech company or someone else?</p><p>ARMANDO PIMENTEL: So Michael, right now, for us, I'd say, 90% of what we're doing is probably the more traditional customers, and those could be the rate-regulated utilities or the munis and co-ops. And I'd say, 5% to 10% are the latter, which you asked about for the corporate entities, what we call C&amp;I companies. We continue to see more C&amp;I companies out there. And actually, we are engaging in that business more proactively today than we have in the past. So I would expect, for us, that 5% to 10% to go up.</p><p>MICHAEL JAY LAPIDES: Got it. And then, guys, how are you thinking about the Section 201 case and some of the recent developments and what that could do if any to solar-related demand? Really, for 2018 solar demands, but even for the next few years?</p><p><person><nameText>JAMES L. ROBO</nameText></person>: So Michael, this is Jim. Obviously, this is something we're watching very closely. I think I spoke on this issue in September. We're fine in '17 and '18 because we prebought our panels when we saw this going on. '19 is probably the year we're most concerned about. That's probably where there is potentially a pinch point, depending on where the ITC comes out and where the administration comes out on this.</p><p>Post '19, I think there's going to be -- the market's going to -- the market will have time to react to whatever happens, and I think we'll get back to normal business in 2020 and beyond. But '19 is our focus, and we're working quite hard in a number of fronts. And it's something that we're watching closely, and we're highly engaged on it and the whole team is highly engaged on it across the board.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p><p>JULIEN PATRICK DUMOULIN-SMITH, DIRECTOR AND HEAD OF THE US POWER, UTILITIES, &amp; ALTERNATIVE ENERGY EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Let me start real quickly on the 201 issue there if I can. What are you expecting when you talk about 2019 and really beyond that in terms of market reaction? I mean, what's your kind of playbook as far as you see this playing out right now? And then secondly, what is your expectation in terms of the positioning of parties and thinking about how this could actually play out over the next few months? Is a settlement possible, et cetera, to make this a little bit more palatable?</p><p><person><nameText>JAMES L. ROBO</nameText></person>: So Julien, it's Jim again. I just think it's too early to tell what's going to happen here. And I think, honestly, there's a pretty broad range of potential outcomes on this, and I wouldn't care to speculate on what's going to happen. I think we'll see. We're -- and what we're doing is frankly scenario planning across a variety of different outcomes and making sure that we're going to be prepared in case of any potential outcome.</p><p>JULIEN PATRICK DUMOULIN-SMITH: Excellent. Well -- and looking beyond the current 2020 period, you guys have done a fantastic job in the repowering side thus far. I'm curious, how are you thinking about repowering opportunities under kind of a sub-100% PTC, call it, 80%, 60%? I mean, you've been pretty forward looking before across the industry, and this seems like an opportunity to pivot. Are you engaging with parties on that front? I mean, do you have an expectation for an ability to use those PTCs that are expired 2000 -- say, '12, '13 and '14 vintage projects as they come off in the early part of the next decade and repower those?</p><p>ARMANDO PIMENTEL: Armando...</p><p>JULIEN PATRICK DUMOULIN-SMITH: So I'm just thinking in the longer term.</p><p>ARMANDO PIMENTEL: Yes. Look, most of what -- not most, just about everything of what we're doing today is to make sure that we can grab the -- as many of these repowering opportunities through 2020, having safe harbored a good part of that equipment in order to get the 100% Production Tax Credits. There's already been one entity out there, which I'm sure you've seen, that has announced the project where they would be getting 80% Production Tax Credits and that the economics work for them under that scenario.</p><p>Our expectation is that when the Production Tax Credit goes down to 80%, that there are actually going to be some repowering opportunities that are going to work, maybe not necessarily for the reasons that some might believe. When we're looking at repowering opportunities, one of the things that we're looking at is, how close is the old asset, if you will, to the end of its PTC life, right? And if it's 9 or 10 years into its life, 100 -- taking the asset down and repowering it and putting it up and getting 100% PTCs for 10 years might work. But if it's at the end of 2020, if it's only gone through 7 years, let's say, you wouldn't necessarily want to repower the asset at that point and lose 3 years of the old PTCs.</p><p>But if you wait another year, now you're 8 years or 9 years, it may actually make sense to give up 1 year of the old PTCs and get 10 years of the 80% PTCs. So that scenario planning is something that we are spending a little bit of time right now. We certainly have a lot of assets that would be subject to that. But I do believe that there are going to be repowering opportunities that work with 80% PTCs.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Paul Ridzon, KeyBanc.</p><p>PAUL THOMAS RIDZON, VP AND EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: John, I think on the second quarter call, you said look for most of the second half growth to hit the fourth quarter. I'm just trying to calibrate. We saw a 6.5% growth in the third quarter here. Did some of that growth shift quarters? And then just how do I think about the sub-par wind resource you had in the quarter? How does that figure into the numbers?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes. So by the time of the second quarter call, we were pretty well into July, which was, well, not a terrific wind resource month. Things -- we were concerned about the trend for the rest of the quarter. For August and September, August ended up kind of following suit with July, and we're a little bit surprised because September rebounded a little bit more than we had expected. I think that September ended up being about 95% of normal. And now we've seen October has truly rebounded so far this month. That was part of it.</p><p>We had a little bit better performance out of other miscellaneous parts of the business, none worth pointing out individually that, when added up, put us in a little bit better position than what we were expecting for the quarter, including some origination activity that we had on the business.</p><p>PAUL THOMAS RIDZON: Should we think about that incremental positive as essentially being offset in the fourth quarter by the refinancings that you talked about?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes. And so the fourth quarter -- that's why I think I made the comment that growth will be down a little bit in the fourth quarter. We have really been focused on liability management. When you look at our portfolio -- one of the things I made a comment on at the investor conference is, if you look at our financing portfolio, we have one of the longest average tenors combined with one of the lowest average interest rates of any of our peers. And that's because we constantly look at the portfolio for refinancing activity opportunities. And that -- those are the opportunities we're looking to execute on in the fourth quarter.</p><p>The remarks were that the MPV could be as high as $150 million. Obviously, those come with some prepayment penalties that do have some book impacts associated with them, but we're just trying to continue our trend of being very mindful that we're in an attractive low interest rate environment and looking at the balance sheet as we always do, to be opportunistic, and that's what you can expect would be reflected in the fourth quarter results.</p><p>PAUL THOMAS RIDZON: And you don't treat those kind of onetime -- make holes or anything as unusual items?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: No. We flow them through.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Shar Pourreza, Guggenheim Partners.</p><p>SHAHRIAR POURREZA, MD AND HEAD OF NORTH AMERICAN POWER, GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a quick follow up on the battery storage comments, John. Did Dania filings that you filed for show that the asset was materially more economical than battery storage and solar, even in the 2022 time frame? So I'm curious on sort of how that fits in with your viewpoint that batteries plus solar could be economical with the CCGT?</p><p>And then just a follow-up on Dania, is -- looking at FP&amp;L's gas assets, there are other plants that fit the similar economics as sort of the plant that you're converting. So I'm kind of curious if the Dania plant's a one-off. And do you see any opportunities thus far?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes. I think we'll just tackle the Dania piece first. The Dania piece first is, one, you got to consider its location. I mean, it's in South Florida, it has a transmission advantage given its location. If you look at the economics on the reduced O&amp;M on improving the fuel efficiency of that facility, given its location, that's why that one works.</p><p>We continue to look for other opportunities. We have the 50-megawatt battery storage pilot program in Florida where we will look to do a lot of the same things we've done on the Energy Resources side, including the project we announced today where we can actually combine our storage capability with newbuild solar in Florida.</p><p>And that -- those opportunities will come about not only through the 8 facilities we're currently building within the 1,600 post 2018. Where exactly that will end up will depend on where they're located in the overall economics of those facilities. But it's a terrific opportunity for Florida to take advantage of the same opportunities that our regulated customer base outside of Florida are looking for.</p><p><person><nameText>JAMES L. ROBO</nameText></person>: And Shar, this is Jim. I just -- one other thing on storage and renewable competitiveness is we see storage and renewables being -- really competing very well against inefficient, old operating nuclear and coal plants where you look at those -- you look at the economics of those sites, they're anywhere from $0.04 to $0.05 on a cash, cash cost per kilowatt basis to operate. These new CCGTs, particularly in a constrained place like Dania Beach, are very, very cost-effective and super fuel-efficient. And typically, you wouldn't see renewables and storage competing with that just yet.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Chris Turnure, JPMorgan.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER JAMES TURNURE, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Given -- you guys probably have maybe 6 or so months to go to kind of finish out the '17 to '18 bucket of renewable backlog, could you just give us an update on how you might fall out within that 4-gigawatt range? Are you coming up on the bottom now? Will any of it kind of spill into 2019? In terms of your maybe original expectations, has anything changed in the last 3 to 6 months?</p><p>JOHN W. KETCHUM: Yes. So first, we're already there on solar. Not only there on solar for '17 and '18. We're pretty darn close to a range for '19 and '20. And we'll look to continue to add to that obviously going forward. And then on the wind side, given the 760-megawatt total portfolio today, the wind additions that were part of that, we're within striking distance on wind. And I'll let Armando fill in the details with kind of his viewpoint.</p><p>ARMANDO PIMENTEL: So for wind, and this has been the case for a long time, right, the -- when folks are looking for wind, they're looking out much shorter -- at a much shorter time period. One of the things that I'm honestly most happy about so far in the cycle is we have almost 900 megawatts of wind signed up all ready for 2019 and '20.</p><p>But when you're focused on '17 and '18 and particularly, on wind, there's the current -- there's the -- just the recent history that we announced today of signing 560 megawatts of 2018 wind. And I can tell you that we are working on a pretty decent backlog for additional 2018 wind right now.</p><p>Whether that happens or not, it depends. Customers understand that if they wait a little longer, that the prices could be a little cheaper. And so you're always fighting that. But I was very pleasantly surprised with the 566 megawatts we signed for 2018 this past quarter. And my expectation is that, that number in 2018 will continue to go up just as it has in the past, just because wind has a shorter time frame.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER JAMES TURNURE: Is it fair to say that just kind of the higher half or the upper half of the range is still achievable for '17 to '18?</p><p>ARMANDO PIMENTEL: It's -- I think honesty, all of the numbers in that range are achievable. And if all I wanted to do was to meet the higher end of the range on wind for '17 and '18, I'm -- we could probably do that. But that's not necessarily always the right thing to do, right?</p><p>I mean, you may be talking customers into building something in 2019 and 2020 because it's better economics for us honestly than it could be for 2018. So every situation is different. Again, I'm happy at this point that we've signed almost 900 megawatts for '19 and '20 and that we still have a pretty decent backlog of '18 opportunities that we have been shortlisted on.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER JAMES TURNURE: Okay, that's helpful color. And then maybe, John or Jim, given the stock performance has been a strong as it has year-to-date, just kind of maybe going back to an earlier question on cash return versus dividend or incremental investment opportunities versus buybacks, does the stock performance kind of lower the hurdle to deploy capital into other investments or to return cash to shareholders through a bigger dividend increase maybe than previously expected?</p><p><person><nameText>JAMES L. ROBO</nameText></person>: So Chris, this is Jim. Listen, we remain very disciplined in how we evaluate all our incremental opportunities. We're looking hard at a lot of different things to continue to deploy that excess balance sheet capacity very profitably for us going forward and that's going to be our focus.</p><p>But as always, we're not going to do dumb stuff either. We're going to be very disciplined about it. And we'll -- on the dividend, we'll be -- we just had a discussion with the board about the dividend in October. We'll have another one in December, and we'll be coming out with our post-2018 dividend policy in February once we -- once the board finalizes where they're going to come out on that. So more to come on the dividend.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Thank you for your participation.

I'm happy to give the floor to the CEO of ING, Ralph Hamers. Go ahead, sir.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS, CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD &amp; CEO, ING GROEP N.V.: Okay. Thank you, operator. Well, warm welcome. Thank you, for joining us.</p><p>We'll give you an update of the developments, our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. With me are Koos Timmermans, our CFO, and Steven Rijswijk, our CRO.</p><p>As you all know, the third quarter for us was deeply marked by settlement with the Dutch justice department and it's sincerely regretful that there is short-comings in the execution of polices to prevent financial economic crime that were identified at ING in the Netherlands. Yes, we take this very seriously. We accept full responsibility for this. Not meeting standards for securing the integrity of the financial system is just unacceptable.</p><p>We didn't wait for the fine to come out to start our enhancement process. We are enhancing our customer due diligence files where necessary. For the last year-and-a-half already that program is running. We're also working on various structure improvements on our compliance policies in terms of the policies, the tooling, the monitoring and the governance as well.</p><p>Now despite this serious setback in this quarter on the other side we can be proud of the hard work of our colleagues, dealing with clients on one side, answering them, but on the other side also dealing with clients that result in continued commercial momentum, and that is what we have shown as well in the third quarter. We saw growth in primary customers by 200,000 to 12.2 million.</p><p>We saw a continuation of the growth on the lending side. Net core lending was well diversified and grew by EUR 6.8 billion. Customers have their confidence is us and did deposit EUR 3.4 billion with us. All of that leading to an underlying pretax result of EUR 2.1 billion for the quarter which is a 6.5% improvement against a year ago.</p><p>Now, as I said this result, the financial result reflects continued business growth and resilient margins. Margins are well-managed. It's also a low-risk cost environment and a strong expense control. And you can actually see expenses going down for us the last quarter.</p><p>The net result was of course impacted by the EUR 775 million settlement agreement that we have with the Dutch authorities and therefore came out as EUR 776 million.</p><p>The underlying return on equity was 10.7% which is actually up. And the capital position remains strong, which was also very good, at a level of 14%.</p><p>[For underlying], financially -- financially and commercially we see a very solid quarter, but regrettably it is a quarter which has 2 different sides. With that very short introduction we are happy to take your questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from [Mr. Rubin Eck], The Telegraph.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Could you share some more light on the division's financial market which is a bleeder at the moment? Could you tell what's happening there? And also a more forward-looking statement?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Yes, so the -- more forward-looking statement, we never do. And there is -- thanks -- thanks for the question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Well, you can always try.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Yes, yes, yes, yes. But okay, so let's look at financial markets. So the business that we do in financial markets as ING is one that is concentrating in the foreign exchange area, how do you kind of help your clients hatch foreign exchange exposure, how do you -- how do you help your clients hatch interest rate exposure. And then we have a business in what we call GSF. I mean, those are kind of the big -- I mean, there is more businesses but these are the big contributors to the financials markets business. Now, within the financial markets business we see already for quite some quarters that given the -- there is a lot of kind of volatility in the stock markets and there is quite some foreign exchange volatility in some markets, overall there is not a lot of volatility, specifically not in the [rate] market. And therefore you don't see a lot of demand from customers for hedges. And that actually makes that volumes of business -- the volume of business coming through to financial markets activities is -- are lower than it used to be 1, 2 years ago. So 2 years ago, I think. And that basically gives a result that is below our hurdles. Now if you look at financial markets and what we do beyond the way we qualify it and report it within Wholesale Banking but also the activities that we do for mid corporates in financial markets. The return of that franchise on an annualized basis is between 3% and 4% which still makes it a bleeder because it's not making a hurdle of 10%. But it's not like it is a loss-generating business. It is a profitable business. But for the amount of capital that you need to hold for these activities, we're not making the right returns. So there is couple of ways to go about this. First one is you restructure, and that's what we did. So we centralized most of our training activities in London. As you know, from Amsterdam and Brussels into London. And with that you try to work on the cost side. You continue to work on the cost side by further standardizing the systems, which is what we have been doing over the last couple of years and we will continue to do so as well. But you can't solve this only on the cost side. So you will also have to look at the income side and at the return side. And for that, either you stop real businesses or you wait for better times to come, times in which there is client demand for hedges, and they will come back. But at this moment, you're right, I mean, the division is not performing well enough in order to make the return hurdles on the capital that we have to allocate to that business. So yes, it is one that we -- that is in our focus to improve.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible) knows that as a -- the trading activities have to go back from the U.K. to the EU which would mean more cost because of reinvestments you had to do to bring everything to London and then bringing it back would be (inaudible). You have any comments on that? And can you also shed some light in where you are in thinking what to do to stop certain activities or just to sit back and wait it out?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Yes, no, so we're -- so I can't allude as to what we're doing. Really we're looking at all different options. We're in the middle of that process to review. And you will hear at the moment that has any kind of major impact. For sure, we will then, if that happens -- if that happens we will -- you will hear so. Now on the other discussion, which is basically the discussion that all banks have with the SSM as to the location of some of the risk-taking and the risk management activities in financial markets and showing that some of that if it is related to the EU 27 business that is located on the continent. That is certainly a discussion that we're having. It's something that we won't comment on because we never comment on discussions that we have with our regulator. But the -- this will not kind of have a material impact on the business case that was underlying centralization in London. So it's not going to really hamper that business case centralization in London. And with the move to London business case risk factors is still valid.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay. So you're staying in London. There is no question that you would leave.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: We are centralized in London, so I mean the question is just is there specific activities that you need to bring on to the continent, but that will not hamper, that will not kind of influence the business case so much that you wouldn't want to be in London, no.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from [Mr. Kune Hasan], [The Follox Grunt].</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I was wondering, because you're saying that expenses have been going down during the last 3 months, but at the same time I would expect that the costs of these measures against -- to -- because of the settlement, for example, the extra monitoring and the personnel expenses in Amsterdam, I would expect these costs to rise. How -- how can you -- would you explain how it comes that the costs still are getting lower?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: I mean there is -- on the cost that we report on is a lump sum of cost of ING across the globe. And we're active in 42 countries, as you know. So if cost go up in one market doesn't mean that overall our costs go up. Or if costs go down in one market our overall costs go down, so that's one. Secondly, the improvement program, the enhancement program around KYC and monitoring client activity, monitoring, that's not something new. I mean we didn't start at the moment the settlement came out. I mean shortcomings were very evident. And we did the investigation together with the prosecutor and therefore we started that enhancement program already early 2017. So clearly we are investing in this area of compliance. We are -- increase the number of people active in compliance. And just to give you an idea in the numbers, we have increased that from 150 in 2010 -- 2010 to 450 as we speak. And globally, from 600 in 2010 to now 1,800 globally. So it's not kind of there is -- that there is going to be a sudden cost peak and cost increase. But yes, compliance and making sure that we do play a role as a gatekeeper seriously and that we do play it well is costing. But at the same time, as you know, we are transforming. We have heavy investments on the digital side. And that is also reducing cost. So the sum of the 2 may still lead to an overall decrease which is happening in this quarter. But having said that, the actual penalty or the actual fine is taken out of the profit this quarter. I mean, it is not reported on the cost line, it's reported as a special item. But it hurts and it's supposed to hurt.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes, yes, but during the next quarters we won't see extra continued cost rising?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Well, as I said, you will see some cost categories going down and the cost of running a program like this, and you can certainly expect to be at high level and sometimes increase because this is an important role to fulfill and it needs investment going forward as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes, yes. One final question on this. The earlier goal of the reorganization of decreasing 7,000 jobs worldwide and 2,300 in the Netherlands, has this changed because of these, for example, extra compliance personnel?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Well, first I have to correct you. We never indicated that we were cutting 7,000 jobs because of the transformation. We said that 7,000 jobs were going to be affected by the transformation. I mean, and the reason why we said it that way is that, and you can check our FTE numbers, that overall our FTE numbers are not really going down and this is IG as a total. That's because we are creating a lot of jobs as well. The jobs that we're creating are in different areas from (inaudible) not only different geographies but also different areas where we are saving jobs because of digitization. For example, digitization leads to a decrease of operational jobs but we do need more data analytical skills and people in that area. Now so the 7,000 that we announced at that moment, that is what we are still performing on. As to the jobs that will be affected, we are currently, in terms of the reductions, for example, then if it comes to those areas where this will lead to a reduction. In Belgium for the last 2 years this has led to a real decrease of internal FTEs, as we would call that, over 1,150 people as an example of that 7,000 that are affected. But again it's not like (inaudible), yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We have another question coming through from Mr. Rubin Eck, The Telegraph.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Could you \u00c3\u00a2(EURO)\"- could you take us with what has happened in the last quarter in the Dutch business? How did customers react on all the news which came out of ING? I see, for example, that EUR 2 million of the customer deposits have decreased. Could you tell us more about how this went?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: So clearly we have talked to customers and we have also looked social media, Rubin. And clients -- and people have indicated that they weren't happy with the situation at ING and some have certainly also closed their accounts. Now you have a pretty large market share. We have more than 8 million customers as we call them, in the Netherlands. The number of customers on quarter-to-quarter is pretty volatile in itself. But if you look at the underlying development of the primary customers in the Netherlands, we actually see a continuation of an increase if you take it as a trend over the last 3 quarters. And with primary customers, as you know, those are the customers that see us as their primary bank. In terms of the specificity of the savings going down in the third quarter, it's quite a normal seasonal pattern because the third quarter is the holiday quarter, so people do use the money that they get in June, January as a holiday payment or May and June. They consume it in July and August. So as you see some of this going down is more a seasonality effect than anything else.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: One other question about the capital ratios. You do see that core Tier 1 is just a bit above your goals, also the leverage ratio is a little bit above that. How come this is going down? And in what ways are you comfortable with how it's looking at the moment?</p><p>J. V. TIMMERMANS, CFO &amp; MEMBER OF EXECUTIVE BOARD, ING GROEP N.V.: Yes, if you look at the core Tier 1 in this quarter, it went down by 0.1%. And that is basically because we are accruing the remaining profit which was somewhat lower of course after the settlement. But we are accruing that for the dividend. So normally, and that is what we always do, we accrue for the dividend in the first 3 quarters of the year, and then the final quarter is more used for either balance sheet strengthening or for using extra money for the dividend. So this quarter the profit is basically reserved for that. So that doesn't add in the equity. On the other end, what also happened is if you look at foreign exchange and then you look at Turkey but you can also look at the U.S. and if you look at equity stake, so for instance, Bank of Beijing, those 2 led to a slightly more downward pressure on the total core Tier 1 ratio. So overall, we are still 0.5% above our ambition level, which is I would say it's a considerable amount, it's EUR 1.5 billion more than what you normally need or EUR 1.6 billion even. Now the issue is, what we have said is we are looking at this capital more longer-term and we just have to make sure that we will continue at this post Basel IV 13.5 level. And that is what we are doing and that's what we are accumulating money for. If you look at the leverage ratio then you see something else. In the leverage ratio what plays a role of course is both your total amount of equity but also your balance sheet size. And for instance, if we have more old money with, for instance, [BMGS], so that is our bank where we deliver cash pooling services for our clients. If they have higher balances then under the new rules this is also part of the leverage ratio. And that plays a role. And that's why, for instance, per quarter it might fluctuate because these -- yes, you have these amount in there as well.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: (inaudible), Rubin. I mean, sort of 13.5 is our ambition. We managed -- we want to manage it around 13.5. Doesn't mean that we would kind of -- that we wouldn't allow it to go below, because in the end the regulatory minimum is 11.8, right. So the regulatory minimum is 11.8. And we basically want to steer away and stay away from that level. That's why we have said, well, we want to manage it around 13.5. So we're well beyond the 13.5 as to where we want to be.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay, yes. And because the loan book is growing and the risk for that makes your capital ratio go lower because you want to use the money for dividend payout.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Well, in the first 3 quarters that's how we reserve our profits. In the fourth quarter you will then see a surplus of profit then going to the capital and then you see it going up again, yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question is from Mr. Kune Hasan, The Follox Grunt.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I have another question on Turkey. This summer there was a lot of noise about the potential problems and losses over there. Now it seems at least in your numbers that this may have been a bit exaggerated. What do you think about it? And do you think that we have seen the main -- the main crisis over there already or can it become worse?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: It's good question. Steven is going to answer that.</p><p>STEVEN J. A. VAN RIJSWIJK, CHIEF RISK OFFICER &amp; MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD, ING GROEP N.V.: Yes. Thank you. So from a macroeconomic point of view, Turkey is in more difficult periods and that is not over yet, they are in the midst of it. Although I must say that the Turkish Central Bank has put the initial right steps in place actually support the country. At the same point in time, we have already been managing our exposure and the way that we deal with individual clients for the last couple of years. So for example, we have been very strict on focusing on foreign currency lending for clients locally. We only focus on the large clients which have foreign currency income then give them also foreign currency lending otherwise there is a mismatch. That's one. Two, we typically, if you look at retail, so mortgages, that's only a local currency. If you look at small business, that's only in local currency because they largely make also local currency income. The larger company we focus on foreign currency lending. That's one. Two, we have been regularly decreasing our intercompany lending from Amsterdam to Turkey. At the end of last year that was EUR 4.1 billion and that has gone down to EUR 3.4 billion and we continue to bring that gradually down. But we still would like to support our clients in Turkey both foreign, so non-Turkish companies in Turkey doing business there as well as Turkish companies doing business here in Europe. So we need to do it in a balanced way and we need to pay continuous attention. But other than, we are focused on that continuously and have to pay a big compliment to the local team who have been managing that already very well for past 2 years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: One further question. Which of your other more important markets do you see potential problems on this -- on this thing? I read something about Romania. Maybe there is China.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: No. So I think, Kune, if we (inaudible) clearly you can have a long discussion about trade war and the effect it will have on the -- on global growth. But there is not a lot of markets apart from the couple of emerging markets that were already hit hard in the summer. Argentina, Brazil, Turkey that were hit hard that we can expect further deterioration or so. In Turkey, as Steven has indicated which is a large market for us, that in comparison it is small for our total book. The book seems to be -- the local seems to be holding up quite well. And that's because of all these things that Steven was indicating. And Europe in general, including Poland and Romania, if there was anything in Europe that spoiled the party is geopolitical risk either coming from Brexit and then more hard Brexit in a way that we don't know how to manage, but honestly we are prepared for that. And geopolitical risk coming from Italy as we know which gives rise to a weakness to euro a little bit. But immediate crisis, no.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question is from [Mr. Archie Weinstike], [ABN Financial Group].</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I would like to start with a question about the treasury related income in the quarter, which according to some analysts is the main like, yes, higher-than-expected results. Could you explain a little bit what's -- what that is?</p><p>J. V. TIMMERMANS: Sure. It is not the main part. But indeed there was a bit of headwind on the treasury side. And what you are seeing is roughly speaking we have the [residues] which we use to hedge our currency. For instance, we take deposit in Czech koruna and we convert them to euros. For that we use a swap and that swap has a bit more value. Similarly, U.S. dollars, we do euro-dollar swap to fit into our dollar business. Those swaps are mark-to-market. And in general that gives us a bit more money. And that was in this case, it is around EUR 60 million that you have derivatives not in hedge accounting which are supporting the results. And the other part in there is we have derivatives which we use for hedging and we have hedged items. Now the hedged items, that is for instances mortgages, derivative we use for hedging are valued against a different curve and that it is technically called OIS curve. And that gives also some results. The characterization of all of this is 2 things. One, this can a little bit go up and down. And secondly, over time is always pulls [two part]. So you have a quarter up, you have it a quarter down. And so in that sense it's a bit, yes, unavoidable type of noise in your hedging activities. But it's again, it is relatively a sizeable number, but at the same time I wouldn't say it is sort of the biggest contributor to the results.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Maybe I knew in advance. I shouldn't have gone into that detail, but thank you.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: It's okay, no, no\u00c3\u00a2(EURO)\u00c2\u00a6</p><p>J. V. TIMMERMANS: (inaudible) like it.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Don't worry, don't worry about it. If you go through the results so the income line is, it's a bit of a beat, so basically a bit better than expected on the back of the growth and good margin. So the margins were kept up. The fee income is a bit better than the market expected which shows that we're turning around the model from a savings bank to a full-fledged digital primary bank and we are selling other products now as well which generate some fees. And the fact that the cost decreased. Now on the treasury side as Koos explained, yes, it's certainly a quarter that looks positive. But some of these elements, as he says, is well over time are neutral. So you will see them then also being a little bit more negative in some other quarters. Over time they have zero result because they are there are to hedge some of our books, and in some quarters they give a positive result and in other quarters they may give a less positive or even a negative result.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: If I could, maybe a totally different type of question. There has been some critique maybe that, well that recent problems including the compliance issue, but also in the IT transformance in the Belgium and maybe also more general that, yes, it seems that ING is maybe focusing too much on IT integration and too little on banking. Do you recognize this criticism? And do you -- maybe -- are you maybe changing course as a result?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: I don't think that banks have a choice because I do think that banking is digital and the future of banking is digital and therefore IT is, technology is a crucial component going forward even on those elements that you mentioned. Now, the part that you mentioned in terms of the IT risk that was reported on in one of the newspapers, I was completely taken out of context and the way we do manage these transformation programs is that we already before we start these programs we make our own kind of summary of where we expect some of the risk to be because you are going through a major transformation. And we do report it to our people that with the programs that they run and the projects that they deliver on and the money they have to insist that that should really go at those areas where we expect some of these increased risks while going through a transformation. And that's exactly what they're doing. But for example, if you -- for example, if you allude to the compliance issues, I think a large part of compliance issues can only be resolved as to where society expects us to be -- to be -- for them to be resolved through technology because if you have to -- and I'm just taking them in Netherlands, if you have to analyze 4 billion payments per annum and you have to analyze those payments against the activity of a client, then there's no other way than using technology to help you and get to interpretation of some of this. And on the back of that, generate your alerts to the [FIUs]. So even in those areas, yes, I mean, it is people, it is skilled people, it is cultural mindset, it has also quite some technology investment that you need to be -- to do in order to get to that level where I think we need to get it as a gatekeeper and play our gatekeeper role as (inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay, thank you. Maybe finally, if I can, would you give some, maybe some update on the state of play where it comes to the competition, expected competition from big tech companies. Do you still have the same opinion on, yes, where banking is going and on the role that ING can play there?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Yes, banks in general, ING specifically for sure. If you look at the trends in terms of customer behavior, then you see that customers deal with us increasingly digital. And just to give you a couple of numbers, we have 3 billion moments of contact a year with our customers as ING-only, 3 billion interactions with our customers. More than 99% of those interactions are through mobile, whether it's your iPad or your phone and your smartphone, more than 99%. Another number to give you is that out of the 38 million customers that we have, more than 20% have never interacted with us or other than through a tablet or a smartphone. Kind of shows that banking and generally banking is done through tablet and iPhones going forward. Now all these people expect from a bank a service level that they are used to also from the global techs which is a service level that is personal, that is instant, and that's why we are happy to deliver these instant payments in the Netherlands going forward, relevant and seamless. So that is the experience they expect from banks digitally. Then you have 2 kind of source of competition for banks other than banks themselves which is the fintechs which we see more like players in the market that can help us to build our own experience towards our clients, the big techs, the Googles, the Amazons, Facebooks of worlds who are in daily touch with our clients already and can easily extend their services to include banking. We see that. We see that Amazon is active in banking. We see that Apple Pay is increasingly accepted. Although they don't have a banking license, Amazon does have and is looking at payments licensing as well. Alibaba has full-fledged money market management activity, WeChat as well. So for them it's very easy to include banking service in their offering and therefore they are a major competitor and vis-\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a0-vis our clients. Now what we argue is that we are happy with competition, any kind of competition, but that should also be on a level playing field. And some of the regulations that are coming through, like [PEC2] don't create a level of playing field. They're very one-sided regulations where basically we are put at a disadvantage vis-\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a0-vis these large players.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And is there any development there? Or will that remain for the foreseeable future?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Well, I think -- well, I think that we have brought some of this under the attention of the respective politicians and they do see it now. But they see the ultimate (inaudible) platforms and the sheer size they had but also the sheer influence they have over consumers, that that there is something that one way or the other needs to be regulated, if that's what you want to call it. And I do think there is an increasing awareness, there's a need for that. Having said that, it's not in the works. So we see it, but for the moment we'll have to work on open banking and PEC2. And that's, as far as reality that we'll have to work with.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have a follow-up question from Mr. Rubin Eck, Telegraph.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Perhaps bit of a strange question, but how is the board doing? I mean, there is -- you've been in the center of the storm from the beginning of this year. Koos is stepping down, the whole company is looking at you. How is it going?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Well, Rubin, this is -- if you go through this experience and you have to kind of come out with a -- the result of an investigation and a settlement like this, it's painful, it's painful for our clients, it's painful for our colleagues, it's painful for us as leaders as well. And clearly it's in one side kind of makes you extra motivated to ensure that going forward you do it well, and the other aside it's something that you have to cope with for some time as well. And also this is what we're going through, but the whole company is going through it and but we use it for the better. We use it as a motivator to take on compliance as one of those categories that really have become part of our DNA, like bankers have grown up to become good credit decision-makers or how we managed market risk. We really have to get the whole area of knowing your client so early and knowing the activities of your clients so early, has to become part of the DNA of a banker. And that is crucial. And that will take some time. But for that we do have the programs, and I will go through that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes, I'm also asking because a lot of analysts had expected you would do less this quarter than you have done. So was it easy? Or in what way was it difficult to keep your focus also on the business while there are any other stuff [as we call it]?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Well, I think Rubin it's a combination of 2 things. First you do see that, the transformation that we've started already 5 years ago and that we accelerated 2 years ago that is bearing fruit, its bearing fruit in terms of how we deal with our clients, the experience that we offered and that promoter scores that are in which we're #1 in 7 or 13 countries is our leading indicators for our continuous growth on one side. The other side, as I also said, is that focus on compliance, the improvement of the files, investment in activity monitoring and activity monitoring is not something that just started because of settlement itself. It's already started more than 18 months ago. So also there the modus operandi within the organization, we include those activities. And clearly that will be stretched even more as we go and with new technologies coming in. But that's -- that was already there and that will continue so as well. So it's not like from an operational perspective this is now a sudden shock. I mean, as said, 18 months ago, more than 18 months ago we already started in many areas to improve what we were doing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: How is actually the search for a new CEO going?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Yes, so that process has started and we're in the middle of the process. So we can't comment on that any further than that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay. All right. One last thing, I understood next year you're organizing a new Capital Markets Day. What's on the program?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Yes. What's on the program. So this is in March. We saw that was -- it would be good to give an update to our investors. And I'm sure you will be invited as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Sure, wonderful.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: To the program because we always have a media part of that as well. So we launch the acceleration of our think-forward strategy the end of 2016. This is a program that runs into 2020, '21 on some elements. And we think that giving a heads up to our analysts in early 2019 is a good moment because we're kind of just in the middle of the program and we can actually show some of the results of that transformation coming through if it comes to digitalization, new initiatives that we have taken across with fintechs and on the wholesale banking side as well as on the retail banking side how we deal with our -- how the experience is digitalin different apps. So we'll have a couple of deep dives into programs and a couple of showcases as well for analysts. And you need to have a regular update with your analysts and through them with your shareholders anyway on what your plans are.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes. And there also on that day updates to be expected about, for example, capital markets, so the wholesale banking which are of course elements which are under the -- well, under stress at the moment?</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Yes. So there will be an update on all of our businesses at that moment, so including that. The things that do well and the things that need improvement will certainly all be addressed there.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) There are no further questions coming through. Sir, please continue.</p><p>RALPH A. J. G. HAMERS: Okay. Thanks all then. I just like to thank you once again for showing your interest in ING and being with us today to go through our third quarter results. As I said in the beginning, clearly this quarter has 2 sides and clearly the quarter itself was overshadowed by -- marked by the settlement that we -- that we have made with the Dutch justice department. The consequence, the number one priority was already and will continue to be the enhancement of our customer due diligence files where necessary, working on structural improvements whether it's on policies and tooling and things I've mentioned before, that's really crucial. On the other side, it's good to see that the commercial momentum is being there, that the transformation program is bearing fruit. We see continued growth in primary customers in many different countries across the globe, continuous growth in lending and deposits, good -- and that combined with good expense controls and that to a good result and a continuous strong capital. Thanks a lot. And if there is any further questions during the day, you know that our media team is always available.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference to Amber Ossman, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p><p>AMBER OSSMAN, DIRECTOR, INVESTOR RELATIONS, PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networksfiscal third quarter 2018 financial results.

MCLAUGHLIN, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.: Thank you, Amber, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning for our fiscal third quarter 2018 results. Before getting to the results for the quarter, I'd like to start by welcoming Nikesh, who will succeed me as Chairman and CEO of the company this week. I've been working with the Board of Directors over the past several quarters on a succession plan after having had the incredible privilege of leading the team here for nearly 7 years. I'm immensely proud of all the team has accomplished in that time, and the company is on very strong footing and well positioned for the future. In Nikesh, we found a leader who's ideally suited to take the company on the next leg of its journey of rapid market share gains with our security operating platform. His experience at Google as the Chief Business Officer as well as his experience as the President of SoftBank brings demonstrated abilities to scale at rapid rates and run very large and fast-growing global organizations. I'll be working with Nikesh over the coming months to assist in the transition, and I'll remain with the company as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors supporting Nikesh and the team with our mission of protecting our way of life in the digital age.</p><p>Welcome to the team, Nikesh, and congratulations.</p><p><person><nameText>NIKESH ARORA, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN AND CEO, PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.: Thanks, Mark. This is Day minus 2 for me on the job, so all I can talk about are my impressions. I've had the pleasure and privilege of getting to know the Palo Alto team, the board and the company over the last few months. The more time I spend, the more excited I get about the space, about the company and the people. It is clear to me that we're still in the very early stages of the cloud revolution for enterprises. I was fortunate enough to see it early at Google and participate in the growth and scaling there. I think we have a very, very similar opportunity here. I think cybersecurity is one of the most exciting spaces out there.</p><p>For me, even more exciting is to be able to see firsthand what Nir, you and the team here have built. This company, for me, is truly unique. Your growth is testament of the quality of the offering, your customer centricity as well as the execution capability that you have built over the last 7 years.</p><p>For me, great companies are built by collecting great people, motivating them towards a common mission with the right set of values, and it's evident to me that the members of the Palo Alto Networksteam are those people. I couldn't be more excited and honored to become part of the Palo Alto Networksteam and work with the leadership to continue to build on the good work that you have done and cement the company's position as a leader in the security space.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Thanks again, Nikesh. Welcome again. With that, let's turn to the quarter. I'm very pleased with the strong results we delivered on our third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 revenue grew 31% to $567.1 million. Billings were up 33% to $721 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.3% and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.99.</p><p>We are seeing strong global demand for our security operating platform due to the ever-accelerating and rapidly evolving threat landscape and the resulting significant consequences to businesses that lose the trust of their customers. As our results show, our competitive advantage is increasingly evident. The ecosystem leverage of our platform is growing rapidly, and we continue to capture market share at high rates and at very large scale.</p><p>We had another strong quarter of new customer additions and are pleased to now serve approximately 51,000 customers around the world. In addition to robust new customer acquisition, we also continue to rapidly increase our wallet share in existing customers. Our top 25 customers, all of which made a purchase this quarter, spent a minimum of $28.7 million in lifetime value in Q3, a 43% increase over the $20.1 million in Q3 of fiscal '17.</p><p>Some examples of customer wins and competitive displacements in the quarter include beating Cisco to become the security standard in both a global leader in the hospitality and entertainment industry as well as a leading cloud-based provider of benefits and HR solutions; a Check Point replacement in the data center at one of EMEA's largest defense system manufacturers and a competitive win against both Check Point and Cisco to become the public cloud security standard for one of the largest U.S. health care providers; also competitive wins against Symantec to become the endpoint security vendor on tens of thousands of workstations to secure a U.S. statewide education system as well as Zscaler with our new GlobalProtect cloud service to secure more than 1,500 stores of a large U.S.-based retailer.</p><p>Customer and prospect interest and engagement in our security operating platform is very high. We were pleased to host a record crowd of over 4,000 customers and partners recently at our annual Ignite User Conference in Anaheim. At Ignite, we showcased the continued strong momentum around our platform capabilities, including the third evolution, which is the Application Framework. The Application Framework fundamentally changes the entire consumption model in security, and we were delighted to have over 30 companies, such as Microsoft, ServiceNow and Proofpoint as well as leading, highly innovative startups like Phantom, which Splunk just acquired, preview their applications. The Application Framework marries security innovation and ease of consumption, which is a compelling value proposition for our customer base and is helping to drive purchases of the foundational elements of our security operating platform in the network, on endpoints and in the cloud.</p><p>In the network, the introduction of PAN-OS 8.1, in addition to the new hardware delivered over the past 15 months, including the most recent PA-3200 series, the PA-5280 and the ruggedized PA-220, allows us to reach new customers while driving expansion sales and opening new use cases in existing customers. These appliances offer customers increased SSL decryption capabilities, higher performance and capacity and superior price performance, and they serve as critical sensors for log collection and enforcement points for the Application Framework.</p><p>And on endpoints, we were pleased to announce the release of Traps version 5.0 in March, which brings a new level of functionality to our Advanced Endpoint Protection offering. Customers can now utilize our cloud-delivered management service, which allows for easier deployment and day-to-day management.</p><p>Also, with the addition of Linux support, Traps now plays a major role in securing cloud applications. We continue to see strong momentum with Traps and are receiving market validation as a leading endpoint security vendor.</p><p>In April NSS Labs' independent evaluation of Advanced Endpoint Protection offerings, Traps garnered a recommended rating. Their report evaluated 20 different vendors looking specifically at protection against a variety of malware, exploits, blended threats and evasions. Traps blocked 100% of evasions and exploits with 0 false positives, and the report identified Traps as having the most favorable rating when weighing overall effectiveness and total cost of ownership.</p><p>We also announced the acquisition of Secdo in April. Secdo brings leading endpoint detection response capabilities to Traps. Secdo's unique thread level approach to data collection and visualization goes beyond traditional EDR methods and will also feed into our Logging Service, giving applications running in the Application Framework greater precision to detect and stop cyberattacks across our entire platform.</p><p>For cloud security, we have shown that you must protect all applications and all platforms through the combination of inline, host and API-based security, which we do through our VM-Series, Traps and Aperture offerings. And we're excited in the quarter to acquire Evident.io, a leader in public cloud infrastructure security.</p><p>With Evident, we now provide continuous monitoring of public cloud deployments, cloud storage protection and compliance validation and reporting. Customers can now better understand how applications are being deployed and used in our cloud environments, produce detailed compliance reporting and achieve an overall superior security posture for cloud deployments. We will also be able to leverage the data collected from Evident's consistent monitoring to enhance the effectiveness of other applications in the Application Framework. We've seen very good traction already with Evident, both in terms of customer interest and pipeline.</p><p>We are helping our customers solve their most pressing security needs and drive digital transformation through security transformation. As we head into the end of our fiscal 2018, we're excited about the significant and growing total addressable market for security, our leading position in the market and the growing competitive advantages we are driving through our security operating platform.</p><p>I want to once again thank our team and partners for their ongoing hard work and dedication to our mission of protecting our way of life in the digital age and our customers who place their trust in us every day.</p><p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?</p><p>KATHLEEN BONANNO, CFO &amp; EXECUTIVE VP, PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.: Thank you, Mark, and welcome, Nikesh.</p><p>Before I start, I'd like to note that except for revenue and billing, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are compared to the prior year periods unless stated otherwise.</p><p>In the third quarter, we drove robust top line growth with both new and existing customers adopting offerings across the full breadth of our security operating platform. We once again delivered market-leading revenue growth in combination with year-over-year operating margin expansion and earnings per share growth. I'm pleased with our results. And as we look to the remainder of fiscal '18, we are well positioned to deliver a strong finish to the year.</p><p>In Q3 '18, total revenue grew 31% to $567.1 million. By geography, Q3 revenue grew 29% in the Americas, 35% in EMEA and 37% in APAC. Q3 product revenue of $215.2 million grew 31% compared to the prior year. Q3 SaaS-based subscription revenue of $192.5 million increased 38%. Support revenue of $159.4 million increased 25%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $351.9 million increased 32% year-over-year and accounted for a 62% share of total revenue.</p><p>Turning to billings. Q3 total billings of $721 million increased 33%. The recently announced acquisitions were not material for revenue and billings in the quarter.</p><p>Total deferred revenue at the end of Q3 was $2.2 billion, an increase of 34%. Gross margin was 76.2%, a decline of 20 basis points compared to last year. Q3 operating expenses were $316.6 million or 55.9% of revenue, which is a 210 basis point improvement year-over-year driven primarily by ongoing increasing leverage in sales and marketing. Operating margin was 20.3%, an increase of 190 basis points year-over-year and includes approximately $3 million of operating expense related to M&amp;A.</p><p>We ended the third quarter at 5,121 employees. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter grew 67% to $95.1 million or $0.99 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis for the third quarter, net loss declined 23% to $46.7 million or $0.51 per basic and diluted share. This includes a loss of $23.8 million due to updated sublease estimates associated with the company's former headquarters and $13.3 million in acquisition-related expenses.</p><p>Turning to cash flows and balance sheet items. We finished April with cash and cash equivalents and investments of $2.2 billion, which takes into account approximately $375 million of cash consideration for acquisitions during the quarter.</p><p>Q3 cash flow from operations of $241.3 million increased 14%. Free cash flow was $212.5 million, up 31% at a margin of 37.5%. These numbers include approximately $10.6 million of operating cash outflow related to M&amp;A for acquisition-related costs and ongoing operating expenses. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $28.8 million. DSO was 58 days, a decline of 20 days from the prior year period.</p><p>Turning now to guidance and modeling points. Please remember, this guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Amber referred to earlier.</p><p>For the fiscal Q4 '18, we expect revenue to be in the range of $625 million to $635 million, an increase of 23% to 25% year-over-year; product revenue to be in the range of $246 million to $249 million, an increase of 16% to 17% year-over-year; billings to be in the range of $815 million to $830 million, an increase of 22% to 24% year-over-year. We plan to invest between $10 million to $12 million or $0.08 to $0.10 per share related to our recent acquisitions. With this investment, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.17 using approximately 97 million to 99 million shares.</p><p>For the full year fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.240 billion to $2.250 billion, representing growth of 27% to 28% year-over-year; product revenue to be in the range of $850 million to $853 million, representing growth of approximately 20% year-over-year; billings to be in the range of $2.807 billion to $2.822 billion, representing growth between 22% and 23% year-over-year; non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.86 to $3.89 using 95 million to 96 million shares, which includes our acquisition-related investments in the fourth quarter. And we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million.</p><p>Before I conclude, I'd like to provide some additional modeling points. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes the impact of our recent acquisitions and assumes that we will be at the lower end of our gross margin range. Our Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate will be 22%, and our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%. And we expect fiscal year free cash flow margins to be in the range of 39% to 40%, which includes approximately $30 million of cash expenditures associated with acquisitions. Excluding the acquisitions, we expect full year fiscal 2018 free cash flow margin of between 40% to 41%.</p><p>With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>KEITH WEISS, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mark, it's been a pleasure working with you and sorry to see you go. But it does seem like you guys got a really solid replacement in Nikesh, and welcome onboard. I guess, a high-level question on the performance in the quarter. 31% product growth is something we haven't seen from Palo Alto in a while. But even more so, it's something we're not really seeing across the board in terms of your peers who seem to be struggling to sort of sustain any really type of growth in their core markets. Can you talk to us a little bit about sort of what's kind of creating that separation between you and your peers and how durable you think that is on a going-forward basis and to what degree the messaging around security operating platform is playing into that separation?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Sure. Thanks, Keith, and thanks for the kind words. I appreciate that. The -- well, as you can see, the product growth is very strong. Platform growth is very strong. And I think it's really important for us to understand inside the company, outside the company as well, the whole concept of security operating platform is resonating very well. As we've talked about before with the 3 evolutions, with the Application Framework being the third one right now, the customers that we speak with, the prospects we speak with almost unanimously across the board really resonate with that. It's an answer to a significant, significant problem about how do you get more automation and how do you get less complexity in their environments. They like it a lot. Now they realize as well that in order to do that or achieve the most value from that, it will become increasingly important that they, in essence, standardize on Palo Alto Networksin all the positions for data centers and enforcement points, which is in the network, on the endpoint and in the cloud. And of course, we need to every single day of the week be the very best at all those positions as well on a -- I'll call them a stand-alone basis, which we're very confident. And you can see that from the release of the hardware, the operating system releases, the new version of Traps, the Evident acquisition, things we're doing at every one of the positions to make sure we win head to head across. But I would say that it seems that to me, and I think the team here who spends a lot of time with customers, the concept of the Application Framework, the third evolution and getting consistency across the entire platform is working very well and driving purchases of all the underlying aspects.</p><p>KEITH WEISS: Got it. And if I could sneak in one follow-up. Nikesh, although definitely has a great record as a leader, not a traditional security pick. Maybe Mark, as your new position as Vice Chairman of the Board, if you could give us some visibility into how the -- how the board got comfort in sort of having a nontraditional security leader be leading up what is still a very much a security-focused company.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Sure. And security will continue to be our focus, so let me be clear about that, and thanks for the question. The -- yes, as I was talking with the board over the last several quarters about succession planning -- it's been amazing to run the company for the past 7 years or so. I said we would want to make a change at the right time. There's no hurry for this. I was basically saying if we find the right person at the right time, we would do it. That had us thinking, of course, about what does the future look like. When we look at the company, we have 5,000-plus security professionals in the company. They're best in the world, starting with Nir and Lee and other folks in the team. We have some of the best operating executives in Ren\u00c3\u00a9 and Mark Anderson and folks who are very committed to the company, which is fantastic. So security is something we know genetically and from a DNA perspective. So we start to think about where the company's going to look like in 5 years from today. I would garner to say that it's more of the security operating platform I just laid out. It's got a lot to do with massive datasets with analytics, with the infrastructure required to support those, the cloud, SaaS. It's very clear that security is heading in that direction and that we're forcing it in that direction as a company. So that really informed our pick for the succession planning, which should be a great, accomplished business leader, somebody who's a culturally great fit and somebody who also has experience ideally with large-scale platforms that have those kind of characteristics. There's not a lot of those platforms in the world. There's not a lot of people who have that kind of experience. We're fortunate to find Nikesh and spend the last few months with him to make sure that we had alignment across all those variables I just laid out. So that was really the thought process, Keith.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.</p><p>PHILIP ALAN WINSLOW, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mark, my congrats again for your move-up to Vice Chairman. I have known you since back at VeriSign. You not only been a super impressive executive, but a real gentleman. So it's been fun, and congrats on your new role.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Thank you, Phil. I'll try to continue to be a gentleman. Yes.</p><p>PHILIP ALAN WINSLOW: Pulled it off well. All right. Yes, just a question on the quarter. Obviously, you noted several competitive displacements and wins sort of across the portfolio. When you think about just the competitive environment out there, particularly from a pricing perspective, there's been a lot of conversation about that, just sort of what have you seen out there? Any changes that you'd highlight sort of across the platform?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, sure. Let me take that first, and I think Mark probably have some good commentary as well. He spends a massive amount of time in the field with the customers. What we're seeing from a pricing perspective is no change in the sense of it's a very competitive market. The competition has always been competitive in pricing. I think they increasingly go to the price card out of desperation in a lot of cases. And what we've seen in our business is being able to sell value first, the security operating platform as being very unique. Nobody can match that. And the third, in doing that and perhaps interestingly, as we have done a very nice job discipline-wise by having discounting improve -- quarter-over-quarter improved again sequentially and year-over-year. So in the face of all that strong competitive pricing pressure, we continue to [sell] the value of the platform. Mark?</p><p>MARK F. ANDERSON, PRESIDENT, PALO ALTO NETWORKS, INC.: Phil, it's Mark Anderson here. So with the last 18 months of product announcements, the hundreds of features that we brought into the platforms that we've -- the hardware platforms that we've replaced, I think price performance-wise, we've got very compelling offers there. But I think most importantly, when customers get a sense for where we're taking security with the third evolution, the Application Framework, I think the kind of future proof nature of us being able to help them distill security innovation into consumable form factors on the Palo Alto Networkskit, I think, is a very compelling proposition. And I think that's something that every customer I talk to takes into consideration when they're making a decision for paying 2 or 3x for Palo Alto Networkswhat our desperate competitors are charging for their stuff.</p><p>PHILIP ALAN WINSLOW: Got it. And just actually a follow-up on the App Framework for my next question here. Wondering if you could give us sort of, I guess, a grade of sort of where you stand so far in the development. And what milestone should we, from the outside looking in, point toward for sort of success there?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. It's a great question, Phil. So first, let me start with where it is. The Application Framework is very real today. We announced it about a year ago, and over the course of the last year have made a lot of progress on a number of things. One is making sure that from an App Framework perspective, the third parties can create apps easily into the framework. The second thing was the development release, and so far very successful launch of the Logging Service, which allows all the data to be collected there. We just had Ignite User Conference last week, and we had over 4,000 folks there and there was 30 companies who were previewing their applications, which was fantastic right there in the demo floor. We really, really liked that the customers saw not only their applications, but also workflow between the applications as well. And we highlighted a number of them on stage just to give a sense of that. We also announced that the Application Framework could be production-ready in August. So very soon, we'll be able to actually use that with customers. So lots of good traction. I would say and people have asked me this before, how do you think about it in the future, let's say, the definitions of success in the Application Framework, which you're driving towards, would be a lot of applications in that framework. And I think somebody said onetime that a real platform is successful when there's more value driven across the top of the platform than the platform itself. So we would expect that over time, customers will get a lot of value from the applications running on top of the framework.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>MATTHEW GEORGE HEDBERG, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I'll offer my congrats to you, Mark, as well. It's certainly been great working with you over the years. And Nikesh, congratulations on the role, excited to see what you bring to the company. Maybe I'll start with Nikesh. Obviously, you mentioned that it's Day minus 2. But your ability to scale businesses at Google was certainly impressive. You mentioned there are some similarities. I'm curious when you did your due diligence, what are some of those similarities you came away with? And any insights in how you think Palo Alto is well positioned to thrive in a public cloud environment?</p><p><person><nameText>NIKESH ARORA</nameText></person>: Thank you, Matt, for asking the question and thank you for your congratulations. As I said, it's Day minus 2, so anything I say is subject to change. So I think the early impressions are, I think there's no question in anybody's mind that we're still early in the cloud revolution, and in the next few decades, we will see almost every company out there having to make that transition. And I think Palo Alto Networks' mission on sort of preserving our digital life and keeping it safe is going to -- in line with that cloud transition. As we go to that transition, huge amounts of datasets are going to be created, people are going to have to keep track a lot of data, we have to apply a lot of AI, machine learning. And just this notion that Mark talked about of sort of migrating or transitioning to an Application Framework where we can bring a best-of-breed and help people to sort of participate with Palo Alto Networksbeing sort of the one who brings this solution to the end customer is extremely empowering and extremely powerful. I think that's sort of my early impression that being able to take the company along that path with the team that is working on those product areas is going to be fundamentally exciting.</p><p>MATTHEW GEORGE HEDBERG: That's great. And then maybe as a follow-up. We continue to hear good things about GlobalProtect. And Mark, you called it out in your prepared remarks, a nice win there. Could you talk a little bit more about the competitive landscape there? Are there some even -- some legacy competitors that you're seeing there? And I guess, just a better sense on pricing for GlobalProtect would be helpful.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, sure. And Matt, we do -- as you know, we have GlobalProtect -- I mean, GlobalProtect cloud service as well, and it's all part of the platform, of course. And over time, what you've seen us do is ensure that customers can use our security operating platform with the appropriate form factor for the appropriate use case, right? So we have hardware in some cases, big hardware, small hardware. We have agents on the endpoint. We have virtual machines in the cloud, API hooks for SaaS applications. And with GlobalProtect cloud service, you have the ability for what we would traditionally call network security to just point it at the cloud and have the full-on next-gen firewall capabilities as well. That's important for branch offices, mobile users and places where you want to reduce your MPLS costs, and customers are reacting very well at that. From a pricing perspective, we're competitive price-wise. As we are with everything in our platform, we can be because we think it's best on a head-to-head basis. And also the value of it being consistent across the platform helps as well, and we've seen really good early success with GlobalProtect cloud service.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.</p><p>ANDREW JAMES NOWINSKI, PRINCIPAL &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY COMPANIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulation, Nikesh, on your appointment. And Mark, it's been a real pleasure working with you over the years. Just a question on -- maybe on virtual firewalls. There's always been a view in the market that the move to the cloud is somewhat bad for security. Can you just give us any color on the demand trends you're seeing on the Virtual firewall side and how they're maybe driving some larger deals?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, sure. It's a really good question. And as Nikesh mentioned a little earlier, the move to the cloud is inevitable. When you look at the amount of IT spend and how much of it is in the cloud today, it's actually pretty small. So I think we're in the early innings of this. And we've seen in our business, again back to the right form factor for the right use case, that the VM-Series is going very well at the inline portion for protection and protecting offerings in the cloud. And that's going very well. That's been, we think, additive to the business so far. We'd expect that to be the case into the future because we see existing customers not only buying VM-Series, but most everything else in the platform along the way, which is fantastic. And we would expect that, that part of our business is going to continue to grow as people continue to -- as well.</p><p>ANDREW JAMES NOWINSKI: Okay, got it. And then I know it's -- the platform and automation, as you said, were driving a lot of the product revenue growth this quarter. But could you maybe give us just an update on where you think we're at with regard to a refresh cycle given the new 3200 Series out in February and you had the 5200 last year? A lot of new appliances in the market, just wondering how much of that's contributing just specifically from the refresh cycle.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. Great question. As you can see from the about 51,000 customers we're serving today, the size of the customer base continues to grow very nicely over time quarter-over-quarter, so the cohorts keep growing over time. As we've said in the past, as these cohorts get bigger and as in the latter years the refresh cycle becomes an increasingly large contributor to the business, we'd expect that would continue into the future. And by giving customers new capability sets not only in the hardware, but also the operating system, and reasons to refresh if they're already a customer or come to us if they're not are very important. The drivers in the hardware side of our business, I think, really fall into 3 categories. The first and I think the most prevalent today is the expansion opportunity with so many customers who are -- where you can see the lifetime value creation goes up very significantly, we think that's the biggest driver. We also have net new customer acquisitions. It's very high. As you can see again from the quarter, that certainly helps. And then the third is refresh, which is performing very well for us. We think that's going to continue to be the case and will continue to grow as a contributor over time.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Jonathan Ho with William Blair.</p><p>JONATHAN FRANK HO, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: Let me echo my congratulations as well. I just wanted to start out with the Application Framework and maybe some of the commonalities that you're seeing with some of the new customers that have signed up and maybe how you think about that from a revenue opportunity as well.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. Jonathan, great question. I described this since we started with the Application Framework as what we inevitably would see as a push-pull on the right. And the push aspect of it is going to be, over time, how much value these applications deliver on the top of the Application Framework. And perhaps someday, we would monetize this. We don't have a plan to do that right now. We think our main focus there should be just growing a very healthy ecosystem of developers, and then we'll see how that transpires over time. The flip of it with the pull, I think, is very evident already for us, which is customers really resonate with the ability to reduce the complexity of their footprint in their -- in all of the network, including cloud and also the simplicity of working with less vendors through a platform, right? And that is driving purchases of all the foundational aspects, which we view as not only fantastic security capabilities themselves, but also data collectors and enforcement positions. So that's in the network, that's on the cloud, it's on the endpoint, and all those are growing very nicely for us.</p><p>JONATHAN FRANK HO: Got it. And then relative to Traps 5.0 and the Secdo acquisition, can you talk a little bit about what new capabilities you're adding here and maybe what challenges you're addressing with that acquisition?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Sure, yes. I think there's 2 ways to think about that, Jonathan. The first and the most probably evident one is that Secdo brings EDR capabilities to Traps. That's an important capability to customers, definitely, one. So our ability to have that is important. We believe that the way that Secdo does EDR is very unique with some very unique thread-level capabilities and visualizations. You'll see that come back into Traps early in the calendar fiscal '19 -- I'm sorry, early calendar '19, and that's what we're going to do with that capability. In addition to that, and I don't know if you were at Ignite or had somebody there, but we also talked about taking the Secdo EDR capability and applying it across the entire platform, so not just endpoints, but also network and cloud as well. This concept we call XDR, meaning across the entire platform, so that you can get the best EDR capabilities everywhere from a security perspective not just on endpoints. We think that's going to be an unmatched capability simply because of the size of the deployments we have in all the data locations.</p><p>OPERATOR: Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs has our next question.</p><p>GABRIELA BORGES, EQUITY ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulations to the team. Maybe for Mark Anderson and maybe Kathy as well. The last time we saw 30%-plus-type product growth were back in 2016, and that was subsequently followed by a little bit of a slowdown. So the question is how you're thinking about managing through tougher comps at a high level going into next year. And a follow-up for Kathy. Just on the incremental investments that you discussed in the prepared remarks in the acquisitions, just a little more on what you're investing in.</p><p>KATHLEEN BONANNO: Thanks for the question. Yes, we're very excited about our product growth this quarter, obviously, very strong number. The platform, as Mark mentioned, is resonating with customers, and the security operating platform is experiencing a lot of interest from customers, both push and the pull side, as Mark mentioned. So we're really happy with the performance of products. We think that we still have a lot of market share opportunity, and we've been growing into that share year after year after year. So we think there's still a lot of opportunity for us to grow, and that growth can be sustainable for years to come. In terms of incremental investments that we're making, we're obviously integrating the newly acquired technology in the case of Secdo into our platform, so that's coming off of the market. And we're working on that integration now. For Evident and Secdo alike, we are working on operationalizing, making sure that we have a great go-to-market plan for both of those product offerings and just overall making sure that we have the right marketing messages, integration and operational plan for those services.</p><p>MARK F. ANDERSON: Gabriela, it's Mark A. here. So I think a couple of things. Our field sales team is really quite disciplined in going after business, both with expansion opportunities with existing customers as well as propositions for new customers, especially ones that are embarking on their own digital transformation journey. I think we provide a consultative type of approach, but it's really a subject matter expert with regards to security in that journey. And it gives us the opportunity to show them how important being able to future proof their investments with, again, access to the Application Framework, like I mentioned earlier. I think also, just hardware cycles come and go. But I think by and large, customers are telling us that our approach to security to provide consistent security everywhere at the endpoint, in the cloud and on-prem in customers perimeters is really differentiated from what our competitors are doing, either by providing an architecture that is just unrivaled out there.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital.</p><p>SAKET KALIA, SENIOR ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats to both of you on your new opportunities. Maybe for you, Mark, I believe several other parts of the Application Framework are going to be generally available here starting in August. Maybe related to Jonathan's questions, can you give us any broad brushes on how the pricing here might work and what you're seeing initially from customers on accepting that different consumption model?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Saket, that's very good question. And yes, probably the best thing to just clarify when we say the Application Framework is production-ready come April, what that means is that third-party applications will be available through the framework. From a pricing perspective, today, the relationship or -- that is between the application provider -- I'm sorry, I said April, I meant August. 10 people give me notes to correct that. In August, I'm sorry. The relationship from a pricing perspective will be through the customer right with the application provider themselves. So that's what it will look like on the beginning, meaning we don't have an intent right now to try to monetize that. From our perspective perhaps over time, like you said, when we're driving a lot of value, we'll be in the position to do that. What we're definitely seeing right now in the business, though, is the pull aspect, which is because of the compelling nature of the idea of being able to actually have a lot of innovation in the market but not have to deploy form factor after form factor to collect data to get one more feature, customers like that a lot. And I think they will standardize on Palo Alto Networks. I think they are standardizing on Palo Alto Networks, and the network increasing, the endpoints and the cloud as well, so that's a driver of our business. I think it's been a driver for the last year. There's lots of other drivers as well, but I think that's a driver that's happening, and I think we're going to see that continue into the future.</p><p>SAKET KALIA: That's helpful. Maybe for my follow-up for you, Kathy. You talked to the impact of that Evident and Secdo we're having here from the EPS perspective in the fourth quarter. Can you give us any broad brushes on any billings or revenue impact it might have either in the quarter or maybe on an annual basis?</p><p>KATHLEEN BONANNO: Yes. On the quarter, the billings and revenue impact was immaterial. Going forward, obviously, we're working on our plans and our go-to-market plans, and we're certainly hoping that we have good revenue and billings performance from both of them. We see a lot of opportunity with both of those products given the demand for cloud, security, and as well the EDR capabilities are going to be a great addition to our endpoint service offering.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI.</p><p>KENNETH RICHARD TALANIAN, ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI, RESEARCH DIVISION: Nikesh, I realized it's early, but could you provide some of your initial thoughts on M&amp;A and general thoughts for the potential for consolidation within the security sector?</p><p><person><nameText>NIKESH ARORA</nameText></person>: Thank you, Kenneth for the question. I think it's inappropriate for me to have thoughts on M&amp;A until I fully understand the entire product offering of Palo Alto Networks, which I do to some extent, but I'm going to spend a lot of time in the early part understanding the company, our priorities and make sure that we continue to execute on the rhythm and pace that Mark has set and what you guys have gotten used to because that's got like a stake on the table that I need to make sure I maintain. And then we'll hopefully, over the future quarters, have more substantive conversation with a lot of you about where we see the opportunity and if we need to do anything or not.</p><p>KENNETH RICHARD TALANIAN: Great. And I guess, as a follow-up, just to circle back around GlobalProtect cloud. Is the primary use case there branch office applications? Or are you seeing broader interest in using the solutions instead of hardware?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. We're seeing a few use cases, primarily, again, early on, one is branch, also second is mobile users as well. So I think both of those are drivers. We expect those to continue to be drivers in the future.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.</p><p>WALTER H PRITCHARD, MD AND U.S. SOFTWARE ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mark, as well congrats on finding a successor here that looks to fill your shoes at least mostly. On -- a few questions for Kathy. One, just on -- as we think about going into Q1, I know you're not providing guidance for next year. But seasonality has been a bit moving around as the business has evolved. And I'm wondering what you could tell us about how you think about the shape of the year into next year with Q1. And then just had one follow-up question on the subscription side.</p><p>KATHLEEN BONANNO: Sure. Thanks, Walter. Yes, we have definitely seen seasonality become a bigger factor in our business, and we are seeing pretty normal seasonality patterns with our strongest quarters sequentially in terms of sequential growth being Q2s and Q4s. And that continues to be the case, and I would expect that to continue into Q1.</p><p>WALTER H PRITCHARD: Great. And then on the subscription side, I'm wondering, you have 2 pieces there. One, I think is pretty easy for us to model with the -- attaching to appliances. You're seeing a continuation, it looks like, in 3-year attach there. And then on the unattached side, you just have a number of new products, some acquired, some products you had for some time. Can you help us understand how the subscription side is splitting out and maybe relative growth rates between the attached and nonattached?</p><p>KATHLEEN BONANNO: Sure. The nonattached business we mentioned at Analyst Day was on a $240 million run rate, growing very fast, growing at about 85% year-over-year. And so while it remains about -- getting close to about 10% of our overall business, still a relatively small portion of our business, but growing much faster than the rest of the business because it's newer and obviously a smaller portion of our business. And so just in terms of law of large numbers, growing much faster. We're obviously adding more and more subscription offerings that are nonattached, and you'll see that in the Application Framework as well. And so we do expect that the nonattached business will continue to become a bigger part of our business and will continue to grow very fast. The rest of the business is also growing very well. As you saw, our services billings growth rate was over 30% this quarter. And so the rest of the business continues to grow very fast. And the attached business, because it's -- nonattached business, because it's a relatively small portion, doesn't influence the overall growth rate to a significant degree at this point.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. If I could just make one other point. Kathy said at the end of Q2, we've given out the billings contribution run rate at about $240 million, growing very quickly. As you can see, that continues to go up over time. And I think probably the interesting thing about that is with that approaching 10% of the billings run rate, which is good, it's against a very large base as well. And that base is continuing to grow very well. So if you think about the network security business and particularly the SaaS security services associated with it, that's a large business growing very well in itself, right? So the level of contribution takes time for the nonattached to grow simply because it's being matched against a large -- very fast growing business as well.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer.</p><p>SHAUL EYAL, MD AND SENIOR ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO. INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Nikesh, welcome onboard. Mark, we still have you onboard literally, so not saying goodbye here. One for Mark, one for Nikesh. Mark, on Europe, another strong quarter, up 35% year-over-year. Talk to us a little bit about the different dynamics you're seeing in Europe than there was in the U.S., maybe how this GDPR in that context play into the equation.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, sure. So I'll take the beginning. I'll hand it over to Mark. He just came back from over there a little while ago. GDPR, this is a big picture, is driving a lot of interest in how do you use what we term state-of-the-art capabilities, particularly GDPR has a requirement -- or avoiding liability that folks using state-of-the-art capabilities for cybersecurity. Of course, there's no definition to that, which is probably the right thing to do for regulators. But it raises a lot of questions for customers, which are positive for us, which is how would you do that, that state-of-the-art capabilities. And we think everything that we provide, plus the platform, fits very uniquely here. Mark, I know you just...</p><p>MARK F. ANDERSON: Yes. I think you nailed it, Mark. I think, for us, legislation like GDPR just heightens awareness of customers to do something different than what they've been doing for the last 2 decades. And I think I would highlight that and also highlight the fact that government over there, the EU as well as each of the individual countries in the EU, have never been more open to working with thought leaders like Palo Alto Networksto do things like share threat intelligence, have bilateral threat sharing agreements. So I think our relevance in Europe, because of maybe a little more conservative group of countries, has really ramped in the last 4, 5 quarters, and you've seen that in the performance. We get invited to the (inaudible) a lot more.</p><p>SHAUL EYAL: Nikesh, you're coming from SoftBank, invested heavily in security in recent years, I think the big $100 million check for cyber reason just about, I think, less than 18 months ago. Google appears to be eyeing security from afar, who knows what they might be doing down the road. It seems that security software requires a bit of a different DNA. I think Mark also, I think, phrased that point. And second, before you plunge into the security software arena, if you could share with us your thoughts as to how security is being observed by the big tech company, the Google, the Amazon, the Microsoft. They haven't done a lot so much, so it could be a great opportunity on your end. So maybe just the second -- the world is becoming crazy for you with Palo Alto. Just share with us maybe how the big tech behemoths view security.</p><p><person><nameText>NIKESH ARORA</nameText></person>: I think it's fair to say I had the privilege of working with the Google enterprise team, which is part of (inaudible) when I was at Google. And for the first time, as you see in the history of innovation, cloud came to the consumer first in a big way and is now slowly making it to the back of the enterprise. And Google's realized that, Microsoft's realized that, Amazon realized that. So they're all charging ahead with trying to address the cloud opportunity into the enterprises. I think that's great. Having said that, given that they're all, to some degree, offering proprietary solutions to people where you can have one or the other, there's an important need for independent security team to look at it and see how we can take these massive amounts of data across multiple cloud offerings, provide a solution around it comprehensively to the end customer and have somebody who they can trust to be the arbiter between all these different offerings that they have. So I think that's the big opportunity out there. Given that we're all going towards the cloud, given that these huge amounts of datasets are going to be created, we need to make sure we understand their aspirations and set our aspirations vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis them and provide the solution to the end customer. I think that's where the opportunity is.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Michael Turits with Raymond James.</p><p>MICHAEL TURITS, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH &amp; INFRASTRUCTURE SOFTWARE ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES &amp; ASSOCIATES, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Mark, thanks for everything in many years. Nikesh, welcome. I'll come back to the M&amp;A question and then I have a follow-up for Kathy. On M&amp;A, and let's just maybe say strategically products in general, Mark, there's still some very large areas of security that you're not in, email, DLT, identity. How are you thinking about those given the fact that you have done so much in terms of expanding in the last quarter or so?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. Great question, Michael. When we look at security, we think in terms of outcomes, meaning that if you're the CIO or the CISO for an enterprise, if you put technologies aside for a second, they have to solve for various outcomes. And in those -- there might be 8 or 10 of those depending on how broadly you define those, and they're not technical when you think about them. The outcome that we're solving for customers is to stop all known threats and ideally stop all unknown threats or at least detect them very quickly and limit the damage, right? And that's a very, very large outcome statement and very important. That lives alongside other outcomes, like making sure you can withstand a massive denial of service attack, for example. And we've been particularly focused over the years in ensuring that whatever outcomes we choose to solve for, for customers, that we bring something unique to the table in a highly competitive way. Now those outcomes blend over time as well, and that's why we've done a lot of very strong partnerships in the identity space, for example, something you just mentioned; on the messaging security space with Proofpoint, something you just mentioned as well, so that we can make sure that the customer using the best capabilities from the vendors who are solving these outcomes doesn't have to be the back-end systems integrator themselves for that. And they really appreciate that. But bringing that holistic picture to the table and solving those outcomes for customers is very important.</p><p>MICHAEL TURITS: Great. And then for Kathy, thanks for detailing the impact on expenses and cash flow, the acquisitions in this quarter. How do those acquisitions -- and those have been particularly, again, very strong investment. How do those acquisitions impact margin expansion next year? You've talked in the framework about 150 to 250 basis points. Are we on track to that even with these acquisitions?</p><p>KATHLEEN BONANNO: Yes. We have talked about organic operating margin expansion of 150 basis points to 250 basis points. The Q4 guidance that we've given is that we plan to invest between $10 million to $12 million, and that equates to $0.08 to $0.10 per share on our recent acquisitions, outside of the organic operating margin expansion that we are working towards for the full fiscal year.</p><p>MICHAEL TURITS: Okay. No early thoughts on next year, though?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, it's pretty early.</p><p>KATHLEEN BONANNO: Yes. We're still working on our planning, obviously. But we have been obviously committed to that framework, and growth and profitability remain very important to the company.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our final question will come from Rob Owens with KeyBanc Capital Markets.</p><p>ROBBIE DAVID OWENS, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: With regard to products revenue and the 5 quarters of acceleration that you've seen -- I suppose, I guess, where your competitors are, and we've actually seen meaningful deceleration. Can you talk about your win rates and whether or not you think those are ticking up? Or is your success more a function of ASPs at this point? And then number two, Mark Anderson mentioned hardware cycles come and hardware cycles go, which begs the question, do we think one's coming? Or do we think we're going at this point? And were one to come, how could that possibly be reflected in customer acquisition and those numbers you're showing there?</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Maybe you can take them in reverse, and I'll do the cycle...</p><p>MARK F. ANDERSON: Yes, sure. Go ahead. Yes.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Everybody is saying Mark here. So I think on the cycle one, Rob, over time, if you take a snapshot back of 10, 15 years long period of time, you see the cycles in 4 or 7 years, it's a little hard to nail that down of buying patterns here. What I think what Mark was saying is that regardless of what cycle they're in, Palo Alto Networkscontinues to outperform everybody in the market. You can see that in -- all through the last 10 years as a matter of fact and including very recently the last 4 quarters as well. Our job, we think, is to make sure that we have the most competitive offering in the market, and we'll always be taking market share. And we're very confident we'll be able to do that.</p><p>MARK F. ANDERSON: Just big picture, Rob, we've got low double-digit market share or we prosecute low double-digit market share in about a $20 billion total addressable market. So I think both in terms of new customer opportunities, if customers want to -- if they're going to make a change for security, they're going to look to the thought leader. And for existing customer expansion, we're just starting to hit the veins of significant customer sizes from the cohorts that we saw big customer growth in the last 5 or 6 years. So I think both give us tremendous opportunities to grow the business, and I think that's what gives us the confidence that's embedded into our guide.</p><p>ROBBIE DAVID OWENS: Then the long competitive win rate lines.</p><p>MARK F. ANDERSON: Competitive win rates, I said it earlier, I think I feel bad sometimes for our competitors because they're trying to sell either stitched together acquisitions that look like Frankenstein's monster or they're trying to sell point products against an architecture. And I think we've developed this platform over the last dozen years organically, primarily with some small technology tuck-ins that really drive the automation that's needed in the digital age.</p><p>MARK D. MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. And we've seen win rates be very consistently high, Rob, against all competitors.</p><p>Okay, I think that was our last question. I'd like to close off, I want to thank everybody here, all the employees of Palo Alto Networks, our customers and our partners for the privilege of working with you. For me, it's been a really amazing experience. I want to thank everybody for their time this morning for the call. We look forward to seeing a lot of you in the upcoming future. Take care.</p><p>OPERATOR: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)</p><p>I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jerry Sweeney, President and CEO. You may begin.</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; TRUSTEE, BRANDYWINE REALTY TRUST: Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for participating in our third quarter 2019 earnings call. On today's call with me, as always, are George Johnstone, our Executive VP of Operations; Dan Palazzo, our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Tom Wirth, our Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer.</p><p>Prior to beginning, certain information discussed during our call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. Although we believe these estimates reflected in these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we cannot give assurance that the anticipated results will be achieved. For further information on factors that could impact our anticipated results, please reference our press release as well as our most recent annual and quarterly reports that we file with the SEC.</p><p>So looking at our business plan, we're in great shape and substantially done for 2019. So after a very brief review of our 2019 plan, we'll outline our 2020 earnings guidance and our business plan. Tom will then provide a synopsis of financial results. And after that, Tom, George, Dan and I will be available to answer any questions you may have.</p><p>Our business plan continues to be very straightforward. Simply take advantage of great product in the strong markets to lease space at increasing net effective rents by controlling capital costs, delivering positive mark-to-markets with strong annual rent increases. Our 2019 plan accomplished that objective as will our 2020 business plan.</p><p>We are 100% done in our speculative revenue target for '19. The leasing pipeline looking forward remains deep for our existing inventory at about 1.5 million square feet, including approximately 270,000 square feet in advanced stages of negotiations. For the third quarter, we posted stronger rental rate mark-to-markets of 9.3% GAAP and 4.2% cash. Year-to-date, our cash same-store growth rate is 1.9%.</p><p>As you may recall, we did elect, last year, to keep a major renovation project in our same-store pool. That project, 1676 International Drive in Northern Virginia, is undergoing a full renovation and is currently 21% occupied. I'll touch on it a little bit later, but this project will deliver an excellent return on our invested capital. By keeping it in the same-store, however, it has had 100 basis point and 250 basis point adverse impact on our 2019 and 2020 same-store growth rate. To illustrate this impact as well as the impact on our occupancy levels, we did provide a road map of 1676 International Drive's impact on same-store and occupancy levels on Page 7 of our supplemental package.</p><p>Based on excellent progress so far, we've raised the bottom end of our range $0.01 to $1.41 and narrowed the top end of $1.43 for a midpoint of $1.42 per share. As outlined on Page 10 and 11 of our SIP, we expect both Greater Philadelphia and Austin to remain strong going into 2020, thereby generating good leasing activity, an increasing pipeline and good leasing levels.</p><p>A couple of quick notes on markets. Austin continues to benefit from tremendous corporate attraction and in-market expansion as well as a tremendous in-migration of population. For the third quarter of 2019, asking rents increased 6.2% year-over-year with 2.1 million square feet of absorption in the last 9 months of 2019. A great way to illustrate the strength of Austin's continued strength and growth is that over the last 5 years, the Austin market has added over 8.4 million square feet of office space while increasing occupancy by over 320 basis points.</p><p>Philadelphia with -- had 1 million square feet of absorption over the last year. The trophy-class vacancy rate has been reduced to 5% from 5.3% at the end of '19, which ranks among the lowest of the top 25 largest MSAs. We've continued to grow jobs over the last year and are experiencing solid demand through the third quarter of '19 with asking rents increasing 4.4% year-over-year. Philadelphia continues to benefit from an emerging life science sector, supported by almost $1 billion in NIH funding, which ranks third nationally behind only Boston and New York City.</p><p>University City receives 42% of all NIH funds allocated to the entire state of Pennsylvania. We believe, our Schuylkill Yards development is well positioned to take advantage of this growth acceleration. In fact, Philadelphia was in the news recently when the CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson said that Philadelphia has the potential to be the Silicon Valley of the health care sector.</p><p>The comprehensive redevelopment of 1676 is on time, on budget. We have 236,000 square feet of vacant space. Our current pipeline is almost 900,000 square feet, which is up significantly since our July call. We are under a letter of intent and in advanced lease negotiations on approximately 111,000 square feet. Rent levels, we believe, will be in the mid-40s, representing about a 15% increase over expiring rents. The projection still reflects that we'll realize a return on our incremental capital of over 20%, and we'll stabilize that property at about a 9% yield on aggregate new basis.</p><p>Turning to the balance sheet, and Tom will touch on this. We did take advantage of the public debt markets to raise $215 million of unsecured bonds at an average rate of 3% and an average term of 7.5 years. This financing improves our liquidity. We now have full availability under our $600 million line of credit, and we also lowered our overall cost of debt and extended our maturity schedule.</p><p>So with that overview of the excellent backdrop of 2019, we also announced our 2020 business plan along with related earnings guidance. The 2020 plan is headlined by 2 operating metrics that demonstrate excellent future growth potential. Our cash mark-to-market range is between 8% and 10% and our GAAP mark-to-market range is between 17% and 19%. We anticipate that for 2020, all of our regions will post positive mark-to-market results on both a cash and GAAP basis.</p><p>Also from a forward growth perspective, our major 2020 rollovers create significant upside due to tremendous mark-to-markets. Our SHI rollover in Austin is a 20% cash and a 28% GAAP mark-to-market. Macquarie in Philadelphia is an 18% cash and a 22% GAAP. And Reliance, also in Philadelphia, is a 20% cash and a 24% GAAP. So our GAAP same-store growth rate of 2.4% is driven by Philadelphia at 4.5%, and the Pennsylvania suburbs are just shy of 7%. Obviously, due to the rollovers taking place, Met D.C. and Austin will be slightly negative due to those rolls.</p><p>As I noted earlier, our same-store forecast, due to the inclusion of 1676, we don't believe reflects the strength of our overall portfolio. And as we noted on that schedule, without the inclusion of this property, our 20 -- 2020 cash same-store range will be 2.5% to 4.5%, which we think is pretty solid.</p><p>Other key operating highlights, spec revenue of $31 million, already 50% achieved. Occupancy levels will close out between 94% and 95%, and we'll also be 95% to 96% leased by year-end '20. Including the rollout of Macquarie of 150,000 square feet in July, we do project a retention rate of 65%. Capital, which is a key focus of ours, will run about 14% of revenues, which is consistent with our 2019 run rate. We do project growing FFO of 3% at the midpoint. And our debt-to-EBITDA range, we project, at year-end will be between 6.1 and 6.3x. CAD will range between 71% and 78% and is down slightly from our 2019 range. That decrease is primarily attributable to the capital and free rent to the anticipated backfill of 1676 International Drive, where we are projecting absorbing a number of square feet within 12 months of that space being vacated.</p><p>Just to amplify a couple of vacancies' impact on '20. At 1676, we are projecting about 200,000 square feet of lease-up at a cash mark-to-market of 14.7% and about $3 million of GAAP revenue as part of our 2020 plan. On the SHI roll, in Austin, we're projecting about 148,000 square feet of absorption at a mark-to-market of -- a cash mark-to-market of -- just shy of 20%. 40% of that square footage has already been executed, and we anticipate generating a couple million dollars of revenue on a GAAP basis from that SHI re-lease. Macquarie, we have no GAAP and no cash revenue in our 2020 as a result of that midyear rollout. Just to further amplify, that $5 million of revenue coming out of 1676 and SHI is GAAP revenue, not cash.</p><p>So the upshot is our 2020 operating forecast grows FFO of 3%, keeps our balance sheet strong, deploys some capital into development, keeps our capital ratios on track with excellent cash and GAAP mark-to-markets.</p><p>To spend a few minutes on development and investments. When we do look at the development landscape and the investment side of our business, we do recognize that there's a lot of uncertainty in the macro environment that could impact the near-term economic outlook. If you think back, our goal for 2019 was really to get all of our targeted development projects in a full-go mode with all approvals, design development and marketing programs fully in place. As we're closing out '19, we feel we've accomplished that objective. But looking forward to 2020 and '21, assuming continuation of the demand drivers that we're seeing and continued strong market conditions, we do plan on placing more land into active development. As such, our 2020 plan includes 2 targeted development starts.</p><p>And our development pipeline can really be classified into 2 components, our near-term production level assets and our long-term mixed-use master plan developments. Our production level assets can be completed within 4 to 6 quarters. They cost between $40 million and $70 million and range in size between 100,000 and 160,000 -- 165,000 square feet. The cash yields in all of these projects are targeted around 8%. These assets are Four Points and Garza in Austin and 650 Park Avenue and 155 King of Prussia Road in Pennsylvania. On these projects, we have a combined prospect list aggregating almost 2 million square feet. Each of these projects are ready to go pending pre-leasing. As I mentioned, we have 2 starts built into our 2020 plan.</p><p>Just a quick note on a couple of projects we have under existing development. 405 Colorado continues on schedule and on budget. We're now 45% leased. We anticipate that project will generate about an 8.5% yield on cost and the schedule holds with a 4Q '20 completion and stabilization by 2021. The Bulletin Building is under renovation. That work will be done by the second quarter of 2020. And as we've noted, that building is -- the office component is fully leased to Spark Therapeutics, and we're actively leasing the first floor as retail space.</p><p>And looking at our master plan, mixed-use projects, which are Schuylkill Yards and Broadmoor, we did update the disclosure within the supplemental package on Pages 15 and 16 to provide a lot more information on those projects. So a couple of quick highlights on each. On Schuylkill Yards, full master plan approvals are completely in place. The design development is substantially complete on the first 2 buildings. Final pricing on those buildings is underway. Marketing efforts continue with the pipeline still around 1.5 million square feet, including significant interest from life science tenants. We are in very active discussions with joint venture financing sources on it -- to provide equity for the project. Our existing investment base aggregating approximately $90 million will be sufficient to meet our equity requirements in the contemplated equity joint venture structures on those projects at our targeted 35% hold. So no additional cash requirements are anticipated on our Schuylkill Yards starts.</p><p>Prior to starting either tower, we will have final construction pricing lockdown and all equity and debt financing committed and announced as part of any start announcement. Given our read on the residential market, we could be assuming the above conditions are met in a position to go on the West tower in the next couple of quarters. The East tower, which is predominantly office and a potential life science component, does require an active tenant as well as having those cost and financing conditions met prior to any start.</p><p>A final point worth noting that you'll see on the page in the supplemental is that our Schuylkill Yards master plan can accommodate almost 2 million square feet of life science space. Given the strong demand drivers we're seeing in that sector, we have also commenced the design development process for a 400,000 square-foot dedicated life science building that could commence construction very late in 2020 or early '21 in a joint venture with our life science partner.</p><p>On Broadmoor, which is framed out on Page 16, again, all approvals done. I do want to highlight that we can build about 2.7 million square feet of space and over 800 apartments with the existing buildings in place. And we are into full planning and costing on 3 blocks with marketing launches attendant there too, which I've detailed the component parts of that on our -- on Page 16. All 3 blocks could be in a position to start by midyear '20, again, assuming favorable market and financing conditions stay in place. Discussions on the train station, public space sequencing and retail hospitality initiatives are all continuing at an excellent pace.</p><p>We have one acquisition program for 2020, which is part of the previously announced transaction with Penn Medicine. We have a 160,000 square-foot building in Radnor that we plan on purchasing later in the year. We do anticipate placing that building into redevelopment upon acquisition. Excluding the committed spend we already have in our 2020 plan for 405 Colorado, the Bulletin Building and a few other items, as Tom will outline, our plan does include $50 million of incremental spent in '20 on our 2 projected development starts. To finance these opportunities, we will be evaluating well-timed asset sales, looking at several of our joint ventures to harvest profit, generate liquidity and reduce debt attribution. We're also evaluating several value-add opportunities. And as we did in 2018 and have done in 2019, we expect any deployment to be relatively earnings-neutral and accelerate bottom line cash flow growth.</p><p>So to close out, 2019 plan is essentially wrapped up. Our focus is now on our 2020 plan. And we're delighted that the bottom line results is strong, effective rent growth, a growth in FFO and a continued solid balance sheet performance.</p><p>At this point, I'll turn it over to Tom to review our financial results.</p><p>THOMAS E. WIRTH, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, BRANDYWINE REALTY TRUST: Thank you, Jerry. Our third quarter net income totaled to $6.7 million or $0.04 per diluted share, and FFO totaled $64 million or $0.36 per diluted share, which met consensus estimates. In addition, we narrowed our 2019 guidance by $0.02 per share and the midpoint remains $1.42 as compared to the initial first and second quarter guidance.</p><p>Some general observations of the third quarter were our operating results were generally in line with our second quarter guidance. Our second quarter fixed charge and interest coverage ratios were 3.6 and 3.9, respectively. Both metrics improved as compared to the third quarter of 2018. Our annualized net debt to EBITDA decreased to 6.3, which benefited from the improving operations and the sale of Plaza 1900 for roughly $36 million.</p><p>Our 2019 guidance, looking at the fourth quarter, we have some general assumptions. Portfolio operating income will total about $84.5 million, FFO contribution from joint ventures will total $2.5 million. G&amp;A, our fourth quarter G&amp;A expense will decrease from $7 million to $6.5 million. The incremental decrease is primarily due to expected timing of expenses. And a full year G&amp;A expense will total approximately $31.7 million. Interest expense will be $20.5 million with 92% of our debt being fixed rate at the end of the quarter, but down to -- but up to 98% fixed as a result of the bond deal. Capitalized interest will approximate $0.8 million. Full year interest expense should be about $82 million.</p><p>Termination fee and other. We anticipate termination income of $2.6 million for the year, other income will approximate $7 million. Net management and leasing development fees will be $2.5 million and will approximate $9 million for the year.</p><p>Financing activity. During the fourth quarter, we took advantage of the public debt markets and issued $200 million of secured bonds at a premium to generate about $214 million of net proceeds. The issuance comprised of reopening of our 24 and 29 bonds, each for $100 million. The issuance resulted in reducing our unsecured line of credit to 0. Weighted average interest rate on those bonds is 3% and the weighted average maturity of 7.5 years. Percent of fixed-rate debt is now above 98% and both bonds issuances are now index eligible.</p><p>Based on our capital plan, which includes $45 million of development and redevelopment, $15 million of revenue maintain, $10 million of revenue create spending, approximately $18.5 million for the acquisition of Radnor land. Our cash balance will approximate $50 million at year-end.</p><p>Based on our estimated fourth quarter EBITDA capital spend, we continue to project that our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be within 6.0 to 6.3 range with the main variable being the timing and scope of our development activities and related capital spend. In addition, our debt to GAV will remain in the low 40% range. We anticipate fixed charge to be 3.6 and our interest coverage to be 3.9 by year-end.</p><p>Looking at 2020 guidance, at the midpoint, net income will be $0.29 per diluted share and FFO will be $1.46 per diluted share.</p><p>Some of our general assumptions, portfolio operating results. Property-level GAAP NOI will increase approximately $10 million year-over-year, primarily due to Drexel Plaza, which will generate $2 million as part -- takes occupancy during the year, an $8 million increase in same-store NOI on a GAAP basis. FFO from our unconsolidated joint ventures will total about $10.5 million. G&amp;A should range between $30 million and $31 million.</p><p>On the investment side, we had no sales activity built into the plan, but we do have the acquisition of 250 King of Prussia Road and Radnor, Pennsylvania, as Jerry mentioned, for $20 million, and we do have 2 development starts that will not generate any earnings in 2020. Interest expense will increase to approximately $82 million to $83 million, primarily due to -- also in that number includes our payoff of the Four Tower Bridge mortgage, which will occur in December for about $9 million. Capitalized interest will increase from $3 million to $3.5 million, primarily due to building of 405 Colorado. And we will -- we anticipate paying off our Two Logan mortgage on May 1, which is approximately $80 million and at a rate just below 4%.</p><p>Land sales and tax provisions should net to about 0. Termination fees and other income should total about $10 million. Net management and development fees will be $8 million, which is about $1.5 million below our '19 -- 2019 estimate. While property management fees will remain constant, we anticipate lower development fee income as the development projects at Garza for SHI and Radnor for Penn Medicine are completed during the first half of 2020. We have no anticipated ATM or share buyback activity.</p><p>Turning to the capital plan. We do project CAD will be slightly lower and our coverage will be between 71% and 78%. The main contributors to the lower coverage is due to an increase of straight-line rent and the re-leasing of the space of 1676, which is anticipated to occur within the 12 months of KPMG leaving the space. Our total plan for the year is about $500 million. It's comprised of about $135 million of development and redevelopment, of which $50 million is going to be new development starts for the year, about $135 million of common dividends, revenue maintain should be $63 million, revenue create should be $50 million. And as I mentioned, we share about $90 million of mortgage payoffs for Two Logan and Four Tower Bridge, $7 million of mortgage amortization, $20 million for the acquisition of 250 King of Prussia Road. The sources for that will be about 20 -- $220 million of cash flow after interest; $220 million for the use of the line of credit; $50 million of cash on hand, which we anticipate at the end of '19; and about $10 million of land sales. Based on our capital plan, our line of credit balance will be about $220 million at the end of the year. We project net debt to EBITDA will range between 6.1 and 6.3, again, the main variable being the timing of development. In addition, our debt to GAV should be maintained in the low 40% range. In addition, we anticipate fixed charge will improve to 3.7 and our interest coverage will improve to 4.0.</p><p>I'd like to turn the call back over to Jerry.</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY: Great, Tom. Thank you very much. With that, we're delighted to open up the floor for questions. (Operator Instructions) Operator?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Manny Korchman from Citi.</p><p>EMMANUEL KORCHMAN, VP AND SENIOR ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jerry, in your remarks, you mentioned the macroeconomy and how that might impact leasing or tenant desires. Can you talk about that sort of construct within both the life science space and the tech tenancy that's likely targeting the Austin development?</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY: It's a great question. And I think looking at the 2 different sectors, I mean, certainly, with a lot of the political dialogue taking place across the country on the regulatory risk facing big tech, while we haven't seen any direct impact on that, it is creeping in the conversation circles. So there's no question that tech potential for any type of legislative action, any adverse public policy decisions, primarily coming from a federal level, but certainly some susceptibility at the state level, could have an impact on the growth expectations of some of the major absorbers of space on the technology sector side. Again, haven't really seen any definitive action steps being taken in response to something that may happen in the future, but certainly that is creeping into more and more conversations in terms of forward planning activity.</p><p>I think the same thing holds true quite candidly on the life science space, where you certainly have an awful lot of dialogue in the public sector on health care costs, the profitability of pharmaceutical companies, concentration of wealth among large employers in that life science space. That -- I think that does create a bit of an overhang in terms of what some of -- some companies may be looking to do. Again, it's just out there as kind of the yellow flag pending the outcome of some of these political processes. But there's no question, in any sector, regulatory risk and public policy always provide a potential positive or adverse impact on growth plans. And I mean given the current dialogue that we're all hearing in the public sector space, there's certainly, again, some yellow flags out there depending on how some of those things turn out.</p><p>EMMANUEL KORCHMAN: Great. And then just quickly on 1676. The LOIs you discussed this quarter, are those the same ones as last quarter? And just, kind of, your expected timing on converting that to a full lease?</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY: Yes. I mean, actually at last time -- at last call, Manny, we were under a letter of intent, now we're in active lease negotiations, pretty far advanced. So we're certainly anticipating that rolling into a lease.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR US OFFICE AND INDUSTRIAL REIT ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: I appreciate the color on potential development starts and funding. I guess if you were to handicap the 2 starts, what's most likely, would they more -- be more of your the production assets you mentioned or some of the larger projects? And then in that light, how do -- how should we think about potential asset sales like the magnitude and maybe even the yield on -- or the cap rate on the assets you might be selling?</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY: In terms of the near-term development starts, I think, given the pipeline that we're seeing, we would anticipate a higher probability right now to the -- what I call the production level assets, so either a Garza or Four Points or 650 or 155. And they, again, can be delivered within 4 to 6 quarters. So given the level of pre-leasing there, the pricing coming out where we anticipate it would be, I think, we're certainly gearing up for 1 or 2 of those to start. I think on Broadmoor, we're really excited about the demand that we're seeing. Those blocks that we're planning clearly could be in a position with final site plan approval and building permits to go midyear '20. So we assign a pretty good probability to one of those starts going as well.</p><p>And then Schuylkill Yards right now, we'll see how the final pricing works out. We are -- we do have a very healthy pipeline that we feel pretty good about. The discussions we're having with potential equity partners, which are clearly very important to that project for us, are progressing nicely.</p><p>But if I -- we had to handicap right now, our guess is that the higher probability, which, kind of, reflects the $50 million in the plan, will be coming out of those production level assets. And in terms of asset sales, as you know -- as you well know, we're always in the market exploring different types of sales opportunities. The -- we continue to be very pleased with the level of response that we see. Even that one sale down in Northern Virginia, very active bid process, good pricing, a pretty wide array of potential buyers. Debt markets are really fluid and attractively priced. And we would expect us to prune some assets in the Pennsylvania suburbs as a primary receiving -- receiver of -- or generator of additional funds in the latter part of 2020.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Okay. And then are there any land sale gains in your 2020 guidance?</p><p>THOMAS E. WIRTH: Jamie, this is Tom. We don't have any material land gain sales. We did say there's going to be about $10 million of land gain sales. Any gains of that nature will be less than $0.01, probably closer to $0.005.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets.</p><p>CRAIG ALLEN MAILMAN, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a clarification. So KPMG, are they -- they came out of the numbers, kind of, October 1, right? In terms of...</p><p>GEORGE D. JOHNSTONE, EVP OF OPERATIONS, BRANDYWINE REALTY TRUST: Correct.</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY: Correct.</p><p>GEORGE D. JOHNSTONE: Yes, correct.</p><p>CRAIG ALLEN MAILMAN: I'm just curious, you guys kept occupancy guidance the same for this year. You have 130 basis points of commencements kind of in the bag so far, but then you're going to lose most of the 160 basis points of the remaining expirations, right? I'm just curious, could you walk me through how you get to 94% to 95% from 93% with the drag from KPMG?</p><p>GEORGE D. JOHNSTONE: Craig, it's George. KPMG did leave 9/30. We've got additional expirations. The pre-lease that we have will commence in the fourth quarter. And then there are a couple of moveouts that immediately get backfilled in the fourth quarter. They don't show -- so you see the expiration, but there's no pre-lease listed in our number because the space isn't vacant as of the end of the quarter. So that's really kind of how we roll up to maintain that same 94% to 95% range.</p><p>CRAIG ALLEN MAILMAN: Got you. So those pre-leases aren't necessarily in the 4Q commencements on the leasing page?</p><p>GEORGE D. JOHNSTONE: Right.</p><p>CRAIG ALLEN MAILMAN: Okay. Got you. Got you. And then just another quick one. So on the 400,000 square foot dedicated life science building, could you kind of give us a sense of what you guys think you might own on that? And did Drexel pass on the -- don't they typically have a right of first offer for like 15% of each building?</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY: Yes. Look, couple of points there, Craig. We're anticipating kind of being in the 50% range in terms of the ownership of the life science dedicated project. We -- yes, Drexel does have an opportunity to participate in our projects going forward, as frankly, does any tenant who is interested. Drexel's -- their right is a rolling right, there's no notice period, they could wind up being a part of our life science building. Yes, I mean that what we're seeing really is a burgeoning demand coming out of the anchor employers here in University City, whether it be Children's Hospital, University of Pennsylvania Medical System, Drexel University and all of their various academic and research initiatives, the Wistar Institute. So I think in assessing the depth and the diversity of the demand, I think, we felt very good about launching that design development process. As the building, the physical form begins to take shape from the plans and specs standpoint, we'll commence the marketing of that and the hope would be that we could identify some tenancies as we're going through the design development process.</p><p>CRAIG ALLEN MAILMAN: Got you. Would it be like a 100% built out as lab space with all the improvements or would it just be geared towards life science tenants who want to cluster together?</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY: The actual specific build-out will be driven by individual tenant requirements. The physical specifications of the building, the ventilation, the mechanical systems, ceiling heights, floor loads, et cetera, will all be designed to be convertible into wet/dry lab administrative. So provide complete optionality in terms of interior layout to what the tenant requirements might be.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel.</p><p>JOHN WILLIAM GUINEE, MD, STIFEL, NICOLAUS &amp; COMPANY, INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: One curiosity question. I just got to ask it. When you're walking around the country or traveling around the country and you see a wonderful park like your new park at Schuylkill, some of them are clean and very user-friendly and some of them are full of tents and homeless people. Are Philadelphia's finest able to keep that park pleasant and usable?</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY: It is very pleasant, eminently usable and being adopted very quickly into the public cityscape in Philadelphia. We have, between Brandywine personnel, between the University City district folks as well as Philadelphia' finest, there's a very coordinated campaign that's been incredibly successful. John, not just at Drexel Square, but also at our Cira Green Park to make sure that we are always keeping those parks as friendly as possible to the general public.</p><p>JOHN WILLIAM GUINEE: Okay. And then the second question. You've been very, very good about raising your dividend in the last few years. What are you thinking about the dividend this year? And what's your taxable issues?</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY: Well, I think from a taxable standpoint, Tom, I'll defer to you. But, I think, from a dividend standpoint, look, we are encouraged by some of the forward signs we're seeing. I mean ranging, John, from a real estate level, the forward pipeline, I think, we're really pleased with the strong mark-to-markets we're seeing, both on -- primarily, on a cash basis. GAAP's very important too, but as they say, you can't buy groceries with GAAP. So having really effective good cash rent growths, the annual escalations we're building into our projects, what we think are some really good near-term convertible development opportunities that will grow cash flow tremendously and the fact that there'll be no ongoing capital costs. All of those are very positive attributes our Board looks at in evaluating the dividend growth plan. I think what we're looking for right now is just some little more visibility on executing the capital side of that plan. It's no secret that construction costs have continued to escalate, not just for base building, but for TIs, as you well know.</p><p>And we have a number of very interesting initiatives underway to kind of keep a lid on those construction cost escalations, which, I think, are really resulting in keeping our capital cost in that 14% of revenue range, which is really very good. So we're able to generate net effective rent growth. So if those 2 elements come together, kind of, the forward-leasing visibility with that positive mark-to-market as well as the good containment on executing leases from a capital standpoint, I think, the Board is always biased to making sure that shareholders receive a very effective share of our growth model. Tom, on the tax side?</p><p>THOMAS E. WIRTH: Yes. John, on the dividends side, we don't have any pressure on the dividend based on the current recurring taxable income we're having. Obviously, we do have some asset sales depending on when they happen and what those assets may generate in capital gains. We would have to assess whether there is a need to raise it. But at this point, based on our operating plan for 2020, there is no taxable reason to raise the dividend.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Jason Green from Evercore ISI.</p><p>JASON DANIEL GREEN, ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a question on Schuylkill Yards. Can you talk more about the interest, specifically for the office portion of Schuylkill Yards, if there are any changes to pre-leasing requirements for the project to get started?</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY: Sure, Jason. The -- no change to the pre-leasing requirements on the East tower. We're still targeting that 35% to 50% range of the office component. You'll recall that building has the flexibility to be up to 1/3 life science, so we are trying to manage those 2 different targeted audiences. And the pipeline, again, remains pretty diverse. There's a few larger tenants in there that we're waiting for some feedback on. But we're also doing a very effective job, our leasing team, that is really developing a pipeline of single and 2-floor users that we think could really add to the pipeline execution as we move forward.</p><p>On the West tower, which is predominantly a residential tower, with the right equity financing in place and given the read that we have on the underlying strength of this location and the depth of the residential demand drivers, I think, we're prepared to start that given its fairly small office component without having any pre-lease in place. So no real change from the plan we've outlined before.</p><p>JASON DANIEL GREEN: Okay. And then on 405 Colorado, the additional 10% leased, was that an expansion of the tenant that was already in there? Or was that a new lease? And then I guess, how should we think about the remaining 55% in regards to how quickly that will get leased up and what demand is like?</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY: Yes. The incremental 10% was new tenants coming in, so not an existing expansion. And -- look, I think we're really happy with the pipeline we have there. We have -- we're 3 to 4x covered on the remaining 110,000 square feet with some very near-term discussions underway. We have been able to continue to push rents through the development cycle. I mean the building, we're still -- the garage is going up now, we're up to like halfway through -- not even quite halfway up the garage levels. So I think we're -- with the pipeline, we feel pretty confident that we'll get some leasing done in the next several months. And as the building really starts to take shape, kind of, Q2 and Q3 of next year, I think, we'll be able lock it away. But I think, as I have mentioned, we feel very confident. This is one of those projects, like an FMC or a Cira Center, we'll be substantially leased by the time we open up the doors.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Daniel Ismail from Green Street Advisors.</p><p>DANIEL ISMAIL, ANALYST OF OFFICE, GREEN STREET ADVISORS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Given the recent headlines, have you noticed any pullback in co-working activity in your markets? And then as a follow-up, can you provide an update on some of these flexible options you guys are working on internally?</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY: Sure. Well, I mean, there's certainly been a lot of very public disruption in that space in the last 60 days or so. I think what we've seen is a push by some of the companies to try and get leasing transactions done. I mean, I think, with the dislocation of the major move in the market, WeWorks, I think, you're seeing a number of other companies really try and accelerate their activity. So we haven't really seen a pullback from that side, from the demand side.</p><p>I think in talking to a lot of landlords and certainly from Brandywine's perspective, we continue to be extremely focused on what the credit support, how that credit support is evidenced on all of our co-working initiatives. I mean we have a little bit more than 2% of our revenues coming in from a variety of co-working initiatives, primarily Regus, we do have 1 WeWorks location, a few other executive suites. So we're very focused on making sure there's adequate credit support there. Really walk those spaces to make sure there's high levels of occupancy. We're very much involved in the design of those spaces. So we think there's a high level of convertibility if the operators have any issues.</p><p>And I think, certainly, Brandywine, our Bex initiative utilization rates are north of 80%. Tremendous benefit. We're looking at expanding that in some of our existing projects. As well as quite candidly, even within some of our development projects allocating pods of our space to facilitate the flexible -- providing some of our tenants a flexible term lease structure that can bridge out some of their short- or intermediate-term demands and have a compensation structure in place for us that gives us an accelerated return on the capital we need to invest to meet that flexibility requirement.</p><p>DANIEL ISMAIL: And by a compensation structure, would that be some sort of share over a market rent premium?</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY: Yes. Yes. I probably was a little bit obtuse on that, yes. I mean the higher rental rate that would compensate us for the -- we're not having a 5-year term or a 10-year term in place. And certainly, our experience is that tenants will pay that premium to afford them the business plan flexibility that's important to how they run their business.</p><p>DANIEL ISMAIL: And not to go over my 2-question limit, but has that -- have you guys generally found that to be in the 2x range or 50% or can you frame that type of rental premium?</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY: It's got to be -- it could be up -- I wouldn't say up to 2x, but it's probably a 50% premium.</p><p>OPERATOR: And I am showing no further questions from our phone lines. And I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jerry Sweeney for any closing remarks.</p><p>GERARD H. SWEENEY: Great. My closing remark is thank you for your engagement this morning, thank you for continuing to follow the company. We're very excited about where we stand today with the portfolio, with the growth opportunities in the near term that we have every intention of executing. And we look forward to updating you on our year-end call, which will occur in late January of next year. Thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect.

This conference call is being recorded. At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&amp;A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also during today's conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.slgreen.com\">www.slgreen.com</url> by selecting the press release regarding the company's third quarter 2019 earnings. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, SL GREEN REALTY CORP.: Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. The third quarter ended up being very much in line with our expectations and puts us on a very good glide path to meet many of our full-year goals and objectives. We've made great headway on a number of strategic fronts, and we believe as the company continues to shrink, simplify, develop and lease that shareholders will benefit from these actions that are focusing all of our resources on creating significant value within the remaining portfolio.</p><p>It appears based on stock performance that this value creation is neither appreciated nor understood by the public markets, but time and time again, through sale of noncore and mature assets, we are realizing prices and profits that routinely and dramatically outpace the values implied by our stock price. The recent sale of The News Building at 220 East 42nd Street for $815 million is another such example of this, having generated substantial gains over an 18-year hold period. In fact, the unlevered IRR was 11% compounded over that period of time, a true champion of investments. This sale comes on top of the $9.1 billion gross asset value of other product we have sold just since 2016, which has generated $3.4 billion of net proceeds to the company, and we have no intention of stopping there. We are already at work on lining up additional sales of assets that don't meet our long-term plan, and we will provide more detail on these planned dispositions at our upcoming December Investor Meeting.</p><p>These assets will largely be in the $500 million and under range to take advantage of the still active and healthy market for leverage-able Midtown assets that can be acquired for an equity check size of $250 million or less. We will also expand our joint venture investments in premier portfolio assets that we intend to hold or develop, like the initiative we just launched to identify capital partner for our exciting new development project at One Madison Avenue, and more on that. One Madison is now 100% complete on design development drawings, and we expect to have a complete biddable package of CDs by April and be in full-blown redevelopment by sometime middle of 2020. Tenant response to this early stage project has been impressive, and we are quite confident that we're building the right product in the right market at a rental price point that appeals to a wide variety of users.</p><p>On the leasing front, we are well ahead of schedule on leasing volume and projected mark-to-market, which is causing our FFO to be trending toward the high side of our estimated range, notwithstanding aggressive dispositions and intended reductions in the debt and preferred equity portfolio, both dilutive activities as offset in part by debt reduction and stock buyback. With another 71,000 square feet of Manhattan office space leased so far by us in our portfolio in October, we now stand at 1.25 million square feet leased for 2019.</p><p>Now add another 260,000 square feet of leases that are out for signature with signings expected imminently, plus an additional 1.4 million square feet of leasing pipeline on top of that and you have the makings of what we hope will be a very big year-end for this company. We expect to add nearly 100 basis points of occupancy between now and year-end, bringing us to our original goal for the year and at 22% mark-to-market on our Manhattan leases, which is where we are currently, we are far ahead of our goal and expect to improve on that by year-end.</p><p>A particular note, the current pipeline of leases that stands at about 1.65 million square feet is the highest we've ever experienced, with no single leasing the pipeline exceeding 335,000 square feet, which is a testament to the broad underlying strength of demand from tenants across all sectors. And that completely excludes all ongoing discussions we are having at One Madison. None of that is in that stated pipeline. So leasing activity Manhattan wide is robust and it's within that environment that we have been achieving our successes this year and the market as a whole is trending towards last year's record-setting totals fueled by the 10th consecutive year of private sector and office using job growth in New York City.</p><p>Job growth is being driven, of course, by technology and healthcare, with lesser gains, but gains nonetheless in finance and business services. There has been nearly 23 million square feet of leasing through Q3 and expectations are for the full year total to again eclipse 30 million square feet in Manhattan.</p><p>Large block and high rent demand has been concentrated around new construction projects and One Vanderbilt has been a big beneficiary of this trend. This transformational project at the crossroads of Midtown is now 61% leased after the recent signing of an additional full floor to the Carlyle Group, representing Carlyle's second expansion of their -- since their original lease, bringing their total presence in the building to approximately 165,000 square feet or thereabouts.</p><p>Of course, there continues to be a number of ongoing and advanced negotiations for additional space, and we feel comfortable that we're on track to meet our goal for the year and more importantly vastly exceed our original underwriting for this project that we first unveiled in 2015. We topped out the steel at One Vanderbilt at 1,401 feet on September 18, just almost 1 month ago, and we broadcast the images of local 40 ironworkers standing on top of the building's 157-foot spire in celebration of this amazing, amazing accomplishment. The ribbon-cutting is still scheduled for August 4, 2020, a full 3 months ahead of our original schedule.</p><p>So with that, in the words of Andrew Mathias, reports of New York's demise are greatly exaggerated, and we -- if you want to hear more and we hope you do, please join us at our investor conference on December 9th where we'll unveil our view of 2020 and provide an update on our very, we think, thoughtful and executable strategic plan.</p><p>With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Manny Korchman from Citi.</p><p>EMMANUEL KORCHMAN, VP AND SENIOR ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Marc, you mentioned the -- the sweet spot for deals being sort of that $250 million equity check, deals under $500 million. Are you seeing any other sort of changes in the market other than the size and has the buyer pool at all changed in either those assets or larger ones?</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Let's -- I'll start off, Andrew will give you some thoughts and commentary about the market. The market has become I think more domestic in nature, so -- and the amount of fundraising going on in the real estate sector right now with private funds is extraordinary and we see no dearth of capital for many of the different classes or food groups or projects we can offer. I think development seems to be the most interesting for a lot of people. But also, in order of priority, probably value plus, a value, a core plus and core, different buyers for one, but a very high proportion of domestic investors flushed with capital, but all -- I don't want to say constrained, but all looking for check sizes that probably top out at about $250 million.</p><p>Above that, there are still buyers, it just -- it's thinner probably than it was a year or 2 ago. And I think in large part that's just directly attributable to the absence of the Chinese buyer who is not really participating in the market at this point, although other groups are filling in that void and the market still continues to be firm and aided by declining interest rates. So Andrew, you have additional thoughts on depth of market?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS, PRESIDENT &amp; DIRECTOR, SL GREEN REALTY CORP.: Yes. I would agree. I think the debt markets are very, very aggressive right now and there's a lot of foreign capital coming into the market via the debt as opposed to via the equity. They seem to be more comfortable playing in that seat these days. But that's fueling transactions like a 711 Fifth Avenue where that equity check, even though that's a large deal size, is still only going to be around that $250 million level with a very high level of financing.</p><p>EMMANUEL KORCHMAN: Got it. And then in terms of your comments on the tech companies being obviously the leading demand source there in the city right now, how does that play into your portfolio and is that a reason that you're looking more on the west side?</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Yes. I just want to -- I didn't say it was a leading source. It's where a lot of the growth is coming from. By far, the market is still dominated by financial services. Tech is taking a -- is growing off of a very small base. So every addition to tech is very meaningful. But the 30 million square feet that's referenced, the majority of that demand or -- 23 million current, 30 million projected for full year is certainly not tech. I think the basic business services, finance, healthcare, certainly, technology, media, all form part of it. But I just want to be careful, it's not the majority of that leasing is not technology. Steve?</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; DIRECTOR OF LEASING &amp; REAL PROPERTY, SL GREEN REALTY CORP.: Well, I mean the big news is that technology is a growing percentage of the tenant demand. Financial services, to Marc's point, have been the leader of what's leased -- of the industries that have leased space, particularly in Midtown year-to-date, followed by TAMI broadly. I think within TAMI and tech specifically, what's really changed, and you've heard us say this in the past, is in this current cycle, it's the story of the large, well-established profitable mainline tech companies. So it's not the start-up, young companies without a bottom line. And we think it's an industry that's going. It's going to continue to grow, and our portfolio has some well-suited buildings to be receivers for that industry: One Madison Avenue, in particular, 460 West 34th Street, our newest acquisition on 50th Street, all are ideal buildings for that kind of profile tenant.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from Michael Lewis from SunTrust.</p><p>MICHAEL ROBERT LEWIS, DIRECTOR AND CO-LEAD REIT ANALYST, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just based on your in-place leases and what you think the current asking rents are, it looks like you're looking at some rent roll downs in 4Q and then in next year as well. I was just wondering, is that kind of a broad-based thing or is there a few large roll downs that maybe you can point us to?</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO, CFO, SL GREEN REALTY CORP.: It's Matt, Mike. I think there's a mix in there. You're probably going to have scheduling, includes old storage, retail, office, everything in there, I'd say there's nothing -- no one driver in there, and we've pretty steadily beat the numbers that we put out there as evidenced by the mark-to-market we've achieved to date and what we see for the balance of this year and into next. So there's nothing -- when you're rolling off of older vintage leases that have escalation through 10 years, your benchmark is a high number. But we are by and large still seeing positive mark-to-markets in the portfolio.</p><p>MICHAEL ROBERT LEWIS: Okay. Great. And then for my second question, I just wanted to ask how you evaluate and maybe we should evaluate the effectiveness of the stock repurchase program. The company has a long history of strong NAV growth, but the NAV -- the consensus NAV right now is the lowest it's been in a few years and the stock price you already talked about, so I'm just curious, how do we -- how can we know and look at this and how do you look at it and know that this has been a good use of capital?</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: We look at it solely as an investment alternative. I mean that's -- and when we line up the investments, almost every time, the stock repurchase wins out because we're buying more interest in a portfolio that gets better and better as we shed some of the noncore assets and we're buying it at deep discount to private market value and our own internal values. For assets that we own, control, operate and is really very little in the way of risk of unknown or there's really nothing in the way of risk of unknown. So we look at that, both absolute return and risk-adjusted as by far the best place to park our money, and we do believe that the program has been a complete success that we've been able to continue to make significant gains in our embedded NAV in a market that probably in the past year values topped out a year ago, maybe cap rates are probably, what, 25 to 50 basis points, that would have an enormous effect on value to your point about, hey, the NAVs are dropping.</p><p>Well, if cap rates are gapping out, 25, 50 basis points, you would expect to see that, obviously. But the point is, we did much, much more mitigation of that, almost eliminated all of that down flow risk because of the stock buyback program. And the gains on the program I think will be fully appreciated and realized when we stabilize the 8 development assets we now have in portfolio. There's just an enormous pipeline of assets that we buy into every time we buy our stock at essentially below cost.</p><p>And when we achieve stabilize value, and we impose that on an ever-decreasing shareholder base, I think the results will be very powerful. At that point, whether we get credit for it or not now in the public markets we can't entirely control, but we certainly see the benefits on paper of an investment program that yields the highest returns.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.</p><p>PILJUNG KIM, SENIOR REAL ESTATE ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: I was wondering if you could provide some more color on the announced acquisition from this morning as far as your expected investment yield post CapEx? And also is this part of the strategy to make Hell's Kitchen along with Worldwide Plaza, like, more attractive to tech tenants going forward.</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Well, on the first question, I think we'll unveil some of those economics in December. We haven't closed on the asset yet, so I'd like to -- we're just in contract.</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: General development plan.</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: We're -- the period between contract close shortly after close, we'll put our development team together. We're going to get live numbers. We've done the underwriting and we know the kinds of returns under different scenarios we think are achievable. The asset is in an opportunity zone. We will likely use it as a receiver. There's a lot of different benefits we get from this asset in different ways we think we can make outsized returns here, returns that would be on par with stock buyback, as I just mentioned. But with that said, I don't think we're prepared on this call to go through any detail on that other than to say, we're in contract and give you a little information about what it is. So Steve you can respond to the target market.</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: Well, this is a prewar building. It's timber construction, timber and brick. So it's got the creative cool factor that everybody searches for in today's world: hardwood floors, wood beams, oversized windows, kind of an industrial vibe to it. And we'll celebrate that as part of our redevelopment and repositioning of the building. It's been owner-occupied for a good number of years at this point. So it's not a product that's familiar to the brokerage community and therefore step one will be introducing the building to the brokerage community, educating them about the opportunity. It's an ideal building that could go multi-tenant, could just as easily have 1 big tenant take down the space that we've got. And it's got a few roof setbacks to do great outdoor space as well. So we're excited about it, and we've got little bit of air rights to play with that, if we find somebody that wants to take advantage of that, we can offer that up as part of the menu choice as well.</p><p>PILJUNG KIM: And my second is on the observation deck. I think your last presentation assumed 1.8 million visitors annually and a $39 ticket price, and I'm wondering if any of those major assumptions have changed?</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Not materially. I mean we have different scenarios, all which go up from there in terms of viewership, not in terms of ticket price. So I'd say 1-8 is the underwritten floor, if you will. That would be operating far less than full capacity where most of these, if not all of these ob decks operate. So we'll hopefully eclipse those numbers, but are -- the underwriting in what we've shown publicly, generally in December have been at those metrics.</p><p>PILJUNG KIM: Is that something that you'll provide more update on at your Investor Day?</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Not much. I think Investor Day we're going to focus not exclusively but primarily on the 8 development projects that we -- that I mentioned at the outset to give more color on those and really to convey the enormous earnings and profit potential of those properties upon completion, some of which are as early as '21 and as late as '23 and '24.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR REIT ANALYST, SANDLER O'NEILL + PARTNERS, L.P., RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions. First, for Steve. Steve, can you just comment a little bit on your sense of the market, sort of post-WeWork. From broker decks, looks like last year, the coworking were big leasing driver last year and this year they dialed back, but obviously with the failed IPO, WeWork has pulled back more. So one, are you seeing an absolute impact in the leasing volume overall with WeWork pulling back in the city. And then, two, your sense if something happens to them, do you think that landlords or other operators would step in or you think that some of those tenants may not lease their space if they weren't leasing in a WeWork building?</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: I think a couple of things to help put it in perspective. Coworking, generally speaking, is only -- is less than 3.5% of the overall Manhattan market. And when you look at sort of the Midtown submarket, where we have the bulk of our portfolio, it's only 1.5% exposure to WeWork. So what you've seen in the coworking industry over the last couple of years, including with WeWork, they've migrated away from true coworking, and it's been more of a focus on the enterprise model. So when you think of Industrious and Knotel and WeWork's focus for the past couple of years on the enterprise model, what that means, that's leasing large blocks of space to companies that have 1,000 employees or more. So if WeWork were to fail, which we don't believe they're going to, but if they were to fail, the enterprise tenants are easily converted over to a direct tenancy with the landlord. Take our exposure to WeWork in particular, like at 2 Herald Square where 100% of that space is occupied and leased to Amazon. So if there were no WeWork, Amazon would simply be our tenant, they step into that lease the next day, there would be interruption of services and no break in our income.</p><p>So I think coworking, generally speaking, with the enterprise model helps sort of stabilize the landlord's exposure to the industry, and I think we're going to see a little bit of pull back from that industry as they sort of find their way going forward. But you've seen other drivers in the market to take up the slack with the big tech tenants, in particular.</p><p>ALEXANDER DAVID GOLDFARB: Okay. And then the second question is on the DPE book. You guys are starting to pull it back as you guys have indicated you would, over the course of the year, but it's also been an incredible source of not only gains but also opportunities like the 712 Madison or 2 Herald or 3 Columbus, et cetera. So as you guys reduce the DPE book, is there not a concern but sort of a risk that maybe a lot of the good fodder that you guys have gotten out of it, you may not get out of it going forward or there's enough in that DPE book where you can still get the sort of the successful deals versus just the generic refinancing deals that get paid off in normal course.</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: Well, I think the intention is definitely to stay active in the DPE market. It may take the form of more syndications where we're selling larger pieces of positions but retaining toehold positions. I don't -- I think we always put a high value on that aspect of the program and the ability to unearth opportunities through the program, so we definitely intend to continue that apace. And if anything, as you said, we'll shift away from more of just the bread-and-butter, income-producing opportunities and try to shift towards assets that have more potential for ultimately making a deal with ownership or some equity upside, et cetera.</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: I would add to that. DPE is a very important part of this program. Whether the balance is $2.3 billion or $2.0 billion or $1.7 billion, it's still by market standards probably the largest position of subordinate debt interest of any holder in New York City. So it's a big program. And we've got a lot of relationships to a lot of positions. Modulating that balance up and down is something we've always done in times -- sometimes market response. In this case, it's a source of liquidity for us for stock buyback and debt reduction. So it's -- there's no hard and fast rule here, but at the moment it's trending down, which is planned, and in 2020 we'll have a new plan.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank.</p><p>DEREK CHARLES JOHNSTON, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I've been getting a lot of client questions regarding high leverage levels. So I'd like to get your take on how you look at leverage and how are you planning on balancing buybacks and debt repayment going forward, given the elevated leverage levels right now.</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: Well, I mean, again, in every presentation, we don't believe our leverage levels are elevated. I think there's -- that's a popular misconception, but if you look at things by LTV, we're actually under-levered, and we feel we're very reasonably levered on a debt-to-EBITDA basis. So we don't believe our leverage levels are elevated, and we've kept within the guidance we issued at the beginning of the year, expect to end the year within those bands for -- where we laid out the share buyback program is going to take us. So Matt, I don't know if you have anything to add?</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: I think I agree with Andrew. The program -- the share buyback program was predicated on leverage neutrality, it has been throughout. That is our view going forward as well. And on an LTV basis, to Andrew's point, we are prudently if not under levered.</p><p>DEREK CHARLES JOHNSTON: Okay. Great. And then just switching gears to One Vandy. Hopefully, Mr. Durels is in the room. How are things going with the top floors and leasing discussions progressing? I don't know if there are any executed leases on the top floors that you would share, but do you see them coming in higher or lower than you underwrote, and could we expect greater than $200 per square foot at the levels?</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: Sure. I'll remind you that we've already signed 1 lease on penthouse floors with McDermott Will &amp; Emery, which is one of our early leases in the building, and the rent was in line with our underwrite for that part of the building. We're trading paper with tenants as we speak today and are hopeful that we'll have some good news to report in the not too distant future on some signed leases in that part of the building. So as we generally expected, when we started the leasing exercise at One Vanderbilt, we knew that the building would lease from the bottom up partly because that's where the larger tenants who make their decisions further out in time would focus and the smaller tenants, because the building tapers in its form, to get to the smaller floor place when you get to the top of the house, those tenants who make their decisions closer to their current lease expirations, they would be last -- those floors would be the last to lease. And that's what we're experience -- what we expected is what we're experiencing and we're completely confident that the rents that we've signed to date, the deals that we're negotiating and the balance of the building will lease up in line with plan.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.</p><p>STEPHEN THOMAS SAKWA, SENIOR MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Marc, I guess I just want to try and follow up on the buyback program. I mean -- I realize you'll give a little bit more detail at the Investor Day, but to date, you've been able to tax efficiently sell a lot of assets and I'm just wondering how deep that pool is. My understanding was that the tax efficiency pool was sort of shrinking and I didn't know if that meant you had to use the DPE book to kind of effectuate more buybacks. So is there any color you can sort of share with us on that?</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Well, look I don't -- we'll see what we go through and don't go through in December. I mean every deal has unique structure and tax planning optimization model, and it's very hard to generalize. I'm not, like, trying to avoid the question. I'm just -- like, every deal is different, and every deal a solution is different to maximize after tax net cash flow proceeds. We've done a great job of that.</p><p>I think if we saw an end to it, as you were, and I think you'd hear that from us, but that's not what you hear from us, if anything, I think what you'll hear in December is we want to go further. We are fully committed to this program. And we believe it's a program that's working as it's -- as we mapped it out in all the stock price, which unfortunately is the thing we control the least.</p><p>But we like where we're headed, and we think we have the field to do more partially from asset sales and partially as was always intended from DPE. But the downdraft in DPE that you've seen: one, is a little bit more just sort of cyclical timing; two, we're a little pickier right now about the kind of deals we're doing, and we're not toughening up our standards, but we're certainly not relaxing standards, like some other lenders might be. And I think we've done just an incredible job over the 21 years in this company of creating, what I'll call best-in-class track record with respect to New York City, mezz, preferred, deal on mortgage rates of return and loss history. So I wouldn't link those 2 things together, but yes, DPE is a source for buyback, but we see continued ability to sell assets and sell big assets and manage the tax situation in ways where we'll be able to continue to do buyback with most, if not all the proceeds.</p><p>And -- but I wouldn't expect a full presentation of that in December because I -- it's just not something that I think is in the interest of the company and our shareholders for us to do other than to let you know that we're doing it and we feel we can go deeper.</p><p>STEPHEN THOMAS SAKWA: Right. But you don't feel like it would require a lot of 1031 exchanges in order to tax shelter gains, which typically if you've got big gains, you've got to pay them out or...</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Yes. No. It wouldn't require that. I mean we're doing a little bit of that it just so happens on with -- we're doing 1010 Washington, but that's just because for those 2 deals, they married up in a way that works, so we're doing it. But we haven't really done much in the way 1031s I don't think in the past year or 2. And we might do more 1031s going forward, but not -- it's not linked to the buyback program, is all I'm trying to say.</p><p>We'll do 1031s where they make sense, and we're going to sell assets where we can and use our DPE to buy back stock where we can, and we think we have a way to go. If we ever ran into a situation where we had a gain and we had to do a special dividend, we are 100% comfortable with that. We just haven't been in that position. Will we be there or not with The News Building, that's something I guess Matt will give further guidance on in December or next year, beginning of next year, when we close. If we do, we do and -- but we think we have strategies where we won't have to or we want to do very big ones. So I would just -- I can't generalize it, I would just say, let's take it as it goes.</p><p>STEPHEN THOMAS SAKWA: Okay. And then second, I know that you've got a large lease with Ralph Lauren coming up at the end of the year and you've got a building there with a ground lease that's sort of coming up for reset, is there any color you can just sort of provide as it relates to the leasing of that space or how we should be thinking about kind of the burn off of that lease and kind of the redevelopment and capitalization of that building moving forward?</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Well, the Polo lease was in place for about 15 years, and the deal for us has been very, very profitable. We have taken out all our basis and then some from the original purchase. So at this point we're in a profit participation really with no downside, at least with the original capital investment. And now we're looking to maximize the next...</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: Building has got positive NOI without Polo.</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Yes. It's got positive NOI without Polo and we're still making that on basically no basis. And now it's our job to figure out how to create a new 15-year asset out of that, which we would typically do with a fairly middle-of-the-road redevelopment program for an asset that's in a great location and we can deliver at a very competitive price point, but we will likely wait until the rent reval before committing any substantial sums of new capital, so we know exactly what the economic returns look like to us.</p><p>Once that's known and we're preparing our 2020 guidance without leasing up that space, and we feel we're in a very good place without it if we are to lease it in 2020, that'll be upside, but that's not the plan right now. But when I say that, Steve is out there showing the building or showing that space, the space always shows better when there's no tenant there. Right now Polo is still operating. I think they maybe even are extending their time a bit or...</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: A little for a couple of months on the part of the space.</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Yes. So I mean let's first get the space, which we know right now it's fully leased building and it's a high cash flowing building. We will get it back. We will develop a redeveloping plan, we will take it through the rent revaluation. We think we're in a good position there given how that works and given the state of the market and then be in a position to share with you specifics as to tie your lease up and the capital and NOI creation, but it's all -- we look at it all as upside to our baseline at this point.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo.</p><p>BLAINE MATTHEW HECK, SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Steve, can you talk a little bit about CapEx trends out there? It looks like your TIs per foot in concession on signed deals were just a little higher this quarter, but we've heard from other sources that concessions may be leveling off in the market. Can you just talk about what you're seeing on the ground at this point?</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: Well, I've been saying that concessions have leveled off since the second half of last year. Our numbers fluctuate depending on how much of the leasing that we do at any one point in time is our new leases for raw space versus renewals versus installations that may be leased by new tenants that have a salvage value to it. So it's -- but to do an apples-to-apples comparisons for long-term lease on raw space, concessions have generally been around $100 a foot in TI, sometimes a little heavier on the higher price point rents, sometimes a little lower on some of the more commodity buildings, but when you blend that together with renewals and retrofits, that's what pulls that weighted average down. But broadly speaking, I think concessions have been leveled for quite a while, and certainly the free rent has definitely leveled off more than a year ago.</p><p>BLAINE MATTHEW HECK: All right, that's helpful. And I guess related to that, given the current supply/demand dynamics you guys are seeing in the market, do you think you can give us updated thoughts on expected net effective market rent growth or decline in Manhattan over the next 12 months and maybe which submarkets you think are poised to outperform or underperform at that average?</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Blaine, I think that's a little bit of commentary you should wait for December to hear.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from James Feldman from Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR US OFFICE AND INDUSTRIAL REIT ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I guess sticking with CapEx, we get a lot of questions about whose portfolio needs to have -- needs to be upgraded to be competitive, can you just talk through, as you think across your portfolio, I mean what percentage of your asset base do you think is kind of in prime fighting condition for beat? And how much do you think actually still needs to have, whether it's lobby upgrades or other types of upgrades as you think about next couple of years?</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: I think all but 625 is probably meets that, maybe 750 Third. 2 out of 30-something-assets, I would say are in need -- we may be considering what round trippers where we've done it already, 10, 15, 20 years ago where -- it's not like one and done, so our CapEx spend has been drifting down on the, let's call it, the steady-state portfolio. We've been devoting the money to new developments, separate issue. But on the same-store portfolio, our CapEx spend for base building redevelop is down materially. And it was for '19, and will be I think again for '20 for sure. 625 Mad you heard me speak about before at some point that could be '21, '22 that will be on our docket, for sure. And 750 Third, not a heavy spend, but we'll be doing some work there because that's where we have some vacancy coming up and it's the time in its life cycle where we should be attending to that property. But by and large, I'd say we're in excellent shape in terms of our buildings. Just walk in and you'll see they're all fresh and redone and look great.</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: Just to add to that, to my point, we continually reinvest in the buildings. By way of example, over the past 1.5 year or so, we redid the lobby in public areas of 1185 Avenue of the Americas, and we redid 461 Fifth. So not huge repositioning efforts, but the money that we've spent has been very effective and has contributed to some very effective leasing as well.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Okay. That's helpful. And then just latest thoughts on The Street retail market, have you seen any change over the last quarter or so?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: I would say, it's hard to pick quarter-to-quarter as a barometer. I mean we announced the [graft] lease on Madison and there's still decent activity, we just don't have a lot of vacancy to lease right now. So it's still a correcting market from the top and I think a lot of landlords are holding out because they have capital structure issues for rents that were sort of yesterday's rents as opposed to today's rents, but we've been able to meet the market in circumstances where we've needed to and attract high-quality tenants.</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: We've got good activity on One Vanderbilt. We have like a corner of left on Madison that we've got multiple deals we're negotiating. We're going through the early stages of repositioning Worldwide Plaza retail. We've got some leases there we're negotiating. So on 1st Jan, we have activity on same-store portfolio, as Andrew said, it's like leased, so we're in great shape.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.</p><p>NICHOLAS PHILIP YULICO, ANALYST, SCOTIABANK GLOBAL BANKING AND MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Steve, I was hoping you could talk through some of the leasing activity on some of the other larger tenant expirations you have coming up. Putting aside 625 Madison, maybe you can talk about 1185 Avenue of the Americas where you have NHL and News Corp leaving. And then also the Advance Magazine group space.</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: Yes. So starting with the 1185, we have rolled in that building over the next couple of years. We're not -- we're sitting with a modest amount of space right now. We're trading proposals with 1 tenant for 2 floors, with another tenant for as much as 5 floors. Not to suggest that either of those tenants will end up executing leases on, but we're getting good exposure to the market and feel very good about the space because most of it's high up in the building. And as I said earlier, the building has recently received some capital enhancements with the new lobby, new entrance, new elevator cabs and they look fantastic.</p><p>On the Advance space, Advance has sort of spread, which is Cond\u00e9 Nast, just for those who don't know, they're spread between 711 Third Avenue, 45 Lexington Avenue and 750 Third Avenue. At 750 Third Avenue, we have leases out on 2 of the floors. At 711 Third Avenue, we have leases out on 2 of their floors. And on 45 Lexington, where they've got the bulk of the space, we're trading proposals on another 80,000 square feet. So that space doesn't come back to us for I think depending on which building it is, anywhere between 1 year to 3 years out. So I think we're going to knock off a good chunk, if not the majority of it, in advance of lease expiration.</p><p>NICHOLAS PHILIP YULICO: Okay. That's good to hear. And then on One Madison, Marc, I think you said redevelopment could start by middle of next year, and I'm just wondering does that mean Cr\u00e9dit Suisse would move out early ahead of the December expiration? And then what does that mean for I guess the rough time frame for delivery of the new building? And I guess, Matt, how should we think about at what point the building gets -- becomes capitalized and removed from FFO?</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Right. So we're going to start doing soft demo actually in the beginning of the year and then we'll do some more invasive demo towards the second or third quarter of next year. Cr\u00e9dit Suisse I think they're out of most, if not all the space, but they're certainly out of most of the space. And so we have arrangements with not just Credit Suisse, but some of the other smaller subtenants there where we'll be able to launch this project in the middle of next year and have a time line that would bring us to a TCO by the end -- by middle to end of the third quarter of '23. So it's not a long -- particularly long development, given the complexities of a tower overbuild on a building that is going to go through a complete repositioning with new facade, new lobby redevelopment, new storefronts, outdoor space creation, it's going to be an incredible project. Equal in my mind in many ways to One Vanderbilt, just different, but sort of equally exciting and equally attractive to a tenant base that wants to be there. So that's the time line, and that hasn't really changed since whatever time line we've spoken about initially, it's always been a 2020 start and kind of a middle to just after middle of '23 finish. Matt?</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: And to answer your question on capitalization, capitalization starts whenever CS vacates, whenever that might be. Their lease expiration right now is end of 2020, so the capitalization will start then. If they left earlier, it'll start at that point.</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Yes. They still have some presence there.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley.</p><p>VIKRAM MALHOTRA, VP, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: I had a couple specific ones. Just on -- any updated thoughts on plans around Worldwide, given the news on Cravath moving out from there?</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Well, I mean Cravath move I think is, like, 2024. So that's going to be -- it's going to be -- we're going to be -- we have plans, but if I said they were preliminary in nature, I'd be understating it. It's '19. They're in their hard through '24. 5 years is a lot of time for a lot of different things to happen, which we've thought through in terms of redevelopment or advance leasing or growth within the buildings, et cetera. And so we'll -- I'm not sure I understand the question, what is the question exactly, Vikram?</p><p>VIKRAM MALHOTRA: Just specifically -- I mean any other thoughts around -- I mean you have a JV there, any other thoughts on any capital in the building, any changes around kind of building itself (inaudible) from here on...</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: No. I mean way too early in. It's just -- I don't want to not answer it. I mean it's just -- trust me when I say, it's like way too early. I mean under that guise, we'll be planning for entire portfolio. I mean you've got remember, our average lease term in this portfolio is 9 to 10 years. So in 9 to 10 years we have 30 million feet rolling. I mean that's -- so there's always space, something that's 5 years out...</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: That we're only 25% of.</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: That's -- 5 years out, for a built building, it's really quite excellent space. It'll have to be tailored to someone at that time with a refreshener, if you need to, but who knows what's going to happen in the next 5 years in terms of the kind of demand that may materialize for that, whether Cravath has to hold over or not, I mean it's just all sorts of variables that is way, way too early to have any kind of serious dialogue about it now in my opinion. I'm not saying that's right, I'm just saying that's where we are.</p><p>VIKRAM MALHOTRA: Fair enough. And then just on the Polo space, Matt, just on what potentially can be capitalized before redevelopment or can you give us a sense of how that might play out?</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: So capitalization is based on property level, debt, its stated interest rate, if there is any. In the case of 625, there isn't and then you would capitalize based on book basis at the weighted average of cost of debt of the company at the point that the building is vacated and put into redevelopment.</p><p>VIKRAM MALHOTRA: Okay. Great. And then just one last one. If you can clarify, the McDonald's lease, given they've relocated, is that -- can you give us any sense of plans there in Times Square?</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: Well, I mean the space is on the market. They've vacated. They continue to pay rent through '23 I think, to 2023. So we're going to market the space and hope to find a quality tenant, but we're also going to be careful about who we select as we have McDonald's, they're still paying rent.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Anthony Paolone from JP Morgan.</p><p>ANTHONY PAOLONE, SENIOR ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just two quick ones. One, I think Marc you mentioned at the outset, 100 basis points of occupancy pick up I think in the fourth quarter. Anything particular driving that or is it...</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Well, the 1.7 million square foot pipeline, we're going to try and make as much of that as humanly possible by [Dec] 31. There's a lot of money lines going around this place right now as to where it's going to ultimately land by today, well that line is already set by December 9, which is Investor Day and then the ultimate Dec 31. If you want in that pool, we can call you after.</p><p>ANTHONY PAOLONE: Yes. But is that -- so is that a leased number, is that like commenced like sequential .</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: It's always...</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: That's a lease number.</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Always lease square footage occupancy.</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: Up from 95 3 to the goal of 96 2. So we're right on the trajectory we expected to be as of the end of quarter.</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Yes. That's not to say there's not work to be done. It's not locked and loaded. We've got to go sign a bunch of leases, but I think that's what we're here to do for the next 2.5 months.</p><p>ANTHONY PAOLONE: Okay. Got it. And then just second one, I know you and Vornado did a nice job with 280 Park a few years ago, it seems like you've gotten some lift in rents from that project, but maybe just a small deal but I noticed in the quarter you had a deal that rolled down like 20%, I'm just curious, like, is there anything to read into that in terms where rents in Park Avenue corridor may have gone?</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: No. It was a small deal of a tenant that went bust on us. As I recall, it was 5,000 square-foot tenant that was in a prebuilt space that the rent reflected the fact that we've put much capital into that unit. But we have leases that are in negotiation right now of much larger than that one, that one little tenant, in the high $80s to low $100s. So very healthy rents, much higher than where the building was predevelopment. It used to be a $55 to $65 building and now it's a $85 to $120 building, depending on where you are. And we've got -- we don't have a lot of vacant -- we have very little vacancy to begin with and very little to roll. So what we've got to play with is all -- some of the best parts of the building because the base of the building is all locked down long term.</p><p>OPERATOR: At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Marc Holliday for closing remarks.</p><p>MARC HOLLIDAY: Okay. So I guess no questions may mean no one's on the line, but for those that are, we, again, thank you for giving us the hour and enjoyed answering the questions and mostly look forward to seeing all of you bright and early, 9:00 kickoff, December 9, Jazz at Lincoln Center, and we promise to keep it interesting. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Welcome to VeriSign's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. At this time, I'd like to turn the comments over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.</p><p>DAVID ATCHLEY, VP &amp; CORPORATE TREASURER, VERISIGN, INC.: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO.</p><p>This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There you will also find our third quarter 2019 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.</p><p>Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.</p><p>VeriSign retains its long-standing policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.</p><p>In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS, FOUNDER, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, VERISIGN, INC.: Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Our results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.</p><p>At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 157.4 million, consisting of 144 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the third quarter, we processed 9.9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.27 million names.</p><p>Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2019 will be approximately 73.6%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.8% achieved in the third quarter of 2018. For 2019 full year, we now expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 3.2% and 3.7%.</p><p>As noted during our recent earnings calls, we are engaged in the process with ICANN to incorporate the terms of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms into our .com Registry Agreement. For those not familiar with this, let me remind you that under the 2016 Amendment to our .com Registry Agreement with ICANN, which extended the term of the agreement, we and ICANN also agreed to negotiate in good faith to do 2 things. First, we agreed to reflect changes to the Cooperative Agreement into the .com agreement, including pricing terms. Second, we agreed to amend the. com agreement to include terms to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the .com registry or the Internet. We believe these discussions with ICANN are nearly complete. While it will be inappropriate at this time to provide more details, I can say that we are satisfied with the results so far. As noted, this is an ICANN process and we expect that before long, ICANN will be publishing for public comment the documents we have been discussing.</p><p>During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1 million shares of common stock for $194 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.23 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.</p><p>And now I'd like to turn the call over to George.</p><p>GEORGE E. KILGUSS, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, VERISIGN, INC.: Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $308 million, up 0.9% year-over-year.</p><p>Operating expense totaled $103 million compared to $105 million last quarter and $111 million in the third quarter a year ago. The small sequential quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of the timing of spend related to some sales and marketing programs. Year-over-year, the decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to lower expenses as a result of the sale of our Security Services business as well as the timing of spend related to periodic and planned changes to and investments in our infrastructure.</p><p>Operating income totaled $206 million compared with $195 million in the third quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 66.7% compared to 63.8% in the same quarter a year ago.</p><p>Net income totaled $154 million compared to $138 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.30 in the third quarter this year compared to $1.13 for the same quarter last year. As of September 30, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $511 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.</p><p>I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance.</p><p>As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $90 million compared to $91 million last quarter and $96 million in the third quarter a year ago.</p><p>Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 70.8% compared to 70.1% last quarter and 68.7% in the same quarter of 2018.</p><p>Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $161 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.36 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 118.6 million shares. This compares to $1.33 last quarter and $1.23 in the third quarter of 2018.</p><p>Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $208 million, and free cash flow was $197 million compared with the $187 million and $177 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.</p><p>Beginning with the first quarter 2020 earnings results, we plan to eliminate our discussion and presentation of non-GAAP measures with the exception of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA on which we will continue to report. As a result, our full year 2020 guidance, which we'll provide on our next call, will only include GAAP metrics. This change is the culmination of the declining trend and influence of our non-GAAP adjustments over the last several years and is consistent with the evolving trends and best practices in financial reporting.</p><p>Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.228 billion to $1.233 billion, narrowed from the $1.225 billion to $1.235 billion range provided on our last call. This revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year 2019 of between 3.2% and 3.7%.</p><p>Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 69.5% and 70%, increased and narrowed from the 68% to 69% range provided on our last call. Our interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $44 million to $49 million, narrowed from the $42 million to $49 million range provided on our last call.</p><p>Capital expenditures in 2019 are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, decreased from the $45 million to $55 million range provided on our last call. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $95 million, narrowed from the $85 million to $100 million range provided previously.</p><p>To recap, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2019.</p><p>Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS: Thanks, George. The third quarter is another solid quarter for VeriSign. And as further expansion of the domain name base and year-over-year revenue growth, we generated and efficiently returned value to our shareholders. We continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders.</p><p>We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question today from Rob Oliver with Baird.</p><p>MATTHEW STEVEN LEMENAGER, JUNIOR ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Matthew Lemenager on for Rob. I do appreciate the comments around the ICANN registry agreement negotiation. So as we look forward, could you remind us, once the public comment period would open up, what does the time line look like after that? I believe you have to give a 6-month notification period before you can make any formal changes in pricing. So I assume that entire review period with ICANN would be complete by kind of April 2020, which can be time frame that it's going to need to be completed by. But can you just remind us what the time line looks like after the public comment period opens?</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS: Sure, Matt. Yes, let me explain how -- what we expect in the public comment period with the caveat that this is an ICANN process so I can't speak with certainty and I don't speak for ICANN, but I can tell you what the expectation is and what they typically do. As I mentioned, we will expect them to shortly publish these documents for a comment period. ICANN's comment periods are typically about 40 days. There's typically a short period where they review the comments. And then after that, it's normally expected that some action would be taken an approval on, on that process. Again, it's ICANN process. I can't tell you with certainty, but that's typically what they do and that's basically an expectation based on what they've done in the past.</p><p>In terms of any price increases, we don't guide to pricing. We need to finalize this ICANN process first. So I can't offer you any details on that, but hopefully that answered your question.</p><p>MATTHEW STEVEN LEMENAGER: Yes, that's helpful. And then I think another one on kind of the newer initiatives, I suppose. Is there any update to .web and the process there?</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS: Yes. Actually, there is some new information since we spoke to you last quarter on .web. Just for the benefit, I guess, of everybody else on the call, for context, there's an option for .web. And one of the losing bidders, a company called Afilias, a competitor of ours, filed what is a form of an arbitration proceeding called an IRP in November of 2018 that's against ICANN. And as a reminder, ICANN filed a response to the complaint. We're not a party to that arbitration, but we have filed a request asking to participate in that arbitration as an interested party, which is allowed by ICANN's rules. So the update is that since last quarter, kind of a significant update, I guess, is that an arbitration panel has been appointed, convened, that actually held a hearing just very recently, a couple of weeks ago, on our request to participate. That hearing was held, and we expect a ruling on that issue of our participation before the end of the year.</p><p>MATTHEW STEVEN LEMENAGER: Okay. Got it. And then lastly, just on the sales and marketing expense. It was down 28% year-over-year. I think it's a couple of quarters in a row that's declined. I mean do you -- is there any expectation -- would that go -- just trying to think about how to, I don't know, call that out into 2020. It seems like -- would that level off at some point if we kind of do .web and put marketing dollars behind that? Or anything, I guess, maybe that you could give color around the sales and marketing expense?</p><p>GEORGE E. KILGUSS: Yes. Sure, Matt. This is George. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the big change in expense year-over-year really is a result of the sale of our VSS business. As it relates to sales and marketing, there was -- most of that expense came out of sales and marketing year-over-year, so that's primarily the year-over-year decline. As far as where sales and marketing is going in the future, we'll provide -- we don't provide guidance on the individual segments, but we will give you an idea of our expectation for next year on our call in February.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.</p><p>STERLING AUTY, SENIOR ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Let's start with the renewal rate in the quarter down year-over-year. Can you give us some context or color? Is there any particular region or factor that led to that decline?</p><p>GEORGE E. KILGUSS: Sure, Sterling. This is George. Regarding renewal rates, our Q3 preliminary renewal rate is expected to be down about 1.2% or 73.6% year-over-year when you consider the 2 major components of our renewal rates. Our previous renewed rate has held consistent in the mid-80% range both year-over-year and sequentially. However, we've seen a slight decrease in our first-time renewal rate in the quarter. And while there's a variety of factors that can influence that, it -- for us, it's really been a geographic mix in the quarter, as we previously mentioned. China registrars, first-time renewal rate as well as what we call the emerging markets at historically lower first-time renewal rates than, let's say, more mature markets like the U.S. and Europe. And as China has continued to grow for us in 2018 and again in 2019, it's really this change in geographic mix which is causing a little bit of downward pressure on the first-time renewal rate.</p><p>STERLING AUTY: So that makes sense. So maybe a follow-up is, the 9.9 million new names processed in the quarter, can you give us maybe a little bit more granularity as to what the geographic makeup of that looks like and how that has trended over the last year?</p><p>GEORGE E. KILGUSS: Well, if you point to the 9.9 million gross adds, and that's a good stat for us. I mean gross adds were up 3.5% year-over-year in the third quarter, which actually was a record gross add third quarter for us. So continued good demand for the product in the third quarter here.</p><p>As far as the regions of gross adds, they tend to change quarter-to-quarter depending on where registrars are fulfilling demand. But again, China has done well for us in the third quarter. Third quarter, we saw EMEA do pretty well for us, and Asia Pacific was doing pretty well for us as well in the third quarter.</p><p>STERLING AUTY: Got it. Moving over to the negotiation with ICANN. I think there's a number of investors that just felt like, well, why isn't this just a slam dunk, quick, put in Item 35 and you're done. I think from some of the commentary you've made in the earnings calls, it does seem to be more of a negotiation, and negotiation usually means both sides want something. There has been some question that I get from investors as to whether the ICANN fee would go up or what other elements we might actually see. Is there any just high-level color that you can give even prior to seeing the public comment documents?</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS: So your question is specifically about when in terms of the publication for public comment? I'm not sure. You kind of lost me right at end there. I'm just not sure exactly what the question is.</p><p>STERLING AUTY: Yes. To be very specific, the question is, since it's a negotiation, should we expect that not only would we see changes to pricing coming into the registry agreement from Item 35, but will there be other changes to the registry agreement since it is a negotiation?</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS: Well, there's -- so I think -- no, I said that we can't provide any details, but I can reiterate and tell you that there's an obligation to move the changes from the Cooperative Agreement, which is the pricing, and we're satisfied with that process. And that is the Amendment 35 pricing.</p><p>There's also an obligation resulting from the 2016 extension to provide the security and stability. So I can tell you that in that process, we're satisfied as well with that process, with the discussions that we've had, including security and stability. And that -- in that process, any obligations or expenses that arise from it, that's also an area where we're satisfied with the progress and also the Amendment 35 pricing, obviously. So hopefully that answers your question.</p><p>STERLING AUTY: Yes, that makes sense. And then last question, George, just back -- as we think about the new guidance for the 3.2% to 3.7% growth in the domain overall, should we think that this would be a continuation of the trend in the renewal rate that gets us to that level for the full year? Or is there any other factors that kind of weighed on it?</p><p>GEORGE E. KILGUSS: I mean, Sterling, as we all know, there is seasonality we have in fourth quarter, i.e., there are quite a few holidays in the fourth quarter in the U.S. and abroad. And so it's obviously a combination of adds and renewal rates, but our guidance fully reflects our expectations for the full year performance.</p><p>OPERATOR: We will take our last question from Nick Jones with Citi.</p><p>NICHOLAS FREEMAN JONES, ASSISTANT VP &amp; SENIOR ASSOCIATE, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I guess thinking a little bit longer term, is there any discernible differences in kind of the number of people who are parking domains today than maybe were during the last recession? And is there kind of any difference in the business today or the profile of the registrants that you could add some color around that are different today?</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS: I think that's a very tough question to get into any specifics on. But generally, I can tell you that this business has shifted steadily over the years. You probably remember a few years ago when Google was making changes to its search algorithm and affected the way that people monetized domains, that affected registrar buying habits. Geography can play a role as well. People buy domains for different purposes in different geographies. So it's -- there are many purposes, obviously, from branding yourself and building businesses. People buy domains for defensive registration purposes. There are lots of different reasons to buy them. They vary over time. Other external factors that influence them, geography. So it's kind of hard to generalize. I can't think of any standout change or shift that I can point to that indicates any specific change or aspect of our business. As George said, this was a record Q3 with 9.9 million gross adds and so demand is good for the product. Whatever the mix may be, that's a subject for publication of some data in the future. We might look at that. It's a good question, but it's really hard to sort of give you a detailed, sort of granular answer to that. There's just so much activity and so many different reasons that people buy domains and so many different types of monetization as well.</p><p>GEORGE E. KILGUSS: Yes. And as a reminder, Nick, we're a thick registry so we really -- excuse me, a thin registry, so we don't...</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS: You don't say the registrant. Registrants don't provide that. So we don't have quite as much information, but we certainly study these trends and it's -- there's a diverse set of reasons that people buy domains.</p><p>NICHOLAS FREEMAN JONES: Okay. Got it. Appreciate it. One more. With kind of an upcoming political cycle and the growing scrutiny on kind of big tech, is there any kind of increased regulatory risk to VeriSign as you guys try to implement Amendment 35 as we get into 2020? Or how should we think about that?</p><p>D. JAMES BIDZOS: We've read what you read about that. That's all we know. I read everything lately. We've read what you've read.</p><p>OPERATOR: That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley for final comments.</p><p>DAVID ATCHLEY: Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.</p><p>OPERATOR: That does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investor.visa.com\">www.investor.visa.com</url>. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website.</p><p>Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website.</p><p>For historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release.</p><p>And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, VISA INC.: Mike, thank you very much.</p><p>The past few months certainly continue to be challenging, and our focus has and will always remain on the well-being of our employees, clients and the communities in which we operate. Even with significant impacts to the economies around the world, many aspects of Visa's business have proven to be resilient and have continued -- and we've continued to invest to propel Visa's growth well into the future in consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Today, after discussing our results, I will then provide an overview of the ways COVID-19 is shifting the way consumers, businesses and governments want to pay and be paid and, in turn, how Visa is helping them. I will close with some notable deal highlights for the quarter that demonstrate how we continue to enable the movement of money globally.</p><p>So to start our third quarter results. Net revenues in the fiscal third quarter were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 17% or 16% in constant dollars. All of the business drivers were significantly impacted by the pandemic. Payments volume this quarter declined 10% globally or 9% excluding China. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe, which drives our international transaction revenues, declined 47% on a constant dollar basis driven primarily by the lack of travel. Including intra-Europe, volume was down 37%.</p><p>We processed 30.7 billion transactions or over 337 million per day through the quarter on our network, a 13% decrease over the prior year. However, in each case, the business drivers improved each month throughout the quarter meaningfully for payments volume and processed transactions, and only marginally for cross-border volume.</p><p>In new flows, Visa Direct grew global transactions in the mid-60s year-over-year. And our value-added services revenue grew in the mid-teens year-over-year. We also effectively managed our expenses, which declined 5%, but more importantly, this was achieved without affecting investments in our primary growth initiatives. Our non-GAAP EPS declined 23%.</p><p>While COVID-19 certainly impacted our fiscal third quarter performance, there are many trends that are accelerating the demand for consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, which will help our business as we look ahead. In consumer payments, even with all the success Visa has had electronifying payments, there is still $18 trillion transacted in cash and check globally. In today's environment, people are sensitive to touching surfaces, including cash and check, and we are seeing this manifest in interest and usage in tap to pay, which we know helps digitize cash at the low-ticket level and has historically increased transactions by an average of 20% over time in mature markets globally. From second quarter to third quarter, we had nearly 50 countries improve tap to pay penetration by more than 5 percentage points, and over 10 countries increased by 10 percentage points or more. We have helped more than 55 countries to increase the tap to pay limits, reducing the share of transactions that require consumer contact by more than 40% in several of those countries.</p><p>In the United States, we added more than 80 million contactless cards in the first 6 months of calendar year 2020 as a number of our financial institution partners accelerated their issuance schedules. Tap to pay is likely to accelerate post-COVID, especially as consumers start going back to the office, where they tend to conduct smaller transactions for their commute, paying for public transit fares and buying food and drinks.</p><p>Another positive trend has been the shift to e-commerce. This works in our favor because Visa's share of digital commerce where cash is not an option is approximately 3x greater than the physical point of sale. In the United States, Visa credentials active in e-commerce, excluding travel, were over 12% higher in June than in January. In addition, the total spend per active credential also increased during that time by over 6%, which is notable considering new adopters typically spend less than those used to shopping online. In fact, when you isolate the active credentials who tend to be more significantly engaged in e-commerce, the spend per active credential increased by over 25%.</p><p>And these trends are not unique to the United States. During this period, in the U.K., active e-commerce credentials increased 16%, while spend per active credential increased 3%. In Brazil, active e-commerce credentials increased 11%, while spend per active credential increased 12%. In markets where e-commerce is not as developed, there are examples of dramatic changes in adoption. Argentina experienced active e-commerce card growth of over 100% and Romania, 70%.</p><p>In new flows, we continued our focus on addressing the $185 trillion opportunity. In B2B, the opportunity is across card-based, accounts payable and receivable and cross-border payments. While B2B volume is down during this work from home and very limited travel period, we are continuing to build out our capabilities and relationships to fuel future growth.</p><p>A couple of quick points from the quarter. We recently established a global partnership with U.K. fintech Conferma Pay, which enables companies to provision virtual Visa commercial cards to employees' digital wallets, enabling tap to pay and simplifying expense reimbursement.</p><p>For our large-ticket cross-border B2B solution called Visa B2B Connect, we continue to build the network out. Many banks are in the implementation phase. And when they are all live by the end of the year, Visa will be processing cross-border transactions in half of the 80 markets where Visa's B2B Connect capability is available.</p><p>Let's look at the remainder of new flows. In the United States, P2P is up almost 80%. And in Latin America, we saw progress with P2P apps in Peru, where there was nearly a 400% increase in transactions in Q3 versus Q2.</p><p>Visa is also excited to announce a global partnership with PayPal including its Venmo, Braintree, Zoom, iZettle and Hyperwallet brands. This is an extension of a long-standing regional partnership with PayPal. This new global agreement will allow PayPal and all of its brands to offer fast Visa Direct-enabled domestic and cross-border payments and expand PayPal's real-time transfer capabilities globally.</p><p>In the gig economy, food and grocery delivery category, we have seen a nearly 50% growth in transactions from pre-COVID levels and have continued to add new program launches such as Instacart for shopper earnings payouts in Canada.</p><p>G2C, government-to-consumer, use cases are gaining momentum, employing both Visa Direct and prepaid cards. This quarter, let me highlight some of the card examples. In the U.S., the Treasury distributed nearly 4 million economic impact payments via Visa prepaid cards. We also worked with CaixaBank in Spain on 3 projects issuing 330,000 prepaid Visa cards with government-allocated funds to support vulnerable families across the region. In France, Natixis partnered with Visa to issue 15,000 cards as a thank you to frontline hospital workers, financed by the government.</p><p>In value-added services, we've seen more clients turn to us for help. As e-commerce has expanded and new sellers are looking to offer omnicommerce payment capabilities that are safe and secure, our CyberSource and fraud and risk capabilities have seen growth. Let me name 2 recent examples. A recent win in Saudi Arabia with Al Rajhi Bank, the largest acquiring bank in the country, will leverage CyberSource to enable e-commerce payments platform for all Saudi Arabian government services through a centralized interface with the country's Ministry of Finance. Buying online, picking up in-store has become very popular among consumers and is a key way for sellers to operate in this environment. However, this use case does bring a higher potential for fraud. One home improvement partner chose Decision Manager, a CyberSource fraud offering, to quickly review online orders for fraud risk and meet customer expectations for a 2-hour pickup. This resulted in a massive increase in Decision Manager transactions in May alone at this merchant. Across all CyberSource risk products in Q3, we saw a nearly 50% year-over-year growth in transactions.</p><p>Interest also has grown in our authentication products. CardinalCommerce, which provides network-agnostic products for sellers and issuers to leverage the 3D Secure standard, has seen accelerated growth in transactions this quarter versus last year. 3D Secure is making steady progress in Europe as well, where the ecosystem is ramping up in advance of the secure customer authentication mandate beginning in December for most of Europe. We continue to work with the ecosystem participants as the deadline approaches, given that some are not ready for the deadline. EMV 3D Secure transactions in Q3 has grown over 100% compared to Q2.</p><p>Data and consulting continue to be valuable to our clients as they navigate this environment. Clients utilized our consulting services at an accelerated rate with almost 60% more projects completed than the third quarter of last year. Visa plays a critical role in providing data and analysis to help clients manage their business through the pandemic. And the client activity on our Visa Analytics Platform increased 60% just from Q2 alone.</p><p>Now let me talk to new deals where we made very good progress this quarter. First, our momentum in Europe continues. We renewed with one of the largest banks in the Nordics, Nordea, to grow debit portfolios across the region. We expanded our partnership with Permanent TSB, a large issuer in Ireland with over 800,000 cards in force, making Visa the primary card in most wallets in Ireland. We recently extended our partnership with UBS in Switzerland to debit. And we're winning processing. In Spain, we secured a significant deal to expand our processing capabilities for domestic transactions. Banco Caminos will migrate their issuing and acquiring volumes from their local processor to Visa.</p><p>Europe was certainly not the exception in developing and renewing partnerships this quarter. In Singapore, we renewed our partnership with the second-largest debit issuer, OCBC Bank, to remain the preferred debit card issued to OCBC Bank's personal savings and current account customers. In Korea, we recently secured a renewal with South Korea's biggest issuer, Shinhan Card. We renewed our credit and debit partnership with Banco de Bogota, our largest issuer client in Colombia. We recently won, started issuance with Kaspi Bank, one of the largest retail banks in Kazakhstan. The bank is moving 100% to Visa over the next few years.</p><p>And our leadership position in co-brand also continued. This quarter, Visa renewed and expanded its strategic partnership with Best Buy, including extending the My Best Buy co-brand relationship. Ford and Visa will collaborate on Ford's new FordPass Rewards Visa Card available to their 4 million FordPass rewards members and other Ford customers.</p><p>Another recent co-brand win was with Verizon to launch a Visa credit card that provide savings on Verizon's industry-leading products and services along with benefits for everyday and essential purposes. And we signed a co-brand deal with Tiki, one of the leading e-commerce platforms in Vietnam.</p><p>A key component to building issuance and acceptance is with fintechs. And this quarter, we secured many wallet and neobank wins globally. Let me name a few. Careem, the biggest ride-hailing app in the Middle East and Africa, will offer driver payouts with Visa Direct as well as credentials to their over 35 million user base. Hong Kong's digital transit card, Octopus, will accept Visa wallet top-ups, allowing commuters to pay for transport and to pay in 35,000 retail outlets. In Saudi Arabia, we signed a strategic partnership with [Hala], a rising challenger bank that has the potential to penetrate an unbanked population of up to 7 million people. Neobank Vivid Money announced its official launch in Germany, offering Visa debit cards in an all-in-one mobile application, including innovative savings and cash-back solutions.</p><p>In the U.S., U.S.-based Chime, with over 8 million accounts, launched access to a new Visa secured credit card, which allows consumers to build credit while spending on everyday purchases like groceries and monthly subscriptions.</p><p>I've often said, partnerships are fundamental to Visa's business model, and these renewals and new deals will certainly help drive growth into the future.</p><p>Before I close, I would be remiss if not to comment on the race situation in this country and around the world. For 4 centuries, Black and African-American women and men have experienced many forms of social injustice and discrimination. It is offensive. It is frustrating, and it's unacceptable. It must stop. At Visa, we are committed to do our part. Visa recently announced the next steps in our journey to drive inclusion and diversity across our company. We've announced a number of actions, including the establishment of a Visa scholars and jobs program. And very importantly, last week, we announced that we are committing to increasing the number of underrepresented U.S. vice presidents and above by 50% in the next 3 years and increasing the number of underrepresented U.S. colleagues within Visa overall by 50% in the next 5 years.</p><p>So to close, while there is some uncertainty in the near term for sure, we remain confident about our long-term strategy and growth prospects and our ability to make a positive difference in the world. On one hand, net revenue, EPS, overall payments volume, cross-border volume and process transactions declined this quarter. Yet we saw growth in debit and in e-commerce volumes, in Visa Direct transactions, growth in tap to pay and click-to-pay enablement and value-added services revenue.</p><p>Furthermore, we've demonstrated our discipline. We've been able to reduce expenses by 5% this quarter while still investing in future growth. And we returned capital to our shareholders at historic levels and retained our dividend. All of this speaks to the resiliency of our business model. We have the scale, a trusted brand, digital products, financial levers and, most importantly, a talented team to emerge from this pandemic even stronger. We remain confident in the efficacy of our global network of network strategy as we enable the movement of money for everyone everywhere.</p><p>Now for more detail, let me turn it over to Vasant.</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU, VICE CHAIRMAN &amp; CFO, VISA INC.: Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. As we did last quarter, we will provide a fair amount of color on the business trends we are seeing as we navigate through this unprecedented time. I'll begin with the key business drivers, then review our financial results and close with some perspectives on the next quarter.</p><p>Starting with U.S. payments volume. For the quarter, U.S. payments volume declined 7%, a sharp decline from mid-April was followed by a V-shaped domestic spending recovery. Volumes declined 18% in April before returning to positive territory in June. July volumes through the 21st are up 7%. This recovery was jump-started by the economic impact payments and enhanced unemployment benefits, helped along by pent-up demand fulfillment and accelerated by the relaxation of shelter in place requirements.</p><p>Debit outperformed credit by almost 30 points. Debit spending was up 8%, while credit spending declined 21% in the quarter. Credit spending recovered 21 points from a decline of 30% in April to a decline of 9% in July through the 21st. Debit spending bounced 30 points from down 5% in April to up 25% in July.</p><p>The outperformance of debit versus credit is driven by several factors. Some of them are more likely to persist than others. First, the government's economic impact payments were directly deposited into consumers checking accounts, benefiting debit. Second, in times of economic uncertainty, consumers have a propensity to shift spending from money they borrow to money they have in the bank. Third, as you know, there has been a significant shift to online purchases in almost every day, almost every -- in most everyday spend categories, which favors debit. Fourth, affluent customers tend to use credit for discretionary spending in categories such as travel, entertainment and restaurants, which have been especially hard-hit by the pandemic. Fifth, the last tranche of economic impact payments as well as unemployment benefits in over 20 states were distributed via Visa prepaid cards, which lifted debit growth by several points in May and June.</p><p>Finally, in the U.S., Visa Direct was up over 75% this quarter due to strong growth in a variety of use cases, ranging from P2P to insurance payouts to payroll. The significant growth in debit demonstrates the acceleration of the secular shift away from cash to digital forms of payment as a result of the pandemic.</p><p>The COVID crisis has also significantly accelerated the secular shift to e-commerce. Card-not-present spend, excluding travel, has grown over 25% every week since mid-April, which is 2x the pre-COVID growth rate. Card-present spending improved steadily through the quarter as reopenings went into effect, from declining almost 50% in early April to declining in the high single digits by late June, but there has been little improvement since. It is too early to tell what all the underlying causes of this recent stabilization are. Recovery trajectories for card-present volumes are relatively similar across states.</p><p>In terms of U.S. spend by category excluding Visa Direct, performance can be summarized in 3 groups based on COVID impact and the recovery we've seen to date. Each group represents roughly 1/3 of our U.S. payments volume.</p><p>The first group includes categories such as food and drug stores, home improvement and retail goods. These categories have consistently grown at or above their pre-COVID growth rates, in the high teens or even higher every week since mid-April.</p><p>The second group includes categories that experienced spend declines between 10% to 50% in April and had all recovered to growth by the end of June. These segments include automotive, retail services, department and apparel stores, health care, education, government and business supplies.</p><p>The third group includes categories that are the hardest hit by this pandemic: travel, entertainment, fuel and restaurants. These categories declined over 50% in April and are still declining year-over-year, although each improved by between 20 to 45 points during the quarter. Travel remains the most impacted category, still down over 50%. Fuel gallons purchased are growing again, but spend is down more than 15% in July driven by lower prices. Within the restaurant category, card-present spend is still declining, while card-not-present spend continues to grow significantly with quick-service restaurants outperforming.</p><p>Moving on to trends in the rest of the world. International payments volume declined over 12% in constant dollars in the third quarter. Similar to the U.S., debit significantly outperformed credit, with debit down only 3% and credit down 20%. Card-present spend improved through the quarter as countries reopened, while card-not-present excluding travel spend remained elevated.</p><p>Performance across categories was broadly similar to the U.S. Our best-performing region continues to be CEMEA, which declined 5% in constant dollars. Within CEMEA, Russia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia had positive growth in the quarter, fueled by a rapid recovery after April declines as well as client wins.</p><p>Europe payments volume declined 10% in constant dollars in the third quarter. Central and Southeastern Europe, which include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, recovered rapidly to post positive growth in the quarter. The U.K. returned to growth in June driven by consistently strong card-not-present growth. Italy is almost back to prior year levels in June, following one of the strictest lockdowns within Europe.</p><p>Canada declined 15%, and Latin America declined 13% in constant dollars. Brazil spend decline early in the quarter was one of the shallowest, but the recovery has also been slow. Brazil is now back near 2019 levels of domestic spending, fueled by strong card-not-present growth.</p><p>Asia Pacific payments volume declined 16% in constant dollars. Reopening of the Asian economies has been gradual, with multiple phases depending on the country. Two of the least impacted countries were Korea and New Zealand, both of which were close to flat in the quarter. Domestic spending in Japan and Australia was back to 2019 levels by late June. India remains one of the most impacted markets globally.</p><p>Processed transactions declined 13% in the quarter. Although this lags volume growth due to a mix shift, the trajectory of the processed transactions recovery is similar, improving from a 24% decline in April to a 4% decline in June. Growth in July through the 21st is flat.</p><p>Domestically, the mix of spend has shifted from low-ticket to higher-ticket categories. Cross-border transactions, on the other hand, are holding up better than volumes due to the mix shift from high-ticket travel-related spending to lower-ticket nontravel e-commerce.</p><p>Cross-border -- constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding volume within Europe, declined 47% in the third quarter. Volumes declined 51% in April and improved marginally in May to decline 45%, but there has been little improvement since. For the month of June and in July through the 21st, the rate of decline has stayed at 44%. Constant dollar cross-border volume, including volume within Europe, declined 37% in the quarter. It's important to remind you that cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe drives our international fees. As you know, the cross-border spend decline is driven by travel. Travel-related spend, which includes both card-present and card-not-present in travel categories, represented roughly 2/3 of our pre-COVID cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe.</p><p>Travel-related spend declined 78% in the quarter and was still declining over 70% at the end of June. To have a recovery in cross-border travel, you have to have a reopening of borders. At this point, borders remain largely closed. The World Tourism Organization reported at the end of June that out of 217 countries, 189 or 87% had completely or partially closed their borders to foreign visitors. Of the remaining 28 countries, 10 had completely or partially suspended flights. Several other countries like the U.K. require quarantines. And the rest had imposed visa restrictions or demand medical certificates.</p><p>As we speak, cross-border travel, especially by air, is even not possible or very difficult. While no one corridor derives a large portion of our volumes -- drives a large portion of our volumes, some of our most important corridors remain closed. Borders have to reopen before we can get a sense of what the cross-border recovery trajectory might be. In the few corridors where cross-border travel is now possible, we have seen some significant recoveries. For example, Americans are traveling again to Mexico and the Caribbean. Since the April low, these corridors have seen cross-border card-present volumes recover by 30 to 40 points. Travel to and from Switzerland to France and Germany is almost back to normal. Russian travel to neighboring countries has picked up. Travel from Europe to the U.A.E. is gaining momentum.</p><p>It is important to note that the vast majority of cross-border travel spend is on personal cards and not for business travel. Consumer travel demand for visits to friends, relatives and for vacations is more likely to remain intact post-COVID, perhaps even enhanced. The consumer travel recovery is likely to start with people going to countries within their geographic zone of comfort. This is already evident as we look at short-haul cross-border travel, which we define as less than 3,000 miles. Short-haul air travel is recovering faster than longer-haul corridors. Similarly, drive to hotels are doing better as are leisure hotels versus business hotels.</p><p>Growth in cross-border e-commerce spend excluding travel has been consistently in the high teens to low 20s since mid-April. The strong growth is fueled by retail spending, which is growing about 30% since mid-April and drives the majority of nontravel e-commerce spend. In most countries, we see that once a consumer decides to buy something online rather than go to a local store, there is a higher likelihood the purchase becomes cross-border with little regard to where the item is shipped from. The strength in retail is offset by declines in entertainment, education and government, some of which are tied to travel and represent a meaningful portion of card-not-present nontravel spend.</p><p>Much of the color I just provided excludes volume within Europe. Within the EU, borders have largely reopened. Intra-Europe cross-border card-present spend is up 40 points from the trough in April through 3 weeks in July, another indication of the possible trajectory of the cross-border recovery when borders do reopen.</p><p>A quick review of our third quarter financial results. Net revenues declined 17% in the quarter or 16% in constant dollars. Third quarter service revenues were flat with prior year and reflect last quarter's volumes. Data processing revenues declined 5%, supported by strong value-added services growth as well as acquisition-related revenue. International transaction revenues decreased 44%, in line with the decline in cross-border volumes excluding volume within Europe.</p><p>Other revenues declined 8% over the prior year due to value-added services impacted by the pandemic. The value-added services impacted by the pandemic include lower use of travel-related card benefits, lower marketing-related services for clients as many slowed marketing activities and fees we waived on certain services which surged at the outset of the pandemic. We should note that had we reported service fees without a lag, our service fees would have declined 11%, and reported net revenues would have dropped an additional 4.5 points to approximately 21.5%. These lower service fees will impact our reported revenues next quarter.</p><p>Before I move on, let me provide some more detail on where value-added services revenues are captured in the P&amp;L. In the third quarter, total value-added services revenue grew in the mid-teens including acquisitions. Approximately 2/3 of our value-added services revenues are included in data processing as many of them are transaction-based revenue streams. These value-added services grew in the mid-teens driven by the strength in U.S. debit and prepaid issuer processing, CyberSource as well as authentication and fraud services as Al highlighted. The remaining value-added services revenue is split roughly evenly between service fees and other revenue.</p><p>Value-added services and service fees also grew in the mid-teens. Value-added services recorded in other revenues grew in the mid-single digits due to acquisitions, increased use of our data products and consulting, offset by declines in the usage of card benefits and marketing services I described earlier.</p><p>Client incentives declined 2% versus last year and were 23.8% of gross revenue. As we've indicated before, the vast majority of incentives are tied to payments volumes. However, incentives declined less than gross revenue, pushing up incentives as a percent of gross revenue. Let me explain why.</p><p>First, incentives are generally tied to total payments volumes and only selectively to cross-border volumes. As declines in cross-border volumes have been deeper than total payments volumes and cross-border volumes have higher yields, incentive declines lag gross revenue declines. Second, heavy renewal activity like we had in fiscal year '19 causes incentives to grow faster than gross revenue. As a result, the decline in incentives lags gross revenue on the way down.</p><p>Offsetting these factors to some degree is the service fee lag. As I mentioned earlier, service fee lag mitigated the gross revenue decline reported this quarter. This will impact us negatively next quarter.</p><p>Third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses declined 5% as we were able to execute additional cost management initiatives particularly in the areas of marketing and G&amp;A. These expense reductions were achieved while sustaining investments in our longer-term growth initiatives. Acting early and decisively has helped us to reduce expenses fast.</p><p>Non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $118 million for the fiscal third quarter. Interest income was lower due to the sharp drop in interest rates. Interest expense was higher from our $4 billion debt issue. The non-GAAP tax rate was 19%.</p><p>Finally, some perspectives on the fourth quarter. Forecasting revenues remains a challenge in this environment. It is difficult to predict when borders will reopen and what the trajectory of the cross-border travel recovery will be post reopenings. Domestic volumes have bounced back nicely in most countries, and inevitably the rate of recovery will slow. Other uncertainties include the impact of the recent spike in infections and the economic impact of stimulus payments tapering off or ending altogether around the world.</p><p>A few points to note as you model revenue growth for the next quarter. As I indicated earlier, had we reported service revenues without a lag, third quarter net revenue would have declined an additional 4.5 points. This will cause fourth quarter reported net revenue growth to be lower than the third quarter, absent the change in trend on key business drivers.</p><p>Continued recovery in domestic payments volumes and transactions will improve the data processing revenue trend but not reported service revenues. This will be partially offset by higher incentives related to the increasing volumes. As such, the most important variable that would improve the fourth quarter net revenue growth rate is cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe.</p><p>One other point to note driven by these turbulent times: if the cross-border recovery remains sluggish through the fourth quarter, the revenue mix shift away from cross-border will persist. Adding in the impact of the service fee lag, incentives as a percent of gross revenues are likely to increase by 2 to 3 points over the third quarter levels. This percentage should normalize as cross-border volumes improve and the domestic volume recovery stabilizes.</p><p>Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter are expected to decline roughly in line with the reductions we delivered in the third quarter. Non-GAAP nonoperating expenses are expected to be around $140 million.</p><p>Even with a significant COVID-19 impact, we expect to generate a very healthy level of free cash flow this year. We ended the quarter with over $17 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investment securities on hand. With access to the commercial paper market on favorable terms and our $5 billion revolver, our liquidity position remains strong.</p><p>In the third quarter, we bought back 5.2 million shares for almost $900 million at an average price of $180.47. Year-to-date, we bought back 36 million shares for $6.5 billion at an average price of approximately $180. Our dividend policy remains unchanged.</p><p>Crises create both risks and opportunities. We have moved fast to mitigate risks by ensuring strong liquidity, reducing expenses while sustaining key growth investments and closely monitoring network performance, security, daily settlement, fraud and other key metrics. The crisis accelerated many favorable secular trends: the digitization of cash, the shift to e-commerce and the penetration of tap to pay. Visa Direct momentum has remained very strong, and value-added services have continued to grow in the mid-teens.</p><p>Our focus remains on helping all our stakeholders, cardholders, clients, governments, regulators and of course our own associates as they navigate through these unusual times. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Mike, I think you're on mute. Mike, you're on mute.</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Al, maybe we should turn to questions. Operator, why don't we move to questions?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: So Vasant, I also understand that we had a technical issue that some people might not have heard the end of mine and the beginning of yours.</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Okay.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: I'm looking for a little -- I was hoping Mike would give us a little direction whether we should summarize those points. Maybe...</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Mike is suggesting we keep going.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Okay. So maybe what I would suggest is that let me just quickly summarize what I said at the end, and maybe you could talk a little bit about U.S. debit, before we open it up to questions.</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Okay.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: So what I said is that certainly the future is going to have uncertainty associated with it, but we continue to believe in our strategy and our growth prospects. Certainly, there were things that declined in the quarter: net revenue, EPS, overall payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. But we did see growth in a number of important areas: growth in debit, growth in e-commerce volumes, growth in Visa Direct transactions, growth in tap to pay, advances in click-to-pay enablement and growth in value-added services revenue. We also demonstrated our ability to reduce our expenses while continuing to invest in the future, and we returned capital to shareholders at historic levels and retained our dividend. So net-net, we believe that our business model is resilient, and we have a lot of confidence in the efficacy of our global network of network strategy.</p><p>I think it would be helpful if you'd, Vasant, could just comment on U.S. debit because I think a lot of people might not have heard it, from what I understand.</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Okay. Yes. So I talked about why debit was outperforming credit. As you may have heard, debit has bounced back about 30 points and is now growing at about 25% in the first 3 weeks of July, whereas credit recovered by less than that and is still declining 9% through the first 3 weeks of July. I went through 6 reasons for that. I'll do those quickly.</p><p>Economic impact payments going directly into checking accounts helps debit. In times of economic uncertainty, consumers do shift spending away from money they have borrowed to money they have in the bank. Third reason, the shift to online has caused a lot of everyday spend categories to move to e-commerce, which has favored debit because normally debit is used for everyday purchases. Affluent customers, reason #4, tend to use credit for discretionary purposes like travel, entertainment and restaurants, which have been especially hard-hit in times like these.</p><p>The economic impact payments, this is reason #5, were distributed using Visa prepaid cards in 20 states including the unemployment benefits, which lifted our debit growth in May and June. And then finally, Visa Direct, which helps our debit numbers, was up over 75% this quarter as a whole bunch of use cases performed really well.</p><p>So I think we'll probably stop there, Al, and take questions. I think we might have lost Mike, so we can take questions.</p><p>MIKE MILOTICH: Jordanne, are you there?</p><p>OPERATOR: Yes, I'm here, Mike.</p><p>MIKE MILOTICH: Jordanne, if we can go into Q&amp;A, that would be great.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS, PARTNER, MOFFETTNATHANSON LLC: All right. Hopefully, you can hear me, I guess.</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Yes, we can.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: So I'm going to hit a topic you did not cover on the call. Al, question for you about big tech. The big tech companies are now facing elevated regulatory pressure, obviously very present right now in the U.S., also in Europe, related to some of their competitive practices. Can you comment on how this regulatory scrutiny you see affecting, one, those firms' initiatives in payments? Like in particular, are there anything -- any practices that they're doing that you at Visa or Visa would view should be scrutinized? And then also, do you view this sort of regulatory scrutiny on big tech as a plus for the payments ecosystem and for Visa or as potentially a negative?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Well, Lisa, as you might imagine, we have relationships with all of the companies that you would consider big techs. Some are a bit more extensive than others, but we certainly have relationships with all of them. I certainly can't comment and wouldn't comment on regulatory scrutiny that they are experiencing. But if it involves payments and we can be helpful to them or helpful to the government in either advocating or explaining what's going on, we will jump into that. There was a case with a payment initiative that we had going with Facebook in Brazil in the last month where we did just that, as an example.</p><p>I think that these big techs are -- certainly have attracted lots and lots of users and have developed relationships with them. And some of those relationships are going to require money movement or payments capability. And we certainly want to be there and be the partner to work with them on those particular things. And we'll leave it to them to figure out and deal with any of the regulatory issues that they're facing. And we're a phone call away if we can be helpful. But I think, in most cases, it's kind of up to them to resolve them.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Matt O'Neill from Goldman Sachs.</p><p>MATTHEW CASEY O'NEILL, RESEARCH ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I was hoping you could provide some anecdotal views on what I think is probably the next leg of the sort of secular catalyst here, the sort of silver lining of this pandemic, if there is one, which is obviously the e-com growth has been robust. But how are the bank partners and merchant partners sort of thinking about the move back into brick-and-mortar commerce in what will inevitably be a significantly greater demand for contactless payments?</p><p>And then if I could just have a quick unrelated follow-up. I was just wondering if there's any update on the Plaid acquisition and any comments around the lawsuit there.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Well, interestingly enough, as you probably could see in some of our charts, as card-not-present has -- I'm sorry, as card-not-present has started to work its way back, it lagged obviously, card-not-present, it was impacted much more greatly by the pandemic. Card-not-present volumes have held up, so we're not seeing any declines there. And I think that what all issuers and anybody who's rooting for economies around the world to come back would love to see a situation where both card-not-present and card-present both bounce back, and that bricks-and-mortar commerce on main streets and communities around the world continue to grow.</p><p>I think the case for contactless, Matt, has been made. We have seen consumers and governments and merchants voting through their actions, and contactless has had -- or tap to pay had tremendous momentum kind of going into COVID. And if anything, COVID had accelerated the momentum of tap to pay even in the United States, which we know has been further behind, but as I cited, we've added 80,000 -- or I'm sorry, our issuers have added 80 million credentials that are tap to pay-enabled in the first 6 months of the year. Something like 80% of the merchant volume is -- that is occurring in the face-to-face world is occurring at terminals that are enabled for tap to pay. So I think it's going to just continue to grow everywhere around the world. And I believe that the COVID situation will help accelerate the growth here in the United States at a perhaps faster pace than it might have happened otherwise.</p><p>As for Plaid...</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Al, I might add a couple of things. One, crisis fosters innovation as you know. And if anything, this has made more and more merchants focus on omnichannel commerce, which CyberSource is very much in the middle of. And increasingly, merchants are getting better and better at serving customers seamlessly across bricks-and-mortar as well as e-commerce. It has also made a lot of categories that never used e-commerce become a lot better at e-commerce. And that's -- you've seen that in a lot of everyday spend categories. You've seen that with restaurants.</p><p>And more broadly across retail, people have come up with more innovative ways like curbside delivery has been perfected in many ways. And that, we think, is going to be here with us, which is really a way where you order online, but you may pick up physically. So you have one more delivery option, you can get it delivered after a day or 2 delay, or you can get it right away by going and picking it up.</p><p>So there's a lot going on. And I think the most important point that Al made was that even as we've seen card-present improve from minus 50 to minus high single digits, card-not-present has stayed very robust, continuing to grow at those mid-20s levels for quite a while now. So lots of changes underway.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Matt, let me address your Plaid question. It's still pending regulatory approval. And we certainly are expecting to close by the end of the calendar year and are doing everything we can to comply with any request from the regulators that are looking at it. We are as excited about the Plaid acquisition today as we were back in January when we made the announcement. And we really believe we got the asset we wanted. And all of the various benefits that we have articulated in prior calls, we believe, are still there. Everything from the depth of their integration with fintechs, the fact that they are most attracted to a lot of fintechs, that they're positioned in terms of how far along they are, we believe they have the best team. And we see it as the best way to integrate into Visa. So we're -- we remain very excited about Plaid and hopeful to close by the end of the year.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research.</p><p>DARRIN DAVID PELLER, MD &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH, LLC: Just a couple of quick ones, first on the fourth quarter, fiscal fourth quarter comments. Just to clarify, I think you guys are saying that the -- just the lag effect of services versus prior quarter volume would impact that line by 4 points. But I guess we're just wondering if the -- just given the trends we're seeing on transactions processed flattening out, shouldn't those trends be enough to offset that when it comes to growth in fiscal Q4?</p><p>And then, Al, just bigger picture, when we think about the services, all these other value-added services you guys are doing well with, I mean, do you see these sticking around post-COVID in terms of the demand you're seeing for analytics and potentially the card-not-present service fees or CyberSource?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: So why don't I let Vasant answer the first piece, and I'll come back and address the second piece?</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Sure. So if you look at the various lines on the revenue line, service fees, as you indicated and as we told you in the comments, are known already. They're going to report service fees based on our volumes in the third quarter. And the volumes in the third quarter was hopefully the low point. And as we said, had we not done a lag, our service fees would have been down 11%, and total net revenue would have been down, as you said, in that 4, 4.5% range. So that is going to happen. That's a known fact. And even if volumes improve on the domestic front and transactions improve, the service fee number isn't going to change next quarter. So that's locked in. So when volumes do improve, which we expect will be the case on domestic volumes and transactions, transactions revenues will definitely go up.</p><p>Value-added services revenues will definitely go up. But the other thing that goes up is the contra-revenue line, incentives. Incentives will go up to reflect the higher volumes because we don't book incentives with a lag. Incentives will go up, but the benefit of that revenue from the higher incentives, we won't get on the services line -- service fee line, we will get it on -- we will definitely get it on the processing line.</p><p>So there's something of an offset there. I just want you to be aware of that. But the biggest variable is going to be cross-border. If there's a change in trend in cross-border and it improves, then that would be the single biggest reason to expect Q4 trends to be better than Q3, recognizing that you've got pressure going in the other direction from the service fee lag.</p><p>So there's some complexity created by these things because of the turbulent times we're in. We've tried to help you with it. And hopefully we can help you some more, if you like, answer more questions later on.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: And Darrin, on your second question, I'm very bullish on what's going to happen with value-added services in a post-COVID world. First of all, 2/3 of our value-added service is a platform-type services, CyberSource, issuer processing, risk and fraud. The need for those is going to continue. And if anything, the volumes and transactions that will run through those will go up.</p><p>Where we've seen some declines are in travel-related card benefits, which is going to get better as travel comes back. We've also waived some fees because of the pandemic. And once we're past the pandemic, we won't waive those fees as readily, so that volume will go up. Travel-related benefits will go up, as I said, as travel comes back. So I see value-added services being very well positioned coming out of COVID and feel very good about the contribution they'll make and how they'll continue to diversify our revenue profile over time.</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Yes. I think the other things to add there, 3 of our largest value-added services, we think, are going to sustain their growth, which has already accelerated. Our issuer processing business, which is directed towards debit. Debit has become the engine for cash conversion right now. Debit growth rates, as you saw, are 25% in the first 3 weeks of July. So as long as debit growth rates are at an accelerated level, the issuer processing business will clearly have high growth rates.</p><p>CyberSource always benefits from the shift to e-commerce. And now with their focus on omnicommerce, CyberSource clearly is benefiting from the shift.</p><p>And then finally, our risk and fraud services certainly benefit as things move more to e-commerce, which is where fraud is an area that we can really help a lot on. So they're reasons to believe that higher growth rates can sustain post-COVID.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from James Friedman from Susquehanna.</p><p>JAMES ERIC FRIEDMAN, SENIOR ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP, LLLP, RESEARCH DIVISION: Al, in your prepared remarks, you shared some P2P growth characteristics. You were going kind of quick there. I -- that disclosure was new, at least to me. But I was wondering if you could repeat what you said and also, at the same time, share some use cases about how you're seeing the P2P applications develop.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Well, what I said in my remarks was that P2P is up almost 80% in third quarter, and in Latin America -- that was in the United States, I'm sorry, up 80% in the third quarter. And in Latin America, there we saw progress with 2 different apps -- P2P apps in Peru where we saw a nearly 400% increase in transactions in Q3 over the prior quarter Q2.</p><p>We've got this tremendous track record of working with P2P providers. And as we said in the past, we were heavily skewed toward the United States and Russia. But we're -- and where we have relationships with most of the big P2P providers, Square Cash, Venmo, Zelle, et cetera. I think that now we're seeing our P2P capability through our Visa Direct platform becomes something that people are looking to us for as P2P applications are developing in other countries around the world.</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Since we had some issues earlier, we'll run longer. So we'll probably go for at least 10 minutes past the hour.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Craig Maurer from Autonomous Research.</p><p>CRAIG JARED MAURER, PARTNER, PAYMENTS AND FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: I was hoping, Vasant, you could comment on if we see cross-border -- the cross-border recovery continue to stagnate into next year and domestic volume continue to pick up, intra-Europe cross-border continue to pick up, where should we be thinking about incentives as a percentage of gross revenue going. What's the risk to next year in terms of upside from that percentage?</p><p>And then perhaps, Al, maybe a comment or 2 on the renewal of the Durbin Amendment version 2 or 3, whatever we're at, at this point, and EPI in Europe.</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Yes. In times like these, I think it's not easy to make long-term projections clearly. In terms of cross-border and its recovery, yes, it's possible, I suppose, that it remains sluggish. It all depends on borders reopening. Wherever borders have been opened or the restrictions have not been significant, we've seen some pretty quick recoveries. So to the extent that there are borders reopening, it may not be globally, but there could be corridors opening up as we're already hearing, Australia, New Zealand, you've seen that it's mostly open across the EU. It's starting to open in other geographies within regions. So it's not black and white, I think, in terms of the cross-border recovery. You could see some changes in travel patterns because of how countries open up. But if cross-border remains depressed, certainly the mix won't help us. And that will cause the percentage of incentives to gross revenue to stay higher than what you might call -- what it would might have been normalized mix of earnings -- of revenues.</p><p>The other factor that's influencing it is probably most acute in the fourth quarter, which is the service fee lag. Normally, our service fees from one quarter to another don't have such significant swings because our business tends to be quite stable, so that service fee lag effect will moderate. So I think the best way to describe it is it will probably normalize from the levels you see in the fourth quarter. It will certainly normalize because of service fee stabilizing. It will probably normalize some because the cross-border business will recover in corridors, but we'll wait and see how fast cross-border normalizes.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Let me address your other 2 questions you asked about Durbin. Visa is fully compliant with all the requirements of the Durbin Amendment. And we don't have any rules or requirements or other restrictions that inhibit a merchant's ability to select their routing decisions, make the routing decision of their choice. And merchants are free and often do route to various unaffiliated networks enabled on a debit card. So that would -- I think we're in good shape as it relates to Durbin.</p><p>EPI, we have a history of dealing with either regions or groups of countries or countries developing their own scheme or intra-market network. It's something that we're very, very used to dealing with. We do know though that developing a network is not an inexpensive thing to do, and it's not a onetime investment. You have to continue to push and invest and innovate and be creative to stay ahead as it relates to all the elements of security, fraud prevention, risk, authentication, et cetera.</p><p>And so we will continue to monitor and engage constructively with regulators and banks in Europe on EPI. But on the other hand, we're going to continue to invest heavily behind our various networks to make them as good as they could possibly be. And we will be continuing to focus on making sure that our clients know the benefits that they can obtain by doing business with us and running on our networks.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG, SENIOR ANALYST, JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just want to ask on the spread in U.S. debit and credit, I know you went through it a couple of times, Vasant. But it's wider than what we saw in '08, '09. So is there a way to try and quantify how much of the debit outperformance we can attribute to secular versus stimulus benefits?</p><p>And curious also, I just want to make sure, any impact on yield differences between the 2 products. I don't think so, but just wanted to make sure.</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Yes. There are some modest yield differences depending on parts of the world and so on. I don't think you should view that as a huge factor.</p><p>In terms of the reasons that might stick as we go ahead, I think we went through 6 -- 5 reasons. One, the economic impact payments and unemployment benefits being distributed on Visa prepaid cards, clearly, that's linked to the crisis and probably is not something that will continue. Affluent customers putting off some discretionary items like travel, entertainment and restaurants, which has hit credit in particular, that probably normalizes over time, so that, you can attribute to COVID. The propensity for people to spend money -- spend the money they have versus money from -- borrowed money, that is something you do see in times of uncertainty. And then some of the economic incentive impact payments going into checking accounts clearly has helped debit.</p><p>But there's a few others that are clearly sticking. The fact that Visa Direct is still going very strong, that has been helping debit for a long time, and we'll continue to do that. The fact that debit has become the mechanism for cash conversion to digital in everyday spend categories and in just about -- in most categories, which have seen a big increase in e-commerce, has benefited debit, I think some of that sticks.</p><p>So I think the best way to describe it is that the acceleration of cash conversion has disproportionately helped debit, and that is most likely going to stick.</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: And Tien-Tsin, it's Al. I would only add that I think the -- if I look back, same observation you do about the 2008/2009 time frame. But e-commerce is just much, much bigger, and it just appears that people who are doing card-not-present e-com nontravel are using their debit cards much more than their credit cards.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT, SENIOR MD, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Could you parse out some of the drivers of the 36% decline in international transaction revenue yield? I imagine a lot of that's just the big drop in cross-border travel. But if you could help us think through the drivers in terms of how much might be inter-European versus debit? And how should we think about international transaction revenue yield going forward?</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Yes. So I think it's very important to continue to point people to the decline of cross-border volumes excluding intra-Europe volumes. The decline was roughly -- was 47% in cross-border constant dollar volumes excluding intra-Europe. So the revenue decline is roughly, as you can see, in line with that. The reason being that -- and if you look at total cross-border volume, that includes intra-Europe, intra-Europe looks more like a domestic transaction. In fact, in our international revenue line, the contribution from intra-Europe transactions is very small. The international revenue line is driven almost entirely by volume excluding intra-Europe.</p><p>Now there's a few other things there that can have an impact. Exchange rate shifts can. Changes in currency volatility can. So that explains -- and then some small changes in mix in terms of which corridors are doing better than others because of some yield differences across corridors.</p><p>But that explains the 44% decline in revenues versus the 47% decline in volumes ex intra-Europe. But as you can see, watching that volume line ex intra-Europe is the best indicator, and that's what you should focus on.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, could you just comment on the 10% growth in processing transaction yield year-over-year and thoughts going forward?</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: Right. There's 2 factors driving it. One is that cross-border transactions have held up a little better than cross-border volume. So the mix has helped a bit because cross-border transactions for processing have a higher yield.</p><p>And the second is we have value-added services and some acquisitions in that line. And as you heard, value-added services are growing in the mid-teens in that line. So those 2 things have helped data processing yields go up.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird.</p><p>DAVID JOHN KONING, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: And I guess following up on that last question, you said that the ex intra-Europe volume down 47%, but 44% revenue decline. Is that gap going to change much? I know FX volatility probably helped a little bit in Q3 to make revenue a little better than the volume decline. But are there any other kind of yield factors in there other than FX volatility to think about?</p><p>VASANT M. PRABHU: The variables that can make a difference there, first of all, the 44% to 47% is a relatively small delta. There'll always be some differences between the 2. They won't match each other precisely.</p><p>But you're right, currency volatility is one factor. Another factor would be mix. Certain corridors can have better yields than others. So if the recovery of cross-border favors higher-yielding corridors, you can have something of a difference. But other than that, it should track pretty closely to volumes ex intra-Europe volumes.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our last question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein.</p><p>HARSHITA RAWAT, SENIOR RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN &amp; CO., LLC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Al, can you expand upon your recent conversations with regulators and governments? Now on one hand, some merchants are lobbying for lower fees in this crisis, and I understand that's not a new phenomenon. But then there are very real benefits of digital payments, especially in this current environment. So just -- can you just talk about how your conversations with regulators and governments are evolving in this crisis?</p><p>ALFRED FRANCIS KELLY: Look, I think like many people, governments are finding themselves in uncharted territory here. And they're all well intentioned, trying to figure out the right things to do.</p><p>Our biggest piece of advice to governments as it relates to core payments is to do no harm at the moment. I mean right now, I think the less amount of moving parts as we're fighting through this pandemic is the best answer for everybody. This is not a time for any kind of changes.</p><p>Governments are also increasingly talking to us in terms of looking for information that we have in terms of trends because they're trying to understand what's happening in their economies. And in many ways, we could get them real-time picture of what's going on, faster than they can get it themselves.</p><p>And the last thing I would say is that there's a lot of interest in the form of governments to become more role models in terms of what they want to see in their countries from a digital adoption point of view. And so as they are -- have genned up stimulus programs, unemployment programs, thank-you programs and all kinds of other things, they're looking to Visa to help advise them on how they could distribute funds digitally as opposed to cutting checks.</p><p>So I think my view at the moment is that governments have -- are being very, very thoughtful and reasonable in terms of what they're saying, and they're also being good listeners. And so we're going to continue to do our job to provide them with whatever information they need and to provide them with whatever advice and counsel we can provide to be helpful to them, both in their role as governments and setters of laws as well as in their role as potential clients for various Visa services.</p><p>Before we close out, one of the things I gather that did not -- when we had a little blackout with -- in terms of the transmission was I did before I closed make a comment about the race situation in the country and around the world. And I'd like to just cite that again.</p><p>For 4 centuries, Black and African-American women and men have experienced incredible forms of social injustice and discrimination. And it's offensive, it's frustrating and it's unacceptable, and it has to stop.</p><p>At Visa, we've committed to do our part. We recently announced the next steps in our journey to drive inclusion and diversity across our company. We announced a number of actions, including the establishment of a Visa scholars and jobs program. But very importantly, last week, we announced that we're committing to increase the number of underrepresented U.S. vice presidents and above by 50% in the next 3 years and increase the number of underrepresented U.S. colleagues within Visa overall by 50% in the next 5 years.</p><p>We want to do our part to eradicate the social injustice in the world. It's way past time that, that has to be the case.</p><p>With that, thank you to everybody. Mike, did you want to...</p><p>MIKE MILOTICH: Yes. Thank you, Al.</p><p>So yes, once again, I apologize for the technical challenges. We will make sure that the replay that's on our website as well as the transcript reflect everything.

Please go ahead.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT, CEO, ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES INC: Thanks, Rhonda, and good afternoon, everybody. Happy New Year and thank you for joining us today for the fourth quarter and 2011 year-end call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga and Krupal Raval. We hope that you like the new format and content of our press release and supplement. Hopefully it will be very informative as well as a more user-friendly and simpler to follow document. As we look forward to 2012, it appears promising as the Dow reached 12,878 yesterday at the close, the highest since pre-Lehman in May 2008. 2012 will be an important year for Alexandria. We will begin the transition of our balance sheet from the bank debt to long-term unsecured bank debt, I'm sorry, long-term unsecured bond debt having received our investment grade ratings in mid 2011 from Moody's and S&amp;P. As many of you remember, the keys to the ratings by the two agencies were -- the size and the leadership of ARE within our Life Science sector and our markets; a well diversified asset base; by geography and tenant; modest leverage; and the size and quality of our unencumbered asset pool; our ability to manage liquidity; our ability to handle higher funding costs; and the help of our operations and leasing, all of which I think have proved true in this reporting period.</p><p>We will continue our expansion domination of our key urban and CBD adjacency cluster markets with our unique and important first-in-class and first mover advantage, and I think this was clearly demonstrated by the breadth and depth of our fourth quarter 2011 and 2011 full-year leasing success. We look forward to on-boarding significant cash flows later in 2012 as we move strategic non-income producing assets to cash flowing operating assets. From fourth quarter 2010 to fourth quarter 2011, we increased -- the Board increased the dividend to approximately 40%. It's likely the Board will continue that approach of sharing increasing cash flows with our shareholders. As we proceed through 2012, it appears the fundamental drivers are in place to enable the continued expansion of a Life Science industry in our key cluster markets and for us to take advantage of that and certainly for Alexandria to continue to dominate and capture the plumb requirements which we've done in San Diego, Greater Boston and South San Francisco this past year.</p><p>We have more requirements today in some of our key cluster markets than we can actually handle; however, as we reduce our non-income producing assets, this will enable us to pursue more of these key opportunities. We hope investors focus on the fundamentals of ARE as a very high quality innovative Company with uniquely built-in platform for growth in net operating income, earnings, our best-in-class assets in irreplaceable locations with solid tenant demand for our unique lab space. For 2011, again we're very pleased and proud to report the highest leasing quarter and year in the history of the Company and again, it confirms I think the meaning and impact of our leading franchise in the Life Science industry. For the fourth quarter, we leased over 1.1 million square feet and for the year, about 3.4 million square feet and almost 1 million square feet out of development and redevelopment. We have a solid flow of requirements.</p><p>This past year the three biggest leases for development and redevelopment space were two in San Diego and one in Cambridge, of the 650,000 square feet of renewals and release space, San Diego, where we clearly dominate, contributed about 50% and Greater Boston about 23%. For the 492,000 square feet of redevelopment and development space, San Diego contributed 51% and 21% for Greater Boston. Some of them, I think most notable leasing accomplishments, certainly during the last quarter, was the leasing of our new 43,000 square foot University Town Center Drive property. The initiation -- the leasing, and the initiation of our build-to-suit for Biogen Idec in East Cambridge, our 100% pre-leasing of a small build-to-suit for a top pharma which we were really compelled to do in Canada, and the lease up of from 43% to 91% of our flagship Campus Point asset in UTC San Diego with an existing credit tenant in another market but now one of our dominant tenants in San Diego, Celgene.</p><p>We would like to address the fundamentals in three of our key Life Science cluster markets and our expectations for 2012. Going to San Francisco, Mission Bay remains tight with Nektar and Bayer exercising their options for a total of 30,000 square feet at our 455 Mission Bay property. Bayer's expansion was especially noteworthy as it again marks an overwhelming trend for big pharma to establish tight networks and close physical proximity to leading intellectual centers. As you remember, they exited the East Bay to move their R&amp;D to Mission Bay. Mission Bay Life Science rates remain strong in the low s$40 with about $125 square foot of generic infrastructure allowance over a shell and tenants contributing significant capital to complete their mission critical fit ups.</p><p>2012 lease rollovers are minimal with about -- almost about 13,000 square feet of space and we're in discussions for 9,000 of that, regarding our flagship 499 Illinois project, we're engaged with some serious discussions and negotiations with a variety of Technology companies and Life Science institutions, both seeking large blocks of space. I'm hopeful we'll be able to beat both the time and the returns of our acquisition pro forma. South San Francisco is growing a little bit stronger incrementally. We've captured the majority of the market demand in the fourth quarter, including an Elan expansion at the Gateway Project and a new clean tech company is leasing a block of space at our East Jamie Court project.</p><p>We're also engaged in negotiations with -- final negotiations with two tenants that will stabilize the West building at East Jamie and an early negotiations with an existing tenant to take another floor in the East building, putting us on track to overall stabilize that building in the second half of 2012. South San Francisco lease rates remain in the low s$30. Our lease rollovers in this submarket are about 100,000 square feet and we're working on negotiations and discussions for about 75% of that space.</p><p>The Stanford, Palo Alto, Mountain View market remains very tight and the overwhelming technology demand has really made that market or those markets pretty hot these days. If we move to the Cambridge market. The Cambridge market has been relatively steady and stable all year, vacancy down to about 10%. Class A -- although Class A second generation space is pretty scarce, major recent deals, as you may know, were Pfizer committing to MIT. We couldn't accommodate their size. We didn't have the space available and we did sign an important requirement for Mass General, a 15-year lease, 75,000 square feet at 400 Tech Square and hopefully we're on our way to stabilizing that building before we deliver it. Some other significant leases have been signed and Tech demand in that market again strong.</p><p>Right now we're tracking over 2.4 million square feet of demand, both in the lab and in the office sector in Cambridge. Cambridge office market low s$40 to mid s$50 on a gross basis, East Cambridge Class A mid s$50 to mid s$60 and East Cambridge Class B &amp; C low s$40 to high s$40 and the suburbs kind of in the low s$20 to mid s$30 so that market stays healthy and the continuing flight to the core cluster markets with Cambridge being benefited certainly continues with the larger tenants. Then finally, in San Diego, as we indicated, Celgene more than doubled in size their San Diego footprint and we successfully leased 172,000 square feet to them at Campus Point. At the end of 2011, Alexandria was responsible for well over half of San Diego's annual Lab space leasing activity. If we look at Torrey Pines today, our almost 0.75 million square feet, we've got a vacancy rate of 10% and headed down, rental rates are in the mid to high s$30 in the University Town Center, our 1.3 million square feet, we've got a vacancy rate of about 3.4% and again, a very strong and solid market. So with that kind of color on a little bit of a preview of 2012 and a little bit of a hindsight review of 2011, let me turn it over to Dean to give you pretty detailed color on the quarter as well.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA, CFO, ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES INC: Thanks, Joel. Let me just open up with results, FFO per share diluted was reported a $1.10 for the fourth quarter and overall in line with our expectations. Earnings per share diluted was $0.44. Total revenues were up $14 million over the fourth quarter of 2010 and almost $88 million over 2010. NOI for the fourth quarter was $101.8 million. It was up about $7.3 million over the fourth quarter of 2010 and about $0.01 over the third quarter of 2011 and really was reflected of the expected decline in NOI related to the completed rollover and start of the full redevelopment of two assets, 1551 Eastlake in Seattle and 400 Technology Square in Cambridge.</p><p>Looking forward into the first quarter of 2012, NOI is expected to be flat when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 for the following reasons. Overall, we're expecting 100 to 150 basis point decline in overall occupancy by March 31, primarily driven by occupancy dips in South San Francisco, Boston, and suburban Washington DC. Occupancy in South San Francisco and Boston are expected to recover by 3Q with occupancy gains in Maryland requiring a little bit more time. Overall, we anticipate our total occupancy by December 31, 2012 to be in the range of 94% to 95%. In summary, NOI is expected to be flat from 4Q into 1Q, up slightly into the second quarter and into the third quarter and up significantly in the fourth quarter of 2012 as we've expected.</p><p>G&amp;A was about $10.6 million and above our expectations for the fourth quarter. The higher G&amp;A was really related to professional fees and consulting, some of which related to training for new systems placed into service related to the paperless invoice processing software, GL in property management and ADP payroll related software implementations. We also had a small amount of debt dealing costs in the quarter, some domestic and some international.</p><p>Moving to the balance sheet, briefly with some comments on our overall balance sheet strategy and capital strategy. Starting with bank debt. Over the next few years, we remain focused on the transition from variable rate, medium-term bank debt to longer-term, fixed rate, unsecured bonds; however, long-term, some bank debt will be a component of our capital structure, primarily consisting of our unsecured line of credit for liquidity and flexibility and bank term loans when appropriate. Variable rate debt from our unsecured line of credit will be used to fund construction activity short-term and ultimately financed with longer-term capital. Construction loans may be utilized from time to time, and in the interim, like we did in December, interest rate hedge agreements will be used to mitigate interest rate risk. Near and medium-term, we will transition variable rate bank debt to fixed rate debt. A small amount of secured debt will always be part of our long-term capital structure, pricing today remains very attractive and will remain part of our sources of capital when appropriate. With our investment grade ratings, we can tap an important new source of longer-term fixed rate capital and accordingly, we expect to be a periodic issuer of unsecured notes.</p><p>Perpetual preferred stock will remain a key component of our long-term capital structure; however, we also believe that our 8.375% Series C preferred stock can ultimately be refinanced with lower cost, long-term capital. JV capital has not been a significant component of our capital structure but remains a real opportunity for the right transaction; however, we do not expect this to become a significant component of our capital structure. Asset dispositions will continue to provide capital for reinvestment. Common equity, whether traditional follow on or through an ATM-type program, will be considered as necessary to balance our use of incremental capital over time. We remain committed to lower leverage.</p><p>Our debt-to-EBITDA is projected to be slightly plus or minus 7 times for the fourth quarter of 2012. This leverage metric will benefit from the significant amount of NOI and EBITDA contribution beginning in the third quarter of 2012, and ramping up significantly in the fourth quarter from the delivery of our significantly leased redevelopment and development projects. We expect over time to improve debt-to-EBITDA to a target of 6.5 times. Our goal is to maintain greater than 50% availability under our $1.5 billion unsecured line of credit. Over the long-term, we expect our outstanding balance under our line of credit to move closer toward 25% or less, similar to most investment grade REITs. Our goal is also to maintain a laddered maturity profile. Our current debt maturities over the next four years is very manageable.</p><p>Additionally, our goal is to lower non-income producing assets to 15% or less of our gross investment in Real Estate. Our current active development and redevelopment projects aggregate about 7% of our gross investment in Real Estate and the completion and delivery of these projects, again a significant amount of which is scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter, will transition these into income producing assets.</p><p>Briefly let me comment on the bond market. As we all know 2012 to date has shown several positive trends in the investment grade unsecured bond market. The Fed recently announced their commitment to low interest rates into 2014. The European headlines have not spooked the market as frequently as the second half of 2011 and Treasurys have rallied and dropped meaningfully. REIT bond spreads have also tightened meaningfully. As a result, a few REITs had very successful bond deals this year. We remain optimistic with recent market trends and would like our bond offering to occur sooner than later. We are also cautious that the market is still subject to volatility from the European crisis and other major headline news. Our guidance for FFO per share and EPS does not include a bond offering since its difficult to predict the timing and pricing for a debut issuer. All indications support a meaningful tightening of pricing for ARE, but ultimately, pricing will be determined based on market conditions when the event occurs.</p><p>In December, we executed interest rate swaps lowering our unhedged variable rate debt from 51% as of 9-30 to 21%. Our goal is to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk in the interim, while also leaving an appropriate amount of unhedged variable rate debt in our projections, in order to allow for the transition of bank debt to longer-term fixed rate debt. The $1 billion of additional swaps in effect for 2012 fixed 1-month LIBOR at approximately 48 to 49 basis points. When combined with the existing $450 million of swaps in effect, the aggregate $1.45 billion of notional amount of swaps in effect for 2012, fixed 1-month LIBOR at 1.5% through September 30, at which point certain swap contracts terminate. Going forward, our unhedged variable rate debt may hover around 20% and occasionally approach in the high 20% range. This will provide us flexibility to transition from variable rate bank debt to longer-term fixed rate debt. Subsequent to December, in January we retired about $84 million of our 3.7% convertible notes, leaving us with approximately $1 million outstanding today.</p><p>Moving next to our value-added opportunities. I'm sure you've noted that our revised supplemental presents value-added development and redevelopment projects, and provides significant detail on key projects making up the majority of our projected construction spend for 2012. As shown in our supplemental, approximately 80% of our 2012 projected redevelopment and development construction cost is related to certain developments and certain urban redevelopment projects with an estimated stabilized yield of approximately 7.5% on a cash basis and 8.2% on a GAAP basis. The remaining 20% is related to suburban and other redevelopment projects and projects in this category will generate stabilized yields ranging up to 8% on a cash basis.</p><p>Our total estimate of construction cost to complete, related to our construction projects increased about $15 million since our Investor Day on December 7. We also updated the timing of certain payments between 2012 and thereafter resulting in a shift of approximately $25 million of anticipated cost from thereafter into 2012. Additionally, the amounts presented at Investor Day separately presented indirect project costs like capped interest from our estimates of construction cost to complete. In our supplemental package, we added these indirect costs to our estimate of total construction cost to complete. And keep in mind, this update only impacted our projected spend in aggregate in putting the numbers together, our estimates have stabilized yields for active redevelopment and development projects included in direct project costs and have not changed since our Investor Day presentation.</p><p>Lastly, let me cover our guidance for 2012. We updated FFO per share diluted to $4.50 and $4.54, no change since our previous guidance, earnings per share diluted was updated to $1.73 to $1.77. Our guidance included the following assumptions, all of which are highlighted on page 16. Same property NOI performance, cash is expected to be up 3% to 5% and GAAP up 0% to 2%. Rental rate steps on lease renewals and releasing of space, cash slightly negative to slightly positive, GAAP up to 5%. Straight line rents are averaging $6.5 million per quarter with amounts each quarter declining from the $9.6 million run rate in the fourth quarter of 2011. The largest single property decline in straight line rent from fourth quarter to the first quarter is related to the East Tower in New York. And that property generates about a $1.2 million decline in straight line rent, obviously with a corresponding increase in cash rents, really related to the burn off of free rent there on that project. FAS141 amortization is projected to be about $800,000 per quarter. G&amp;A expenses overall for 2012 compared to 2011 will be up about 5% to 8%. Capped interest is expected to be in a range between $54 million and $60 million, and is dependent on timing of construction activities, and interest expense net of capped interest will range between $68 million and $75 million.</p><p>Again, due to the significant amount of rentable square feet under redevelopment and development that is leased, projected to be leased, placed in service and contributing to NOI and EBITDA by the fourth quarter of 2012, we have also provided a range of guidance for certain items for the fourth quarter. Our guidance is as follows. NOI in the range of $111 million to $113 million, up from the $101.8 million as of the fourth quarter, G&amp;A in the range of $10 million to $11 million, net interest costs in the range of $20.1 million to $23.1 million, aggregate FFO in the range of $71.7 million to $74.1 million, and FFO per share diluted in the range of $1.16 to $1.20. In closing, I just want to clearly remind everybody that our projected NOI is flat into the first quarter of 2012, a nominal increase into the second quarter and then into the third quarter as well, with most of the increase in NOI occurring in the fourth quarter of 2012. With that I'll turn it back over to Joel.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Thanks, Dean and operator, we will be happy to open up for Q&amp;A.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Sheila McGrath, KBW.</p><p>SHEILA MCGRATH, ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS: Joel, you did give a lot of detail in the markets, but I was wondering if you could characterize the demand picture, how you see it now versus a year ago and which markets you would categorize as strongest and which weakest?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, Sheila, I'd be happy to try to do that. So I think just kind of going around the country quickly, in Seattle and a year ago is a little hard to remember, but I think the demand there has been I think quiet, its been selective, more focused on the Institutional side and I think it has been a pretty busy time for Tech there with Amazon leading the way but I would indicate that market, they've held rental rates but I would say demand is kind of average. In the San Francisco Bay Area, again a little hard to remember exactly a year ago, but I think Mission Bay we're seeing more on the Tech demand and the Institutional demand, at this point South San Francisco we're seeing more on the Biotech demand and I think we've been pleased that although that market has been slower and more lethargic because of Roche's really reevaluation of the integration of Genentech -- so previously Genentech was really growing like crazy. Roche has really rationalized that. They moved a lot of people into their campus at South San Francisco but we haven't seen any real new requirements from them. But we are seeing activity, Biotech and Clean Tech and we've managed to capture most of those requirements. The Palo Alto area we're full and Mountain View has been strong heavily in the Tech area and also a number of Life Science.</p><p>Down in San Diego, I think we've indicated, that market has really come back pretty dramatically over the last 12 months, not only due to the market itself, but I think the integration of the Veralliance team has really benefited us greatly and they've executed in a marvelous fashion. We're seeing requirements down there Institutionally, Biotech, Clean Tech, Product and Service companies, not so much Pharma and that market remains very strong for us.</p><p>Cambridge has been, I think continually solid all year, no dramatic change. As I said we're tracking some pretty big Tech and Life Science demands today and so that market has held well. In New York we're full up there, we're literally 100% occupied and talking to a number of folks for a potential West Tower kickoff as we look into the future. I'm not sure what the timing of that might be at this point, but we're having some very serious discussions. I'd say suburban DC, that market has been challenging. I think with the cutback in the overall budget, NIH is flat for the year and that's good. There's no cut forward this year. We still see less requirements obviously out of the government side. We just see a number of tenants really looking at current and future requirements, but nothing new, dramatic entering that particular market. Then I think Research Triangle Park we're seeing a number of small tenants, nothing dramatic there so I'd say that market remains quiet but promising on the Institutional side, so if that's helpful. That's kind of a quick run around.</p><p>SHEILA MCGRATH: One other question for Dean, I guess. Same-store expenses in the quarter were pretty high and I was just wondering if you could give us more detail on what was driving that in your outlook for 2012.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Well, OpEx I think has been up primarily from utilities and some winter-related matters, whether it was the storm on the East Coast or snow removal matters. Most of those costs, because of our triple net nature of our portfolio, are passed through to our tenants so it's recovered, so although OpEx may highlight in the same-store pool a fairly meaningful increase year-over-year, those costs are going by the tenants substantially, and that would be true for 2012. Hard to predict how summer or winter weather patterns impact utility costs but again, the same thing would occur, any increase or decrease in those operating expenses are absorbed by our tenants.</p><p>OPERATOR: Jay Habermann, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>JAY HABERMANN, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Dean, maybe just starting with the occupancy and the outline that you gave, you mentioned the decline going into the start of the year. Can you talk about the pick up, I guess, should we assume that it recovers evenly throughout the year or do you think this will be much more back end weighted as you pick up occupancy?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: I think you'll see some occupancy improvement in those three submarkets going into the second quarter and that's really between South San Francisco and Boston. Both of those markets I think being substantially recovered as we get into the third quarter. Maryland, just given the dynamic in the Maryland market being a much quieter market than Cambridge as an example, I think that might take a little bit more time, but again, by the end of the year, overall, we expect to be relatively in the range of where we are again in the 94% to 95% range.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: And part of that's driven, Jay, by we've got two significant rolls in the Maryland market coming up in the second quarter, one tenant that's exiting and another tenant that we're still unsure of and then we've got one roll in South San Francisco we're working on. So there are a number of rolls that have figured into how Dean has given that guidance and kind of the flow from early in the year to late in the year. But we're pretty confident outside of the Maryland market that we'll be able to either re-lease or backfill space pretty successfully. We certainly have done it over the past few years.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Yes, and I think in our last call comments last quarter also highlighted that in Boston, we have temporary down time on some space that rolled and was re-leased so it is subject to a lease today and that will be delivered in September, I believe and it's about 25,000 square feet.</p><p>JAY HABERMANN: Okay, and maybe just following on that, in terms of your outlook for CapEx, can you talk about tenant improvement and leasing costs for the year? Clearly the rate for 2011 increased versus 2010, but help put into perspective I guess the fourth quarter run rate.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Yes, I think if you look, I think you're referring to, generally speaking, page 23 of our supplemental which highlights our leasing activity for the year and on the renewals, we were averaging just under $6 a foot both on TIs and leasing commissions and then closer to $13 on previously vacant space, whether that was inclusive of redevelopment or development. I would generally expect the dollars to remain in the range and I think in our 10-K we give a pretty good summary of CapEx and TIs leasing costs related to renewals and releasing the space and they, generally over a 5-year average, stay within a fairly narrow, fairly small bandwidth. I don't expect 2012 to be meaningfully different from our historical averages.</p><p>JAY HABERMANN: Okay, and maybe just to dig a bit deeper on 499 Illinois, you mentioned the activity and I guess the Tech tenants there. Do you expect this to be something you could announce in the first half of the year, I guess, and are tenants looking at the full space or is this just a portion of the space?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: The answer to the first question is that would be our hope. We don't know for sure, and this -- our initial tenant would be a three-floor tenant and then potentially a follow-on would take up the rest of the building so we're potentially looking at two tenants.</p><p>OPERATOR: James Feldman, Banc of America.</p><p>JAMES FELDMAN, ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH: I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what you've seen recently in terms of Tech demand versus Life Sciences demand and how you guys are thinking about in your main markets maybe tipping the portfolio exposure more towards Tech, given the demand prospects for that sector and how you guys are just kind of thinking about it internally.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, that's actually a pretty great question. I think that we are a Life Science niche-focused REIT obviously, so we're not trying to change what we are and who we are, but I think as you have significant projects in a number of markets. For example, the Binney Street development, we're looking at, I'm just looking right now, they're outside of Lab. There's over 1 million square feet of today demand for Tech, so for us to look at in running our return hurdles how we might lease to a Tech user, if there's 1.1 million square feet of demand that's real and we're looking at that, how that might work from a rental rate that would obviously be somewhat lower than the Lab rate but at a tenant improvement allowance -- infrastructure allowance that would be considerably less versus a lab tenant. I think we have to just look at it on a case-by-case basis. We have no real desire to change the tenant base in the portfolio.</p><p>I think as we look at 499 Illinois, we're mindful that with Salesforce taking down 2.1 million square feet there, that has created a new hot bed of Tech tenant interest. South of Market is pretty much on fire as you know certainly from other calls I'm sure, so we just have to pay attention. Our goal is obviously to have the highest quality tenants with the strongest cash flow in place and if at any given point in time we've got a tenant that it makes sense, then we're likely to consider that as opposed to just hold out for the right Lab tenants but I don't think you see any big fundamental strategic shift. It really is a building by building basis. We're in a Tech bubble of sorts. I'm sure when the Facebook IPO comes to market it will even be more poignant, but these are, as you remember many years ago from the Internet boom, we saw I remember when [Speaker] reported I think something like rates going from $1 or $2 to maybe as high as $10 or $12 a foot and then a year or two later they collapse. So we're mindful that's a pretty up and down market but we'll take advantage of it selectively in the best way we know how.</p><p>JAMES FELDMAN: To your last point -- my understanding is the biggest difference now is you've got companies that are cash flowing. Do you really believe that we are getting close to a bubble in terms of the fundamentals and the economics of leases?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Well, I think from a valuation standpoint, I kind of believe that. We were talking this morning, when you look at Facebook that may be a 100 times earnings that probably when you compare that to Google or other companies that are out there, Apple and so forth that have had stellar operating histories, it seems to strike you as being a little bit unusual, but that's kind of the fervor of the unknown. But I think again our view is that Tech, the intersection of Tech and Pharma and bio is important because these are all core knowledge markets and I think we'll remain in these markets and we'll take advantage of that sector as best we can, but we're not focused on diversifying into the Tech sector as a major strategic change.</p><p>JAMES FELDMAN: And when you think about your most active Tech markets, is there a material delta between the yields you can have based on where Tech rents are and the kind of buildout you'd need to do versus bioTech or Life Sciences?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, I think it's pretty fair to say that in Mission Bay and in Cambridge those numbers pencil pretty favorably. We haven't really been faced with it up in Seattle nor in San Diego, nor in Maryland or New York or Research Triangle Park but I'd say in the Bay Area and in Cambridge, those are compelling opportunities. I remember when we did Google's first campus we had a redevelopment sale-leaseback that we did with Scios Nova that ultimately got bought but we bought their campus. Google came in and paid us -- this is back in 1997, 1998 -- kind of an obscene amount because they wanted that campus in Mountain View, that was their first foothold. They ended up gutting all the infrastructure and it turned out to be a great deal for them and for us. So again we just have to be opportunistic and play our cards the best we can but we're not focused on creating a Tech sector portfolio.</p><p>JAMES FELDMAN: Okay, thanks and just for Dean, I'm curious, I notice there's an increase in the straight line rent assumption in the 2012 guidance but the FFO outlook is flat from the prior guidance. I'm just curious what that was and I apologize if you already said it.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Jamie, I think you're picking up on a change from $6 million to $6.5 million. It was really rounding more than anything. Nothing really drove the difference significantly.</p><p>OPERATOR: Philip Martin, Morningstar.</p><p>PHILIP MARTIN, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: I wanted to just talk a little bit about leasing terms. Has there been any meaningful changes in leasing terms given what appears to be still a rather challenging environment out there? Are you seeing meaningful changes?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Well I think what is striking is in a number of build-to-suits or redevelopments that we're working on, I think you're seeing substantially long lease terms. We're able to achieve 10, 15 and even 20 years. These are from bigger well-capitalized entities whether they be big Biotech, obviously Pharma, or Institutional. I think some of the meat and potatoes leases that run from small to medium still are three, five, seven years, so that hasn't substantially changed based on the size of the space and based on the size of the entity.</p><p>PHILIP MARTIN: And you're not giving more. Your negotiating leverage is still more or less the same as it was before challenging times?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Well I would say if we're talking about 2006, 2007, I would say, no I think today is tougher and I think occasionally there are landlords in the market that are willing to do things that we normally wouldn't consider rational. So we have to be mindful of that, but I would say although we had a spectacular quarter and really year from a leasing standpoint, it's never easy and it's always challenging and I think boards of entities whether they are big Pharma, big Biotech, Institutional boards, smaller company boards, are all mindful we're still in a tough macro environment and people aren't making dumb decisions. So I think we just have to be very careful, very competitive, and focused. But we have, on occasion, decided if a tenant wanted a certain opportunity or wanted a certain situation and we just felt it wasn't worth it or our underwriting of the tenant -- this happened recently -- didn't justify economics that a tenant wanted, we just passed on the deal.</p><p>PHILIP MARTIN: Okay.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: But I'd say it's tougher today than it was in 2007 for sure.</p><p>PHILIP MARTIN: Yes, I mean, it dovetails a bit to the CapEx question where your CapEx went up a bit. I know there were a tenant or two there from the dotcom era, et cetera. Just looking at trends generally and --</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, it's hard to know, because again, a lot of bigger tenants tend to want to put their own capital in, but it varies, actually it truly varies lease by lease.</p><p>PHILIP MARTIN: Lastly, how has the confidence among your tenants changed, if at all, even in the last six months. Are you having any incremental discussions with tenants on more redevelopment or expansion opportunities? Obviously, from what you said in your opening remarks, it sounds like you have almost -- it's a high grade problem more internal growth opportunities than you can almost handle.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Right, I think the difference is and, Philip, you know the sector well -- let me just break it down by groups. In the Pharma area, you have specific requirements. A specific requirement like Pfizer had coming out of Groton or Pearl River and they're looking for 250,000 square feet for that specific requirement. So we see specific requirements in Pharma, generally moving a group or starting up a group into a cluster location, so that's a dynamic. In the Biotech sector, when you have a clinical milestone or a regulatory approval made, obviously the need to then take down, whether it be additional space or shift what they may be doing, becomes very milestone driven. So we've seen that. Then in the smaller companies, it really is just milestone driven, as they begin to grow up and their funding is tied to milestones, whether it be on the private side or the public side, we see those just develop again based on a milestone-related situation. So I don't think that's fundamentally changed.</p><p>In the Institutional side, it usually is again a specific requirement funded by, whether it be bond funds or a particular gift. A deal we signed in New York happened to be endowed and so when the endowment was made for the long-term, that requirement then got generated and we were able to secure it. So I think those things fundamentally haven't changed so much, maybe the Pharma situation has changed more over the past couple of years than anything else.</p><p>PHILIP MARTIN: How about from universities? Certainly, this economy has caused a lot of groups to rethink strategies. Is Alexandria having -- are you being approached by universities to help them manage a growth platform in Biotech or Life Sciences or something similar?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes. Unequivocally yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ross Nussbaum, UBS.</p><p>ROSS NUSSBAUM, ANALYST, UBS: I've got a couple questions here. First, in the supplemental, we appreciate all the new disclosure. On page 33 on the development - redevelopment schedule, you've got sort of all of the way to the bottom about $215 million worth of suburban and other redevelopment projects, but there's notably no stabilized yield listed there. Can you give us a sense of what's the return on that capital?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: I think Dean suggested that's about 20% of the total I believe of the redevelopment and returns range generally, I would say, mid single-digit to high single-digit, that's kind of where those are, there are a number of smaller projects but that's kind of typical.</p><p>ROSS NUSSBAUM: Was there a specific reason that was left off?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: It's just a lot of detail for a lot -- we're trying to kind of highlight the principal matters and then I think over time, our view is we probably will be doing a lot less suburban work.</p><p>ROSS NUSSBAUM: Okay. The other question I have is on the page before and I know it's minor, but with respect to India and China, the square footage from September down to December went down by 100,000 square feet. So that's question one, is why the square feet change? Then number two, just can you give us a sense of what the $41.3 million that it looks like you expect to invest in 2012 is going toward?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: So the first question relates to just the transition of some of the basis into land, so we completed what we needed to complete on that particular project. Broadly, the other question you asked about the $41 million to spend, that's really on construction related to Laboratory facilities in India. A little bit of the final interior improvements for China as well, but the majority of those dollars are focused in India.</p><p>ROSS NUSSBAUM: And if I think about the $148 million plus because there's still a TBD there that you're investing in those two countries, what should we be thinking about for the returns on those because I don't see those listed on page 30.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, I think I've said, and I think over time as we get to some more critical mass, we'll try to be pretty detailed about this but I think our goal is in India. China remains to be seen. We don't have a lot going on there at the moment in the sense of we clearly aren't doing any expansion, we are test running a project, but I think in India our goal is to try to achieve 500 basis point return over what we would achieve in the US on a net after-tax basis and that's what I think I've pretty much said and it turns out to be true.</p><p>ROSS NUSSBAUM: So that's the anticipation on those current projects as well?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: More or less, yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: Quentin Velleley, Citi.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: It's Michael Bilerman with Quentin. Yes, I agree with Ross also. On page 33, I think to present a whole picture of your $1.1 billion of completed investment, having the complete total return at the end would be helpful. I think, Joel, you said mid single-digits to high single-digits. Do you just have the weighted average stabilized cash and GAAP yield, so that we know on 20% of the pipeline most of the stuff is coming in late this year and early next year, what yield we should be using for that capital?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, we can probably get that. I don't have that at hand but we can probably get that to you.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: And then thinking about sources and uses of capital into -- for this year and this is in reference to the guidance that you've provided, it's on page --</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: 16?</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: 16, correct. Your uses are pretty identified and rigid and I recognize you have full availability of this remaining on the line and credit to fund that. But as you think about this line item of $700 million for debt equity and joint venture capital, obviously each of those has a different cost, each of those have different ramifications and terms of when it's raised, how it's raised. So maybe just talk about how are you thinking about raising that $700 million, both in terms of time, but obviously debt is very different than common equity, very different than preferred equity and joint venture capital is obviously effectively sale with interest and assets which would be very different. So what are you progressing down the road with to raise that money?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Well, a little bit will come off of our line but I think our hopes, Michael, as we mentioned in our prepared comments is that the bond market has shown some significant improvement in 2012 and we're optimistic that we'll have the opportunity to have our bond issuance sooner than later and that would allow us to fill a large chunk of that $700 million of incremental capital.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: So you would view the unsecured bond issuance of say $500 million as a debut as part of that $700 million if you were to execute it?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Yes, I'm sorry if that was confusing, that would not be incremental to generate our total sources to if you add -- if you assumed it was $500 million, it wouldn't be additive to the $899 million resulting in roughly $1.4 billion of sources, it would fill that $700 million requirement.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: But if I just take it one step further, one of the things you talked about at Investor Day was buying back the preferreds, $140 million of preferreds, which obviously have a very high coupon on them as a way to offset the dilution from doing the bond deal. So that would obviously true-up some capital but if you were to swap out $500 million out of that $700 million, you're also not making a lot of goals towards your sort of reducing your floating rate. I know you have hedges in place but eventually those will roll off. Part of the bond issuance was to elongate the maturity schedule and fix it but you are spending $900 million of capital, so wouldn't you need to raise some form of equity for that?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Actually, to maybe clarify a little bit, what will likely happen from a bond perspective because we do have a specific use to retire our 2012 term loan. If a bond event was to occur before the maturity date of the bank term loan for $250 million, we would likely concurrently retire that $250 million term loan and part of that has to do with the legal structuring of that transaction where we need to -- I think it's the only bank agreement that has provisions that were not modified to release our borrowers, and so it was always contemplated that one of the key chunks of bank debt that would be retired was the 2012 term loan. So part of the answer to your question, Michael is yes, some of the proceeds will be used to retire bank debt at a minimum, the $250 million term loan.</p><p>The remainder will obviously depend on the size of the transaction and how much incremental capital we have. But ultimately we are going to work on retiring bank debt and replacing it with longer-term fixed rate debt over several years. I think it's difficult for us to -- it was much more difficult for us to sit here and think about this 60 days ago, probably relatively difficult for us to contemplate much on this 30 days ago. The recent trends in the last four weeks in the bond market -- four, six weeks in the bond market have been pretty spectacular to say the least, so we're a little more optimistic. We are set on that transition, Michael. This is just the first start of it.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: Okay.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: I'd say the other thing that factors in and we've said this without being particularly specific, and I mentioned in my comments, we are sitting on -- and you've been one of the proponents of this -- a fair amount of non-income producing assets and we clearly are focused pretty laser-like on the movement of some of that to aid in our funding of both the retirement of variable rate debt, as well as the reinvestment in development and redevelopment, so that is likely to be an important part of this line item as well.</p><p>MICHAEL BILERMAN: Great. That's helpful. Just sticking on this page in terms of the guidance, when you look at the fourth quarter, you'd also provided guidance at Investor Day for the line items listed here and it would appear that NOI came out about $1.7 million higher, but G&amp;A was commensurately $1.7 million higher than the mid points of the ranges of guidance that you gave then. Can you just talk about what sort of drove the higher NOI? Was the timing of commencement higher, was it something that happened in the core? And also what happened with G&amp;A at the end of the year?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Yes, I think it was really -- the contribution came in stronger as a result of I think OpEx being inside of where we thought it was going to be because I don't think there was much changing top line. We do have some OpEx numbers, as you know, from our recovery ratios that don't necessarily move hand in hand with recoveries and there's about 15% of that. So I think we had a favorable non-recoverable component of our OpEx that dropped down. I would say a little bit of the contribution at the rental income level, but nothing significant stood out in my review, so I think you had a little bit of contribution from all areas and it definitely wasn't other income because other income was down.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: And then on the G&amp;A, it's primarily the systems [work], right?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: Yes, in most of the G&amp;A stuff, a good chunk of that I think is non-recurring, so we had, unfortunately, not anticipated some of the costs coming in.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, a pretty big systems conversion, as Dean mentioned, on a number of particular areas of the operation of the business.</p><p>QUENTIN VELLELEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: It's Quentin here. Just going back to the sources of capital, in guidance is $112 million of asset sales but you make the comment that you got to be more aggressive on asset disposition and, Joel, you kind of alluded to this. But I'm curious sort of how many assets you're looking at, what volume of assets you're looking at marketing and what the split between land and actual income producing assets might be?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, I think we have to tread carefully there because we have to -- we don't have specific transactions at this point in time obviously teed up. But as I said, you look at the supplement, we've got 24% non-income producing assets to GAV and so we've got a pool of assets on the non-income producing side that we're pretty laser-focused on that we hope over -- as the quarters unfold through the year, we can do some things with that would help us supplement the sources of capital. So that's probably going to be one of the dominant factors and features and we'll keep you posted, obviously, over the coming months and quarters, but that's pretty important. On the $112 million, Dean can give you the ratio of asset to just kind of our rough estimate of land, income producing. I don't recall exactly what that number is but it's probably maybe 50/50 or 60/40.</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: It's in that general range, and I think we've got three assets I believe under contract in that number. They are relatively small but I think they aggregate somewhere just under $20 million in proceeds.</p><p>OPERATOR: John Stewart, Green Street Advisors.</p><p>JOHN STEWART, ANALYST, GREEN STREET ADVISORS: Dean, I'm hoping you could help us understand. I mean, I fully take your points about the evolution in the state of the corporate bond market over the past 60 days, but given the improvement, just to put it bluntly, why aren't you just jumping through the window?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Well, maybe let me preempt Dean. The answer is, we have to report earnings and get things done. But I think the fair statement is if you listen to Dean's words carefully, he said sooner rather than later, so we're very mindful of that, John, and I would say stay tuned.</p><p>JOHN STEWART: Okay, that's helpful, thank you. And, Dean, if I could come back to you, you've alluded to the ramp up in NOI as projects come on line throughout the year and also kind of give us a sense that 1Q through 3Q should be relatively flat. So if you assume $100 million NOI run rate, what's the step function in the fourth quarter?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: As a percent of the incremental NOI, it's probably somewhere close to 60% of it coming in in the fourth quarter versus 40% being spread over 2Q and 3Q.</p><p>JOHN STEWART: 60% of, can you remind us what the number was?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: It may even be a little bit higher than 60%, but it's in that 60% to 65% range.</p><p>JOHN STEWART: And what was the base? What's the improvement?</p><p>DEAN SHIGENAGA: I'm not following you, John, I'm sorry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER, ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE: If you look at page 16, John, NOI goes from the actual, which is $102 million and then our projection for the fourth quarter of 2012 is $111 million, $113 million so it's about call it $10 million of improvement.</p><p>JOHN STEWART: Got it, thank you. Lastly, Joel, could I ask you to just touch on the -- of course, I guess Illumina's out today rejecting Roche's bid, but given the Genentech example that you cited in South San Francisco, can you touch on the potential for redundancy in San Diego and then, just perhaps more broadly, consolidation in the big Pharma sector?</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Yes, that's a good and timely question. I think if you look at what Roche has said and what commentators have said, there's been a lot written recently, both Street commentators and then people from the industry, believe that the Roche -- if anybody would buy Illumina, the Roche -- and whether they stay independent or not, I don't know and that's obviously for their Board and shareholders to determine -- but that the Roche integration might be the most seamless and the best with Roche's Applied Science group. We had seen public pronouncements by Roche that they were going to move their headquarters of Roche's Applied Science group, I forgot, it may be in Europe to San Diego, build around Illumina as the flagship piece of its whole focus in the diagnostics and in tools area. Obviously, this is a huge growth area given the personalized medicine and it gives them -- how they view moving whole genome sequencing as a routine clinical practice. This would give them a huge advantage. Roche is a huge leader in that area. So we -- if we believe what comes from Roche directly, this would not be a consolidation and some kind of a movement out of San Diego, would rather be a movement into San Diego and build around Illumina as the flagship piece of their whole DX effort.</p><p>With respect to Pharma M&amp;A, all we can say is, it has gone on. Wyeth and Pfizer being one notable part. Pharma has really kind of moved on from that world and there still may be more, but they are in their rationalization of their own R&amp;D and the -- really measuring the productivity and moving much more of their R&amp;D to the touch points of innovation, that's where they are today. They have got a lot of capital, cash on the balance sheet. Yes, there are patent expirations, yes, there are a whole range of different issues that all of the Pharmas face but fundamentally, many of them and most of them have successfully transitioned to kind of the new model. Again, we've seen that in spades in the requirements that have come to New York, come to Cambridge, come to Mission Bay, so we're pretty comfortable with the state of Pharma affairs today.</p><p>OPERATOR: Jason Ren, Morningstar.</p><p>JASON REN, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: In the third quarter call, Dean, you made the comment that Alexandria was committed not to raise equity at the price of the stock at that time, which I believe was around $66 or so. Since then, you guys have raised -- punted out the maturities, scheduled, raised a lot of debt and the stock has also moved up. I just wanted to see whether your sentiment on issuing equity at current levels would be similar to your sentiment that was expressed in the third quarter call.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: I would say, I don't want to get in the role of trying to handicap what we may or may not do on conference calls, but I would say we've really set out our strategy on the capital plan and as we see it today, certainly now and where we are in time and space, equity, common equity capital is really not our priority at this point. Getting to the bond market clearly is, potentially at some point when the markets appropriate refinancing the perpetual preferred, obviously, to the extent that we look at any other situation trying to match source with use. I think that's how we're thinking about it, but that at the moment is not a priority of ours. Obviously, probably the other top priority in addition to getting the bond market is really moving that non-income producing asset base down a few notches and thereby freeing up capital, both to pay down variable rate debt, and to reinvest in what we're doing. So I'd say those are the two dominant priorities at the moment, Jason.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, there are no more questions in queue. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS: Just want to thank everybody for their time today during earnings season and look forward to talking to you likely early May on first quarter. Thanks again.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Okay. I think we're ready to go, so let's get started. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to KPN's Q4 and full-year 2016 results presentation.</p><p>Before turning to the core presentation, I would like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor Statement on page 2 of the slides that also applies to any statements made in this presentation. In particular, today's presentation may include forward-looking statements, including the Company's expectations with respect to its outlook, which are also included in the press release published this morning. All such statements are subject to the Safe Harbor statement.</p><p>I would now like to hand over to Eelco Blok, CEO of KPN.</p><p>EELCO BLOK, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND CEO, KONINKLIJKE KPN NV: Thank you, Wouter. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us this afternoon. With me today are my colleagues, the full Board of Management; Jan Kees de Jager, our CFO; Frank van der Post, Chief Commercial Officer; and our Chief Operations Officer, Joost Farwerck.</p><p>We look back at what we think has been a productive year for us at KPN. Before we go through the details, let me start with what we see at the three main takeaways. First of all, we finalized the first wave of our simplification program ahead of target. Second, we delivered on the outlook we had set for 2016. And third, we have returned a large amount of cash to shareholders.</p><p>If we look at the other highlights, I would like to draw your attention to our continued investments in our networks. And we have brought fiber closer to customer premises and we deploy innovative technologies in our network. And Jan Kees will tell you more about that later.</p><p>Our efforts with respect to sustainability have been recognized in 2016. We were rewarded with the inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the fifth consecutive year. We received a CDP Climate Leadership award. And one of our datacenters has been awarded the most sustainable in EMEA, thanks to an innovative approach to use its heat as a renewable emergency power supply.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, we continued to see a solid operational performance. Our strong market position in consumer delivered continued success in growing fixed-mobile bundles and further growth of our high-value subscriber base. Of course, we acknowledge the challenging environment in the business segment. As we have said previously, we aim to stabilize revenues of the business segment in the medium term.</p><p>We are encouraged by the continued strong performance of our multi-play product, the improved order intake at large enterprises and corporates, and the strong increase in Net Promoter Score in business.</p><p>We set out our updated strategic vision in March 2016 with the three pillars of simplify, grow and innovate. We've made good progress in all fronts since then and most of our KPIs and financial scorecards show sustained positive improvement over the year. We have a strong portfolio of innovative services, and earlier this year we started with the second leg of our simplification program. This will lead to an even higher quality of service for your customers and improve time to market.</p><p>Combined with an even leaner cost structure, we see value creation for all our stakeholders. While we have already come a long way in executing this strategy, we see sufficient potential for the years to come.</p><p>We are on track with the key priorities we set out at our Capital Markets Day last year. I won't go into detail here as we use our key priorities to guide you through today's presentation.</p><p>Let's now look closer at our first priority, accelerate up and cross-sell in bundles. Our convergence strategy in consumer is clearly paying off. We see continued growth in fixed-mobile bundles, and we had 74,000 fixed-mobile net ads over the quarter, reaching a penetration of 37% of households.</p><p>Looking at our postpaid customer base, we've added 122,000 mobile customers to the fixed-mobile base, reaching 43% of postpaid customers for all our brands. At 56%, our KPN brand is already well ahead.</p><p>We see continued growth of our convergent offering as we recently started to cross-sell our high-value fixed brand, XS4ALL, with KPN mobile, all of which helps to create an even more loyal customer base. Also, at Telfort, our focus is now fully on convergence.</p><p>As we give a EUR5 discount on our complete offering, growing convergence first comes at a cost. However, longer term, there are clear benefits outweighing this initial expense. We see much higher customer satisfaction, lower churn and, as such, we are able to reduce marketing expenses considerably. With this, fixed-mobile convergence remains an important pillar in our strategy, not only from a customer proposition perspective, but also from an operational and network perspective, as we will discuss later.</p><p>Let's now move to mobile. Our efforts in the mobile market are focused on delivering high-quality services to our customers. Our disciplined approach towards convergence and emphasis on value per customer resulted in a growing, committed ARPU level.</p><p>Postpaid net ads were again entirely driven by the KPN brand, reflecting the competitive environment in the lower end of the market. We see customers moving towards higher data allowances and more expensive handsets, and, as such, see a higher bundle value for our customers.</p><p>Despite a higher SAC/SRC per sub , this still translates into a higher customer lifetime value. As we explained at our Capital Markets Day, this is a key performance metric for us. It allows us to track our current financial performance and also the performance we expect to deliver over the near future.</p><p>Another key strategic priority for us is around growth in TV. Our innovative TV platform delivers the best customer experience, as reported by the largest Dutch consumer organization, thanks to a superior stability and quality of the equipment. Due to the high-quality digital infrastructure in the Netherlands, high broadband speeds are the rule rather than the exception. Therefore, speed is not a key differentiator in the fixed landscape, but TV is. This is not so much about linear TV, but more about personalized non-linear offerings.</p><p>Three items are of paramount performance, in our view, the stability and image quality of non-linear TV services watched everywhere, seamless integration on all devices, and have personalized content easily and widely accessible for everyone.</p><p>One of the key aspects in delivering these items is our high-quality content delivery network. We store widely used content at more than 100 Metro Core locations throughout the country, thereby offloading our core and transport network.</p><p>We have a selected range of exclusive content, but mainly focus on content aggregation through smart partnerships. This ensures that our customers have access to a rich content package, including music, sport, movies and entertainment. We are confident that our high-quality interactive TV platform and recognition by our customers will further drive personalized and on-demand TV consumption.</p><p>Moving to the transformation in our business segment, through our history of connectivity we've built strong relationships with the majority of Dutch businesses. For many of them, we are the vital partner in their digital transformation. We're in the midst of migrating customers to integrated solutions and new technologies across all our business segments. The migration brings us strengthened and deepened customer relationships and presents us with up- and cross-sell opportunities in the longer term. However, it's clear that today this has a significant impact on our revenue trend.</p><p>In Q4, we've seen that all of the major revenue buckets performed in line with previous quarters except for customized solutions. Traditionally, there was a positive impact on revenues from customized work in Q4, but a shift to more standardized solutions have shaved off this seasonal peak. Full-year 2016 business revenues were down 7.6%, a small improvement in the trend compared to full-year 2015, when revenue were down 8.6%.</p><p>In SME, we have seen the migrations to our integrated service, KPN One, accelerating to 27,000 additional multi-play seats, more than twice the number of additions in the third quarter.</p><p>We've seen that the mobile base has remained relatively stable throughout the year, but we have -- what we see happening requires a bit of explanation. Because we look at the revenue breakdown in KPN from a product view, we see customers migrating from SME mobile-only services to SME multi-play, as well as to large enterprises and corporate integrated services.</p><p>We see continued price pressure in the mobile market. And also, in business mobile, we have a clear focus on value, driven by our high-quality network and service. This means that we will not necessarily chase every tender in the market available.</p><p>Also, in our large enterprises and corporate segment, we see the impact of migrations. Revenues from network and IT services declined by 11% year on year as customers are rationalizing and migrating away from legacy network services to new technologies.</p><p>Examples of this are migrations from a legacy VPN network to a fully cloud-controlled, software-defined network. The flexible and scalable solution we offer can be adjusted to customer requirements. Following migration, our customer will only pay for the actual network capacity used instead of a flat fee. Now, for KPN this presents an opportunity to increase the share of wallet for such a customer.</p><p>Also, in this segment we see a shift to more standardized solutions. We see sharp growth in KPN One seats in the large enterprise segment. Furthermore, we are comforted by a decent pickup in order intake, with large orders from several Dutch leading organizations.</p><p>In business, we are furthering strengthening our market position along three main routes. First, we are further strengthening our infrastructure by deploying a similar hybrid access strategy as we use in consumer. Second, we have launched our own managed hybrid cloud service, but also want to be a trusted partner with our carrier and cloud neutral colocation services. And third, we are expanding our scale and capabilities in growth areas by selective acquisitions, such as the acquisition of dearBytes, which strengthens our market-leading security proposition.</p><p>Overall, the financial performance of our business segment illustrates the impact of migrations away from traditional services, but the positive impact of up and cross-sell through integrated solutions takes time.</p><p>With clients moving to more standardized products, we have the opportunity to significantly reduce our portfolio and simplify our organization. As a consequence, we were able to reduce our indirect costs by 5.1% in 2016. And further reducing our cost base in business will be one of our main focus points in 2017, and we have already implemented the necessary actions to execute on this.</p><p>Again, we see that our simplification efforts lead to improving quality at a lower cost level. Our NPS in the business segment improved to minus 3, compared to minus 10 last year.</p><p>The strong improvement in customer satisfaction, accelerated uptake in multi-play and higher order intake in the fourth quarter illustrate that we are on the right track in business.</p><p>Let me now hand over to Jan Kees.</p><p>JAN KEES DE JAGER, CFO, KONINKLIJKE KPN NV: Thank you, Eelco, and good afternoon, everybody. Let me start by discussing the financial performance. Thereafter, I will discuss the progress we are making to simplify our operating model and expand our networks, which is one of the main drivers for our expense reduction.</p><p>Our revenue trends improved further during the quarter, with an adjusted revenue for the Netherlands down 1.9% year on year, compared to minus 2.4% for the full year 2016. As Eelco already indicated, business remains challenging. But we see a very strong development in consumer, driven by our clear focus on convergence and high-value customers. Wholesale revenues benefited mainly from take-up of VULA services in fixed and increased data usage in mobile.</p><p>We can see the real fruit of our simplification program by looking at our adjusted EBITDA development in the fourth quarter. Regardless of lower revenues, we were able to post solid growth in adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>The cost of goods and services improved nicely due to lower SAC/SRC, resulting from a relatively low end of contract base. Personnel expenses were lower year on year, mainly due to a strong reduction of external personnel. IT/TI expenses increased marginally year on year as a result of customer-driven investments, for instance, from a higher order intake in business. Other operating expenses were lower, mainly due to less marketing and communication, reduced housing expenses and lower cost related to billing and collection.</p><p>Looking back at the full year 2016, we see reductions across all cost buckets, which is more than compensating for the 2.4% decline in revenues. For example, personnel expenses were down 4.9%. IT/TI costs were 2.6% lower, and other operating expenses decreased by 13% year on year. This is something we are particularly proud of because, yes, this simplification program brings us cost savings. But also important, it brings us a higher quality of service. Our more efficient IT platforms enable us to enrich and unify the customer experience, while we can turn off legacy systems and reduce personnel.</p><p>In addition, an improved billing system and simplified invoices have led to increased customer satisfaction and lower churn. And that enables us to reduce marketing expenses.</p><p>As we start a second wave of the simplification program, we see sufficient scope for further quality improvements in our processes. These should lead to a further reduced spend level, but, above all, more happy customers.</p><p>Let's look at more detail how we are changing our operating model. The first wave of our simplification program consisted of creating a digital and uniform omni-channel front end for customers and integrating all the management systems for our customer segment, allowing us to decommission legacy systems. In fixed, we decommissioned 20 IT systems, while in mobile we are consolidating 40 different IT systems. This significant simplification of our IT brings us a substantially faster time to market while saving some serious money.</p><p>The second wave of our program consists of a similar IT integration for the business segment, the blue box with number two in the middle of the slide. But more importantly, we will start to simplify our network interaction layer. We expect, once again, further quality improvements for our customers. However, at first, we must also account for additional investments and restructuring charges. Moreover, I cannot emphasize enough that we are truly on the forefront when it comes to digitalization of our network and IT infrastructure.</p><p>As Eelco already indicated, we ended the first wave of our simplification program ahead of target. We realized EUR460 million in run rate savings at the end of the year, which is well above the original target of EUR300 million. The second wave is continuing seamlessly and will realize annual run rate savings of at least EUR300 million by the end of 2019.</p><p>Next to improving IRT we have been rationalizing our legacy networks and have removed around 45% of the install base of 2010. In the coming years, we will complete our OIP transformation by modernizing KPN's remaining legacy networks, such as vSDM, and all the transmission techniques, like SDH.</p><p>In parallel, we are consolidating the transport and IP core networks. We are already integrating the backbone network for fixed and mobile access. Only the final part of the network is either fixed or mobile. The result is an all-integrated and largely fiberized network to the home, to the curb, to the business park or to the mobile site. Furthermore, we are decentralizing content at 161 Metro Core locations.</p><p>As customers are shifting to more personalized and on-demand TV consumption, this leads to strong growth of traffic volumes in the core network. With our content delivery network storing data closer to the customer, this will result in an enhanced customer experience through higher video quality and faster responsiveness.</p><p>We go through this enormous effort to change our network in order to prepare for virtualization, a revolution for the industry. Network virtualization will bring lots of benefits for our customer and for KPN. As an operator, virtualization will enable us to run multiple services on the same generic hardware and capacity will be used and handled much more efficiently at lower cost. Furthermore, it will be easier to scale the network to cope with rapid traffic growth.</p><p>Let's look at our access network now. Currently, almost 80% of Dutch households have a fiber connect to the home or to the curb. As you can see in the graph on the right, your left, approximately half of our customers are within roughly 300 meters of a street cabinet, while roughly 80% is within 600 meters. With vectoring, we can reach 100 megabytes per second, which is ample speed to cover current demand. And if demand changes, we can easily upgrade to higher speeds with technologies such as bonding and Vplus.</p><p>Moving to CapEx. Increasing coverage is much more capital intensive than increasing capacity. As a consequence, the position created by investing in fiber gives us the flexibility to lower CapEx and increase capacity at the same time. While CapEx will come down further over the coming years, we keep making significant investments in our network.</p><p>Following deregulation of fiber to the office, we see further potential to increase coverage in Dutch business parks. We will also continue to roll out fiber to the home in new-build areas. Furthermore, starting the second phase of the simplification program, our CapEx budget for this year includes initial capital expenditures which are expected to come down thereafter.</p><p>Now let's turn to our free cash flow. Our operational free cash flow is performing strongly. It grew 10% year on year. Our free cash flow came in at EUR683 million for the full year. If we exclude the dividend received from Telefonica Deutschland and [if we correct for EUR52 million at first impact] from cash optimization options already presented at our Q3 results, this means 24% growth year on year.</p><p>Interest paid and CapEx came in lower year on year, but we have seen a higher working capital level during 2016 due to accelerated spend reductions throughout the year.</p><p>In 2017, we expect to see a similar pattern, lower cash interest and lower CapEx, partly offset by a negative impact from working capital, although expected to be smaller compared to last year, and restructuring cash out related to the second wave of simplification. These investments will lead to a structurally lower cost level and further free cash flow growth.</p><p>Finally, I will discuss our financial position. We reported a solid financial position as of December 31. Net debt to EBITDA decreased slightly to 2.8 times compared to Q3. In January, we redeemed a EUR720 million bond as it expired. We financed the redemption from available cash. And with a coupon of 4.75%, this should lead to another EUR34 million lower cash interest in 2018.</p><p>Overall, we've seen solid financial progress in 2016, with cost reductions outweighing the real revenue decline. Our rigorous cost discipline and execution of the simplification program is delivering quality improvements at a significantly lower cost base.</p><p>Now let me hand back to Eelco for the outlook and concluding remarks.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Thank you, Jan Kees. We are pleased to see that our strategy is delivering. As we start the second wave of the simplification program we are fully focused on continued successful delivery in 2017.</p><p>Our outlook for 2017 is for adjusted EBITDA to be in line with 2016. This includes the negative impact of roaming regulation, which is expected to be around EUR40 million to EUR50 million. CapEx will be roughly EUR50 million lower, at around EUR1.15 billion.</p><p>Given that outlook, we intend to pay a regular dividend for the full year 2017 of EUR0.11 per share, a 10% increase year on year. On top of that, it's our current expectation that we will pass through the dividend we received from Telefonica Deutschland to our own shareholders, as we did last year.</p><p>At the start, I said that 2016 had been a productive year for us. Through disciplined execution of our strategy we have delivered on our promises, ended the first wave of our simplification program ahead of schedule and returned cash to our shareholders. We aim for more of the same in 2017. The successful delivery of our strategic priorities will drive further growth in our cash flow and shareholder remuneration in the coming years.</p><p>Thank you and now we will take your questions.</p><p>WOUTER STAMMEIJER: Okay. I think that Reinout will walk around with the mic, so starting there.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon. Thank you. I've got three questions, please, on the business market. The first one is, since you are losing a bit of market share in mobile in business, I just wanted to get your view there who is taking share, what's happening.</p><p>The second question is on the slight deterioration we saw in Q4 from customized solutions. I just wanted to ask you what's happening exactly there and is it a one-off or should we expect more of that to -- in 2017?</p><p>And my last question, obviously related to a big profit warning from one of your peer in enterprise blaming the public sector. I just wanted to get your view on the public sector in the Netherlands. Is it declining faster than the private corporate markets or is it declining more than 8% year on year? Thank you.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Okay. Frank will take the first and third question and Jan Kees the second one. Frank, will you start?</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST, CCO, KONINKLIJKE KPN NV: Yes. Good afternoon. On the market share, mobile, what we see obviously is there's quite some price pressure in the market there. Secondly, we move quite a few into multi-play propositions from single-player wireless. The -- and as I said, the price pressure in the market, you see some shift.</p><p>On the public sector, what -- that was the third question. On the public sector, we see that the revenues have been stable in 2016. And actually we haven't seen much movement there, nor do we expect it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. Are you losing market share in business or mobile or is the market share flat and it's just pricing pressure?</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST: It's predominantly pricing pressure on the moment, where you see that some of the competitors are going in with very low pricing, which puts everything under pressure, predominantly in the large enterprise and corporate segment.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Jan Kees, will you take the second question about deterioration of customized solutions in the fourth quarter.</p><p>JAN KEES DE JAGER: Yes. So for several years already we see that -- well, traditionally, in Q4 we always have, even also now this quarter, a positive impact in Q4 on revenue coming from customized solutions because that has a pattern that tends to be larger to revenue in Q4 customized solutions. However, there is a trend, which you also saw in Q4 2015 already, that is less customized solutions and more a shift to standardized products.</p><p>So overall, we see a shift from customized solutions to standardized products. So whilst there is still a slight positive impact of customized solutions in absolute terms in the fourth quarter comparing Q4 2016 to Q4 2015, we have a negative impact because customized solutions are less, and more standardized solutions, and standardized solutions have a more gradual pattern throughout the year. But also in Q4 2015 you already also saw that same impact compared to Q4 2014.</p><p>So it's a trend, a trend which we'll also see probably in Q4 2017, a more gradual approach throughout the year because there's more an uptake of standardized solutions and less customized solutions.</p><p>JOSH MILLS, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Hi there. It's Josh Mills at Goldman Sachs. I've got two questions, the first to follow up on the B2B point. So compared to your guidance at the Capital Markets Day for stabilization in B2B revenues, how are the trends that you're seeing at the moment comparing to your initial expectations?</p><p>And second to that, when you as a management team look at that guidance and forecast that stabilization, are the metrics that you focus more on related to the large enterprise order book, which clearly we don't have as much information on, or is it something you can really model out with the multi-play improvements that we can see?</p><p>The second point, second question rather, would be on cost cutting. So your three-year simplification guidance of EUR300 million implies that there is a lower cost opportunity now than there was three years ago. Is that fair to say? Are there other opportunities? And how confident are you in being able to exceed that EUR300 million target?</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Will you take the first question about the trend?</p><p>JAN KEES DE JAGER: Yes. So in March 2016 at the Capital Markets Day we said in a three-to-five-year time, the medium term, we expect revenue inflection in business, in business-to-business market. Plotting the current trends, that could be easily -- well, according to our expectations because we see underlying also corrected, for example the customized solutions, as I just mentioned. Underlying, we see an improving of the trend, so there's less decline also in 2016 in business compared to 2015.</p><p>So the -- and also, very importantly, everything that we are doing in business in converged multi-play and also our growth in multi-play, in Q4 we see two times as much multi-play net adds in KPN One than in Q3, for example. So that's a doubling of the number of KPN One customers. We see demand in cloud and securities also -- security taking up.</p><p>So -- and also looking at the examples, but also looking at the revenue trend, it's safe to say that this is compatible with our earlier given indication of revenue inflection of three to five years, yes, counting from March 2016.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Jan Kees, will you take --?</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST: Frank.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Frank. Yes, sorry.</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST: No problem. Yes, if you look at the metrics, obviously, we're steering very closely on lines. Jan Kees mentioned already the seats we have in the SME market. In the large enterprise and corporate market, you look at the order intake and at the funnel. Order intake was up 14% in -- last year. Clearly, we have some really aggressive targets for the salesforce for this coming years -- for this coming year.</p><p>And secondly, what you do is you look at the funnel, so on a weekly basis I review the funnel with the team. You look at the quality of the funnel, you look at what's in there. Is it telco business, IT business? Is the right focus there? You look at the lead times on the funnel. And from that -- obviously, that feeds the order intake, and from that you gain confidence that the guidance we've given in the Capital Markets Day is certainly possible.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Joost, will you take the question about the EUR300 million?</p><p>JOOST FARWERCK, COO, KONINKLIJKE KPN NV: Yes. So three years ago we started our first wave in the simplification program. We guided, three years ago, a spend reduction of EUR300 million. During the process, we accelerated the simplification and spend reduction, so we moved up finally this [close] the spend reduction of EUR450 million and we ended the year above that on EUR460 million. So now, we are facing the next three years in simplification. Again, we launched a start of spend reduction of EUR300 million at least. And of course, we aim to again accelerate this program and if we can find more benefits, we will for sure grab them.</p><p>But we start like we started three years ago with the ambition of a new program, or not a new program but the next wave in a program. Again, we go for EUR300 million and every now and then we give you an update.</p><p>POLO TANG, ANALYST, UBS: Hi. It's Polo Tang from UBS. I just have three different questions. The first one is just in terms of your equity free cash flow guidance for this year. You've guided towards growing equity free cash flow but is there any reason why you didn't give a range? And are you comfortable that you can meet consensus expectations of around about EUR740 million for this year?</p><p>The second question is really about the competitive environment mainly in consumer. Can you maybe give some color in terms of what you're seeing in terms of both fixed and mobile? And can you comment in terms of T-Mobile? They appear to be a bit aggressive in terms of their unlimited data offer.</p><p>And my final question is really just in terms of how we should think about the levers of growth for the consumer business, because your KPIs in terms of broadband net adds, mobile net adds have been a bit softer in recent quarters. So is the level of growth mainly in terms of ARPU and pricing or should we think about it as both volume in terms of net adds and pricing?</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Jan K, so you start with answering the question on the free cash flow guidance.</p><p>JAN KEES DE JAGER: Yes, we are very confident about growing free cash flow, feel very strong about it. We see, of course, about EUR100 million less interest spend, we see CapEx coming down approximately EUR50 million net. Even with the initial startup phase of the new simplification program and CapEx spend to that.</p><p>Also in 2016, we had a tax benefit cash, whilst in 2017 we expect to pay around EUR25 million EUR30 million cash tax. But taking all that into account we still are very confident in growing free cash flow. And we do not feel uncomfortable for any consensus that I've seen on free cash flow.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Frank, will you take the second and third question?</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST: Yes. So the second question was on the competitive environment in fixed and mobile. They're both slightly different I may add. In fixed what we obviously have done the last year is we've put a good price increase through in the market of EUR2.50. And despite that, we've seen growth in both broadband and ITV customers. At the same time, we also refrained from heavy discounting in the last year.</p><p>Unfortunately, the competitors didn't quite follow. We saw that Ziggo for example, did not put a serious price increase through. And they have been very aggressive in the below the line promotions. If you were a TV customer, they would add a broadband line for EUR10 for example. They have a below the line offer to six-months discount in order to get to some of their numbers. We wanted to refrain from that.</p><p>At the same time, we've seen Vodafone being extremely aggressive and they had an offer out there for 12 months for EUR21, And clearly that takes away a little bit of the bottom end of the market from that perspective. And we've been really trying to focus on the converged. We've tried to focus on high value. And even the commercial focus for Telfort, for example, was mainly driven around getting fixed and mobile customers in that base.</p><p>If you look at the [MPS] and you look at the satisfaction in both Telfort access for all as well as KPN that is clearly working. Also, the churn is very low at below 5%.</p><p>If you look at the mobile market most of the battle still is in the bottom end, so you're talking about EUR10 a month for a gig, some are offering that for even less. And the strategy we have, which I think has showed to be very good is to play with the four brands we have, or in mobile the three brands we have, and make sure that we have a value play in there.</p><p>We did 92,000 net adds over the year of which 157,000 were KPN subs. And what we do in the KPN subs is we try to steer the customers towards higher bundles with higher values. And that is working very well.</p><p>Also, because we see that two things happening there it locks them in -- well it makes it easier for them to make that step to become also a fixed customer. The second thing we see is that a lot of fixed customers are now bringing in second and third SIMs into their fixed mobile offering. So I think we are very well positioned in the mobile market as well.</p><p>If you look at T-Mobile, I think which was your last comment if you look at T-Mobile unlimited package, yes, at the end of the day that is for a SIM-only at a very high price point of EUR35. We see that the majority of our customers and the majority of our net adds are in the five and one gig bundles. If you are a Compleet, customer you get automatic doubling of your data so you go to two and 10. The average usage at the moment, although it's increasing, I think it's increased 50% versus last year, but the average usage is about 2.1 gig. I think there is plenty of room to grow for people.</p><p>And I think the interesting thing is in the Netherlands is that, and that's what our research confirms, is that people don't want to pay for something they don't use. So it's paying EUR35 for something you're never going to use in a long time I think is something we don't necessarily have the offer right now, our largest bundle is 10 gig. And that is very competitively priced. And if you're, again if you're a Compleet customer that's 20 gig.</p><p>So I think we are very well positioned there in that market with the current data bundles we offer. Back in September, we both included EU roaming into the offer and we made sure that all our offerings were handset credit legislation proof.</p><p>That was a long answer but --.</p><p>KEVAL KHIROYA, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Thanks. Keval Khiroya from Deutsche Bank. Could I ask a question on the IT NTI OpEx base? So in Q3 we saw quite a sharp production given the IT simplification. But in Q4, as you mentioned, you saw a bit of an increase in that cost line. Can you talk a little bit about what drove that given I thought you would have seen further savings there? And how should we think about this line going into 2017? Thank you.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Jan Kees?</p><p>JAN KEES DE JAGER: Yes, so underlying we still see a declining trend also in the ITTI costs that's going forward, that's moving forward also in -- going in 2017 we see the same. But there is also now somewhat more cost made related to revenue for large customers that we started in Q4 so there's some cost related to -- revenue cost related in Q4. But underlying looking at the cost of running the Company, we see also a decline in Q4.</p><p>FREDERIC BOULAN, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Good afternoon. Frederic Boulan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. A quick question on your CapEx outlook. So if I look at your guidance for 2017 of EUR1.15 billion still puts you pretty high versus your mid-term outlook you presented in March of 15%, 17%. So could you explain a little bit the path for CapEx in the next three/four years? In particular, around your tech choices on the high-speed broadband. You talked about it a little bit but it seems there's a bit more fiber coming up in the mix. So where should we see that CapEx line developing in the next years? Thank you.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Joost, will you take this question?</p><p>JOOST FARWERCK: Yes, so indeed we invested heavily compared to others over the previous years. As you know, we invested in the transition of our core networks. Like Eelco and Jan Kees already highlighted, we built the core network and the decentralized content delivery network. We did a lot in access networks, covering 80% of the Netherlands on fiber either to the home or to the curb, 80% of our mobile sites are on fiber. So that's a lot of investment. And for the coming years this CapEx will go down.</p><p>Having said that, we will still invest in the quality and transition of our company. So first in the simplification we are focusing on rebuilding our operating support systems and customer process support systems on the B2B side. That's hand-in-hand with cost reductions, but we have to invest in the simplification over there.</p><p>Of course, we will always very carefully look at monetizing our access networks. So now we build this new network every mobile site is on the radar screen and every street cabinet is more or less on the radar screen to see where we can further upgrade, where to invest with respect to the value in the country.</p><p>Of course, there is customer CapEx related to the new business we want to do on the B2B and consumer side. So, all in all, we see the trend of CapEx moving down, having said that, we will keep on investing in the growth and the simplification of our company.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Given Joost's explanation we are confident that we will meet the guidance we had given at the Capital Markets Day of a 15% to 17% range for CapEx over sales in the medium-term. So that's -- well given what we know today and given what we have put in place for our long-term CapEx planning still our guidance.</p><p>GUY PEDDY, ANALYST, MACQUARIE: Hi. It's Guy Peddy from Macquarie. One quick question going back to the business segment, in your -- Eelco, when you stood up you mentioned that in the consumer side actually TV was a point of differential in your product offering. Do you have any points of differential in the business segment? Because my fear is, I've been following KPN for nearly two decades now for my sins; the Dutch market is always competitive. I'm always fearful that when you use the word standardization the next word you're going to use is commoditization i.e. we don't get any pricing power. So can you give us what you're feeling is so we don't end up in that constant spiral down.</p><p>And secondly, on your cash flow outlook that you've just suggested there you're already delivering about 11% free cash flow margin on your revenues, which is very high. So to grow that, bearing in mind you're not going to grow any revenues next year, by definition you're look at continually to improving your free cash flow margin. But I think from a big picture perspective to grow free cash flow margin from an 11% number does seem a real challenge in the mid-term, because that just implies you're going to make super-normal returns. Thank you.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: I'll take the first question. Yes, the KPN One product for large enterprise and SME, which gives us the opportunity to offer integrated services fixed, mobile, broadband, voice, and IT services, cloud services, workplaces. And we believe that we will see a similar impact in the business market of this product as we have seen of the integrated product in the consumer market.</p><p>And also, looking at, well, first results of KPN One, the customers we have connected already in the beginning of the KPN One, we see really higher ARPUs on a month-to-month base given this easily cross and up-sell opportunity we have. So we are really confident that this will be one of the pillars of our transition in the business market.</p><p>Jan K, so you take the free cash flow question?</p><p>JAN KEES DE JAGER: Yes. Again, looking at the moving parts in free cash flow, it's very important to note that [we will] break down interest cost, interest spent again EUR100 million lower this year. CapEx comes down approximately at least EUR50 million this year.</p><p>Tax, whilst compared to last year that was because we had a tax benefit in 2016, the delta is still not positive but still we have sizeable DTA of almost EUR1.1 billion. So for the next coming years we do not pay cash taxes or very, very few in the region of -- probably somewhere EUR25 million EUR30 million or something like that so few cash taxes out.</p><p>And then EBITDA margin also starts to improve, as we also indicated on the Capital Markets Day that we see at least 300 basis points in a few years' time EBITDA margins to improve.</p><p>So with an improving EBITDA margin now also seeing proof points, interest spend, CapEx coming down and also coming down even further for the medium-term, as already indicated by Joost and Eelco, towards the 15% to 17% ballpark figure over sales, we are confident that we can grow free cash flow and thus also, yes, free cash flow margin if you want to look at it that way, absolutely.</p><p>LUIGI MINERVA, ANALYST, HSBC: Good afternoon. It's Luigi Minerva from HSBC. One question about the consumer EBITDA performance, which was, I think, particularly good in this quarter. If you can give us a bit more color on what has driven it and whether we can extrapolate that performance.</p><p>And second question is more a medium-term one on network virtualization what that implies in terms of CapEx and whether you believe that increasing the software component in your network takes you to a stage where you risk giving up some control on your network towards the big tech companies like, say Google just to mention a name. Thank you.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Frank, will you take the first question about the consumer EBITDA and Joost, you about the network virtualization, any potential impact.</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST: Yes, on the consumer EBITDA basically that is a result of the higher base -- of the base growth and the higher base including the price increases we've put through, so we've created value there. But at the same time, we've been very disciplined on costs. There was a little bit less SAC costs because of lower end of contract base, but also our market costs and payroll costs were lower in the last quarter due to some of the actions we've taken earlier in the year and that has helped improve the performance there.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Joost on the network virtualization.</p><p>JOOST FARWERCK: Yes. So in the medium term indeed we are moving and we are currently building this by the way to a more software defined network approach, and we are virtualizing network functions. So that means that we run our network more from a centralized point of view from a software point of view instead of moving in hardware all the time.</p><p>So your question was are you more dependent on vendors when you move to a virtualized network. I would say the opposite is true. Today the traditional way of upgrading your network is moving more hardware in the country. And there's always one or two vendors at the next supporting you there. While moving to a more virtualized environment, as we are constructing today, gives us the opportunity to move it -- to run it in firstly in a far more efficient way. And secondly, we have the options between more partners than we have today and that's what we are currently making decisions on and doing proof of concepts in the field.</p><p>ULRICH RATHE, ANALYST, JEFFERIES: Ulrich Rathe, Jefferies. I have two questions, actually two and half. The first one is on the B2B order intake. That looks rather encouraging. I'm just wondering would you be able to share book to bill. Is that still below 1? Also what percentage of revenues is actually caught by orders? I suppose there are some buckets that don't come through orders but come in other ways.</p><p>And also is there an element in this order intake uplift from this shift that you talked about from SME to large enterprise? I think you talked about some revenue shifts there because of the way your products work. That was my first question.</p><p>And the second question is more a clarification on the VAT issues going back and forth in terms of you and your trends in the consumer business. Do you have any visibility what might happen in 2017 or even just in the first quarter? Is there more of that sort of stuff coming based on the conversations you are having with the tax authorities?</p><p>And then my last one, any news on the MTR process? Is that coming through this year? And do you have any sense of where that might end up and what it might cost you if any? Thank you.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Okay, Frank, will you take the first question, Jan Kees, the second one and, Joost, the third one.</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST: Yes, so the order intake is encouraging as you said so we are quite pleased with that. Obviously, order intake is for revenues contracted for the next two to three years and is obviously mainly for the LE and corporate market. In SME it is predominantly the [KPN One] machine, which we have turned on and moving customers towards.</p><p>If you look at the split between telco and IT obviously, we are very focused on driving more IT revenue. Certainly, the new order intake the focus is very much on IT whereas at the same time clearly, we want to maintain existing customers and maintain their telephony, the fixed so we renew that business as well.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Jan Kees on VAT?</p><p>JAN KEES DE JAGER: Yes, as to the VAT benefit that changed throughout recent years the through the tax administration, tax regulations. So of course, there's always uncertainty attached to that. For this quarter, we expect the same approach as we have seen in recent quarters, also -- so also to record the benefit. But there are ongoing discussions with the tax authority about this, and there is always discussion about -- because it is very complex situation. But for now, we are recording the benefit, also looking forward in this first quarter.</p><p>How this can change in the future? Well, I know because of my background as former Finance Minister there is nothing as uncertain as taxation, so that's difficult to assess. But for now looking at what's more likely than not we record the benefit also in this quarter.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Joost, progress on the MTR.</p><p>JOOST FARWERCK: On MTR and FTR by the way in the Netherlands our regulator drafted a decision be implemented May 1 this year. We are now in a so-called consultation phase. That means that we and the other players in the markets can get feedback on what we think about the process and how this decision is built up.</p><p>So we have -- we are working on that answer and we will send it to our regulator this week and then we will discuss the outcome of what we think they think. But it's their ambition to implement it late this year.</p><p>And maybe to add to that, the impact of the decision was already in our plans for a long time. So we anticipated on the outcome of the decision of our regulator for the coming years.</p><p>USMAN GHAZI, ANALYST, BERENBERG: Hi. It's Usman from Berenberg. I had three questions please. The first question was just on mobile pricing again. We recently noticed Vodafone with pretty aggressive 50% off promotions, at least on their website I don't know what it's like in the offline channels but on the website, you see 50% off handsets, 50% off SIM-only. Are you seeing them becoming more aggressive or reacting to T-Mobile at all?</p><p>The next question was just on business mobile. Is this something new where you've seen competition pick up in the fourth quarter in business mobile for pricing or is this just ongoing trend that you've been seeing?</p><p>My third question was on the SAC and SRCs I think you made a comment that part of the benefit in the COGS that you saw in Q4 was because SAC and SRCs were lower in absolute terms. I know that you were in the middle of a big renewal volume cycle in 2016. This is that kind of -- has that peaked? Thank you.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Frank will take the first two questions and Jan Kees the third one about the SAC (inaudible).</p><p>FRANK VAN DER POST: On the mobile pricing I think there's a couple of things happening, that's why the market is moving. Per January 1 was new legislation, which is the handset credit model. Basically, with the handset credit model there's a couple of things you need to do in order to ensure that you have the right proposition, which is legal. We implemented those in September because we wanted to be ahead of the market. And I think the other ones are now starting to follow.</p><p>But the handset -- the credit model basically what it does is that you need to give -- you need to be -- it gives transparency to the customer. You need to ensure that the cost of the device is given to the customer without any interest. And you can't cross-subsidize anymore. So you can't cross-subsidize with a lot of SAC the devices. So the alternative there is to move your pricing on the actual bundle a little bit.</p><p>The second thing, which is happening in the legislation there is that any credits above EUR250 need to be registered at the Credit Registration Bureau. For a customer, that can have negative impact because it will limit their borrowing power for mortgages and anything else because it now becomes part of your overall credit profile.</p><p>So there's a couple of things I think happening. First of all, we believe that less people will take more expensive devices and less people will be willing to borrow more than EUR250. So they either need to pay more upfront or they will keep their devices longer and not go into an automatic cycle of replacement every two years.</p><p>So I think there's a couple of different things in that dynamic, which are going to change. And what you will see is that because you can't cross-subsidize devices anymore, operators will have to change the pricing in their bundles.</p><p>However, in the legislation or what you need to make sure is that your SIM-only pricing on the bundle is equal to your pricing when you link it to a handset. And that again, the transparency will have a few of the operators I think thinking and scrambling. We have been ready for this since September, so the effects of this are fully incorporated in the fourth quarter and I think we are in a very strong position to benefit there.</p><p>Your second question was around the mobile pricing in the business market. I don't think we've seen any unusual trends peaking in the fourth quarter. I think it's just that it's an ongoing repricing in the mobile -- I the business market specially in large enterprise and corporate. SME I don't think we see the effects as much; it's just that we had quite a few of the contracts coming up in the fourth quarter.</p><p>And I think there were one or two questions.</p><p>EELCO BLOK: Yes, Jan Kees.</p><p>JAN KEES DE JAGER: So, yes, the absolute level of SRC declined because we were at the bottom of a cycle of retention. So that's why we have less retention costs. So the end of contract cycle was lower in Q4 2016 compared to Q4 2015. That explains the absolute lower levels of SAC/SRC.</p><p>However, it's good to note that we do have in Q4 we have noted a higher SAC/SRC level per sub. But that also has a silver lining because that is a result of the higher value we took in. We took in 33,000 net adds on KPN brand minus 14,000 on our [challenging] brands so net plus 19,000 net adds.</p><p>But an important shift in customer lifetime value and even ARPU level, so if you're looking at ARPU, the committed ARPU has grown by EUR1 per month. So that's actually a good thing. That is the explanation of a higher SAC/SRC per sub. But because of the end of contract cycle, the total level is down compared to Q4 2015.</p><p>WOUTER STAMMEIJER: Any more questions? No. Okay, then we would like to thank you very much for coming and have a good day and evening. Thank you very much.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Please go ahead.</p><p>SALLI SCHWARTZ, GLOBAL HEAD OF IR AND COMMUNICATIONS, MOODY'S CORPORATION: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us on this teleconference to discuss Moody's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results, as well as our outlook for full-year 2017. I am Salli Schwartz, Global Head of Investor Relations and Communications.</p><p>This morning, Moody's released its results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016, as well as our outlook for full-year 2017. The earnings press release and a presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.</p><p>Ray McDaniel, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead this morning's conference call. Also making prepared remarks on the call this morning is Linda Huber, Moody's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p><p>During this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP or adjusted figures. To view the nearest equivalent GAAP figure and the GAAP reconciliation, please refer to our earnings release that was filed this morning. Before we begin, I call your attention to the Safe Harbor language which can be found toward the end of our earnings release. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</p><p>In accordance with the Act, I also direct your attention to the management's discussion and analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in other SEC filings made by the Company which are available on our website and on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website.</p><p>These, together with the Safe Harbor statement, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements. I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. I'll now turn the call over to Ray McDaniel.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL, PRESIDENT AND CEO, MOODY'S CORP: Thank you, Salli. Good morning, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call.</p><p>I'll begin by summarizing Moody's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. I will then conclude with comments on our outlook for 2017. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to respond to your questions.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, Moody's revenue of $942 million increased 9%, primarily as a result of higher issuance in global leverage finance, US CLOs and US public and project finance, as well as continued strength from Moody's Analytics.</p><p>Many of Moody's other fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial measures were impacted by the Company's January 2017 agreement reached with the US Department of Justice, 21 US states and the District of Columbia, to resolve pending and potential civil claims related to credit ratings assigned during the financial crisis era.</p><p>The agreement, while costly at $864 million, removed legacy legal risk as well as future costs and uncertainty. As such, we felt that putting these claims behind the Company was in the best interest of Moody's, our employees, and our shareholders.</p><p>Fourth quarter adjusted operating expense, which excludes the $864 million settlement charge, was $551 million, up 3% from the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income, which excludes the settlement charge as well as depreciation and amortization, was $424 million, up 17% from the same period last year.</p><p>The adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 45%, up 320 basis points from 41.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.23, up 13% from $1.09 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter 2016 adjusted EPS excludes a $3.63 loss from the settlement charge and an $0.18 gain from a non-cash foreign exchange benefit related to a subsidiary liquidation.</p><p>Turning to full-year performance, against volatile market conditions, Moody's achieved 2016 revenue of $3.6 billion, up 3% from 2015. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Moody's revenue by 1%. Moody's Investor Service record second half revenue overcame a very challenging first quarter, allowing MIS to record a 2% revenue increase to $2.4 billion. The impact of foreign currency on MIS revenue was negligible.</p><p>Moody's Analytics revenue surpassed $1.2 billion in 2016, a 7% increase over the prior year. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 3%. Adjusted operating expense, which excludes the settlement charge and a $12 million restructuring charge, was $2.1 billion, up 4% from the prior year. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.</p><p>Adjusted operating income, which excludes the settlement and restructuring charges as well as depreciation and amortization, was $1.6 billion, up 3% from 2015. Moody's adjusted operating margin for 2016 was 45.5%, consistent with the prior year. Recognizing ongoing uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, our 2017 outlook is for mid-single-digit percent revenue growth, and EPS of $5.15 to $5.30, which includes an estimated $0.15 benefit from an accounting change related to equity compensation.</p><p>I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates.</p><p>LINDA HUBER, EVP AND CFO, MOODY'S CORP: Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the Company level.</p><p>As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the fourth quarter was $942 million, up 9% from the prior-year period. US revenue of $534 million was up 11%. Non-US revenue of $408 million was up 6% and represented 43% of Moody's total revenue. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Moody's revenue by 2%. Recurring revenue of $472 million was approximately flat to the prior year and represented 50% of total revenue.</p><p>Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's investor service, total MIS revenue for the quarter was $608 million, up 12% from the prior-year period. US revenue increased 11% to $376 million. Non-US revenue of $232 million was up 13% and represented 38% of total ratings revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenues was negligible.</p><p>Moving to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $278 million, up 13% from the prior period. This result reflected increased levels of US and European rated bank loan issuance, as well as higher global speculative grade bond rating revenue. US and non-US corporate finance revenues were up 6% and 28% respectively.</p><p>Second, global structured finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $131 million, up 14% from the prior-year period. This result reflected increased deal activity in US CLOs and CMBS and in European RMBS and CLOs. US and non-US structured finance revenues were up 18% and 7% respectively.</p><p>Third, global financial institutions revenue of $89 million was down 4% from the prior-year period, primarily as a result of reduced European banking issuance. US financial institutions revenue was up 4% while non-US revenue was down 8%.</p><p>Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $103 million is up 21% versus the prior-year period, primarily driven by strong non-US infrastructure and US public finance issuance. US and non-US public project and infrastructure finance revenues were each up 21%. MIS other, which consists of nonrating revenue from ICRA in India and Korea Investors Service, contributed $8 million to MIS revenue for the fourth quarter, up 10% from the prior-year period.</p><p>Turning now to Moody's Analytics, global revenue for MA of $334 million was up 4% from the fourth quarter of 2015. US revenue of $158 million was up 11%. Non-US revenue of $176 million was down 1% and represented 53% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 4%. On a constant currency organic basis, MA revenue grew 5% in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research data and analytics, or RD&amp;A, revenue of $167 million was up 3% from the prior-year period and represented 50% of total MA revenue.</p><p>Growth was mainly driven by new sales and contract upgrades for credit research and ratings data fees. US RD&amp;A revenue was up 7%, while non-US revenue was down 1%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted RD&amp;A revenue by 4%.</p><p>Second, global enterprise risk solutions, or ERS, revenue of $130 million was up 7% from last year. The growth was driven primarily by the March 2016 acquisition of GGY, as well as an increase in software license revenue. US ERS revenue was up 24%, while non-US revenue was down 1%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted ERS revenue by 3%. Trailing 12 month revenue and sales for ERS increased 12% and 4% respectively. Product sales were up 13%, while services declined 16%, reflecting our progress on shifting the mix of the ERS business to emphasize higher-margin products.</p><p>Third, global professional services revenue of $37 million was down 3% from the prior-year period. US professional services revenue was flat, while non-US revenue was down 4%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted professional services revenue by 3%.</p><p>Turning now to operating expense, Moody's fourth quarter adjusted operating expense, which excludes the settlement charge Ray mentioned earlier, was $551 million, up 3% from 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to increased incentive compensation, the March 2016 acquisition of GGY, and to annual merit increases, largely offset by management savings initiatives implemented in early 2016. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted adjusted operating expense by 3%. As Ray mentioned, Moody's adjusted operating margin increased 320 basis points to 45% in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Moody's repurchased 558,000 shares at a total cost of $60 million, or an average cost of $107.48 per share, and issued 86,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan. Moody's returned $71 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the fourth quarter of 2016.</p><p>For full year 2016, Moody's repurchased 7.7 million shares at a total cost of $739 million, or an average cost of $96.38 per share, and issued 2.8 million shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan. Moody's returned $285 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during 2016. The total capital returned to shareholders in 2016 was $1 billion.</p><p>Additionally, on December 21, 2016, Moody's increased its quarterly dividend by 3%, from $0.37 to $0.38 per common share of stock. Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2016, totaled 190.7 million, down 3% from December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, Moody's had approximately $700 million of share repurchase authority remaining.</p><p>At year-end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program, which is backstopped by an undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at year end were $2.2 billion, with approximately 78% held outside the US. Free cash flow in 2016 was $1.1 billion, up 4% from 2015, primarily due to changes in working capital.</p><p>And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Okay. Thanks, Linda.</p><p>I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing our full-year guidance for 2017. A complete list of Moody's guidance is included in our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on Moody's Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.</p><p>Moody's outlook for 2017 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors; including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued.</p><p>These assumptions are subject to uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Our outlook does not include any estimated impact for potential changes in US tax laws or other possible policy or regulatory changes. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-year exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.24 to GBP1, and for the Euro of $1.05 to EUR1.</p><p>As I noted earlier, Moody's expects full year 2017 revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Adjusted operating expense is expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range from the 2016 adjusted operating expense of $2.1 billion. On a constant dollar basis, the revenue growth rate would be approximately 120 basis points higher and the adjusted operating expense growth rate would be approximately 170 basis points higher.</p><p>The Company is projecting an operating margin of approximately 43%, up approximately 100 basis points compared to 2016's operating margin, excluding the settlement and restructuring charges of 42%. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 46%.</p><p>The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 31% to 32%, and reflects the US accounting change related to equity compensation, as well as changes to UK tax laws as noted in our earnings press release. Full year 2017 EPS is expected to be $5.15 to $5.30, including the estimated $0.15 per share benefit resulting from the accounting change previously mentioned.</p><p>Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $500 million, which includes the payment of the settlement charge recorded in the Company's fourth quarter 2016 financial results. Moody's expects share repurchases to be approximately $500 million, subject to available cash, market conditions, and other capital allocation decisions.</p><p>Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $100 million. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $135 million. For MIS, the Company expects full year 2017 revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Both US and non-US revenues are expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. On a constant dollar basis, the revenue growth rate for MIS would be approximately 100 basis points higher.</p><p>Corporate finance revenue, structured finance revenue, and financial institutions revenue are each expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Public project and infrastructure finance revenue is expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range.</p><p>For Moody's Analytics, the Company expects 2017 revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. US revenue is expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range, and non-US revenue is expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. On a constant dollar basis, the revenue growth rate for MA would be approximately 180 basis points higher.</p><p>Research, data and analytics revenue is projected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. Enterprise risk solutions revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. And professional services revenue is expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range.</p><p>This concludes our prepared remarks, and joining Linda and me for the question-and-answer session are <person><nameText>Mark Almeida, </nameText></person>President of Moody's Analytics; and Rob Fauber, President of Moody's Investor Service. We'll be pleased to take any questions you might have.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you.</p><p>(Operator Instructions)</p><p>We'll go first to Alex Kramm with UBS.</p><p>ALEX KRAMM, ANALYST, UBS: Hey, hello everyone.</p><p>I think my questions are mainly for Linda today. Starting with the expenses, I think the margin guidance was a nice surprise relative to what you've said before. Could you walk through the puts and takes a little bit more, how should we think about what's driving the upside?</p><p>Is it the way you've ended in terms of being soft on hiring this year? What about legal expenses that might be coming down post the settlement? And maybe any color on variable compensation, how we should be expecting there for the year. Thank you.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Hey, Alex. Glad you're happy, and I have a couple of points to make about that. We did do better in 2016 due to some pretty rigorous expense control measures that we took back in February of last year. So we did better at the conclusion of 2016 even than we had expected.</p><p>Those controls will continue going into 2017. So we feel pretty good about guiding to approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion.</p><p>Some of that does come from saving some legal costs, but the majority is what we're doing in terms of hiring. We have slowed the pace of hiring for the corporation.</p><p>MA continues to move a little bit faster than the rating agency and shared services. Looking at 2016, over 2015, MIS is actually down in headcount, and shared services is approximately flat. All those things have helped us, just with good general housekeeping and some discipline.</p><p>In terms of incentive compensation, let me find the right page here and we'll talk about that. As what sometimes happens, we noticed that in the fourth quarter, because our performance was a good deal stronger in 2016, Alex. The quarters had gone in 2016 for incentive compensation about $32 million, $35 million, $42 million, and then, as sometimes happens, the fourth quarter was $59.6 million in incentive compensation.</p><p>For 2017, probably the right thing to model there is somewhere between $40 million and $45 million per quarter of incentive compensation. And does that hit most of what you wanted?</p><p>ALEX KRAMM: I think that got everything. Secondly, similar on cash flow, I guess, how should we be thinking about the settlement, and how you will actually end up paying for that, and the timing of all of that? If you can run through the buybacks, are those going to be more third quarter or fourth quarter?</p><p>How about, are you going to draw on the revolver or the commercial paper program? What's the interest rate we should be thinking about? I don't think you guided on interest expense.</p><p>Just think about, you have a lot of cash overseas. You generate decent cash here, but maybe not enough, so how should we be thinking about that?</p><p>Lastly, related to that, you how do you think about leverage in general? If you need to raise a little bit more debt for this, I think you're hitting some of your initial targets, are those targets changing? How do you think about being a rated Company yourself?</p><p>Anything we should be thinking about here. Thank you.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Okay. Alex, that's about all the questions.</p><p>Let me try to start with the DOJ settlement. So the happy news is we're done. Or we're just about done.</p><p>The payments have been made. Those were largely completed. And the way we did that was cash on hand, US cash on hand.</p><p>You'll recall back in 2016, we reduced share repurchase guidance from $1 billion to $750 million. And then also, for those who have within paying close attention, we have re-entered the commercial paper market. We have about $600 million of commercial paper outstanding right now, about an average maturity of 60 days, and we're paying about 1.2% on that commercial paper.</p><p>So we're very happy with the receptivity of the commercial paper markets, and that's how we have financed the payment of the settlement. So again, that's done. Going forward, we've guided to $500 million of share repurchase for the rest of the year.</p><p>That's subject to many things, as we've discussed already, but some of it is how cash flow comes in for the year for the Company. So we'll see. As we announced, the settlement -- one of the other rating agencies that looked at us did provide a little bit more leverage room for us under its measure, which is now 1.5 to 2 times, rather than the 1.5 times that you had seen before.</p><p>However, with very much like our rating category that we have right now, and we don't like to run right up to the edge of our leverage level. We feel that we have some dry powder, we're happy about that. We have at least $500 million of dry powder, something like that, as we look at what we might want to do for 2017.</p><p>So we like the leverage levels. We have a bit of room. Share repurchase about $500 million, and again, we just want to be thoughtful, given everything that we've just had to deal with, and we don't like to be too close to the edge in terms of the leverage levels.</p><p>I don't know if Ray had anything else he wanted to add. I think that's of most of it.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: I want to underscore both -- this is implied both in the question, and then addressed directly by Linda's answer. Between our cash on hand and our various borrowing options, we feel we have quite a bit of flexibility. And so we are going to be making decisions according to market conditions as we go through the year, and as I imagine you would expect, we're going to pay close attention to what we think are the best opportunities.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Alex, one final point which may not have been taken into account by everyone looking at their models. We did do some financing in 2016. So you'll see in 2017 the roll-forward effect of that interest expense.</p><p>Secondly, we do have the $600 million of CP, and we are considering the term market at this time. And we'll see what we decide to do about that.</p><p>But, again, if we take that 1.2% rate we're paying for the CP and we term that out, I think it would be fair to say that we would expect that, that interest expense would be a little bit heavier. So we're considering that right now, and that's one of the reasons why everything doesn't flow fully down to EPS.</p><p>ALEX KRAMM: Very helpful, as usual. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.</p><p>JOSEPH FORESI, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Hi. My first question is, just any thoughts on issuance given the new administration, I'm sure you're predicting that one. What could that do to your current projections, any internal scenarios you're setting up for.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Joe, what we'll do, I'll go through what we usually do regarding our views that we're hearing from the investment banks, and then we have an exciting new feature. Rob Fauber is going to add a little bit of color in terms of what the rating agency is noting in the marketplace.</p><p>So starting with the US view and again, this is coming from the investment banks, and it's an averaging of what we're hearing from the different banks. Investment grade right now is running very, very strong. January was $200 billion in issuance -- a strong month is $100 billion.</p><p>This is record January supply. Financials have dominated, as well as significant issuance from TMT companies. For the year, we're looking at about $1.2 billion of US investment grade issuance. That's about flat year-over-year.</p><p>The pipeline is robust as corporates exit their blackout periods and potentially look to get ahead of Fed rate hikes later in the year, which might be June, could be March, and then potentially again toward the end of the year.</p><p>We note that many issuers were hearing from the banks prefunded in favorable 2016 issuance environment. That might serve as a bit of an offset to 2017. And we're thinking about the M&amp;A pipeline, which is bouncing around a bit.</p><p>For US high yield, $35 billion issued so far, $250 billion expected for the year, which is up 5% year-over-year, 2017 has started on a positive tone. Large cash inflows to high yield, recovering commodity prices and attractive yields are very constructive. More constructive default scenarios and energy price outlooks are helping with the backdrop, and we think that will support 2017 high yield bond issuance.</p><p>Leverage loans so far $120 billion. That is a torrid pace. $400 billion expected this year.</p><p>The year is expected to be down 15% year-over-year. But for right now, stability in the macro backdrop is aiding the leverage loan market with potential interest rate increases.</p><p>The floating rate view is preferred for investors, and we continue to have CLO formation, and that will support leveraged loan activity. Not enough, though, to surpass the elevated levels of 2016.</p><p>Now moving to Europe. What we've heard from the banks investment grade in Europe, volumes were higher than usual in January as issuers took advantage of the good conditions and low rates. The ECB and Bank of England continue to buy bonds and support the market, and there's a strong pipeline as issuers look to go to market ahead of key political events in Europe and potential ECB tapering.</p><p>We're about two months away from the French election; that's the first major event. High yield in Europe and the leveraged loan market remain in robust shape. ECB bond buying has indirectly supported the high-yield market and should help maintain rates at all-time lows.</p><p>Macroeconomic and geopolitical risks continue to be a key focus, though, in Europe, particularly for the speculative grade market. And now I'll invite Rob to make any further comments that he might want to offer.</p><p>ROB FAUBER, PRESIDENT, MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, MOODY'S CORP: Linda, that was pretty thorough. I don't have too much to add to that. I might just talk about a little bit of the upsides and downsides in general to you how we're thinking about issuance.</p><p>Certainly, higher economic growth leading to more capital investment and in turn debt financing would be a positive. Some sort of infrastructure stimulus, either privately funded or in the municipal market. More constructive M&amp;A environment.</p><p>Certainly, Linda touched on that. And I think importantly, a pull forward of these 2019 to 2021 maturity walls. We think we're seeing some pull forward now, but if we see more pull forward, that could provide some upside.</p><p>Things we're thinking about as potential headwinds, I think you mentioned potentially unfavorable tax changes. There's been a lot of discussion around that, around corporate interests, tax deductibility, repatriation of foreign cash. Interestingly, we did see in January some very large issuance from some big tech players who have large cash balances offshore.</p><p>And we're looking at trade developments that could disrupt markets, stall investment. Obviously watching the election calendar in the EU. Strengthening of the US dollar would also be something that would have an impact on us as well.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Not that we're supposed to ask the questions, but Rob, you had mentioned one of the pieces of research we released last week on the refinancing law.</p><p>ROB FAUBER: I don't want to confuse people, because I don't have the global numbers handy, but we just put out some research last week. I know in regards to the US spec rate maturity wall, we're looking at the five-year maturity wall is now over $1 trillion for the first time. That's up about $100 billion from the study this time last year.</p><p>JOSEPH FORESI: Got it. So, any color, though, on real-time, what the clients are telling you given the new administration? Are you seeing a wait-and-see approach or any pull forwards? I'm just wondering if there's anything outside of what you laid up from the issuance side of things.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: No, this is Ray. Obviously, conditions were very strong in January, and the markets remain active in February. We really don't expect to see the January kind of numbers in the loan and high yield sectors continue at that pace, but market conditions remain good.</p><p>All of that indicates that issuers are taking advantage of a tight-spread environment. They may be moving ahead of uncertainty later in this year, whether it's policy uncertainty here in the US or the potential implications of unexpected outcomes in the European elections. So the pull forward is, I think, both a recognition of good market conditions and potential uncertainties later in the year.</p><p>JOSEPH FORESI: Okay. And then the last one from me.</p><p>On the regulatory side we've heard about some repeal, maybe, at some large institutions. Just wondering if you have any thoughts about that impact on your Analytics practice? Thanks.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: I'll let Mark comment on how they're thinking about that, and I'll add any color if appropriate.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT MOODY'S ANALYTICS, MOODY'S CORP: I'd say that we're not seeing any meaningful impact to any of the talk about pullback on banking regulation, for example. We're still seeing very good demand for our products, for regulatory requirement as well as some of the accounting rule changes that are coming through, both IFRS 9 and the current expected credit loss CECL program that's coming in the US. So nothing meaningful from our standpoint.</p><p>JOSEPH FORESI: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC: Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the strong quarter.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Thanks.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: So first question on -- wanted to ask about new issuer rating mandates for 2016, how that's been trending versus previous years.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: Well, the fourth quarter was up year on year. We had I think about 175 new rating mandates in Q4, so that's good looking forward into the new year.</p><p>We are not at peaks we were at back in 2013, 2014, but it has been a stable flow of new mandates at healthy levels, just off-peak levels. Rob, I don't know if there was anything else worth adding on that.</p><p>ROB FAUBER: No, I think that's right.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: How is the breakdown between Europe and US?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: I don't have that number in front of me. Rob is telling me it was skewed towards the US, at least in the fourth quarter.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Okay. And then on the Moody's Analytics side, just wanted to ask you how things were looking at RD&amp;A, how the retention rates have been holding up, how the pricing realization has been.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: It continues to be strong on both fronts. We're running in the mid-[90%s] on customer retention, pricing is solid. We're seeing good upgrade activity.</p><p>So that's all strong. I mean, any softness we see in the RD&amp;A numbers for the quarter really are down to currency. We really took it on the chin on currency translation in Europe.</p><p>So it's hit us pretty hard. But the underlying business is as strong as it's been over the of last couple of years.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Last question on ERS. You mentioned the GGY acquisition which you're going to be anniversarying, and then also what looked like very strong software license revenue. I was going to ask for some help in terms of modeling that out for the rest of the year, how we should think about that.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: Well, you're right, we had a good year in 2016 because we had very good performance in the business. We also had help from the GGY acquisition, so that was all good. Linda also referred to the fact that we are making good progress on our transition in the mix of the business, as we've been talking about for a while.</p><p>We are de-emphasizing the services piece of the business and focusing much more heavily on sales of products that are much more scalable and therefore much more profitable. So the impact of that will flow through to 2017 revenue in the sense that we had a revenue -- a deliberate revenue decline in the services segment of the business, and so you're going to see that flowing through to revenue growth in 2017.</p><p>So we're guiding toward mid-single-digit revenue growth in ERS. And I think the way to think about that is, think about 2017 in terms of ERS revenue growth as a transition year as we shift the mix of the business away from services and focus more heavily on products, which we think will drive a much stronger P&amp;L over the coming years.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Got it. Thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays.</p><p>MANAV PATNAIK, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Hi, good afternoon. Linda, just us to follow up on the expense commentary. Can you give us the ramp that you usually guide us to from now to the fourth quarter?</p><p>And also, how much of that 100 basis points is coming from the Moody's Analytics side? Maybe you could just update us on the efforts for the margin improvement there.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Sure. Manav, the first question's a little bit easier, and maybe I'll let Mark think a little about what he wants to say on your second question. This year, we're hoping that the ramp will be a little bit flatter than it's been in previous years.</p><p>To give you somewhere to start, I think I've got this right, we're looking at about $532 million for the first quarter budget for expenses in 2017, and we're looking at the ramp going up $20 million to $25 million from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. Now, I'll give the same warning that I give every year, that includes the review that incentive compensation lays out pretty evenly for the year.</p><p>We haven't had that sort of performance recently in 2016. You'll note incentive comp went way up in the fourth quarter because of the strong performance. But all things being equal, you want to start with $532 million or so and take it up $20 million to $25 million.</p><p>Now, we've had pretty significant margin work in MIS and some pretty strong cost controls in shared services in 2016. That reduces the run rate increase for 2017. And Mark's continuing to focus on margin by at his higher-margin businesses, as we said in the prepared remarks.</p><p>I don't know, Mark, if you want to make any other comments on your thoughts.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: Yes, I mean, I would only observe, consistent with what we've said before, that I think we are making good progress with the MA margin. The challenge that we have is it's difficult for you to see that because of the way that we allocate overhead expense to the two operating businesses. MA, as it's been growing faster than MIS over the last of couple of years, is attracting more overhead.</p><p>So that's sort of offsetting the work that we're doing in the business itself. So it's difficult for you to see it because of that. It's difficult for you to see it because of the impact on the margin, at least in the short run, with some of the acquisitions we've made.</p><p>So we believe we're making good progress. We think that progress is only going to get better over the coming years. But it is going to be difficult to see it on the MA standalone P&amp;L, just given the way we treat overhead expense.</p><p>MANAV PATNAIK: So is the target still mid-[20s] over several years?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Yes.</p><p>MANAV PATNAIK: Okay. And then, just one on the rating side, maybe Rob can add some color here. I think you guys have put out some pieces around tax reform and the impact on issuance. It sounds like for Moody's companies specifically, obviously the lower tax and repatriations are positive.</p><p>Just on the broader tax reform piece, I guess it sounds like the view is it should be a negative, but how should we think about timing and how that impacts issuance and the Company's decision making? Any help or color there would be helpful.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: This is Ray. When we look at potential changes in taxes, it's really -- there are a number of puts and takes. Certainly to the extent that there are impacts from changes in interest deductibility, you have to count that as a negative. But to the extent that debt financing is still a low-cost form of financing, you would have companies that have more available cash.</p><p>It would probably be a stimulus for economic growth and so I would hope and anticipate we would see more new money borrowing. So the quantification of whether it ends up being a net negative or a net positive is difficult to assess without having more detail about what the actual changes in tax law would be. And as we see that, we will obviously communicate it.</p><p>MANAV PATNAIK: Got it. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>TONI KAPLAN, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Hi. Good morning.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Good morning.</p><p>TONI KAPLAN: In 2016, your transactional revenues, ratings revenue growth, was up about 0.5%, while your biggest competitor was up about 6% in transactional rating. Was do you think the key drivers are that explain the delta there? Just given that, historically, you've been a little bit more in terms of transactional mix shift, just wanted to figure out what we should be thinking about.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Toni, it's Linda. This is one of the most difficult types of questions for us to answer because we can see what goes into that view for us, but of course we don't know what goes into that calculation for our competitor. Makes it pretty hard for us to judge.</p><p>I'll ask Rob if he wants to make any other comments on this, but that wouldn't -- we don't have as much clarity on that as you might think, and it's a little hard for us to parse. Rob?</p><p>ROB FAUBER: The only thing I think I can surmise would be some shift in the mix.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: Just to add onto that, our transaction versus recurring revenue splits remain fairly constant in 2016 versus 2015, so we didn't see any big shifts there.</p><p>TONI KAPLAN: Okay. Great. And I guess related, can you just talk about the pricing environment within MIS?</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Sure, it's Linda. We had spoken about, at Investor Day back in 2016, that we felt pretty good about the pricing environment. I think that continues, I think I had noted then that we expect to be closer to the 4% end of the range we had said of 3% to 4%.</p><p>We are very interested in providing appropriate value for what we do, and we think we've made some significant investments in what the team has been able to do in terms of ease of use and otherwise a very strong value proposition which I'll let Rob talk about. But we're feeling okay about pricing. Rob, anything else you want to mention?</p><p>ROB FAUBER: I think that's it.</p><p>TONI KAPLAN: Great. And then your long-term framework calls for EPS growth in the teens. This coming year, you're expecting mid-single-digit MIS growth environment.</p><p>Why only 5% on the EPS increase excluding the tax benefit? I think you did mention perhaps the higher interest expense before rolling into 2017 from the actions you took in 2016, but are there other pieces that we should be thinking about as well?</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Toni, you might want to note the new accounting provision is helpful to us, but the UK has a couple of laws that's going to limit the interest deductibility piece to 30% of EBITDA. And that is costing us about 160 basis points on the tax line. The tax line is, in this climate, one of the more challenging things for us to predict.</p><p>If we do see a change in tax policy, I would note, which might be helpful to you, that a 1% change in the ETR, that's 100 basis points, gives us $0.07 to $0.08 in EPS, which is a lot. So we're quite sensitive to what happens to that tax line, but you know that we've guided to 31% to 32%. We'll see what happens with that.</p><p>And there's obviously some variability around it. So we're taking a prudent view on this, given what we know now, and if we have adjustments, we'll be happy to discuss those with you on future calls. Ray, I don't know if you want to --</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: The only other thing I would direct you to is the fact that we do have higher financing cost this year than we did of last year. Part of that is the roll-forward of financing that we did during the year last year.</p><p>And part of it is the fact that we've done some financing and we'll continue to do some financing as a result of the settlement with the Department of Justice and the payments that were made there. So that's just giving us an increase in that line that we normally wouldn't see.</p><p>TONI KAPLAN: Thanks a lot.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Warren Gardiner with Evercore.</p><p>WARREN GARDINER, ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI: Thanks. On the margin and analytics in the quarter, it sounds like there were a couple of moving parts there with GGY and some FX. In any sense you could parse that out for us, give us what you think the core margin would be for that business?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Well, I can tell you that if we ignore the additional overhead expense that we absorbed, and we ignore the impact of the acquisition, for the quarter, the margin would have been flat to 2015.</p><p>I should also note that we had a couple of million dollars of nonrecurring expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 that we won't have going forward. And so you probably -- if you want to look at, on a run rate basis, you want to back out a couple million dollars for that as well.</p><p>WARREN GARDINER: Okay. I guess, then, on expenses, overall -- for Linda, maybe -- in the past you guys have -- this is kind of been asked a little bit. In the past you guys have given us a sense of what you might have to pull back on if things got choppy. Any sense what that level of flexibility would be for 2017?</p><p>LINDA HUBER: I think I'd stick to what we said in 2016. We always tell you guys we can achieve $50 million of expense savings, and voila, we achieved $50 million of expense savings. So there's probably another $50 million in there across the Company.</p><p>I would note that we are being very thoughtful about expenses. We note that both operating expenses and CapEx, CapEx is looking to be up about $100 million as we go through 2017. We've had a little bit of lightening up in terms of our real estate projects.</p><p>We had taken two floors in One World Trade Center in 2016, and as you know, we're making some investment in our technology. But we expect that to lighten up a little bit in 2017. So we're guiding to $100 million, as we had said.</p><p>Just across the board, we're being really careful with what we're doing and considering every cost. We have a procurement group that's done a really nice job on some of our expenses such as T&amp;E. We're managing very, very closely.</p><p>We'll think about maybe flexibility for another $50 million for 2017.</p><p>WARREN GARDINER: Thanks a lot.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next to Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thanks. Good afternoon.</p><p>I guess I wanted to come back to the ERS growth, and the assumed deceleration of mid-single digits from double digits the last three years. I know you called out the mix shift of going towards products away from services. One, I just want to confirm for similar, I guess, offering, I'm sorry, the implication that it's a lower price, I just want to confirm if that's right for one.</p><p>And then two, how much of it is that versus just you being conservative? The last couple years, I think you've guided to mid-single digits and put up something much healthier than that.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Andre, a couple of things. First, as Linda said earlier, she noted that trailing 12-month sales in ERS are up 4%, and then she decomposed that. She said that product sales, again trailing 12 months, products sales are up 13%, and services are down 16%.</p><p>So if you just start with trailing 12-month sales for ERS up 4%, that flows through to our mid-single-digit revenue guidance for 2017. Because we've got sort of the lag on revenue recognition. So that's how we get to the guidance.</p><p>The mix shift, again, is designed to deliver more margin. I think you're right in talking about fees, you're right in the sense that over the last number of years we've done some very large projects for customers where we charged many millions of dollars for the services work that we did. So in that respect that -- not doing projects of that scale and charging those kinds of fees for services will put some -- will put a bit of a drag on top-line growth.</p><p>But we think that because the product is more mature, it is more scalable, it meets more needs for more customers, we think we'll be able to sell more. We're going to make it up -- to some degree, we're going to make it up on volume. We'll be able to, as we get through this transition, we'll be able to get through a better growth rate over time.</p><p>And then the other thing to keep in mind here is that decline, that 16% decline in services sales in 2016, was kind of a one-time phenomenon. Our expectation is that we'll hold that line flat going forward. So you won't see a big contraction there.</p><p>We'll be holding that flat while the product line continues to grow at a double-digit rate. We're going to get, on balance, we'll get to a much healthier overall growth rate in ERS. Which is why you say it's helpful to think of 2017 as a transition year for the business.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: That's helpful. I guess, just a follow-up on the margin question, a couple other people asked. Definitely makes sense that you're getting more overhead.</p><p>You've been talking about that for a while now. It's just explicitly to make sure we modeled it right. Should we assume that margins for that business are up next year as you work through this transition or is getting to the mid-[20]s more back-end loaded?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Again, we don't give specific margin guidance by line of business, but I will tell you, again, if we were to -- you ignore the GGY acquisition, you ignore the additional overhead that we attracted in 2016. And if you ignore that couple of million dollars that I mentioned, that nonrecurring expense that we had in the fourth quarter, we would have seen over 100 basis points of margin expansion in MA from 2015 to 2016. And I would expect that trend to continue.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: Thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray &amp; Co.</p><p>PETER APPERT, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY &amp; CO.: Thanks. Ray, what's left on the legal front?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Fortunately, not much. If we step back and look at all of the crisis era litigation, we've now disposed of better than 90% of what we were facing globally. So very little left in terms of numbers.</p><p>PETER APPERT: And then, Linda, I understand their rationale in terms of a lower pace of share repurchase in 2017. Should we anticipate, then, that in 2018, maybe get back to more of the $1 billion run rate you've been doing in recent years?</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Peter, it's hard for us to guide that far ahead in terms of share repurchase. We do look at market conditions. We do want to reinvest in our businesses, and share repurchase oftentimes is sort of the last number that we look at given that.</p><p>We thought it was best to be prudent for this year. Yes, we would like to return to more vigorous share repurchase but we're going to have to see. It's too early to tell where that will go.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: I think the fairest thing we could say looking out that far is we believe we certainly would have the capacity to do so, and we'd make those decisions nearer the date.</p><p>PETER APPERT: Got it. Lastly, Rob, just on the trends in the structured finance market, which seems like it's basically come back to life.</p><p>Any commentary in terms of changes you're seeing in the market that might give you more confidence in the sustainability of volumes there? And any commentary on competitive dynamics? Because it does seem there's more competitive pressures in that market than you see elsewhere. Thanks.</p><p>ROB FAUBER: Maybe I'll focus primarily on the US. That's obviously the largest market. So in the ABS sector, got off to a bit of a subdued start as folks were still adapting to the Reg AB2 loan level reporting requirements.</p><p>But the pipeline's certainly heating up, and activity is heating up in February on some very strong demand there. In terms of CMBS, we saw a very weak start. That was due to a pull-forward of deals from the risk retention deadline at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, and I would I say that CMBS hasn't weathered risk retention quite as well as the CLO market.</p><p>We've only seen two risk-retention compliant deals get printed since the deadline at the end of December. That said, there is a pipeline building in CMBS. And in CLO, we've seen some very strong issuance continuing into the first quarter of 2017.</p><p>So obviously, you saw in our results, there was very strong issuance in the fourth quarter due to a real pull forward from 2017 into 2016 in advance of that risk retention deadline. I would note that much of the early volume in the first quarter in CLOs is refi as spreads have come in.</p><p>We are starting to see some new CLO formation come into the March pipeline as the CLO market seems to have found some structures that work within the risk retention framework. Just in terms of -- from a competitive standpoint, our coverage continues to be strong, and we actually have seen some nice gains in our coverage in Europe.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go to Tim McHugh with William Blair &amp; Company.</p><p>TIM MCHUGH, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY: Thanks. Just on the margin question, obviously 2017's better.</p><p>Are you finding things that you didn't expect? Or are we seeing some of the expected margin expansion that you talked about at Investor Day, in terms of the path towards 45%, just come faster than you would have otherwise expected?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Yes, I think it's a couple of things. We have taken actions in 2016 that were somewhat accelerated against our original expectations, and we're getting the benefits of those. We've also got a little bit, as you might imagine, better position on the legal side now than we had last year.</p><p>We are still anticipating that we can move to the mid-40%s margin overall. Again, subject to the mix of the two different businesses. But, yes, you've got an acceleration of what we were identifying earlier in the year last year. Linda, I don't know if there was anything else you wanted to add to that.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: We were very pleased with the progress we made in 2016. I think we even surprised ourselves, frankly, Tim. We did a $12 million restructuring charge. The genesis that was split half-and-half between the rating agency and shared services.</p><p>We're being very careful with what we're doing in headcount. And in shared services, we're very thoughtful about our use of lower-cost locations. Those are our own employees we're using in those lower-cost locations. We've gotten the run rate down, and we're very happy about that. We're being really careful about what we do going forward.</p><p>I think it's good housekeeping, and Ray and I encouraged our colleagues to think hard about the margin line. And everybody really got the message and did a great job, and we expect that, that will continue. We run the business in a very disciplined way. We've been very careful in terms of adding new headcount and even backfilling.</p><p>So we're pleased with what we're seeing, and we're doing a little bit better than we even thought. So we're very happy with all that. There's no magic to it -- it's day-to-day hard work and good discipline.</p><p>TIM MCHUGH: Okay, great, thanks. Just a follow-up on the tax benefits from the new stock comp rules, I guess. Does that cause more seasonality in the tax rate that we should expect?</p><p>I know there's timing differences sometimes, and when you'll recognize the benefit associated with that part of it. I don't know if the UK rule has similar --</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Sure. The US rules probably will see seasonal effects. And we've estimated about $0.15, but there are a number of factors that go into that which could move around. So we would urge everybody to think about that as an approximation.</p><p>A lot of that might come into the first quarter when our restricted stock awards vet. And there are a bunch of factors there.</p><p>One is, what is the exercise price? Second is, what is the pace of that exercise pricing? The timing, the number, and any number of other factors.</p><p>So we would expect that, that effect might be heavier in the first quarter, particularly given, very happily, where the stock price is right now. So we'll see how that lays out. This is new to us, and we'll give more information as we see what we get in the first quarter.</p><p>TIM MCHUGH: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER, ANALYST, HUBER RESEARCH PARTNERS: Great. Thank you.</p><p>I have just a broad question on the tax policy potential changes we could get out of Washington. If they do get rid of interest expense deductibility in the US as part of overall tax reform, could you guys base case that would hurt potentially high-yield issuance much more so than investment grade issuance? That's my first question.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: I think it would probably have more of an impact on high-yield. Again, though, just trying to weigh the puts and takes on that. It's also high-yield companies that are going to probably want to take most advantage of having additional cash on-hand.</p><p>And so that gives them more flexibility. It might cause them to engage in different behaviors, whether it's from an M&amp;A standpoint or business expansion. So I do think the premise of your question probably leans against high-yield more than it leans against investment grade -- there's pluses and minuses in both cases.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: Ray, I assume you would say that probably even more so, if the interest expense deductibility was limited to only up to 30% of EBITDA. Similar to what you talked about in the UK, I guess Germany has as well, as opposed to getting rid of 100%.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Yes. And again, there's what it does in an absolute sense, but then it's also, relatively, what is still the more or less attractive ways to raise capital. And so even if it's less attractive, if it's still the most attractive, you would expect firms would make rational economic decisions.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: And then Ray, as a follow-on to that, if you just isolate -- I know this is hard, but if you just isolate, if the corporate tax rate, the US Federal rate goes from 35% to 15% or 20% or thereabouts. What is your general sense on what that could do to debt issuance in terms of -- obviously it should be more pro-growth out there?</p><p>What do think it would do for debt issuance from an M&amp;A perspective, and investing in backing companies, et cetera? (Multiple speakers) debt issuance.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: I don't have a quantification of that for you, Craig, but again, the pluses and minuses that we've outlined in a couple of our comments throughout the call indicate that we don't expect dramatic change in what is happening around our business.</p><p>But it's going to have some impact. Whether it's at 15% or 20% or 25%. And we're just going to have to see.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: Linda, a couple quick housekeeping questions. Maybe I missed this. What percent of your cash hoard is outside the US right now, if you would, please.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: 78% is offshore now, Craig. The numbers are -- US is roughly $500 million, international is roughly $1.7 billion. That totals to $2.2 billion, a little bit more.</p><p>But 78% overseas. And that's because we use some of the US cash as we dealt with the DOJ situation. But as we noted, the very vast majority of the settlement payments have already been made.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: And as has been the case in the past, a substantial fraction of our foreign cash is also held in US dollars.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: Lastly, Linda, if I could ask, given the concerns, ongoing concerns around Brexit. For your ratings business, was your revenues out of the UK for full year 2016 roughly 7% to 8% of your ratings revenue gap? Fair number to think about.</p><p>LINDA HUBER: Offshore, offhand -- excuse me, Craig, I'm not certain. We're puzzling and looking at Rob to see if he has any further information.</p><p>ROB FAUBER: It's not as straightforward as you might hope, Craig, because we do both UK-entity-based ratings out of the UK, but we also do European-based ratings, EU-based ratings out of the UK. And the companies that are issuing into the EU may be filed from any one of a number of offices.</p><p>So both how the revenue gets apportioned and then how the expense base supporting that revenue gets apportioned are subject to some interpretations of what's in and what's out. The UK is not a large part of our overall European business, but I don't have a fraction I can give you.</p><p>CRAIG HUBER: Okay. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Jeff Silber with Bank of Montreal.</p><p>HENRY CHEN, ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS: Good morning, guys. It's Henry Chen on for Jeff.</p><p>I had a question on MIS. I'm just curious, from a commercial sales perspective, now with the business stabilizing, are there any new markets or geographies that you're looking at to potentially expand your coverage in?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: In terms of markets that we are looking to expand in, we have been active, as you have seen. In emerging markets including India, increasing our stake in Korea, growing business coming out of China has been growing very nicely.</p><p>With the liberalization that is being proposed and discussed in the Chinese market, we would anticipate that, that should create some opportunities. We've also been concentrating on building out the business in Latin America and Middle East. So Rob, I don't know if there's anything else you wanted to add to that.</p><p>ROB FAUBER: We opened an office last year in Sweden. We've been building out presence as well in the Nordic region.</p><p>HENRY CHEN: Okay, that's helpful. Just on MIS, as a follow-up comment, in terms of the different products, is there any margin changes when one increases as a percentage of the whole, say, when structured increases as a percentage? Does that impact the margins of the business?</p><p>ROB FAUBER: The margins in the MIS business for all of the fundamental areas are roughly the same. The structured finance margin is more variable. It's a more transactionally oriented business. And so in periods of high volume, you get higher margins, and low volume, lower margins.</p><p>It's also susceptible to how intense the monitoring to activity has to be. In periods of greater stress, there is greater allocation of resource to having to be on top of the monitoring. That's simply because in periods of stress, there are more assets that have to be scrutinized more closely, so you get some swings there as well. That's the only line of business I would say has substantial variability in margin.</p><p>HENRY CHEN: The monitoring for the structured, or just overall?</p><p>ROB FAUBER: Monitoring for structured in particular, because of the large number of assets that underlie those pools.</p><p>HENRY CHEN: Got it. Thanks so much.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll go next to Patrick O'Shaugnessy with Raymond James.</p><p>PATRICK O'SHAUGHNESSY, ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES &amp; ASSOCIATES, INC.: Good afternoon. Quick CLO question for you. Does the CLO refinancing create the same revenue opportunity for you guys as a CLO issuance?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: No, new issuance would be a higher revenue opportunity than refi.</p><p>PATRICK O'SHAUGHNESSY: Got it. And then, follow-up question. The acquisition that you just announced the other day, this structured finance data and analytics business of SCDM, is that going within research data and analytics? If so, can you talk about how much of the high-single-digit revenue growth target for that segment in 2017 is going to come from the acquisition?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: The answer to your first question is yes, it is part of RD&amp;A. But it is a very, very small acquisition. It's a good acquisition. It makes a ton of sense.</p><p>We've done this a number of times before where we've acquired businesses where -- in this case we didn't acquire any people. We essentially bought a product that is very similar to an existing product of ours. We're going to transition their customers from the legacy product to our product.</p><p>So essentially, we bought that business without buying any expense, frankly, that would come along with it. So I think it's a very good transaction for us. But it is, honestly, it's tiny.</p><p>Strategically, it's a nice fit, but it's not going to turn the dial on financial performance for RD&amp;A.</p><p>PATRICK O'SHAUGHNESSY: Smaller than the GGY acquisition of last year?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ALMEIDA</nameText></person>: That's correct.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Significantly.</p><p>PATRICK O'SHAUGHNESSY: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ray McDaniel for closing comments.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Okay. Thank you all for joining the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you again after the first quarter. Thanks.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes Moody's Corporationfourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2016 earnings call.

HEFFERNAN, </nameText></person>CEO, PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR, ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION: Great. Thanks, Eddie, and good morning, everyone. As always, joining me is Charles Horn, who is preparing himself for about 20 questions on tax. And we'll also update you on the fourth quarter, full year results. I'll give a wrap up of 2017. And then we're going to get right into '18 and the trends we're seeing in -- by business, and we're going to get after it.</p><p>So with that being said, I'll just kick it over to Charles right away.</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN, CFO AND EVP, ALLIANCE DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION: Thanks, Ed. Revenue for the fourth quarter came in strong at 15% growth to $2.1 billion. For the year, revenue increased 8% to $7.72 billion, slightly soft to guidance due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, negatively impacting revenue at Card Services by approximately $80 million.</p><p>Core EPS increased 34% to $6.26 for the fourth quarter and 14% to $19.35 for the full year. Excluding the net tax benefit, core EPS increased 12% to $5.24 for the fourth quarter and 8% to $18.33 for the full year, better than our guidance of $18.10.</p><p>The recently enacted tax reform lowered our provision for income tax for the fourth quarter of 2017 and full year by reducing our net deferred tax liabilities, essentially reducing cash taxes that we would have had to pay in the future. Tax reform also benefits us moving forward, as we expect our effective tax rate to drop to 26% to 27% in 2018, and that compares to 33% in 2017 prior to the adjustment we just talked about. We also anticipate the cash benefit to approximate $100 million to cash flow in 2018.</p><p>Our net corporate debt ended the year at approximately $5.9 billion, while the corporate leverage ratio ended the year at 2.7x, consistent with the last several years.</p><p>Let's move on to the next slide and talk about LoyaltyOne. It was a mixed year for LoyaltyOne. AIR MILES met expectations, and we restored the profitability at the level we anticipated, while BrandLoyalty results were unexpectedly poor. We entered the year knowing that we needed to retool the AIR MILES business model following the breakage assumption reset at the end of 2016. We were successful in introducing small changes that allowed AIR MILES EBITDA margins to return to the mid-20s range.</p><p>On the other hand, AIR MILES issued came in short of expectations, down 4% for 2017. Softness in promotional activity, especially in the grocery vertical, caused the shortfall. We will need to stimulate promotional activity in 2018 in order to drive issuance growth.</p><p>Turning to BrandLoyalty. Revenue decreased 12% in 2017. The weakness is due to several reasons: one, key markets Germany and Russia were off due to the absence of events, such as the Euro Cup and Olympics, which reduced the number of programs executed; two, North American expansion into the U.S. did not manifest, as it's taking longer to establish the foothold here than we anticipated; and three, the rollout of Disney product offering was delayed to 2018. On a positive note, the backlog for the first quarter -- or first half of BrandLoyalty looks good, and that's 2018.</p><p>Let's go to the next slide and discuss Epsilon. Our goal for Epsilon entering (inaudible) percent top and bottom line growth. The strong finish to 2017 allowed us to hit the 5% revenue growth target. And on an apples-to-apples basis, we also achieved the 5% adjusted EBITDA target. The difference to the reported decline of 1% is the restoration of $29 million in incentive compensation versus 0 last year. Essentially, it's a 1-year grow-over that we had to play through, but we needed to restore bonuses in order to maintain highly-competitive compensation packages going forward.</p><p>The storyline for 2017 is all about the faster-than-expected stabilization of the technology platform business, which finished strong with 7% growth -- revenue growth in the fourth quarter, as the offering stabilized through the sale of more packaged offerings and record volumes through our Harmony digital messaging platform.</p><p>The other 2 big drivers of growth, auto and Conversant CRM, finished the fourth quarter and the year with double-digit revenue growth. Auto continues to benefit from ongoing penetrations in new OEMs, while Conversant CRM cross-selling efforts continue to gain traction, in particular, as the digital capabilities are now embedded in both auto and technology platform offerings.</p><p>Let's flip to the next slide and talk about Card Services. Facing the headwinds of the second year of credit normalization, Card Services still delivered with double-digit growth in both the revenue and adjusted EBITDA for 2017.</p><p>Looking at the key performance metrics. Credit sales increased 6% for the year with apparel brand partners showing consistent improvement as the year progressed, culminating in strong holiday performance. Tender share grew more than 160 basis points in Q4 and more than 100 basis points for the full year. Average receivables increased 15% for the year. The growth rate in the fourth quarter dipped slightly to 13%, as we divested approximately $800 million of noncore program receivables in December, which hurt receivables growth by about 2%.</p><p>Operating expenses were up 7% compared to revenue growth of 13%, so very strong expense leveraging. The net loss rate was 6% for the year, up 90 basis points over 2016. 60 basis points of the increase were due to lower recovery rates and 30 basis points due to higher gross losses. Gross loss rates stabilized as 2017 progressed, as we reached the end of the credit normalization cycle. The delinquency trend or wedge as we call it, closed within 10 basis points at year-end, excluding the transitory impact of the hurricanes.</p><p>Turning to the all-important holiday season. Overall credit sales increased 8% with strong performance from our recent vintages. On a comparable brand basis, credit sales were up 5% over last year. The growth was fueled by continued non-store spend, up 11%, which includes digital and web channels. Non-store sales growth was driven by both an increase in buyers and spend per buyer, and that's 3% and 2%, respectively. This growth came from an increase in omnichannel buyers, reflecting our continued strategy to help brands engage customers in all relevant channels.</p><p>Card Services continued to expand and diversify the portfolio brand partners, signing nearly $3 billion vintage in 2017. The new partners we have signed this year have been a great reflection of where the market is growing and what consumers value, brands like IKEA and Viking Cruises being valued for their product and experiences they provide, and Build.com being a strong e-tailer in a growing category for ADS.</p><p>A key initiative for 2018 is to develop a consumer direct funding program for our Utah bank. It would allow us to take saving accounts and other non-demand deposits, thus diversifying our funding sources and helping funding rates.</p><p>With that, I will turn it over to Ed.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Great. Thanks, Charles. If everyone can turn to the slide titled 2017 Full Year. This is sort of more of a commentary part of the call. I don't have a lot to add from a numbers perspective, but I would call out 2 items on the slide.</p><p>First up would be under Epsilon. As Charles mentioned, the goal for the year was mid-single digits top and bottom. On an apples-to-apples basis, we believe we accomplished that. Again, the delta between the reported number for EBITDA and the 5% growth rate is the restoration of the incentive comp or bonus program. So if you -- said differently, if you went back to prior year, there was 0 payout, which we don't believe is sustainable in this market. And therefore, we wanted to make sure we were highly competitive as we move into '18. But we didn't want to cloud the actual performance. And frankly, exiting the year at a plus 7 top line is a very good signal as we move into next year. So we think we're getting a handle on that sort of mid-single-digit growth rate and, overall, it feels good.</p><p>Card Services, as Charles said, even with 90 basis point increase in loss rates, still managed to deliver EBITDA net of all these provision costs and funding costs and everything else of double digit. So a nice job there.</p><p>And then finally, on the earnings per share, we had guided to roughly $18.10. We came in at $19.35. The differences are the following: overperformance would have brought us in at $18.33, so ahead by $0.23 and then a little over $1 coming from the tax benefit, which consisted both of the benefit itself, less about $12 million that we allocated to nonexecutive bonuses coming out of the tax reform act.</p><p>So overall, I think it was -- certainly, it was an exciting year. And hopefully, as we move into '18, it will be a little less exciting, a little more fun.</p><p>So let's now turn and talk a little bit about the businesses themselves. First, we talk about LoyaltyOne, which consists of our Canadian business, AIR MILES. As Charles, again, sort of highlighted, in my mind, we set out to do 5 things. And I think 4 out of the 5 came through. Most importantly, after the crisis last year, we stabilized the model with a number of changes that we made. And specifically, we came in, in the mid-20% EBITDA margins, which was our goal and very pleased to see that, that has stuck. Second, we renewed our largest client, Bank of Montreal, which is critical to the ongoing success of the program. Third, we wanted to make sure, coming out of the crisis, that we retained our clients. And we had 100% retention rate, so congrats there.</p><p>And then finally, we wanted to get the folks excited about the program again. And that comes through with active collectors. Active collectors are all the way back to pre-crisis levels by Q4. So we've set the table pretty nicely.</p><p>Probably there are couple of things that we still need to work on. One is, look, the model stabilized, but it has not yet kicked into adding to our growth rate at ADS. So we want to move it back now that it's been stabilized into growth rate mode, and that's the job for '18. The one goal where we came up short was promotional spend from our clients, which represents about 1/3 of all the miles that we issue. It was quite soft. And that's something that we're working on right now to make sure that it's not just the everyday spend that gets rewarded, but we want a big chunk of the promotional spend as well. So overall, I would say, the Canadian business did a nice job following the crisis the year before.</p><p>BrandLoyalty, unfortunately, had a -- frankly, there's no other way to put it. It was a very, very poor year. And I think we got a little bit comfortable with 3 straight years of strong double-digit rate of top line and EBITDA. The program just kept rolling along. And then we just had -- frankly, it fell off a cliff in '17. And we had very poor results. The big question for me was, was that an air pocket? Or do we have a fundamental issue with the program? Fortunately, we now have visibility on the fact that we've got a huge book of business for '18. And it looks like it's more like an air pocket. So we're looking forward to having a very robust snapback from BL in 2018.</p><p>All right. Let's go to Epsilon. Again, sort of that mid-single-digit organic top and bottom line is what we're looking for. That's what we brought to the table. That's what we're looking to continue into 2018 and start building up a level of consistency that people feel comfortable with. Again, for those of you who recall the end of '16, that's when -- there was a big question on our largest chunk of the business with Technology Platform, which is about over 1/4 of all of Epsilon Conversant, and that was a bit of a melting iceberg. At that point, it was down 13% year-over-year in Q4 of '16. The team did a wonderful job of turning it, not only getting the pricing at a level we want, setting up the office in India, also moving from a very customized model where things take 15, 17 months to get to market to a more standard package, where we're talking about 2 to 3 months. And as a result, what we saw is steady progress and actually exited the year at plus 7% growth for that business. So that's probably the big story there.</p><p>Also as Charles mentioned, our 2 big growth areas. Digital CRM and the auto offerings were both up strongly double digit. There was a bit of a concern in Q3 whether the digital CRM, which had fallen off in terms of growth rate, whether that was an air pocket. Fortunately, it was. And as a result, you saw a nice pickup in Q4.</p><p>On the negative side, I would say it's a bit more from a macro perspective. We've got a lot of folks since -- it's both a tech offering, but it's also a services offering. And from a macro perspective, we're going to be watching very carefully the impact of the tight labor market for hot skills. A lot of folks competing for this type of talent, and we want to make sure we're on the top of the list.</p><p>And then finally, we want to have more consistent, better visibility on the financial results. I think '17 was a good start, but there's still work to be done there.</p><p>All right. Card Services, as Charles mentioned, the fabulous wedge that we put out, I don't know, 15 months ago, which is our best predictor of future losses, as everyone knows. We started -- it was up year-over-year about 50 basis points, and that's where we sort of said, \"Look, we think losses will be up about 50 basis points.\" By the end of the year, for me, it should have closed. That would have been a nice finish to the year. Unfortunately, we came within 10 basis points. We did have some noise from the hurricanes. But look, the trend's our friend at this point and it's effectively closed. That means that the outlook for '18 gives us comfort that stable loss rates will follow.</p><p>Growth rate in the book of business is quite strong, 15%. Frankly, I feel that's a good number for us to shoot for on a yearly basis. If you were to look back the last 5 years, I think the numbers were closer to 20%. But I think 15% is a very solid number. That gives us a lot of flexibility when it comes to signing new clients and also being very selective on renewals. We did have a record new vintage this year, close to $3 billion. For those of you who don't live and breathe in the card business, $3 billion essentially means if you took all the signings that we did over the past year, whether it was an existing file or whether it was a file starting from scratch and it takes 3 years to ramp up, after 3 years, all of these clients together will add roughly $3 billion to the portfolio. And that's how we look at it. And we have a number of vintages each year that are spooling up.</p><p>If you looked at the clients, it's interesting that they differ across verticals and across physical presence versus strictly e-commerce. Obviously, Signet, Build.com, Viking, Guess, Diamonds, Adorama and IKEA represents what we're beginning to see now, which is different from the more traditional model of mall-based soft good apparel. So we continue to see the interest coming from many different areas and that gives us a lot of comfort on what we're going to do going forward. Double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. So obviously, that includes absorbing the 90 basis point increase in losses, and frankly, getting that done, I thought, was outstanding.</p><p>On the negative side, what did we miss? We missed the third-party recovery market, which I'll talk about in a little bit, absolutely plummeted. And as a result, it lowered our recovery rates dramatically. And if you look at that 90 basis point increase in net losses, we thought it would be more like 50. What it turned out to be was gross losses were only up 30. And so, we lost it on the recovery side when the market cratered.</p><p>And then finally, a more macro issue. Obviously, everyone knows about the retail environment, so we just need to keep our eyes open in terms of what's going on with our core clients as well as signing the newer ones.</p><p>Full year, decent year. Revenue up 8%. Core EPS up 14% with the tax bene; up 8%, excluding the bene. Leverage at the corporate level was very modest at 2.7 and that included the impact of funding over $1 billion for buybacks and capital for growth in the portfolio. So good generation of free cash flow for the company. Frankly, the biggest news that everyone's been waiting for is the stabilization of the credit loss rate. We're there, after 2 years of absorbing increases. And we're poised now to return to mid- to high-teens core EPS growth rate in '18, which is, quite frankly, our long-term model. So it's been a bumpy couple of years. And we're right where we wanted to be for the slingshot for 2018.</p><p>We are raising the cash dividend 10% to $0.57 per share starting in Q1. And with that, let's put '17 behind us and move right into '18 and talk about guidance.</p><p>So pretty straightforward, of course. There's always a little wrinkle, but the revenue itself looks quite strong. We're looking at double-digit revenue growth of roughly 12%. Against that, there is an accounting adjustment that does not affect cash flow or EBITDA or earnings per share. It's merely geography, but it does change the recognition of roughly $350 million in our business in Canada.</p><p>And I'd like Charles to just very briefly talk about it.</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: So essentially, this revenue standard has been out there for quite a while, but it was really in December when the AICPA came out with a white paper that basically said that if the loyalty program does not take inventory risk, meaning we don't own it, we don't carry the inventory until the point of redemption, we should record it net, meaning the gross revenue minus the cost of the product redemption to get to a net revenue. LoyaltyOne travel has definitely fit that threshold. So what it forces us to do is to look at the travel-related redemptions going into 2018. Recognize we'll now have a net recordation for it. To Ed's points, no impact at all in terms of your earnings -- any of your earnings metrics. Obviously, it bumps up your EBITDA margin appreciably, but it's purely just shifting to a net presentation. This was something that came very late in the year. We had not anticipated it early. Not a big impact overall to ADS in terms of revenue. And like I said, no impact to profitability.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Okay. So again, from our perspective and from how we're going to be presenting on earnings and stuff, we'll pro forma the nums and from our perspective, it's a 12% top line core EPS, even with the big bump-up in '17 from the $18.10 to the $19.35. We're still looking at 16% to 19% growth in 2018. If you want to go back to the original guidance, we said we wanted to do $18.10 this past year, bumping up to $21.50 for next year. The new guidance is -- we came in at $19.35 and we're going to bump up $18 to $22.50 to $23 a share, representing 16% to 19% growth.</p><p>All right. Big question, tax bill, tax bill, tax bill. Tax bill will provide us with $100 million -- roughly $100 million a year in additional free cash flow. And that's roughly $1.78 per share. We're going to take that $100 million and, obviously, flow through roughly 2/3 of it. And we're going to take between 30% and 33% and plow that back into the company. We're going to put it back into the company in 3 different buckets. The first bucket would be to accelerate some existing projects that we have on the board. The second would be to establish an innovation fund to get -- to make sure we're on the leading edge of the various digital payment products that are out there. And then the third would be to bolster some employee benefits, whether it's getting the 401(k) participation rate up or holding down any increases on the benefits, the premiums on various health care packages for the employees, we want to help out there. So it's -- we're trying to live the spirit of the agreement as well as what we believe is the appropriate thing to do. And we can talk about that during Q&amp;A.</p><p>So let's go into specifically guidance. Let's talk about LoyaltyOne, which is our Canadian business. In BrandLoyalty, we expect high single-digit revenue, low double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. AIR MILES, we talked about, has stabilized. Now we would like to see it begin to return to incremental growth.</p><p>Second, BrandLoyalty, as we also talked about, usually runs at a solid double-digit top and bottom. We did have a very poor year in '17, which means we expect a very strong snapback in '18. We think the World Cup, the Olympics and the Disney deals that we have, it's already looking like the number of deals we signed is going to be a record.</p><p>Epsilon, consistency, consistency and consistency. We want to see a minimum of mid-single-digit top and bottom. We expect the tech platform, now that it's turned, to actually turn into growth, along with auto and the Conversant CRM. Those 3 businesses are almost 70% of Epsilon/Conversant.</p><p>In Card Services, growth math, as they say. We expect roughly mid-teens growth or 15% growth in average credit card receivables. I get a lot of questions about how do you do the math. And if you look at the signings from '15 to '17, those signings are ramping. And let's say, combined, they add about $2.5 billion to the growth rate in 2018. Plus the core, we expect to be in growth mode -- modest growth mode, add another $1 billion. So you're at $3.5 billion. And then we have budgeted about $1 billion of what we consider folks that either are going bankrupt or we don't feel the renewal process is favorable to us. And so we put in a fair amount of squish there to get us to the 15%, which means it could be a tad bit higher or right at 15%. But that looks like a good number. Gross yields are very stable.</p><p>And then let's get into the credit stuff. Stable delinquency rates, best predictor of future losses. Again, we started '17 at about 55 basis points higher. By Q4, you get rid of the hurricane noise, it just about closed to 10, and that's sort of what we're seeing going forward here. We expect stable delinquency rates and that will lead to stable loss rates. And so if you look at the loss rates and the composition of loss rates, what you'll see is it's kind of interesting that the gross rates were up only 30% -- 30 basis points, sorry, last year, better than the 50 basis points we had initially forecast. The consumer is quite healthy. We're seeing very good behavior from the consumer. But really, where the 90 basis point increase came from, 2/3 of it came from, again, as I talked about, the third-party recovery market, which fell off a cliff.</p><p>The recovery market for sales of written off accounts got to be very challenging for us. And again, for people who don't live this, there's 2 stages. One is when you go delinquent, some people call that a recovery process for the first -- for the next 180 days. We've always done that 100% in-house. I'm guessing we always will. It's certainly one of our advantages. But what we're talking about is post write-off. So after 180 days, after we write off the account, we sell some of those -- that paper to the third party. That market collapsed. We normally recover between 22% and 25% of gross losses. So if you looked on the chart here, in 2016, 1.8% meant roughly 26% of gross losses were recovered. In '17, we received much less; when we sold all those accounts, our recovery rate fell to 16%. And therefore, it added 60 basis points to the net loss rate or 2/3 of the total. So similar to the past, we know we can do better in-house. That process started in earnest in late fall and will be complete by Q2 of '18.</p><p>All right. What's it all mean? We're trying -- Charles and I are trying to answer every single delinquency and loss question here, so we don't have 100 of them after the call. What's it all mean? Q1 will be noisy and will be elevated. The final hurricane flow-through will cause gross losses to be elevated, while we will also be refraining from any third-party sales of written-off accounts, which would normally have lowered -- which will, in fact, lower the recovery rate versus prior year. Basically, we want to recover those ourselves, which means it will come a little bit later in the year, so expect an elevated loss rate in Q1. This is noise only. The delinquency flow suggests stable gross losses, and in-house recovery process will be done by Q2. So after an elevated Q1 to these transitory items, Q2 through Q4, we expect flat to better versus prior year on loss rates and to make up for the Q1 noise with favorable comps in Q2 to Q4.</p><p>The 2018 summary is the 2-year credit normalization process is over. We are back as a company to mid- to high-teens earnings growth. Free cash flow will be very robust with over $1.5 billion. Right now, we've only allocated roughly $500 million of that to support regulatory capital and dividends. So over $1 billion of unencumbered free cash flow, and we feel very good about 2018.</p><p>And we appreciate your patience, and we'll open it up now for Q&amp;A.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.</p><p>DARRIN DAVID PELLER, MD, BARCLAYS PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Let me just start off on the card business. From an outlook perspective, the -- I know you're talking about mid-teens receivables growth, or the like again. And I know the year ended off with a slightly slower growth rate. I think it was closer to 10% in the December month. I just want to understand where the confidence is coming from in terms of the portfolio growth and the underlying trends in retailers you're seeing right now. And then just a quick follow-up on the BrandLoyalty -- on the LoyaltyOne business after, please?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, sure. What we do is, obviously, we've got roughly 160 clients. Actually, a lot of the core clients that we had wound up doing a bit better in Q4 and holiday than, I think, a lot of people had anticipated. So we are seeing a little bit of traction there. Also what we do is we look at, Darrin, the vintages that we signed not just in '17, but '16 and '15 and see how they're ramping up and when they're going to layer into the '18 growth pipeline. And so you sort of wrap it all together and what we're seeing is even factoring in at roughly $1 billion that could go away due to a client going bankrupt or renewals that we don't want to pursue, we've looked back -- oh gosh, if you went back prior 5 years, our average growth rate has been 22%. If you layer in the vintages, what you're seeing with the ramp-ups of the IKEAs and stuff like that, the 15% looks certainly doable.</p><p>DARRIN DAVID PELLER: Okay. So it's really organic. I mean, in terms of the strength you're seeing, it's actually organic addition -- additional clients.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes. We have not factored in any acquisitions of portfolios in 2018.</p><p>DARRIN DAVID PELLER: Okay. I was just going to ask about -- I appreciate that. On the LoyaltyOne side, just to be clear, I mean, I understand BrandLoyalty has a ton of different new business coming on -- World Cup, Olympics, Disney, et cetera. Just give us more color on the overall confidence on that business, not just -- I mean, on loyalty and the AIR MILES side, specifically, in terms of the overall guidance, high single-digit revenue. What do you need for the AIR MILES business to do for that business overall -- LoyaltyOne, to deliver the guidance you're giving, high single-digit revenue growth and -- I mean, can you give us a little more confidence on what you're seeing there to give you the conviction in that?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure. I think the Canadian business, we've set the bar, I think, at a reasonable level. So the goal for '17 was stabilize, get the margins back to the mid-20s. For '18, frankly, Darrin, we're talking 2% to 3%-type growth, which should certainly be doable. The BrandLoyalty, frankly, is going to be the engine driving this bus. And based on what we're seeing in terms of the number of programs signed versus the folks who decided to take a pass last year and sort of wait for the Olympics and World Cup and everything else, it looks pretty robust.</p><p>DARRIN DAVID PELLER: Okay. All right. Charles, just last question and I'll turn it back to the queue. But on the tax side, it's great to see your guidance unchanged, backing out now the tax benefit implicit in your '18 guidance. Just curious in terms of the assumptions for the tax benefit. I mean, I think we had estimated a little bit higher than the $1.50-or-so you're guiding and I know there's a $0.50 reinvestment. But even with that, is there any other items we should just be aware of in terms of conservatism in your tax adjustments or tax estimates for the year?</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: Sure. So if you look at 2017, our effective tax rate was 33%. We're guiding to 26% to 27% effective tax rate in '18. To Darrin's point, it does assume that we'll get a little pressure from the States. You've read what's going on in New York, New Jersey, California. They could -- the states could look to grab some of that federal savings. So there is little bit of conservatism built in, in that the state rate could go up in 2018 versus '17, which is why we set the bar at 26% to 27% effective tax rate '18.</p><p>DARRIN DAVID PELLER: All right. So it's maybe another 100 basis points or so above what it otherwise would have been. Or...</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: I can't quantify it, Darrin.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI, MD, KEEFE, BRUYETTE, &amp; WOODS, INC.,RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe this goes back to the spirit of some of Darrin's questions. But Ed, maybe you could just talk about where you see the largest risks to your outlook. I know there's a lot of positive things happening underneath it all, but maybe you could just talk about what you're worried about to the extent that you are worried about anything. And then as far as tax reform, can that help Card Services and Epsilon as consumers benefit from that and businesses look to reinvest? I'm just trying to think through the impacts.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes. I think they're fair questions. Look, we don't -- the areas that we need to continue to show consistency, that would be Epsilon/Conversant. We've had a good run in '17. Frankly, I think we need to demonstrate we can do that again in '18 before people get really comfortable. From what I'm seeing, it looks pretty good. Obviously, the BrandLoyalty thing was probably the thing that took us all by surprise. And I can -- I see the number of programs we signed based on prior year. We know how that will flow into earnings growth. I don't think we're going to say much more until we actually just print the numbers because we missed so badly during '17. If there's one place of risk at the overall level, it's certainly not with the consumer. What we're hearing out of the thousands of folks who are in our collection areas is that the consumer is quite strong, quite healthy. So I would say, Sanjay, the only thing that would pop up to me, of our 160-or-so card clients, we're assuming a handful, and we watch them pretty closely, are going to have a very difficult time. A couple may even head towards bankruptcy. To the extent, on the retail side, that estimate is off and there's another handful that we haven't thought about, I don't think it will hurt '18, per se, but what it will do is it will make for a tough grow-over for '19. So from a macro perspective, it's more retailer-specific, a handful we've sort of identified. It's no more than that handful.</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: And on the tax reform, Sanjay, we would say, you've seen many companies come out announcing they're going to put more money in the hands of their associates, which could lead to card holder spending more money in 2018, which could be beneficial to our card operations.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: How about Epsilon? Are businesses looking to reinvest some of the upside?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes. I think from some of the reinvestments, I would call out probably 2 areas. The first in terms of reinvestment would be -- we have always -- given the size of the card business today, it was a lot easier when the file was a couple billion as opposed to heading towards $20 billion. We will be rolling out and launching a new source of funding, which will be on the consumer deposit side out of our ILC facility in Utah. And obviously, that requires a consumer platform. It requires marketing. We'll have to come up with some fancy slogan or catchy slogan, I guess, that will get people excited about what's in their purse. And then the other area would be with the CRM business at the Conversant side of it. Given the growth rates there, we will probably -- not probably, we will absolutely be ramping up the size of the sales force effort and, perhaps, focusing even more on not just the large clients, but also mid-market. So those would be the 2 big areas I would see initially for investment.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Caintic with Stephens.</p><p>VINCENT ALBERT CAINTIC, MD AND SENIOR SPECIALTY FINANCE ANALYST, STEPHENS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So first, I have to ask a question on credit. But on the in-house collection efforts that you've had so far, so I know it's early days, but given the 60 basis point headwind you had in 2017, what are you seeing so far in your experience that maybe can give us some encouragement? And then also, how you think about the level of credit reserves that you keep. We've had some good provision performance recently, but just kind of wondering how you think about credit reserves.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure. Great question. Yes, we went through this whole recovery in-house versus selling to third parties post great recession, where we raised the same type of issue and we had to bring things back in-house. All right, it's pretty simple math. At a certain level, it's more profitable to push it outside. What we have found, so far, because we're about 6 months into this process, is that much like we had anticipated, if I were to put a number on it, the recovery rates internally are probably somewhere around 20% to 22% of your gross loss rates. So against a marketplace that was paying us 25%, it certainly made sense to go outside. However, that 25% dropped all the way down to 16% during '17. So as we gradually move that up to the 20%, 22% in-house, that's what we're seeing. And that's why I think we feel very good about where the net loss rate trend is going to be this year. From a gross loss perspective, it's going to be flat.</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: In terms of credit reserves, we tend to carry 11 to 13 months in terms of forward loss coverage based upon the trends we see in losses. Beginning back in 2015, we carried up to 13 months coverage all the way through the third quarter of this year. We trimmed it back to 12 based upon favorable trends. Fourth quarter, we kept it at 12 months forward coverage, which is likely where we'll stay until we see it stabilized and potentially drop lower. The key thing to keep in mind in looking at the reserve quality or the reserve coverage, if the Signet file came on late in the year, close to $1 billion, the losses embedded with the file recorded net, so there is no reserve attributable to it. So you always had to focus on the reserve divided by the reservable AR, which would not include the bulk of Signet in that number.</p><p>VINCENT ALBERT CAINTIC: Okay. Got it. That makes sense. And then separately on the -- I mean, the loyalty programs and kind of the loyalty updates, you talked about 15% AR growth in the card side and the signings' activity that you're getting there. I'm just kind of wondering how also that might translate into some growth on the Epsilon side. It seems like -- there seems to be more engagement on the overall loyalty offering that you have and if you can just give more perspective on that.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure. Yes. I mean, 100% of our card clients are on the loyalty platform developed by Epsilon. The various digital distribution channels, such as email, our card clients would use the Epsilon. We are, right now, beginning a bigger push to get the unique sort of identification platform that is Conversant CRM into the hands of our card clients. So we would expect that to be a big area for us to push. I would say, across the board, our card clients are asking not only for the type of insight into their existing customers, but they also want to be able to say, \"Let me take a look at my best customers. How do I go out and find people similar to that, that may not be customers today?\" And that's the beauty of what Conversant can do with its unique ID. We can take all those characteristics and then go find these folks and, on behalf of the clients, get something really exciting that could motivate them to show up, either online or in-store at our clients. And that's sort of a new area that we're really beginning to expand. So it's not just taking care of the existing best customers. That's obviously job #1. But it's now moving into, \"Help me take a profile of my best customer and then go out into space there and find someone similar and then get them all excited about the brand.\" And that's -- that is an area that's getting our clients very excited because it's going to drive sales, and that's sort of the bottom line. So that's the big push.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Deleeuw with Piper Jaffray.</p><p>JASON SCOTT DELEEUW, VP &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY COMPANIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I just want to be clear on the credit recoveries. Sounds like we have some noise with the hurricanes maybe in the first quarter. But taking it in-house and then the changes you've made, I mean, shouldn't the recovery rate -- shouldn't there be a tailwind to your net charge-off rate? Or are you expecting that still kind of flat versus the 2017 level?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: That's absolutely going to be -- when it's fully up and running, it should be -- you should think 20%, 22% versus 16% that we did in 2017. So from that perspective, if you had flat delinquencies, which we have, and you're going to see flat gross loss rates and you've got this tailwind on the recoveries, as the year progresses, it certainly suggests that we're going to be in decent shape.</p><p>JASON SCOTT DELEEUW: Good. And then just on Epsilon. The technology platform revenue, it grew 7% in the quarter, so it was a nice improvement on the growth rate there. Can we sustain that level? And can you just help us understand kind of the drivers of that and then kind of the margin profile of that revenue versus the rest of Epsilon?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Sure. I'll let Charles do the margin. In terms of the product itself, what we basically had there was the traditional Epsilon product release, big iron-type databases and loyalty platforms that were highly customized for each and every client. And they were just massive, right? They dealt with tens of millions of customers of clients, all the bells and whistles in the world. And they were, frankly, pretty cool. The problem was they cost an awful lot of money. And it took anywhere between 9 to 15 months for this thing -- for these things to be delivered and cranked up for the customer. That just wasn't feasible anymore. We were frankly a bit slow to make the pivot to transition to a lower cost, quicker delivered product. And that's what took us a full year, maybe 15 months to do. We opened a large office in India, which helped with the price point. It brought us very competitive with some of the SaaS-based solutions out there. In addition to that, we, frankly, could no longer sit there and spend 6 months getting all the bells and whistles on these platforms. And we said, \"Here's what we can deliver in a 2-month time frame.\" And so we sort of marginalized the offering. And lo and behold, with the new price point and the time to market being brought from 10 months to 2 months, we found a very receptive audience because a lot of these folks, frankly, don't want to run the things in-house. There's a big market for companies that want to run and they get SaaS-based solutions and they hire IT staff and they go do their thing. So it's also a very big market as long as we can hit the price point and we can deliver in a timely fashion, where they're saying, \"Look, I don't want to be the ones responsible for figuring out how the watch is made. I just want to know the time.\" And so that's why I think this is something that, right now, certainly seems sustainable based on the book of business we've signed.</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: Yes, Jason, from an EBITDA margin standpoint, think of technology platform being in the 18% to 20% range.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question is from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT, SENIOR MD, HEAD OF PAYMENTS, PROCESSORS &amp; IT SERVICES RESEARCH AND FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI, RESEARCH DIVISION: Could you drill down a little bit more into the mid-teens portfolio growth assumption for '18 for Card Services? More specifically, could you talk about your assumption for same-store credit sales and what the breakdown of that would be between expectation for same-store sales of your existing retailers versus expected wallet share gain?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: You bet. I think, David, it's -- we are taking a fairly conservative view based upon what we've seen over the last year or so. So for the core clients, the folks who've been with us for 3 or more years, what we have seen is they've gone from probably negative 2% or 3%, to the last quarter, they were probably -- it just broke the surface of the water, probably 0% to 1%. So we're assuming same-store sales are probably not going to be better than 1% for those core retailers. With tender share, we should be able to get to somewhere between about 4% -- 4% to 5% in terms of sales that will -- sales growth on our cards from those core. And so as you know, you go back half a dozen years or so, that 5% used to be closer to 8% or 9%. But it looks like factoring in same-store sales of about 1 point, we'll get tender share, of course, and so we're thinking 4% or 5% and then the rest will come from the big books of businesses that we've signed in '17, '16 and '15.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Got it. And then just a follow-up on capital allocation. Charles, you highlighted $1 billion of unencumbered free cash flow. How are you thinking about capital allocation priorities with your stock at its current price, let's say, balanced against potential acquisition and/or divestiture opportunities?</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: I'd say, David, we're going to be flexible on how we use that. I'd say, right now, M&amp;A is probably pretty low on the radar screen. We could use some for buyback. We could use some to pay down debt over the course of the year. Really, the focus Ed and I have is to make sure that all 3 of our segments are firing and back on track. And based upon those trends, we'll determine how we deploy that capital. So I'd say, conservatively, expect it can go to just pay down debt, delever a little bit. Even though we're in a very good shape now, it makes sense. We could do a modicum of buyback. Obviously, we have the dividend that's there as well. What I would say is just expect M&amp;A to be a relatively low priority at this point. Really, the focus, as I said, is to get all 3 of our segments back firing.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.</p><p>ANDREW WILLIAM JEFFREY, DIRECTOR, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Really nice to see Epsilon back in the mid- to high single-digit range. I'm wondering if you could provide just a little more color. Auto has been really strong. CRM is doing well. So I guess, a couple of questions. First, on auto, could you characterize how you think about the cyclicality of those -- of that end market versus sort of structural demand? And then within the CRM offering, are there any verticals, in particular, that you'd call out as being important drivers? And again, I'm just trying to get a sense for the sustainability of the growth in those 2 really important drivers of Epsilon.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, good questions. On the auto side, what's interesting is the bulk of the work that we do, both for the OEM and for the various dealerships, the thousands and thousands of dealerships, really is more after the sale is made. So it's much more in terms of service. So that doesn't have the type of variability you'll have with everything is driven off of sales, new car sales. So we're the folks who will sit there and, hopefully, use predictive analysis and more and more of the telematics, the data that comes out of the dashboard that basically will say, let you know through a text or an email or a big card in your mailbox that says, \"Hey, Andrew, it looks to me like you're about 1.5 weeks away from when it's time to get your oil changed. Come on over to the dealership and we'll give you a great deal.\" That's the type of stuff that we'll be doing. As more and more data comes from the telematics side of it, we'll be able to bug you all day long about your transmission level and all these other things that we'll be making sure you don't break down out there in California. So that's sort of it on the auto side. From the CRM side -- so the auto side shouldn't all be that cyclical. From the CRM side, look, the huge verticals, thus far, have been retail. Auto is certainly looking bigger. What else, Charles?</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: Financial.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes, financials, the banks for sure. There's a couple other verticals we're beginning to look at that hold promise. So we want to take the offering and move it from just sort of a retail-type offering to auto financial services. CPG looks promising. Those are the verticals we'd be focused on.</p><p>ANDREW WILLIAM JEFFREY: Okay. And just one quick one, if I may. In technology, to the extent you're winning more there and your win rates look better, are there -- are you -- are these competitive takeaways? Or are they buy versus build decisions that you're swaying?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: I would say it's less competitive takeaways. I think it's -- the market continues. It's a very -- it's a growing market, right, as you know. It's really -- comes down to the CMO needs to decide whether she wants to have the thing built in-house and have a big tech stack, meaning let's get a SaaS-based solution and surround it with 100 tech people or now that we can have a similar price point to that offering and do it ourselves, is it okay to give up controls of the guts of this thing and just have the results pour through into her shop so he or she can just have a bunch of analysts to look at the results? So that's -- the sandbox itself is getting bigger and bigger, so I would say the vast majority of it are more and more folks who are getting into the whole concept of, \"Hey, we can use this data in loyalty platforms to understand my customers and market to them.\" It's huge.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your last question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities.</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL SCHARF, MD AND SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: First question on the card side. Just a point of clarification. Ed, when I look at the components of your portfolio growth guidance this year, is the $1 billion subtraction for retailers that ultimately may become noncore, non-growing, is that just a guess and a cushion? Or are there specific programs you've identified?</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: Yes, I think it's a case. Think of it, David, we divested $800 million in December, so you know for the full year, in terms of average, that's going to be part of it. So basically, it means that there's another $200 million potential over the course of the year that we could look at and evaluate, either do a held-for-sale or could be a retailer that goes away. So said simply, the bulk of it was the divestiture we made at the end of December.</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL SCHARF: Okay. Got it. And the mid-teens, Charles, that's a year-over-year -- that's a 12/31 versus 12/31 guidance apples-to-apples, that's average.</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: Average '18 over average '17.</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL SCHARF: Got it. And then lastly, shifting to Epsilon, you noted the tightening labor market. Curious, you obviously took a lot of initiatives in recent years on the off-shoring side to address that. Do you feel like, based on the mix of skill sets that are needed, the composition of Epsilon as it exists today, is off-shoring as an option pretty much run its course? Or are there additional opportunities there?</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Yes. Again, we view it a little differently as from off-shoring. It's actually an office that we built over there. These are Alliance Data employees just like the folks here. So it's very much keeping it within the family-type approach. I would expect we're going to have 2,000 folks over there. And no, I don't think it's run its course in terms of the cost model itself. The proportion that -- of our associate base that's over there versus here is probably getting to be at the point where we find it's comfortable. And I don't think there'll be a huge shift, either way, going forward. But in terms of the benefits on working across, both India and here in the states, we're just beginning to see that. So I would expect, while there's a nice chunk that we've picked up thus far, there's probably another chunk to go.</p><p>DAVID MICHAEL SCHARF: Okay. That's helpful. And just last question quickly on the AIR MILES business. You've noted, obviously, for several quarters the challenges in issuance growth associated with the grocery segment. Is there something structural that's changed among a number of the large sponsors in terms of how much they're willing to spend on promotional activities? Or did you feel like 2017 may have just been a breather on their part as they assess maybe the fallout from the expiry events? Trying to get a sense for visibility there.</p><p>CHARLES L. HORN: Yes. I think, David, it's hangover from what took place in the fourth quarter of '16 around the expiry. I think that's really what it was. Obviously, we had a number of things come on this year. We need to get Bank of Montr\u00c3\u00a9al renewed, which we did around the third quarter; that should help. And I do think in the grocery vertical, we just need to get them back satisfied, get the consumers back in their stores and that, by itself, will lead to getting promotional activity back. But I would attribute it to purely hangover from the Q4 '16 event.</p><p><person><nameText>EDWARD J. HEFFERNAN</nameText></person>: Okay. Thanks, everyone.

Welcome to Bank Hapoalim Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Results Conference Call. For your convenience, this call will be accompanied by a PowerPoint presentation. May we suggest, if you have not yet done so, that you access the presentation on the bank's website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bankhapoalim.com\">www.bankhapoalim.com</url>, by clicking on the Financial Information on the homepage and then click on the Annual Report presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, March 19, 2020.</p><p>With us on the line today are Mr. Oded Eran, Chairman of the Board of Directors; Mr. Dov Kotler, CEO of Bank Hapoalim; Mr. Ram Gev, Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Ofer Levy, Chief Accountant; and Ms. Karen Mazor, Head of Investor Relations. I would like to remind everyone that forward-looking statements for the respected company's business, financial condition and the results of its operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, product demand, pricing, market acceptance, changing economic conditions, risks in product and technology development, the effect of the company's accounting policies as well as certain other risk factors, which are detailed from time to time in the company's filings with various securities authorities.</p><p>Mr. Chairman, would you like to begin?</p><p>ODED ERAN, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, BANK HAPOALIM B.M.: Thank you very much. Hello, everyone, and welcome. This morning, we published our annual financial reports when in the background, there is an outburst of global epidemic that might lead the world into a crisis. At this time, the resilience of the financial sector and the ability to cope with extreme scenarios are critical more than ever.</p><p>Bank Hapoalim entered this complex time, strong and stable. We understand the importance of our leadership in these days of uncertainty, and we are working through this dynamic crisis, putting our customer stability and wellbeing first in our minds and actions. Yesterday, we informed the public that our negotiations with the U.S. authorities are moving forward, hopefully, near the end of the investigations. As a result, at the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded a provision of $259 million. These reserves add to our previous reserve of $611 million. The upcoming conclusion of the investigations will allow us to put this behind us and focus on our future challenges and strategy.</p><p>It seems like the current crisis has been with us for years. But the truth is that less than a month ago, our attention was focused mainly on the challenge of adapting our banking system to the future of banking and preparing towards the competition rising from the global big tech companies. In the previous year, we invested great resources at this important mission and worked hard in order to adapt our bank to the new era, implementing more agile fast lean procedures, developing and enhancing our digital products and services. I am pleased to say that we are able to obtain great achievements in this front.</p><p>Before I hand over the call, I would like to note that this is the first annual financial report of our new CEO, Dov Kotler, who began his term less than 6 months ago and smoothly took over this complex low-fascinating leadership role. Though we are very happy for you to be here with us today, I want to thank you for all your impressive achievements thus far and wish you the best of luck with the upcoming challenges we are going to face in the future. Also, we have a new CFO, Ram Gev. Ram was the CFO of Isracard during the past year. And we are lucky enough to have him on board. Thank you, Ram. I want to thank our stakeholders, investors, employees, regulators and the public, and most notably our customers for putting their trust in Bank Hapoalim. I have no doubt that with the strong leadership of Dov, the support and guidance of the Board of Directors, the professional execution of the management team and with our dedicated employees, we'll be able to confront and course any challenge and cross any challenge we'll face in the future and continue to be the leading financial institution in Israel.</p><p>With that said, I want to thank you all for your attention and pass on the call to Dov. Dov?</p><p>DOV KOTLER, CEO &amp; MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT, BANK HAPOALIM B.M.: Thank you, Oded, and good afternoon, everyone. I understand that we have guests all over the world, especially competitors. So also welcome to our competitors that are listening to this call. Thank you very much. I am pleased to join us -- to join you on this call, which is my first as a CEO of Bank Hapoalim. I would like to start by taking the opportunity to thank the Board of Directors as well as Oded, our Chairman, for the trust in appointing me as the CEO of the bank. This is also an opportunity to thank Arik Pinto, my predecessor, for his 40 years of service and contribution to Bank Hapoalim.</p><p>This is not an ordinary analyst call. We are publishing our annual results only weeks into the beginning of a global pandemic that is quickly becoming a global financial crisis, with significant economic and social turmoil. The initial effect of corona already reflected in our results for the first quarter, but it is difficult to assess the full magnitude of this crisis and it's still unfolding.</p><p>A previous draft of my comments prepared only a couple of weeks ago highlight the strong results of our core business, and I would emphasize. We succeeded in our work on improving our retail credit portfolio cutting retail provision and focusing in highly quality credit. We've also increased the size of our mortgage portfolio by more than 10%. Our corporate and commercial credit portfolio continued its solid responsible growth, while diversifying our risk assets.</p><p>The new economic situation is creating significant dislocation in the global and Israeli economy. We are already seeing its impact in our financial statement as stated in the immediate report that we published today on the matter. First and foremost, we are here to service and support our customers in good times as well as in difficult times. I can assure you, we can -- we have the resources and determination to fulfill our promise in a responsible manner.</p><p>In recent weeks, we have offered tailored deposits product, deferred mortgage payments and awarding government secured loans program for small business and increase the use of ways to deliver financial product for our customers who cannot reach our branch as well as other initiatives. It goes without saying that the global economy is undergoing a major dislocation, yet allow me to quote Major Kilgore in the movie Apocalypse Now. \"Someday, this war is going to end. Life will go on.\" Please remember this quotation. Pandemic as well as financial cases are tough, but they come and go. I am entirely dedicated to lift the bank through the crisis, and I'm confident of the bank abilities. My job, as a business leader, is constantly to build a better, more efficient, more resilient and a more profitable bank.</p><p>On a personal note, as Oded mentioned, I am completing my first 6 months in my office as CEO of the bank. Upon taking the role of the CEO, I set a few objectives to ensure long-term sustainable growth of the bank. I am glad to report that we have acted decisively to achieve these objectives. We made the necessary required organizational changes, we built a new HR division, we merged our innovation, strategic and bizdevs to one division, and tightened our management by the team -- by reducing it by 20% to become a more efficient management.</p><p>We worked on regaining the confidence of our employees union and signed a new collective wages agreement. The new agreement is fair, while increasing the flexibility in areas such as technology and professional services. We continued our pursuit of becoming more efficient and announced a new efficiency plan for 2020 up to 2022, trying to reduce 900 jobs positions. We complied with the regulator requirement and completed our separation from Isracard. We rationalized our international activity, maintaining our focus in the U.S. middle market and finalizing the closing down most of our other subsidiaries.</p><p>Finally, as reported yesterday and by Oded, we invested immense effort in advancing the American tax investigation towards conclusion and reaching resolution with the United States authorities.</p><p>Preparing for the future, our Board of Directors approved a strategic plan for the next 3 years. We perceived the bank's success in continuing digitization, while keeping a position of leadership in lending. We are well positioning and maintained the responsibility growth of our portfolio, taking an advantage of particular pockets of growth, like mortgage, et cetera.</p><p>I wish to conclude my comments by saying that I wake up every day with a strong sense of privilege by leading the exceptional financial institution that, by the way, next year, we'll celebrate 100 years, amazing. I am certain of the energies and capabilities of the bank to adversity in the situation. I want to thank our dedicated employees whose efforts and professionalism make this bank a pillar, an important one, in the Israeli economy. Our people and dedication and commitment during the difficult times are notable.</p><p>I will now pass to Ram Gev, our new CFO, to discuss our financial results. Thank you very much. Ram, the floor is yours.</p><p>RAM GEV, CFO &amp; MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT BOARD, BANK HAPOALIM B.M.: Okay. Thank you, Dov. And good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will accompany the presentation that can be accessed on our website. So let me start with Slide 3. I would like to begin by addressing the financial aspects of the initiatives related by Dov in his comments. The successful signing of a new collective wage agreement in January had an impact on the fourth quarter of onetime expense in the amount of to NIS 210 million. As you all know, the collective agreement was announced in parallel with a new 3-year efficiency plan, whereby 900 employees will leave the bank in 2020 till 2022 on the basis of voluntary retirement. I'm reminding you that this efficiency plan is our fifth in a row. It reflects our determination to reduce costs to the most competitive levels. The net effect of the plan on shareholders' equity was NIS 352 million as of the end of 2019.</p><p>The completion of the separation from Isracard in the form of distribution of dividend in kind fulfilled also our obligation under the soon performed. As we already announced, the distribution will adversely impact the results of this first quarter of 2020 by about NIS 109 million, mostly due to market-wise fluctuations. Nevertheless, the full transaction of the sale was profitable one. We recorded a profit from the sale offering of the lion's share of the company.</p><p>Yesterday's announcement regarding the U.S. tax investigation was of great importance to us. We are moving towards leaving the bank from a significant burden in resources and management attention. The negotiated resolution called for the bank to pay $870 million. This required us to provision an additional $259 million in the last quarter, which is approximately NIS 900 million. I'd like to remind you that the negotiated resolutions are subject to reaching agreed upon final terms as well as receiving the necessary approval at each of the U.S. authorities.</p><p>In my perspective, one of the most important takeaways from this is that we now have more attention towards cultivating the bank's core. We can dedicate the necessary resources and attention towards steering the bank through the challenges at hand with focus on the recent economic disruption of the coronavirus. As with any evolving event, where uncertainty of its duration and magnitude is great, my experience is that the entry point of an organization into the situation is of paramount importance. And Bank Hapoalim is a strong financial institution, and our starting point is one of strength and resilience.</p><p>We are well capitalized with strong liquidity parameters and hold a portfolio of assets, which have been considerably derisked in recent years. Because of our reporting date of today, we are able to take into account the most current information about the evolving events, while making our estimates of their effects on our loan portfolio and give our shareholders a transparent picture. As a result, we recorded in our statement today, a top-up to the ongoing provision for credit losses that affected net profit by NIS 450 million.</p><p>Looking ahead, because of the great deal of uncertainty in both, it is difficult to determine the full future effects. Naturally, there is a correlation between the length of the event and the potential impact on the economy. The sum of all the development, I just mentioned, significantly impacted the bank's ROE and profit for 2019 as indicated in Slide 4.</p><p>With that said, let's move ahead and look at how we grew our business fundamentals in 2019. I'm happy to report on our responsible business growth in 2019. We were able to grow our main business line, maintain NIM and make further steps in reducing the risk parameters of our retail loan book. We remained focus on our cost base, driving efficiency and maintained a robust capital base, ending the reported period with a CET1 of 11.53%.</p><p>As you can see on Slide 6, in 2019, the bank continued to lead the domestic banking system with the largest credit portfolio in Israel, presenting a 3.7% growth, this while ensuring its diversification and differentiated risk parameters. Next slide outlines the responsible growth in commercial and corporate credit, in line with the bank's risk appetite. The 3.3% growth in income reflects the lower risk profile of the loan book in these segments.</p><p>Looking at consumer lending and small business on the next slide, the bank continued to focus on improving the credit quality and reducing the risk profile of both these segments, as we have been doing in the past 2 years. While these efforts have affected growth, the improved underwriting and risk evaluation processes have been contributing to the overall reduction in credit losses in this segment, which declined by 52% and 24%, respectively, allowing us to increase net income in these segments. And retrospectively, this way, it better positions our portfolio for these events.</p><p>Finally, looking at housing loans on Slide 9. In 2019, Bank Hapoalim grew its mortgage portfolio by over 10%, all the while, maintaining our rigid loan parameters. The majority of our portfolio consists of Bank Hapoalim customers, and it's characterized by relatively higher income populations and low-risk indicators. I would like to also point out that the Israeli mortgage market is conservative in nature and highly regulated.</p><p>Moving to Slide #10. The bank is also well positioned in the area of deposits. 65% of deposits at the bank are retail deposits with strong stickiness. This important financing source grew by 2.3% in 2019.</p><p>Now let's look at our financing activity for the quarter on Slide 11. Total financing profit came close to NIS 10 billion, which reflects the overall growth in the bank business activity and strong financing spread of certain segments.</p><p>Moving to Slide 12, I already said to the adverse effect of the coronavirus on the bank results that are also reflected in the increase in problematic debt. Bear in mind, balances recorded for 2019 includes the virus effect up-to-date of publication of our financial statements.</p><p>The same is reflected in the NPL ratio. As you can see on Slide 13, noting that the bank is still tracking at relatively low levels compared with historical benchmark. Likewise, credit losses on the next slide, Slide 14, reflect the impact of the provision made in respect of a number of borrowers related to sectors that have so far been affected by the coronavirus or its derivatives in the various markets.</p><p>In the next couple of slides, I would like to cover key aspects of our efficiency program, which remains an important strategic focus for Bank Hapoalim in 2019. You will note on Slide 15 that the bank continues to reduce headcount with an additional decrease of over 460 positions this year, marking an impressive 27% decline in headcount since 2012. Looking forward, the bank will continue to reduce headcount in line with its recently announced efficiency program, whereby over 900 employees will voluntarily retire in the next 3 years.</p><p>Moving on to operating expenses on Slide 16. Overall expenses this year were primarily influenced by the material update of the provision in respect of the investigations of the U.S. authorities. They also include significant legal and other costs associated with the investigations. Onetime costs resulting from the new wage agreement and costs associated with the closure of the bank's private banking activities in Switzerland. The majority of these costs will not be accompanying us in 2020. Looking at our cost profile indicate that the bank has been able to restrain expenses, most of all of which is the continued reduction in wage costs.</p><p>Moving on to our capital base, following the material effect I mentioned on our fourth quarter, the bank recorded a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 11.53%, higher than both its regulatory and internal threshold, a strong asset to have during these times.</p><p>I would like to leave you with a few concluding remarks. Today's results demonstrates the Bank Hapoalim is a strong financial institution, managed with great responsibility and experience. This crisis, too, will end. And I am certain Bank Hapoalim will weather the storm.</p><p>Before we take your questions, I want to emphasize that this event is changing all our daily lives. We are personally affected, our families are affected. The way we do things are affected, our social lives are affected. We no longer -- if you think about it, we no longer open doors the same way we did. But what we can safely say is that as it's related to cooperate and economy, scale, scope and a healthy business fundamentals matters.</p><p>I conclude on a personal note, the most important thing at this moment is the safety and health of yourself and your loved ones. Stay safe and healthy. We are all together in that.</p><p>With that said, let me open the call for any questions you may have.</p><p>Operator?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) First question is from Tavy Rosner, Barclays.</p><p>CHRIS REIMER, ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Chris Reimer, on for Tavy. With regards to dividends, you put the distribution on hold due to the investigations. Can we assume that once the authorities sign off on the settlement, you will resume dividend distribution? Or Maybe due to the corona situation, the Bank of Israel may ask that you hold off for the time being?</p><p>DOV KOTLER: We assume that Bank of Israel will release the ability to give dividend after signing the agreement with the authorities, but my belief is that as the CEO -- as a responsible CEO, it's too early to consider additional dividend until we'll understand the full implication of the corona. And this will be my recommendation at this stage.</p><p>CHRIS REIMER: Okay. And can you give us some color on the traction you're seeing for the Bit application? And what's the business model for that down the road?</p><p>DOV KOTLER: Bit application is growing too fast because of the corona and the mid -- while you are in your houses growing fast. We are concentrating in having the largest market share in the Israeli market. There is a business model going forward. But at this stage, we're focused on our market share.</p><p>I assume that competitors are listening to me, so I'm giving a short answer, with your permission.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question is by Joseph Dickerson of Jefferies.</p><p>JOSEPH DICKERSON, HEAD OF EUROPEAN BANKS RESEARCH &amp; EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Can you just discuss on the -- so the credit charge, so probably that is NIS 450 million for coronavirus. The credit charge is still NIS 150 million to NIS 200 million higher than what we were thinking for the quarter. Were there any specific provisions on the corporate side? Apologies if you may have mentioned this earlier. I had a few issues dialing in, but that would be helpful, any color.</p><p>DOV KOTLER: I will try, but Joe, if I understood correctly your question, you are focused on the NIS 450 million allowance for the corona, specifically. Did I understood correctly?</p><p>JOSEPH DICKERSON: No. If I look at the total impairment charge, and I back out the NIS 450 million for the coronavirus, the number was still a couple hundred million higher than I might have thought. So I was wondering if there was something on the corporate side that was specific in the quarter around any given names?</p><p>RAM GEV: I'll take that question. Thank you, Joe. You have to take into consideration that the NIS 450 million is the net effect. Before tax, it's about NIS 680 million. So if you take our overall credit losses expenses for 2019 and deduct from it the NIS 680 million, you will be around NIS 600 million. That is very similar to what we had in 2018. So if you look at our statement overall...</p><p>JOSEPH DICKERSON: That clears it up for me. So I didn't appreciate it was an after-tax number. So that clears it up for me. I understand now.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question is by Micha Goldberg of Excellence.</p><p>MICHA M. GOLDBERG, HEAD OF RESEARCH &amp; BANKING ANALYST, EXCELLENCE NESSUAH BROKERAGE SERVICES LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: First of all, congratulations on standardizing on the U.S. investigation. And I guess, the whole 2019 wrap up, an exception at that time, but congratulations anyhow. A couple of questions, if I may. First of all, could you try and maybe detail for us a little bit what you view to be the most exposed segments and sectors in the current economy that could suffer from the ongoing current coronavirus impact?</p><p>DOV KOTLER: Micha, frankly, I will try to answer this question from a different angle totally. In my position, I am more focused and worried about my business continuity to service the customer base, thereby we are trying to support our employees with all the rules and regulation, so we can keep them safe. Mainly the technology division should be working in full power. And if I would rank my highest role is the technology ability to service. And so far, I'm pleased to say that this is being handled properly, and we're ready for the next stage of the quarantine, if it will be imposed on the Israeli market. So this is -- on contrary to what you are asking is my main trouble, and I am glad to said that it's being handled properly. By the way, we have reduced, as of yesterday, our staff substantially and we still maintain a nice level of service to the customer base.</p><p>Going back to your question, as we said in our report this morning, it's too soon to analyze all the industries in the Israeli market. This quick pace between the adoption of this virus and our -- and today, which are a few days, we focus our efforts in 3 industries, as we publish; energy, transportation and hotels and tourism. And in those fields, we go to the conclusion that we have to have additional allowance of net NIS 450 million, which is about NIS 600 million or so growth. And this is what has been accomplished in the last few days. Don't forget that we are the third bank that have already put in the books allowance before any other banks so far. Going forward, I believe that between today and the next quarter that we will publish, either sometime during May, we will have much more accurate tools to assess the risk, specifically in each industry or in the level of customers specifically, but it's too early to assess it a bit today, and this is the reason we've published the immediate report this morning.</p><p>MICHA M. GOLDBERG: Okay. Thank you very much. First of all, very much comforting that you are definitely caring importantly about the business to continue and the support IT and -- in certainly a country that's pretty down. Just on the 3 segments -- sectors that you mentioned, energy, transportation and tourism, is there any way you guys can give us an indication with -- the size of the exposure there is?</p><p>DOV KOTLER: Unfortunately, Micha, this is a very legitimate question, and I would like -- I would love to answer you personally, but we are strictly but we are strictly with the answer that we are not able to expose such specific numbers, either on a specific borrower or on a specific industry at this stage.</p><p>MICHA M. GOLDBERG: Okay, okay. I appreciate it. Another question. You mentioned just now that you already have been reducing your staff and just remain -- I think, it's supposed to be down to 70% out of the office, I think. Does that mean they're on lease without payment? Or is that -- how does that work? And how does that impact both your services to the public and all European offices?</p><p>DOV KOTLER: At this stage, let's say that it's -- I believe it's 35% of the workforce. They are being paid out of the relief allowance. It's not -- it's under their expense than the bank expense. But going forward, we'll have to rent a different arrangement with the employees, it cannot work on a long-term basis. So far, the understanding of the bank management for the next few weeks, and then we will assess the situation.</p><p>MICHA M. GOLDBERG: Okay. Thank you very much for that.</p><p>DOV KOTLER: How is everything in Dutch, in Berlin, in Amsterdam, in Ireland?</p><p>MICHA M. GOLDBERG: I think things seems to be a little more relaxed in Israel, but since I'm in Israel.</p><p>DOV KOTLER: Let me assure, you, Micha, that my son is working in Amsterdam for a bank, a small bank by the name of ING, it's not a small, it's a huge bank. And everyone there is at home, working out of the office. They don't -- they are not in the offices for a few weeks, for 10 days already. So it's similar to us.</p><p>MICHA M. GOLDBERG: Yes, I think we're doing okay. Thank you very much for comforting us all.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)</p><p>DOV KOTLER: The time are very intensive times, so everyone is focusing in other matter. So I would like to thank everyone for attending the meeting. And I want to wish best of luck to our competitors again. And hopefully, everyone is in good health. Best of luck to everyone. Thank you, guys.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes the Bank Hapoalim Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Results Conference Call.

They will be answered by the IR team after the conference is finished.</p><p>Before proceeding, let me mention that forward statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Cielo management and on information currently available to the company. They involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to future events and therefore, depend on circumstances that may or may not occur. Investors and analysts should understand that conditions related to macroeconomic conditions, industry and other factors could also cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements.</p><p>Now I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Paulo Caffarelli. Mr. Paulo, you may begin your presentation.</p><p>PAULO ROG\u00e9RIO CAFFARELLI, CEO, CIELO S.A.: Thank you. Thank you all of you for taking part of this conference. I think that my main message for the investor, for the analyst is Cielo is back on the game. We can emphasize this by: the first thing is we gained market share on the first and second quarter '19. These didn't happen since the first and the second quarter in 2014, almost 5 years. The second thing is related to the volume. We grew 12.6% year-over-year. For us, it's very important. It means in Brazil, almost 10% of the Brazilian GDP.</p><p>The other thing is, we reached at the end of the December, 1.6 million in terms of customer. This didn't happen in Cielo since March '17. It's very important for us to maintain a consolidated base in our portfolio because we have the -- all the products and services for providing these kind of customer.</p><p>The first thing is we have sold 1.3 POS in Brazil -- 1.3 million POS in Brazil. This is important because since 2018 Cielo didn't sell POS. We started to do this in the end of 2018. And now we have these good emphasize, this could reinforce our basic customers. The first thing is relating to the SMEs, Entrepreneurs, that we have a growing -- SMEs and Entrepreneurs, we have growing faster than Large Accounts since last June. For us, it's very important when we analyze our portfolio, our mix portfolio, it's very important that you can increase more SMEs and Entrepreneurs than Large Accounts because Large Accounts can bring us volume, it can bring us data. But in fact, the name of the game nowadays in Brazil is SMEs, we need to focus on SMEs and try to increase our participation in this segment.</p><p>We defined 2019 for the year of customer relationship, the score interfering our results in the customer satisfaction. In this case, we defined that NPS will interfere 30% in terms of participation in the variable compensation for the total of employees in Cielo. It's very important because up to this figure used to be just 40%, just 5% in terms of participation. We are doing a very hard work in terms of call center to develop our call center, try to establish a new kind of commitment, and we can improve the decisions and definitions for to be more -- to provide more support to our customers.</p><p>In terms of customer satisfaction, yet, we defined that we need to be much more effective in terms of to provide equipment to establish the maintenance and other things. The most complex product portfolio we have in Cielo, this is very important because, I think, that we are the only acquirer in Brazil that has a lot of the products in terms of from entrepreneurs to big companies.</p><p>Another thing is relating to the e-commerce. We are nowadays, the leadership of this market in Brazil, more than 50% in terms of market share. This is important because it's another kind of business that we have. We don't -- are just -- we don't have -- we don't focus on just on POS, but we are looking for another kind of development from equipment and solutions that we can provide to our customers, like QR code, like links, et cetera.</p><p>The other thing is, I can reinforce to you that Cielo is already in all the segments in acquired Brazilian market. In this case, we are working hard from entrepreneurs to big companies in Brazil.</p><p>And now, as I told you before, we tend to be more emphasizing, more present in terms of Retail. We have developed it in 2019. 17 new kind of strategic partnership with a lot of big companies in Brazil, and then can bring it to Cielo other kind of opportunities to be involved in terms of business related to the payments, but other kind of business.</p><p>We defined 3 kind of business units in Brazil. In our company, Large Accounts, Retail, SME and Entrepreneurs. It's important because each kind of this segment, we need to focus on in a different kind of strategy. I think that we did the right job in this case, because in 2020, we can see the first results among these segments.</p><p>Another thing important is related to ZBB, we defined 1 range to be involved in ZBB in Cielo, then you can reach in this year, almost BRL 300 million. It means more than 10% of our total budget that you can interfere in terms of to cut expenses.</p><p>And related to hunters, we have 1,000 hunters nowadays working out of our offices, and this is important because even we have the banking channels. Back to Brazil, Bradesco, Caixa, we can be much more involved in terms of to our own channel when we decide to have these 1,000 hunters. For us, it's very important because concomitant with the business developed in the channels, we can be involved with hunters, with farmers. And these segment needs to improve much more in Cielo because it's important to establish our balance relating to the banks and relating to our own channels.</p><p>The other thing that we need to follow this year. And for us, it's very important, is increase our participation in terms of prepayment. Nowadays, our penetration is 22%. And when you analyze and compare this with another competitors, I think that we can reach this much more because a lot of them has more than a half in terms of penetration in terms of prepayment. We have a very large room for to be involved in these prepayment. At the end of the day, MDR, rental and prepayment work together in terms of price. In this case, our main challenge today, this year, is to develop prepayment in Cielo.</p><p>Now I ask Gustavo do the presentation. After that, we can come back to the Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA, EXECUTIVE VP OF FINANCE &amp; IR OFFICER, CIELO S.A.: Thank you, Caffarelli. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting our presentation on Slide 4. We have a snapshot of our operating results. So we have a financial volume in the fourth quarter of BRL 190 billion and that's a 12.6% increase year-on-year and 10.7% increase quarter-over-quarter.</p><p>Our client base achieved 1.6 million clients that's say, roughly 18% growth in the year. Our credit volume paid in 2 days totaled BRL 21.5 billion in the quarter. Our net revenues totaled BRL 2.9 billion and our net income totaled BRL 242 million.</p><p>On Slide 5, we see the evolution of a few metrics, financial volume reaching BRL 190 billion, a 12.6% growth year-on-year. Our client base with a close to 18% growth, totaling 1.6 million clients at the end of the year. And also, our credit volume paid in 2 days totaling BRL 21.5 billion in the quarter, which is an 18.8% growth year-on-year.</p><p>On Slide 6, we have a look at some highlights of our income statement. Our net revenues totaling BRL 2.9 billion, and that's a 1.2% contraction year-on-year. Our EBITDA margin of 22.9% and that's 13.5 percentage points decrease year-on-year. And a net income of BRL 242 million and that's a 68% decrease year-on-year.</p><p>On Slide 7, we see our revenue yield, which is the most important component in the explanation of net income contraction. The price change is the main contributor for the revenue yield compression over the quarters. In this slide specifically, we have a comparison of the revenue yield of the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and also versus the fourth quarter of the previous year. We can see in both graphs that the price change was the main contributor for the decrease in revenue yield, and I'll talk about this in the upcoming slides with a little more detail.</p><p>On Slide 8, we show the 3 sections that we will approach as highlights of our 2019 performance. The recovery of our presence in SMBs also highlights on customer experience related to improvement in quality of service and also brand recognition.</p><p>Moving to Slide 9. What we see in this graph is the evolution of revenue yield for Cielo's portfolio. We see that since the first quarter of 2018, we have seen decreases of revenue yield quarter after quarter. I know we have talked a lot about this in our meetings with analysts and with investors. In the second quarter of 2019, this was the most pronounced drop of prices that we saw in our market in Cielo followed that. But after that, we continue to see a pressure in terms of prices. Another important information that we have in this slide and now relating to Cielo's Retail portfolio to Cielo's SMB portfolio is the fact that now 75% of our Retail portfolio has been repriced.</p><p>Moving to Slide 10. We have some comments on our new sales model. We hired 1,000 new employees categorized as hunters, as employees that have the sole job to pursue new clients. And we see in this slide how quarter after quarter, the work of the hunters has evolved. From the first quarter, we see an immediate contribution in terms of an addition of clients of new accounts that were brought in for Cielo. Starting on the second quarter, we started to change to adapt this model prioritizing the size of the client, the volume that the client brings to Cielo and not prioritizing the actual amount of clients that are brought for Cielo. As a result of that, we see that over the quarters, the contribution of the hunters to the total volume of the Retail portfolio of the SMBs portfolio has increased. We finalized the fourth quarter with 12% of the SMB portfolio that was brought in by this work of the hunters.</p><p>On Page 11, we see that as a combination of more competitive prices and the work of this new sales model, we have now a continuation of a trend that started in June of this year, which is the fact that the segments of SMBs and Entrepreneurs have outpaced the growth of Large Accounts inside Cielo.</p><p>Now moving to customer experience, on Slide 12. In the last year, we presented significant improvement in client services. This happened mainly due to improvement in systems and processes related to chronic problems. Additionally, and we have talked about this, I believe in the last call, we implemented a new call center model with incentives for the call center operators to prioritize client satisfaction and first call resolution. Their compensation is tied very heavily to these 2 specific metrics. As a result of all of that, we showed an 87% decrease in the time it takes to solve complaints that are raised by clients. We saw a 53% decrease in the number of calls in the call center. We saw a 16% decrease in the number of complaints in the call center, and we also saw a 60% decrease in the number of calls due to technical problems.</p><p>Moving to Slide 13. We have a highlight in terms of brand recognition. Cielo has traditionally been the top player, the Top of Mind player in its segment, and throughout the -- over the fourth quarter, we also reached the #1 position in terms of Internet searches on Google.</p><p>And finally, moving on to Slide 14, I'll talk briefly about 2020. We can see in this slide a pyramid of the client segmentation inside Cielo. In the Large Account segment, that we see intense competition with very narrow margins. We have adequate pricing for this segment, and we will not pursue clients at any cost. And when we look at the bottom of the pyramid, the Entrepreneur segment, we see that there has been an escalation in competition, mainly seen in the increase of equipment subsidies. For 2020, we won't add to this increase of subsidies. We will look at subsidies within certain limits for Cielo.</p><p>Our priority for the year will be the absolute focus on SMBs. We already have competitive prices as we have seen in the previous slides. We have competitive products for prepayments. We have a robust sales model, and we have shown improvements in terms of quality of service.</p><p>With that, I finalize the presentation and open the Q&amp;A session. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mario Pierry, Bank of America.</p><p>MARIO LUCIO PIERRY, MD, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: I have 2 questions. The first one is related to the outlook for prices. You show whether your revenue yield has been under pressure. You talked about the competitive environments remaining intense. However, considering the rebates that you've renegotiated with the banks, considering that your volume mix is improving as you're focusing on SMEs rather than large corporates. Is it fair to assume that your average revenue yields next -- in 2020 should be similar or higher than in 2019? That's my first question.</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: Thank you for the first question. I'll be very brief in terms of comments about the future. Because this comment has embedded in it a view in terms of price and the competitive landscape. So what I'm referring to now is our view of a continuation of pricing pressure. So even with the items that you mentioned, I don't see, to the best of our knowledge to -- from what we have seen in terms of prices at the end of the year, and now in the beginning of the year, a slowdown in terms of price competition. So we are likely to keep seeing a pressure on margins and also a pressure in revenue yields, even with other items that may offset that. But that being said, we're still concerned about price and revenue yield compression.</p><p>MARIO LUCIO PIERRY: Okay. That's helpful. Second question is related to volumes in 2020, given your focus then on SMEs and less focus on large corporates, is it fair to assume that you should lose market share in 2020, when we look at overall volumes?</p><p>PAULO ROG\u00e9RIO CAFFARELLI: Mario, that's Caffarelli here. In fact, when you decide to migrate from big companies to SMEs, our intention is to improve our margin. In this case, we want to accept any kind of offering from the big companies related to the price. In this case, perhaps we again lost a part of the market share in this situation.</p><p>MARIO LUCIO PIERRY: Okay. And just a follow-up on that question then Caffarelli, right, you show in your presentation that you're able to grow volumes again that you're growing your client base. But at the same time, right, you're sacrificing your profitability, your return on invested capital is down to 6.6%. Your ROE is down to 16.7%. So I was just wondering, how do you look at profitability? What do you think is the appropriate level of returns for this business?</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: Mario, that's -- Gustavo here. That's a very tough question because we look at all of the metrics that you mentioned, ROE, EBITDA margin, revenue, yield and all of that. Our concern in terms of prices is based on first, a continuation of this trend of price pressure, that's what we see day after day. And also, when you look at our industry, which over the past year has been characterized with a reduction of barriers of entry and also a reduction in IT costs, processing costs, there's still room for new players to join this industry, which will put pressure in terms of margins. And we're not talking about pure acquiring players, we are talking about fintech companies, they may want to enter the acquiring arena to create a digital bank. We may be talking about big retailers and big tech companies. So that being said, even though we traditionally look at the main financial indicators, it's hard to establish where is a hurdle for, where the competition pressure will take those indicators to.</p><p>PAULO ROG\u00e9RIO CAFFARELLI: And Mario, if I may add something. When you're talking about the SMBs, actually, we decided last year to reduce pricing in order not to lose market share. In one of the most, if not the most profitable business, which is SMB. So the price went down, but we think continue to have a kind of 30% share in the SMB business. Making that aware that it's not a stable picture, it's a very aggressive and competitive landscape. So sometimes, we have to put a little bit pressure on pricing, which was the case in SMB not to lose market share in a business where the profitability is the highest. And then in the future, you compensate by higher gains.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Julie Chariell, Bloomberg Intelligence.</p><p>JULIE CHARIELL, SENIOR ANALYST, BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE: I have a couple. First, I wanted to ask about the new contract with the controlling shareholder banks. And I guess, just fundamentally, I want to understand the changes in this contract compared to your prior relationship. What are the banks going to be providing to Cielo now that they hadn't in the past? Or is this more just a change in the financial relationship?</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: Thanks for your question, Julie. In terms of the rationale for the contract and in terms of the services rendered by the banks, it's a similar nature of services, which has to do with the indication, intermediation, maintenance and the relationship with the clients that have their account with those banks. So it's not only introducing new clients, but also maintaining the client base that has accounts with those banks. So in terms of the basic components, those are the ones that are included in the new version on the contract and also in other versions, older versions of the contract.</p><p>In terms of the economics, in the new contract, we announced that we will pay 10 basis points on a volume that has a qualification. There's eligibility criteria for the -- this volume to drive this payment to be eligible for this payment. One important criteria is a minimum profitability metric that is embedded in this contract. This is one of the differing aspects to the old contract. In the old contract, there was a given fee that was paid in total volume of accounts with those banks without this qualifying minimal profitability metric.</p><p>PAULO ROG\u00e9RIO CAFFARELLI: Julie, if I may add. It's important this time because the most important thing in this negotiation is to adopt this kind of contract. In our current time in Brazil in terms of acquirers because when we compare this moment now and when we compare this 10 basis points, it's completed this different that's used to be the best, it's not the same reality that we are facing nowadays. In this case, it's very important for us to adapt to this. And I can assure to you that we are in most best conditions that when used to be before.</p><p>JULIE CHARIELL: I see. So there's -- they're -- it's not going to be a fee that Cielo has to pay for clients who are just not sufficiently profitable for Cielo?</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: That is a fact in this contract, there is a minimum profitability level.</p><p>JULIE CHARIELL: And do you see that the banks, in this case, becoming a source for credit business for lending for Cielo, maybe for some of the smaller clients who the banks wouldn't take on?</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: That's an important question. So I may be long-winded here. So -- and I'm sorry, if I talk about some things that you haven't asked, okay, but I had to paint the full picture here. So competition in the acquiring industry is open competition, where in terms of prepayment products, the acquirers compete with the banks. So this is an open arena. So whether we are seeking a client that has an account with these 2 banks that are controlling shareholders or with other banks, any bank and any acquirer can try to offer credit or a prepayment solution to that client. So this is how this industry is established in Brazil. Even though we have this agreement with the banks, we compete with them in terms of prepayment products. We currently don't have a fully launched credit product. We did run a pilot of a credit product in 2019, and we are likely to fully implement it in 2020, but always competing with any bank with the 2 controlling shareholders and with any other bank in the system.</p><p>PAULO ROG\u00e9RIO CAFFARELLI: So actually, it's a total competition, it's not a pick and choose a way to be dealing with the customers.</p><p>JULIE CHARIELL: I see, I see. So you'll continue building your credit business off of that pilot presumably over the course of this year, but this particular contract has nothing to do with that. It's just part of the ongoing competition.</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: That's right. This contract does not interfere in any sense in terms of our effort to expand prepayment penetration in our client base. And even if we decide to fully implement this pilot of a credit product that we have done in 2019. It also is an independent decision in terms of its relationship with this contract.</p><p>PAULO ROG\u00e9RIO CAFFARELLI: Even though Bradesco and Banco do Brasil are controlling shareholders, they are basically a channel for us and we don't have any type of limitation to be acting with the customers. Even if they are from Bradesco, Banco do Brasil, it's totally open.</p><p>JULIE CHARIELL: Okay. Great. Is there sort of a natural segmentation that goes on here though, where smaller clients, SMB clients may be more likely clients for Cielo given your knowledge of their accounts on the acquiring side where as the Larger Accounts maybe more likely targets for the banks. Is there a natural segmentation?</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: I wouldn't say that there is a natural segmentation, but there is a difference in terms of level of penetration because of the way the product mix for the different clients is structured. So for micro entrepreneurs, for example, it is natural, not only for Cielo, but for the competition to have very high penetration rates in the prepayment product, penetration rates around 70%. And this is because these clients, they prefer to receive the cash right away. So usually, when you create the products, the combo that you're going to offer to that client, you already sell -- you offer a prepayment as a function, and they take it. So with that, inside Cielo, you'll see -- and there's also common for the market, a higher penetration in Entrepreneurs are close to 70%. And in the other segments inside Cielo, a penetration that is closer to 22% to 20%. But this has to do with the preference of the client.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Tito Labarta, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>DAER LABARTA, VP, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: A couple of questions also. First, you mentioned that you're growing more with SMEs versus Large Accounts. But then if we look at the prepayment volumes, they were down to 14% of total volumes. And also, you mentioned that was impacted because of Larger Accounts. So if we look at the trend, it seems like you're actually growing more with Larger Accounts or at least in this quarter, even on the 2-day prepayments, that was down compared to last quarter. So just want to understand, was that just a quarterly thing, given that you focus more on SMEs versus Large Accounts? Or why did the prepayment volumes fall so much as a percentage of total volumes? And then I have another question after that.</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: Thank you, Tito. So on your question. So specifically, in the fourth quarter. And I would like you to visualize the decrease that we saw on the basic interest rate in Brazil. So we had a decrease on the basic interest rate, which led to tighter spreads for Cielo and a decision to do a capital allocation strategy, prioritizing the higher yielding segments. So for the larger clients, we have repriced our prepayment product, which led -- bear in mind that when I refer to larger clients, I'm talking about the clients who had big tickets. And if I lose a number of clients from 5 to 10 clients, this impacts this metric. So this decision for Cielo to prioritize higher yielding segments in prepayments led some clients to get their prepayments, financing alternatives, somewhere else, outside of Cielo, which led to this compression of the volume that was -- that we had in terms of prepayments.</p><p>Just to give you some color in terms of numbers related to that. And I'm going to refer to the balance of prepayments of the end of September versus the end of November. At the end of September, we had BRL 11.3 billion in prepayments. That's the balance. And the balance at the end of December was BRL 9.7 billion. So bear in mind that in the fourth quarter, it is a seasonally strong quarter. So it would be normal to see an increase there. But because of this repricing, the prioritization of the Retail segment of our portfolio, we did see a contraction in prepayments in Large Accounts.</p><p>DAER LABARTA: Okay. So that was a contraction with Large Accounts, not because you grew more in Larger Accounts that they didn't need the prepayments, correct?</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: Correct.</p><p>DAER LABARTA: Okay. So this -- like 14% of total volumes that are prepaid. Is that sort of like a new normal? Is that what we should expect going forward?</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: I would -- it's hard to say. It's hard to quantify because it has to do so. These products have a very short term. We're talking about average terms of 50 days. So this cycles do quite fast. So it has to do with what pricing policy we're likely to implement. So I'm not going to answer your question directly because I do not have a guidance on this for the full year. But what I can tell you is that the pricing policy that we implemented that led to some clients doing prepayment outside of Cielo is still in place. We are still prioritizing higher yielding segments.</p><p>DAER LABARTA: Okay, understood. So I understand. This is a focus on profitability. And so I guess, that sort of plays into my second question. Before you mentioned that you expect the revenue yield to continue to fall, given pricing competition. And I assume this is even with the new rebates from the banks. So is the way to read that, that margins or earnings can still fall like this BRL 240 million in net income that we saw this quarter? I know you're not giving any guidance, but is there still downside risk to that because of pricing pressure, your costs are still high, even though you're trying to focus a bit on that? Or have we neared the bottom in terms of earnings?</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: Tito, thank you for providing you with the context for the answer. So I cannot give guidance, but I can share with you what our concerns are. So our #1 concern for 2020 is still price pressure due to competition. And even though we have initiatives in terms of cost reduction of higher penetration of credit products, the combination of increasing brand fees of a change in mix that has more credit, which makes brand fees more heavy and this concern of still compressing margins are at the backdrop of our view for 2020. Our initiatives to offset that may not be enough to compensate for the margin pressure that we are seeing this, but this all may change according to what price market we see during the year.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Craig Maurer.</p><p>CRAIG JARED MAURER, PARTNER, PAYMENTS AND FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: Two questions. But the first is, when we talk to competitors in the market, whether that's Stone, First Data, [Rede] Santander, you name it. Everybody says they're gaining share in the SME or the middle market. So considering that the SME or middle market is a finite number of merchants. Help me understand who Cielo is now gaining share from, again, to increase their share in middle market because that the commentary from all the players doesn't add up. And secondly, if you could comment on aside from Cielo's specific pricing changes, what your expectation is for the market in terms of prepayment pricing now that Rede has decided to go to 0% prepayment without the need for a bank account domicile to detail?</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: Craig, thank you for the 2 questions. So starting with the second question. In terms of prepayment margins, you are correct. This competitive environment and this change in terms of a key competitor leads us to believe that we will have a tougher environment in terms of margins for prepayments. That's a fact. And I'm saying that, and I can tell you that even though we haven't seen a significant change in terms of requests from our clients, our clients leaving Cielo because of that offer. But I understand it's an important offer that will put pressure on prepayment margins.</p><p>And now I'm going to try to do my best to reconcile market share movements on the retail from what you hear from us and also from what you hear from the competition, okay? So first of all, bear in mind that when we talk about Cielo regaining its presence in Retail, and we put that into perspective, we take -- we look at a long picture here. So we lost significant market share on the Retail, in our calculations, roughly 20 points of market share in the Retail in the years of 2017 and 2018. What we were able to achieve in 2019 was a stabilization of this. By stabilization, so our first item to celebrate this year was listen, we are at a given level of our estimate of market share, and we are still around this number. This number fluctuated upwards on the second quarter, where we gained share from most of the players and is fluctuated downward on the third quarter. But still, when we look at 2019, for the Retail, our job was, we preserved our market share. We stopped a trend that was happening 2, 3 years back of bleeding clients fast on the Retail. So that's how I try to reconcile the different arguments that you get from us and from the competition. And looking at 2020, it will be an important battle for all of the acquirers on SMEs. Yes, I follow your comment. Yes, everybody is prioritizing that.</p><p>CRAIG JARED MAURER: Okay. And if I can just ask 1 follow-up. Historically, Brazilian regulators have monitored Cielo's market share looking to have new competitors gain share in Brazil. How is the -- how are the conversations with the regulators these days in terms of Cielo's overall market share and Cielo's ability to be aggressive to regain momentum and share in the market?</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: Thanks for the question. Our interactions with the regulators haven't built specifically or, let me say, better, heavily in terms of this specific concern that you raised. Cielo does have a market share that is now above 40%. It used to be above 60% in the past, but our recent interaction with the regulator in Brazil, hasn't weighed heavily on this specific topic. We talk about everything with the regulator. Their plans for open banking, their plans for instantaneous payments, their plans for providing a platform for prepayment for providing better transparency and access to clients in terms of prepayment options. But I would say -- I don't want to say 0, but I would say, way less in terms of a threat to competition because of the market share of Cielo.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Neha Agarwala, HSBC.</p><p>NEHA AGARWALA, ANALYST, LATAM FINANCIALS, HSBC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Sorry, I came in late, so apologies if I'm making you repeat any of your answers. I have 3 questions. First is on the credit product. How has the experience been in the credit product, has you set quality being tougher than you imagined? It seems like the rolling out of the credit product is on the slower side. My second question is in terms of regulation. Could you update us on the creation of the marketplace for receivables? I believe we'll receive the first guidelines in August of this year. And what is the impact that you estimate from the creation of the marketplace? Any rough estimate or any guideline would be helpful.</p><p>And my last question is on our focus area. We understand that the SMB market is now the focus area. But what about your strategy in the micro merchant segment. Do you -- should we expect lower focus on that in the micro merchant segment? And if so, what is the rationale behind that?</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: Okay. Neha, thank you very much for your questions, okay. So in terms of the credit product, so we created a product, a pilot of a product here inside Cielo that went throughout the second half. That was what the Brazilian market calls fuma\u00c3\u00a7a roughly translated to smoke, which doesn't describe the product at all. So let me try to explain it to you. Because the acquirers have the relationship with the clients, they can forecast how much that given client will sell over the upcoming months. Based on that projection, credit is offered. So this is what the market in Brazil calls fuma\u00c3\u00a7a. This credit product is very heavily associated with acquirers. Okay. That being said, we created a methodology where the most important credit criteria is our projection of churn of that given client. So if our projections indicate that we have a strong likelihood to remain with that client, we are comfortable granting that credit. This experience was successful on the second half. We are now -- but we ran it as a pilot. We're now preparing systems, procedures to do a full implementation of that. We are not ready to implement it yet. As soon as we launch it, we'll let the market know.</p><p>Going to your second question, in terms of the marketplace of receivables, yes, the first stage of this project will be launched in August. Right now, all of our attention is to have all the operational aspects compliant with what the Central Bank is requiring of the acquirers. I do not have projections related to that. Subjectively, this represents a threat and an opportunity. It represents a threat to our portfolio because it will be an open platform, but also an opportunity to reach out to other clients into other prepayment alternatives. But unfortunately, at this point, I don't have a projection to make on what our prepayment, how our prepayment will be affected by that.</p><p>And in terms of focus, when we look at the micro merchant segment, we saw an increase of the percentage of the value of the cost of the equipment that is subsidized to this type of client. Up to a certain point, we followed this competitive behavior, its competitive pattern from the industry. We think that now at average levels of close to 70%, this subsidy is quite high. So we will look at 2020, limiting our level of subsidies. It's still a segment with high margins, with clients that, as I mentioned in one of the previous questions, seek prepayments, right? But still, because it's an upfront cost that depends in terms of a future performance where viability depends in terms of a future performance, we'll be more cautious in this segment, which leaves the SMB segment as our top priority for 2020.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Mohammed Ahmad, FGP.</p><p>MOHAMMED AHMAD, VP OF FOREIGN EQUITIES AND FOREIGN EQUITIES CO-PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FOYSTON, GORDON &amp; PAYNE INC.: I just want to focus a little bit or understand the cost side of Cielo Brazil, a little bit more. Could you -- given that it's going to be a fairly challenging environment on the revenue side. Can you give us a little sense of what part of your cost or what percentage of your cost is something that you can address and control and perhaps curtail versus what portion of the cost is directly linked to just volume and will grow with it with limited control on your part?</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: Mohammed, thank you for your question. One of the items that we refer to in these types of interactions with analysts and investors is the fact that if we look at our cost base in 2019, and I'm talking about a round number of close to BRL 4.5 billion. If we look at items, there are directly actionable, I don't want to say manageable because every cost in the long term is manageable and you have some influence over that. But if you take outside of this calculation, costs such as brand fees, depreciations and others, we will be left of this BRL 4.5 billion, with close to BRL 2 billion of items where we have a direct influence in that cost on that given year. So this is why when we look at the evolution of costs at Cielo, we see increasing variable costs, mainly driven by higher brand fees, brand fees have been going up because of 2 things, both as a function of an increase in, I'm going to call it, the headline price of the brand fee and also because of a change in mix over the past periods, we have seen an increase of the credit component. So there's a more heavier weight of the credit in the mix and also a heavier weight of the brands that have higher fees, which leave us with BRL 2 billion or 44% of the total cost that I mentioned with an ability to maneuver around. I'm referring to close to BRL 700 million in personnel expenses and also costs related to telecom, processing and other administrative costs. So this is why it's tough, but it is part of our job to try to offset price pressure and increasing variable costs with a more efficient structure.</p><p>MOHAMMED AHMAD: Sorry, did I understand this correctly, you said BRL 2 billion is manageable of that BRL 700 million is what I didn't quite catch that.</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: Personnel, payroll.</p><p>MOHAMMED AHMAD: BRL 700 million is payroll.</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: Yes.</p><p>MOHAMMED AHMAD: Just my other question on the subsidiary side, we've noticed last year, obviously, the subsidiary losses ex Cateno on Cielo Brazil spiked up a little bit that historically been sort of close to breakeven on average. Can you give us a little sense of what you can do there? Can you realize some value there? What should we expect in 2020 there?</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: If we look at other subsidiaries, so we have improving performance from Cateno. That's the most important contributor for Cielo's total earnings at this moment. So there is -- we are confident that we will keep seeing improvement -- improving performance from Cateno. In the other subsidiaries, there is one that has a very strong focus of attention from management and from the Board, which is Merchant e-Solutions. That's our subsidiary in the U.S. where in April of 2019, we changed the management. And the new management has done a few things. First, they completely changed the cost structure. They reviewed the number of locations of Merchant e's presence across United States, a number of offices. They also reviewed the number of employees. They did some cuts in terms of headcount there. They propose and they are developing a road map of products and solutions. And throughout the first quarter, we will -- this management will present their proposal of a turnaround of Merchant e to our Board. So we're still improving there. At this point, we have done the basics, which is efficiencies in terms of number of offices and headcount. The product portfolio is being worked on. But the final path for turnaround, the alternatives will be presented to our Board throughout the first quarter. As soon as we have finalized a strategic view for that asset, we'll let the market know.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Jeff Cantwell, Guggenheim Securities.</p><p>JEFFREY BRIAN CANTWELL, VP AND ANALYST, GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Most of my questions have already been asked, but I have a question that's related to the increase you're seeing in your active merchant base, which is now 1.6 million versus the 1.3 million in the same quarter last year. So that looks pretty good to us. And we heard you talk now about some changes in your strategic focus using the hunters, which you outlined on Slide 10, and that also looks positive. So I guess, the key question is, will this strategic focus ultimately cause net income growth to rebound? And can you maybe talk to us about your thinking there? And then related to that, I also want to see if you could talk about the new merchants you're adding over the past 12 months? And how do they compare to your legacy merchants? Are they more profitable versus your legacy base, for example, or maybe expect to see less churn from these new merchants? Any color you can give us there would be great.</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: Jeff, let me just rewind your question a little bit. I -- your call was a little chopped. And I lost what you said before, rebound. The -- not the whole thing. The 10 seconds before rebound. Can you just contextualize that for me, please?</p><p>JEFFREY BRIAN CANTWELL: Yes. So the first is on thinking about your strategic focus, right, with your active merchant base and how that's increasing. And whether that can ultimately drive a rebound in net income growth for you in 2020 and maybe even if you want to talk about 2021? And then the second is thinking about the merchant base, the new adds, how they compare to your legacy merchants? Are they more -- do you think they're more profitable, right, versus your legacy base? Or maybe you're thinking that there will be less churn from those merchants? I'm just trying to look for some color on the net adds that you're seeing.</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: Perfect, Jeff, thank you for clarifying. So in terms of our client base expansion, net adds came heavily from expansion in SMBs. And most importantly, in micro entrepreneurs. So when we refer to micro entrepreneurs. It's a new segment. So those are new clients for us. I cannot draw a direct comparison from this portfolio in the past. This is a portfolio that was more heavily built in the year 2019. When we look at the SMBs that were added to our base, what we have seen on the SMBs portfolio as a whole was a stabilization in terms of churn. Up until the end of 2018, we had been experiencing increasing churn rates throughout 2019, we were able to stabilize that. So the new clients that were brought in, they came, they had this positive effect of stabilizing churn on the SMB segment.</p><p>That being said because we're talking about a 2019 with way more competitive prices, they have much lower profitability. We added clients with a different revenue yield. So not only we added new clients with a lower revenue yield, but the clients from the legacy portfolio were also repriced. With all of that and with a view that price pressure will remain in 2020, it's very hard to forecast when this rebound in terms of net income will happen. Our job here is to still work with the stabilization of Cielo's presence, mainly on the SMBs portfolio. But still, touching on some of the items that I discussed throughout the other questions, facing headwinds of price pressure, increasing variable costs because of brand fees and doing our best to become more efficient and to further increase our penetration of prepayments on the Retail portfolio on the SMB portfolio.</p><p>JEFFREY BRIAN CANTWELL: Okay. And then you got a couple of questions on your outlook for net revenue yields. And we can see that came down by 5 basis points this quarter. And you're highlighting pricing adjustments was a big driver of that. I guess, I just want to ask this in a slightly different way, which we're all trying to figure out directionally up or down, right? And I guess, the crux of my question is, what would be the 2 or 3 factors that would cause our net revenue yields to inflect positively for you guys? Is there anything that you're seeing or you can discuss with us that would give us a feel for a possible positive inflection over, call it, the next 12 to 18 months?</p><p>GUSTAVO HENRIQUE SANTOS DE SOUSA: Got it. Got it. So one of them is a stabilization in terms of prices, which is not our base case scenario, that's not what we were seeing. But if prices were to stabilize, that would be positive for us. And the other one would be an inversion in terms of the participation of the segments. But that, in order for that to happen in 1 year, the SMB portfolio would have to grow way faster than the other portfolios, namely in the Large Accounts portfolio. So I'm talking about what would drive this inflection in terms of revenue yield. In terms of market conditions would be stabilization of prices and that's not our base case. And in terms of the mix of our products, a much stronger growth and/or deceleration in Large Accounts, but because Large Accounts are 2/3 of Cielo's volume, this change in mix takes some time. It's hard to see that in 1 year, okay?</p><p>PAULO ROG\u00e9RIO CAFFARELLI: And also a possibility to grow more in credits that maybe we are forecasting in order to grow the 2-day payment on a higher way that we expected. So this is also a driver for us that makes us have a potential to grow more, which is not the basic scenario, but it could be a good surprise.</p><p>OPERATOR: Excuse me. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to invite Mr. Paulo Caffarelli to proceed with his closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.</p><p>PAULO ROG\u00e9RIO CAFFARELLI: Thank you all of you for the participation. If you have any doubt, please do not hesitate to contact with us, okay? Thank you so much. See you soon. Bye-bye.</p><p>OPERATOR: That does conclude Cielo conference call for today. Thank you very much for your participation.

Everyone is encouraged to refer to today's release and related CFO remarks for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP comparable measures and descriptions of the calculation of EBITDA and measures presented on a constant currency basis.</p><p>Let me now turn it over to Paul for his report. Paul?</p><p>PAUL A. MALEH, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, CRA INTERNATIONAL, INC.: Thanks, Chad, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With each year and with each decision, CRA sets out to maximize long-term value per share. Such a goal requires an optimal distribution of capital that is directed between investments that drive value-creating growth and a return of capital to our shareholders. During the past 5 years, we have increased our consulting head count by more than 70% while maintaining an average utilization of 75%. This has translated into revenue growth of 50% over the past 5 years. During this time frame, our assets have become more productive as demonstrated by the average revenue per vice president increasing by more than 25%. This has contributed to non-GAAP EBITDA, net income and EPS growth of 43%, 77% and 113%, respectively, over the 5-year period.</p><p>In addition to reinvesting in our business, we have also returned substantial capital to our shareholders. Since fiscal 2015, we have repurchased $97 million of our common stock at an average price of approximately $35 per share and reduced our shares outstanding by 15%. Dividend payments provided an additional $18 million to our shareholders for a total redistribution of $115 million over the past 5 years, equating to a shareholder yield of approximately 7.5%.</p><p>Following a record-setting 2018, CRA delivered an encore in fiscal 2019 with 8.1% year-over-year revenue growth and 13.4% head count growth, while at the same time recording utilization of 75% for the full year.</p><p>I'm especially pleased in the way we continue to position the firm for future success. During fiscal 2019, we made several talent investments to augment our teams in Antitrust &amp; Competition Economics, Finance, Forensic Services and our new Risk, Investigations &amp; Analytics Practice. These efforts continued in the fourth quarter as we welcomed a group hire of approximately 25 consultants in our Antitrust &amp; Competition Economics practice. Next month, we look forward to consolidating this with our colleagues from our Oakland and Pleasanton offices into new office space in downtown Oakland. This new consolidated office will house approximately 75 colleagues and 3 CRA practices.</p><p>Turning to a few highlights of the quarter. Within our Antitrust &amp; Competition Economics practice, our colleagues in Europe advised Uber in a recent high-profile case. The Supreme Court of the State of New York annulled a regulation that would have required for-hire vehicle basis such as Uber and Lyft to limit the time drivers on their platform spent cruising without a passenger in the vehicle to 31% of total driving time in Lower Manhattan. The court ruled in Uber's favor that the cruising cap was without sound basis in reason and imposed without regard to the facts.</p><p>Within our Finance practice, CRA continues to work on matters stemming from the government's heightened activity, investigating and prosecuting institutions and individuals for spoofing and related manipulative activity in financial markets. In addition, CRA has worked and continues to work on large securities litigation matters in the U.S. and other countries.</p><p>Our Forensic Services practice continues to experience strong demand from companies that need our help responding to allegations of fraud, misconduct and noncompliance. The team recently investigated a ransomware event at an international health care company that impacted operations in multiple countries. CRA determined the source of the intrusion, provided information associated with the e-crime syndicate, assisted the client with remediation efforts and provided a security map to the company's Board. In addition, the practice performed a similar investigation at a global media company that also experienced a ransomware event affecting its global operations.</p><p>Our Labor &amp; Employment practice continues to assist clients facing nationwide discrimination litigation and state and federal wage and hour issues across a variety of sectors, including professional services, information technology and transportation. As clients start their annual compensation review and incentive pay processes, the practice is regularly engaged to assist with privileged proactive audits to ensure decisions are consistent with an unbiased process.</p><p>I'm grateful to all of my colleagues for their hard work throughout the year as we help our clients address their most challenging -- their most important challenges.</p><p>Recapping fiscal year 2019, revenue on a constant currency basis was $455.3 million, consisting of $451.4 million of reported results and a $3.9 million adjustment for currency headwinds relative to fiscal 2018.</p><p>Full year non-GAAP EBITDA and non-GAAP EBITDA margin were $44.1 million and 9.8%, respectively. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP EBITDA decreased by $0.1 million to $44 million or 9.7% of revenue. If we add back the foreign currency loss of $1.3 million, non-GAAP EBITDA margin would have been 10% on a constant currency basis.</p><p>Our fiscal 2019 financial performance demonstrates our continued success in the marketplace. New business opportunities and project originations grew significantly over fiscal 2018 and improved during the calendar year 2019. We look to build on our trend of broad-based profitable growth in the years ahead.</p><p>For full year fiscal 2020, on a constant currency basis relative to fiscal 2019, we expect revenue in the range of $495 million to $510 million and non-GAAP EBITDA margin in the range of 9.2% to 10.2%. While we are pleased with CRA's strong performance in 2019, we, of course, remain mindful that the short-term challenges arising from uncertainties around global economic and political conditions can affect our business.</p><p>And now I'll turn the call over to Chad for a few additional comments. Chad?</p><p>CHAD HOLMES: Thanks, Paul. As a reminder, more expansive commentary on our financial results is available on the Investor Relations section of our website under Prepared CFO Remarks.</p><p>Before we get to your questions, let me provide a few additional metrics related to our performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. In terms of head count, we ended the year with 779 consulting staff which consisted of 128 officers, 434 other senior staff and 217 junior staff. This is a net increase of 13.4% year-over-year compared with the 687 total head count we reported at the end of fiscal '18.</p><p>Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, excluding the 2.7% attributable to commissions to nonemployee experts, was 18.0% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with 17.5% a year ago.</p><p>Also worth noting is that profits were negatively impacted by approximately $920,000 of foreign currency losses in the fourth quarter, which resulted from net losses on foreign-denominated transactions and the revaluation of working capital balances. These losses arose mainly from fluctuations in the euro and pound exchange rates which were affected by the ongoing political uncertainty surrounding Brexit. For the year, FX losses negatively impacted profits by a total of $1.3 million.</p><p>The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 22.8% compared with 19.2% on a non-GAAP basis for the fourth quarter of 2018. For the full year 2019, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.3% compared with 21.8% for fiscal 2018. The increase in our effective tax rate both for the fourth quarter and full year was driven primarily by our jurisdictional mix of earnings.</p><p>Turning to the balance sheet. We concluded fiscal 2019 with $25.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings. DSO at the end of the fourth quarter was 105 days compared with 108 days at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2019. DSO in the fourth quarter consisted of 77 days of billed and 28 days of unbilled.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per common share, up 15% from the third quarter. For the full year, dividend payments equaled $6.8 million. In total, we returned $24.9 million to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividends, demonstrating our confidence in our long-term outlook and our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders.</p><p>Further supporting this view, as announced earlier today, CRA's Board of Directors authorized an expansion to our existing share repurchase program of an additional $20 million in value of shares of common stock, bringing the total amount available under our share repurchase program to $23.5 million.</p><p>Finally, we announced earlier today that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per common share payable on March 20, 2020, to shareholders of record as of March 10, 2020.</p><p>That concludes my prepared remarks. Before we turn the call over to questions, Paul has a few final comments. Paul?</p><p>PAUL A. MALEH: Thanks, Chad. In addition to this morning's earnings and dividend announcements, CRA communicated a few organizational and governance changes intended to build on the successes that we have enjoyed over the past several years and to continue the momentum in the quarters and years ahead.</p><p>First, we are dividing the responsibilities of the CFO and Chief Corporate Development Officer into 2 executive officer positions reporting directly to me. Chad has led our corporate development efforts since 2009 and will transition to this new role full-time as Executive Vice President and Chief Corporate Development Officer once we identify a new CFO. We have also announced that current Board Chairman, Row Moriarty, plans to retire at our annual meeting scheduled for July. Board member, Bill Concannon, will become Independent Lead Director and I will assume the Chairman role. We will forever be grateful to Row for his thoughtful and dedicated leadership over the past 34 years.</p><p>And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Robert who's going to be fielding some questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)</p><p>Our first question is from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.</p><p>TREVOR ROMEO, ASSOCIATE, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: This is actually Trevor Romeo on for Andrew. First of all -- first, just wanted to kind of ask on the revenue guidance, which seems to imply accelerating growth in 2020, and at the same time, you kind of talked about uncertainties in global economic and political conditions. So just, I guess, what gives you the confidence that you'll be able to achieve accelerating growth in 2020 despite the uncertainties you see right now?</p><p>PAUL A. MALEH: I mean you always have to be mindful of the uncertainties we're seeing across the globe. But with that said, I have not observed any kind of slowdown in CRA's business activities, both in terms of our ability to hire talented colleagues; second, by the business opportunities that are coming through the door; and lastly, our ability to convert those into revenue-generating projects. We've seen this consistency not just in 2019 but, quite frankly, for the past several years. So with that, we remain confident in the guidance that was communicated today.</p><p>TREVOR ROMEO: Okay. Great. And then given, I guess, what seems like pretty broad-based growth you've seen, I guess, over the past few years, as you said, where specifically would you see revenue growth accelerating in 2020? Would it be kind of similar, almost every practice across the firm accelerating? Or would that be concentrated in any certain pockets?</p><p>PAUL A. MALEH: We've enjoyed the broad-based growth. And by definition, that means I have different practices contributing at different points in time. This team effort has led to the consistency of our results and really the upward trajectory of our overall performance. In 2020, I really am expecting contributions from all my practices, of course, at different levels of that, but some of it to be expected and some of it will be pleasant surprises as we go along. So if you're a member of our service portfolio, the expectation is you're going to be assisting us in creating value for our shareholders in 2020 and beyond.</p><p>TREVOR ROMEO: Great. And then if I could maybe just ask 1 more, maybe particularly given the announcements today regarding the Chief Corporate Development role, and congrats, Chad, by the way, on that. Could you just talk about your thoughts currently on the acquisition environment? Should we read this announcement as sort of an increasing focus there?</p><p>PAUL A. MALEH: I think the way to read the announcement, and quite frankly, the way it was intended is we're quite proud of the success that we've enjoyed over the last several years, but we also acknowledge that staying pat is not a recipe for future success. We would like to bolster our senior leadership team to provide us the bandwidth to both do what we have to internally with respect to our financial administration requirements, but also provide the bandwidth to take advantage of the hiring opportunities we're seeing in the marketplace.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research.</p><p>KEVIN MARK STEINKE, MD, BARRINGTON RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe it's been in the news a lot lately in terms of all the scrutiny on the big tech companies from an antitrust perspective. Do you see that playing a significant role in your outlook for 2020 and beyond? I know you're generally involved in the largest matters out there, so just wondering if you see that as a specific growth driver as you move over into 2020 and beyond.</p><p>PAUL A. MALEH: Sure. Without divulging any of the specifics of our engagements, as we have mentioned in the past, the increased regulatory scrutiny that we're seeing both here in the States and abroad is clearly a driver of our demand. We're seeing active matters as a result of this activity, and we expect to be a significant player in future matters going forward.</p><p>KEVIN MARK STEINKE: Okay. Great. And maybe just to touch on the utilization rate in the quarter. It's a bit below your typical kind of mid-70s. Is that just kind of reflective of the accelerated hiring in anticipation of the strong growth you see going forward?</p><p>PAUL A. MALEH: Yes, I think your answer is about as good as I'm going to be providing you. Growth takes investments. Sometimes that investment takes the form of an acquisition that you bring on individuals at one time, and sometimes it's a little more grassroot on the hiring. If we want to grow in the 10% to 13% range as implied by our guidance, we need to have the colleagues here and capable of delivering those services. So you always are going to have a little bit of a lag between bringing on the staff, and then it's just how quickly can you get those assets ramped up.</p><p>We're quite happy with the level of utilization in Q4, given the fact that head count grew more than 13% year-over-year in that quarter. So we're not changing our overall expectations of productivity. And as long as we have the upper trajectory for the business, that 72% utilization doesn't cause us any concern.</p><p>KEVIN MARK STEINKE: Okay. Great. And then can you just touch on the margin guidance for 2020, implies kind of up or down in terms of where you came in versus 2019? I know CRA is already operating as a pretty lean organization. But just maybe any comments on margin trends and expenses or investments as you move into 2020.</p><p>PAUL A. MALEH: Sure. We've been able, for now an extended period of time, as demonstrated by some of the statistics I gave earlier in my comments, we've been able to grow profits at a faster rate than revenue now for an extended period of time. Our goal is to continue to try to provide that expansion. The guidance range of 9.2% to 10.2%, I think, covers that range. We're always looking to become more efficient, both in the way we deliver our selling, general and administrative services but also the way we deliver services to our clients. So we're not retreating from our desire to be creating value-creating growth by driving the top line and bottom line on our income statement.</p><p>KEVIN MARK STEINKE: Okay. And I believe in your prepared comments, you talked about average revenue per VP being up, what, 25%. I think that was over a multiyear period. But what is the opportunity, if any, that you see for that metric going forward? Is there still room to expand revenue per VP as you move forward?</p><p>PAUL A. MALEH: Sure. That expansion of revenue per VP has a couple of factors that, I guess, are important to highlight. The first is we're always looking for important affiliations with various experts, either in academia or in industry, and that is helping raise that revenue per consultant or revenue per VP figure.</p><p>Secondly, the quality of our portfolio has been steadily improving. If you look at the VP count over that extended window of time for the past 5 years, it has remained relatively flat but yet, CRA has enjoyed nearly 10% per annum growth rate. Those are all things that go into the comment of the quality of this portfolio is improving on that.</p><p>So we still believe there is upside potential on that. I don't know whether you're going to enjoy the same level of growth in the next 5 years as we've seen previously, but I think there's still room to get better.</p><p>KEVIN MARK STEINKE: Sure, sure. Yes, makes sense. Okay. And I suppose obligatory question, given the news headlines in terms of the coronavirus. I mean have you seen any impact at all in terms of your people's ability to travel or any impact on your clients' business activity to date, keeping in mind that obviously it's a fluid situation? But just any comment around that or your thoughts on any potential impact.</p><p>PAUL A. MALEH: Sure. To date, I can't say that we have observed a shift in the business activity as a result of the coronavirus on that. Our main concern right now is as to the safety of our colleagues who travel abroad regularly outside of their home office. So our monitoring is much more related to ensuring the safety of our colleagues, ensuring they get home without event.</p><p>KEVIN MARK STEINKE: Okay. And then -- that's helpful. And then, lastly, maybe Chad, what do you expect for tax rate in 2020? How should we think about that?</p><p>CHAD HOLMES: Sure. For 2020, we're estimating a full year effective non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 30%. That range could be affected by a few factors, most notably jurisdictional mix of earnings, discrete items such as stock-based comp, and of course, our stock price during the year as it relates to our accounting for stock-based compensation. All of these things can introduce volatility to our effective tax rate quarter-to-quarter. But for the year, 27% to 30% would be the range.</p><p>KEVIN MARK STEINKE: Okay. Great. Maybe I'll throw one last one in there, Chad, given your transition to the new role. Just -- yes, I see you hired one of the large search firms to assist in your search, but maybe do you have a kind of a time line as to how quickly you'd like to find a new CFO and any characteristics of the person you'd be looking for?</p><p>PAUL A. MALEH: Sure. How about if I take that one, Kevin? We're actively searching for a new CFO, a new member to our senior corporate team on that. There is no defined time line on it. We feel quite comfortable for Chad continuing the role of both CFO and Chief Corporate Development Officer until such time. When we do identify an individual, all of you will be the first to know at which time that new CFO will report to me, the CEO, and also Chad's role as Chief Corporate Development Officer will also be reporting to the CEO's office.</p><p>KEVIN MARK STEINKE: Okay. Congratulations on the nice results today.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Marc Riddick with Sidoti.</p><p>MARC FRYE RIDDICK, BUSINESS AND CONSUMER SERVICES ANALYST, SIDOTI &amp; COMPANY, LLC: So a lot of what I was going to talk about was already covered. I did want to address just a couple of small items. Wanted to see if there was a follow-up on where you were with CapEx. I mean I know we were finishing up with increased spending on Boston facilities, so I was wondering if you could discuss where you're looking for CapEx for 2020 and if we're continuing to look to return to, I guess, more normal levels there.</p><p>CHAD HOLMES: Sure. So consistent with prior quarters, our CapEx outlays have been directed primarily towards office build-outs and expansions to support the growth in our head count. And our real estate investments have focused on efficient space planning, and in doing so, we've been able to maintain a relatively flat real estate cost per employee over the last handful of years.</p><p>In fiscal '19, we spent around $17 million on property and equipment. These investments focused primarily on our office build-outs in Boston and Cambridge. Our build-outs in Oakland and New York began in earnest in Q4 with the majority of those outlays shifting into 2020. We had originally thought they might start to materialize in 2019. So for the full year in 2020, we expect to spend around $18 million on CapEx as we wrap up our construction of our new office in Oakland and we complete some office expansions in both New York and Toronto.</p><p>MARC FRYE RIDDICK: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then I was wondering if you could sort of touch on a little bit as far as maybe some trends around international activity, particularly Europe, to sort of maybe see what that marketplace is like, not just from business activity but also maybe the potential for acquisition targets there.</p><p>PAUL A. MALEH: Sure. We've been really pleased with the performance of our European office. They have grown organically. They have grown from bringing on lateral resources in the marketplace, but the consistency of that growth has been quite impressive. We have a number of practices represented -- or that represent our European operations. And I know each of those practices are actively looking for ways to improve their operations abroad.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have reached the end of the Q&amp;A session. I will now turn the call back to Paul Maleh for closing remarks.</p><p>PAUL A. MALEH: Again, thanks to everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your time and interest in CRA. We'll be meeting with investors in the coming months, and we look forward to updating you on our progress on our first quarter call. With that, this concludes today's call. Thank you, everyone.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Today's call has concluded. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Today's conference is being recorded.</p><p>At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to John Gamble. Please go ahead.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE, CORPORATE VP &amp; CFO, EQUIFAX INC.: Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. With me today is Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.equifax.com\">www.equifax.com</url>.</p><p>During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including full year 2020 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause us -- could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2018 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.</p><p>Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. For the fourth quarter of 2019, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes accruals for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, costs associated with acquisition-related amortization expense, the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and foreign currency losses for remeasuring the Argentinian peso-denominated net monetary assets. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also includes legal and professional fees related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, principally fees related to our outstanding litigation and government investigations as well as the incremental nonrecurring project costs designed to enhance our technology and data security. This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our technology and data security infrastructure as well as projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global networks and systems as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects that will transform our technology infrastructure and further enhance our data security were incurred throughout 2018 and 2019 and are expected to occur in 2020 and 2021.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and also, as is the case for adjusted EPS, excluding accruals for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinian peso-denominated net monetary assets. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included in our earnings release and are also posted on our website.</p><p>I would also like to welcome back Jeff Dodge, who will be rejoining us for the next several months until Trevor Burns returns from his medical leave. Mark and I would like to thank Jeff for stepping back in. It is greatly appreciated. And Jeff has joined us today.</p><p>Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, EQUIFAX INC.: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. If you've been following the news this week, it was another busy week here at Equifax. Before I get into the fourth quarter financial results, let me just spend a few minutes on Monday's Department of Justice and FBI announcement on their indictment of 4 Chinese military officials for their role in the 2017 cyber attack on Equifax.</p><p>We're pleased that the FBI and DOJ were successful in identifying the criminals who attacked Equifax and U.S. consumers. Monday's announcement is another positive step forward for Equifax as we close the chapter on the 2017 event.</p><p>Continuing on the 2017 cyber event, you recall that we took a $700 million charge in the first half of 2019 related to the comprehensive settlement of the most significant legal and regulatory matters facing Equifax. In the fourth quarter, we recorded an additional charge of $100 million related to resolution of all remaining U.S. legal proceedings and investigations arising from the 2017 cybersecurity incident. This charge includes settlements reached in the securities class action and the shareholder derivative litigation, the financial institutions class action and lawsuits by the states of Indiana and Massachusetts, who did not join last year's multi-state Attorney General settlement. The charge also includes an estimate to resolve the remaining open U.S. proceedings and investigations. This charge is net of insurance proceeds related to these matters. The matters for which no estimate is included in this charge are the resolution of the review being undertaken by the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. and the Canadian consumer class action litigation. Consistent with prior legal settlement charges related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, the $100 million net charge is excluded from our fourth quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS.</p><p>In January, the court granted final approval for the multi-district consumer class action settlement we entered into in 2019. The timing of when the remaining approximately $360 million of the consumer restitution fund will be paid depends on the resolution of the appeals filed related to this case. The timing of that resolution of the appeals is still uncertain. Details on the status of all outstanding legal and regulatory issues will be provided in our 10-K to be filed later this month. Monday's indictment by the Department of Justice and our resolution of the U.S. matters related to the 2017 cyber event allows our team to fully turn the page and focus on our EFX2020 security and technology transformation and growth at Equifax as a leading data analytics and technology company.</p><p>Let me move now to our fourth quarter results. We're very pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and strong progress in 2019. The results were broad-based, showed sequential improvement, were above guidance and were another very positive step forward for Equifax. These results are our strongest since the 2017 event and reflect Equifax' return to a more normal growth mode.</p><p>Revenue at $906 million was up 10% in constant currency and up 8% on an organic constant currency basis and above the top end of our October guidance. We had strong revenue growth driven by our 2 U.S. B2B businesses, USIS and EWS, that collectively were up a strong 13% overall with Workforce Solutions up a strong 22% and U.S. up -- USIS, up a very solid 8%. The 22% growth at EWS was its strongest since 2016 and USIS' second half performance was their strongest since 2015. U.S. market -- U.S. mortgage market inquiries remain strong with inquiries up just under 21% and consistent with our guidance. International delivered 4% constant currency revenue growth, with growth in all regions in the quarter, but with continued pressure from the slowdown in Australia, Brexit uncertainty in the U.K. and most recently, the unrest in Chile. Global Consumer continued their path back to growth with revenue up almost 3.5%, and as expected, improving revenue growth driven by the recovery of our U.S. consumer business.</p><p>Adjusted EPS of $1.53 per share was at the top end of our guidance we provided in October. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.2% grew nicely, up 200 basis points compared to 2018. While we are seeing increased depreciation and duplicate cloud costs as our transformed systems move into production, these costs were in line with our guidance provided in October.</p><p>Let me move now to the individual business units. First, USIS. Their revenue was up 8% versus the fourth quarter of 2018 on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis. Total mortgage revenue was up just over 20%, consistent with the growth of the mortgage market inquiries. Mortgage Solutions revenue was up 19% in the quarter, much stronger than prior quarters in 2019, as we lapped the negative impact of the mix shift from a large mortgage reseller which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our non-mortgage revenue growth grew 3% in the quarter, and non-mortgage organic growth was positive again but up only slightly compared to last year. This was lower than the third quarter and lower than our expectation and reflects the continued choppiness of the USIS recovery that we've discussed over the past 2 years. We saw continuations of some very positive trends in USIS and feel good about accelerating USIS non-mortgage organic growth in 2020.</p><p>Online revenue in USIS was up 7.5% on a reported basis and up 4.5% on an organic basis. We saw double-digit growth in mortgage, ID and fraud, insurance and DataX as well as in auto and banking and lending. These are all very important verticals for USIS. This growth was principally offset by declines in our telco segment and our direct-to-consumer segment. Direct-to-consumer is the segment in which USIS sells credit files and scores to other credit-reporting agencies. This was down due to a onetime sale that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 that did not repeat. We expect this segment to return to growth in the first quarter of 2020. And telco saw a decline -- and while telco saw a decline in the quarter, we've had very good success with recent customer wins and win backs and expect a -- and see a clear line of sight to growth in telco as we move into 2020.</p><p>Financial Marketing Services revenue was up 3.5% in the quarter compared to last year. For full year 2019, FMS delivered 2.5% revenue growth as compared to 2018. While quarterly FMS revenue is still choppy, they delivered growth in 3 of the 4 quarters in 2019, which we view as positive. The revenue growth reflects the continuing growing pipeline that we discussed over the past couple of quarters in that business.</p><p>Sid Singh and the USIS team continued to show accelerating commercial activity through 2019 with good momentum coming out of the fourth quarter and into 2020. Their new deal pipeline is up 15% at year-end 2019 versus year-end 2018. And new deals won in 2019 increased over 2018 by almost 25%. And in the fourth quarter, the dollar value of new deals won was the highest it's been in the past 4 years. We continue to believe that our differentiated data assets, coupled with our technology investments, will return USIS to its traditional growth mode. The fourth quarter and 2019 results show that they are well down that path.</p><p>USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 45.1% were down 240 basis points from fourth quarter 2018 primarily due to increased royalty costs as well as higher development expense and investments in data analytics, commercial resources and new product resources.</p><p>Shifting now to Workforce Solutions. They had a very strong quarter with revenue up 22% compared to last year, which was much better than our expectations. Verification Services revenue was up an extremely strong 33% driven by broad-based, strong double-digit growth across mortgage, health care, debt management, auto, government and talent solution verticals. The strong and broad-based Verification Services revenue growth reflects continued growth in Work Number active records as well as the rollout of new products, expansion into new verticals and addition of new customers. EWS and Verification Services revenue growth, excluding the benefit of the mortgage market, were up a strong 12% and 19%, respectively.</p><p>Rudy Ploder and the EWS team did an outstanding job in 2019 growing their business and expanding the TWN database. TWN has almost 105 million active records at the end of 2019 and over 82 million active unique individuals, up 15% from a year ago. These compare to the roughly 170 million, including self-employed individuals in the U.S. nonfarm payroll, which gives us plenty of room to grow our database in the future. As you know, these TWN records really drive our revenue hit rates for our customers and benefits the U.S. consumers. Our system-to-system integrations with our customers allow us to monetize additions to the TWN database as soon as they are added by delivering the higher hit rates to our customers as they access our database in their system-to-system applications.</p><p>Employer Services declined in the quarter 6% and in line with our expectations primarily due to the expected declines at Workforce Analytics, our ACA business as well as our unemployment claims business. The strong Verifier revenue growth resulted in strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 47%. Margins were lower in the quarter compared to the prior year principally due to incremental third-party implementation and royalty costs associated with the TWN records expansion and some higher selling costs. Workforce Solutions is clearly Equifax' best business, and they continue to deliver strong results with significant future growth potential.</p><p>Shifting now to International. Their revenue was up 4% in local currency and almost flat on a reported basis, and this was weaker than our expectations. The majority of the weakness versus our expectations was in Latin America, particularly in Chile, and to a lesser degree, in the U.K. debt management business. Importantly, we saw better-than-expected performance in Asia Pacific, including Australia. I'm encouraged about the trajectory of the International business given the revenue growth posted in the second half of 2019 despite the continuing economic headwinds in Australia, Chile and the U.K. Asia Pacific, which is primarily our Australian and New Zealand businesses, was up almost 1% in local currency in the fourth quarter versus fourth quarter '18 and 1.5% for the second half of 2019. Importantly, in Australia, we saw our consumer and commercial online revenue, which, combined, represents just under half of Australian revenue, grow about 5% in the quarter. We also saw nice growth in our Identity and Fraud business and our HR solutions business. We continue to see weakness in our Marketing Services business, which we expect to continue, but at a lesser extent, through the first half of 2020. I was in Australia 2 weeks ago with our new leader, Lisa Nelson. She and her team are focused on returning the business to growth in 2020. We expect local currency Australia revenue growth -- to return to growth in the first quarter and strengthen in the second half of 2020.</p><p>The Australian business continues to make very good progress with positive data, and by the end of the fourth quarter, we had 80% of positive data from contributors, including 90% of the credit card and mortgage data for Australia. We expect this additional data to be a new lever for growth for the business in the future.</p><p>Shifting now to our European businesses, which were up 1% in local currency in the fourth quarter and weaker than our expectations, primarily in our debt management business. Importantly, our European credit business was up 5% in local currency, an improvement from the up 1% in the third quarter of 2019, and their strongest performance in 2019.</p><p>Consumer online and batch, which represents almost 60% of our European CRA revenue, was up 3% in the fourth quarter. Our analytics and scores business and Ignite InterConnect revenue grew double digits in the quarter, and this growth was driven by strength in fintech and financial services. Commercial and ID fraud revenue was weak in the quarter. Our European debt management business declined 7% in local currency, principally in Spain. And our debt management business with the U.K. government did not return to growth in the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, did return to growth in the fourth quarter, which was positive. However, we expect the overall debt management business to remain weak through the first quarter of 2020 as the Brexit situation normalizes.</p><p>Shifting to our Latin American business. They grew a strong 10% in local currency in the fourth quarter of 2019 despite the impact of Chile due to the recent unrest. We saw a double-digit constant currency growth in Argentina, Ecuador, Uruguay, El Salvador and Mexico, and we are seeing growth accelerate as our Latin American businesses benefit from the expansion of Ignite and InterConnect SaaS customer rollouts and strong NPI rollouts in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>Canada was up a strong 9% in local currency in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year, reflecting a continued focus on customer innovation and new products. Canada continues to be a very strong growth market for Equifax.</p><p>International adjusted EBITDA margins at 36.4% were up 400 basis points compared to the prior year. The strong recovery in margin reflects both the return to growth in the quarter and the benefit of the cost actions we implemented in the fourth quarter of 2018 and during 2019 as well as improved income from minority investments.</p><p>Shifting now to Global Consumer Solutions revenue. That business was up 3.5% on a reported and constant currency basis in the fourth quarter, a substantial improvement from the 50 basis point increase in the third quarter of 2019. Global Consumer direct revenue, which represents just under half of our total GCS revenue, was down only 1% in the quarter. Double-digit growth across the U.K. and Canada's combined consumer direct businesses was offset by an 8% decline in U.S. consumer. Although a slightly greater decline in the U.S. than we expected, this still represents a substantial improvement from the double-digit decline in U.S. consumer direct we saw in the third quarter and earlier in 2019.</p><p>Our GCS partner business increased 6% in the quarter as a result of solid growth with our U.S. partners, our benefits channel and our Canadian breach business. Our GCS partner team continues to close new logos, and their pipeline has grown nicely from this time last year.</p><p>GCS' adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.9% increased 580 basis points compared to the prior year and increased 200 basis points sequentially from the third quarter of 2019. As expected, in the fourth quarter, we saw the effect of revenue growth and the benefit of cost actions taken earlier in 2019. The GCS team has done an excellent job turning this business around and returning it to growth.</p><p>Dann Adams, our leader of GCS, retired from Equifax in late 2019 after a 21-year career at Equifax. I want to personally thank Dann for all his contributions to Equifax, including as President of USIS, EWS and GCS during his career. Dann leaves a tremendous legacy and will be missed. Taking over for Dann is Bev Anderson, who joined us after more than 30 years of experience in financial services. Bev joins us from Wells Fargo, where she was most recently responsible for leading the growth and transformation of their consumer credit card business and operations. I'm really excited to have Bev join my leadership team and be the head of the GCS business.</p><p>Turning now to our technology transformation. In the fourth quarter, we reached some significant milestones in our $1.25 billion EFX2020 security and technology transformation. As you recall, we launched a 3-year program in 2018 to migrate our data and applications to the Google Cloud. We've made significant progress on the implementation of our U.S. data exchanges in the new cloud-based data fabric during 2019, and we have some real momentum as we move into 2020. As of today, initial migrations of The Work Number, NCTUE, auto, target connect and our IXI wealth exchanges in cloud-native environments are complete. We expect to begin delivering in production to customers from these migrated exchanges as early as March, with complete migration of all data ingestion processes and legacy system decommissioning completed over the next 6 to 12 months. By the end of second quarter in 2020, we expect to have completed initial migration of our U.S. commercial exchanges, property exchange and our DataX exchange. And by third quarter of 2020, initial migration of all U.S. exchanges, including our property exchange, U.S. consumer or Acro exchange are both scheduled to be completed. These data migrations to the cloud are meaningful milestones in our technology transformation program.</p><p>Our Ignite analytics and machine learning platform, that includes attribute and model management capability and is integrated with InterConnect, will be fully available for our customer migrations at EWS by the end of the first quarter and at GCP by the end of the second quarter of 2020. This will include the ability for customers to easily ingest and manage their own data as well as Equifax data in their own Ignite instance. We continue to make strong progress globally in rolling out our Ignite analytics platform with over 150 customers now using Ignite Direct and Marketplace. NDT, our patented explainable machine learning technology, has now been deployed in the Ignite development with over 30 customer models. And a few weeks ago, we were awarded our second U.S. patent for NDT.</p><p>We're also making progress internationally with our cloud transformation. The initial migration of the Canadian consumer risk exchange and known fraud exchange to GCP and [EWS] will occur by the end of the second quarter of 2020, with similar progress in the U.K., in Australia and New Zealand on consumer exchanges expected by year-end.</p><p>We're also seeing accelerating progress in the migration of our customers onto our cloud-based InterConnect and Ignite API framework. This is the common set of services on which we are working to migrate all USIS, EWS and International customers. By the end of the first quarter of 2020, we expect to have migrated approximately 1,000 U.S. customers, with a similar amount in international. This pace will accelerate significantly through 2020, with the vast majority of U.S. customer migrations completed by early 2021. As we've discussed, customer migrations are certainly the most challenging part of our technology transformation to forecast, but we are very pleased with customers' enthusiasm for the benefits of our new cloud-native environment and the accelerating pace of customer migrations.</p><p>I hope this gives you a sense of the significant progress we are making on our technology transformation that will deliver industry-leading, cloud-native technology to our customers. We are laser-focused on execution and have continued good momentum as we move into 2020.</p><p>Shifting now to new products. This remains a key component of our EFX2020 strategy and a long-term muscle for Equifax. We have an active pipeline of innovation and new products, and we've launched over 90 new products in 2019, up 50% from 2018, and up from the guidance we gave you in October. As you well know, innovation and new products fuel our growth and are integral to our strategy. Importantly, USIS product launches were up 2x in 2019 and are back to the level that we were seeing in 2016. EWS also had a very strong new product year, doubling their new product launches. Innovation and new product rollouts will get increasing focus from our team in 2020 and '21 as we leverage the unique benefits of our cloud-native data fabric and cloud-based applications to deliver capabilities -- and new capabilities to our customers. This is a key lever for Equifax' growth in the future.</p><p>In 2019, USIS launched new or enhanced products in marketing, including enhanced email append, DataX prescreen and pre-approval of One; in Identity and Fraud, including our Luminate -- new Luminate fraud product suite and Synthetic ID 2.0, and in several vertical-specific products in commercial, which allow our customers to take advantage of our broadened commercial lease payment data set with the acquisition of PayNet; in real estate, for lead scoring, a new Insight Score for personal loans; and for the insurance industry, a new score, the Inflection score, which we developed jointly with Verisk. EWS also expanded their product offerings through the addition of new data assets, including education, property and other data, to augment their unique income and employment data, which is part of their path towards being a data hub that centers around their unique income and employment data asset. EWS' new products included expanded mortgage product offerings as well as new talent reports to be rolled out to support identification of loan stacking for the personal loan industry.</p><p>International also had a strong year with new products, increasing launches over 30%, with good distribution across all of our geographies. The strength in international NPIs is driven by over 100 customer Ignite installations at our International customers.</p><p>As you can see, we really prioritized our focus and resources on driving innovation and NPI rollouts in 2019, and we plan to invest even further in innovation and new products in 2020 and beyond. NPIs continue to be an increasingly important lever for Equifax' growth, particularly as we leverage the new product opportunities in front of us from the cloud transformation.</p><p>We also recently announced new partnerships with rent-reporting platforms, including Esusu, MoCaFi and Zingo, to help develop a more complete picture of a consumer's financial profile from rental data. These rent-reporting platforms enable consumers to opt-in to include rental payment data as a part of their credit report to allow a more complete picture of their financial history. All 3 companies, as a part of their credit education initiatives, will also present their users with a free weekly or monthly VantageScore so consumers can track score changes over time. We believe these partnerships are a win for consumers and a new data source for Equifax.</p><p>And earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in our India business to take 100% control of that business. We view India as a strategic long-term market, with tremendous potential with our unique data assets and capabilities.</p><p>Wrapping up and looking back at 2019, we made tremendous progress in executing against our EFX2020 strategy that we're convinced we'll return Equifax to market leadership and growth as a leading data, analytics and technology company. We have strong operational momentum coming out of 2019, with revenue growth in the second half of 2019 at almost double the pace of our first half performance. This second half acceleration, particularly in our U.S. businesses as well as return to year-over-year growth in EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS, positions us well for 2020 and beyond.</p><p>Monday's announcement of the DOJ indictment, along with our resolution of the principal remaining legal issues related to the cyber event, is another very positive step forward for Equifax that allows us to close the chapter on the 2017 event and turn our focus fully towards the future growth of Equifax.</p><p>Our $1.25 billion EFX2020 cloud-native technology transformation has accelerating momentum, and we are now implementing, in production, major exchanges as well as our Ignite analytical environment and our cloud-native infrastructure. We are also actively migrating customers onto our cloud-based InterConnect Ignite API-based platform, and we're equally energized about all the learning that we have about the power of the new cloud-native environment to drive innovation, speed-to-market, new products and solutions, always-on stability, and the cost and cash savings we talked about previously. We remain convinced that our cloud investment will be transformational for Equifax and drive our top and bottom line in the future.</p><p>We continued our focus in 2019 on advancing our already differentiated data assets by adding significant new data capabilities in the U.S. through our PayNet acquisition and in our partnerships with FICO, Yodlee and Urjanet. This focus on expanding our data assets will continue in 2020 and beyond. We continue to make big investments in our data security to deliver on our goal of being an industry leader in data security.</p><p>And last, we have the right team in place for the future of Equifax. Over the last 2 years, we brought in strong talent to my leadership team and the broader business. We are all aligned on returning Equifax to growth and market leadership.</p><p>We're energized by all we accomplished in 2019 and the momentum in the business as we move into first quarter in 2020. We know we have a lot of work still in front of us but our focus is clear, around executing our $1.25 billion cloud technology transformation while driving new innovation and products that will accelerate our growth in the future.</p><p>With that, let me turn it over to John.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Thanks, Mark. I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but will refer to non-GAAP results as well.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, total nonrecurring or onetime costs related to the cybersecurity incident and our transformation, excluding the $100 million in legal accruals that Mark discussed, were $82 million and below our expectations principally due to lower legal fees. The cost includes $76 million of technology and security and $6 million for legal and investigative fees. For all of 2019, U.S. mortgage market inquiries were up over 6.5% versus 2018, which is in line with what we had expected in October for 2019 inquiries. 4Q '19 inquiries were up almost 21%, consistent with what we had expected in October. In the fourth quarter, mortgage-related revenue represented just over 19% of Equifax' revenue. As a reminder, the estimate we provide is for 2020 mortgage market credit inquiries. We base our estimate on multiple third-party forecasts of mortgage originations in dollars, including MBA, Fannie and Freddie. Our current forecast originations of about flat in 2020 is, we believe, only slightly more positive on the order of 50 basis points than the current MBA originations forecast of down 7%. Inquiries can be very meaningfully -- can vary meaningfully from originations principally due to mortgage type mix and timing of inquiries versus closed loans.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, general corporate expense was $211 million. Excluding nonrecurring costs, adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $72 million, down $4 million from 4Q '18.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.2% in 4Q '19, up 200 basis points from 4Q '18 and up 130 basis points from 3Q '19. As we discussed in October, and as covered in Mark's comments, the increase in overall adjusted EBITDA margins year-to-year is driven by positive mix as high-margin USIS and EWS had the highest revenue growth rate in 4Q '19, growth in margins in International and GCS as well as leverage on corporate costs as revenue grows. Margin declines in USIS and EWS from strategic investments partially offset these increases.</p><p>For 4Q '19, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 22.7%, slightly below the approximately 23% we had provided for guidance for 4Q '19 in October. We expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be about 24%.</p><p>Full year operating cash flow of positive $314 million was down $358 million from 2018. The decline was more than driven by the following nonrecurring items: Equifax made payments of $341 million in 3Q '19 for the consumer settlement announced in the second quarter, no such payments were made in 2018; and payments related to the $57 million of restructuring charges taken in 4Q '18 and 1Q '19 were $36 million. Capital spending, or the incurred cost of capital projects in 4Q '19 and year-to-date, was $90 million and $376 million, down $28 million and up $8 million, respectively, from 2018. Excluding payments related to settlements of litigation or regulatory actions, full year 2019 free cash flow was above $250 million and was better than our expectations. Now let's take a look at 2020. 2020 is an important turning point for Equifax' 2020 security and technology transformation as we accelerate the move of our data exchanges to data fabric at GCP, our customer transitions to our Ignite InterConnect API framework and our Identity and Fraud customers' transition to using our new systems at AWS. As we put our cloud-native systems into production, we will begin to depreciate these new systems and incur the cloud and other operating costs of running these new cloud-native systems. It will generally take 6 to 12 months from the start of production to fully transition a legacy exchange or decisioning system to a new cloud-native system. During that time period, we will incur both the cloud and other operating costs of the new system as well as the operating costs of the legacy systems. As 2020 is a transition year and the decommissioning of legacy systems is not expected to substantially occur until late 4Q 2020 and 2021, we will incur these additional system transition costs for much of 2020. For 2020, we expect these additional system transition costs to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.50 per share, with increased depreciation representing about 2/3 of this additional cost and cloud costs, net of any legacy system decommissioning savings, representing approximately 1/3 of this cost. As we move into 2021, we expect the savings from the decommissioning of legacy systems to exceed the incremental cloud costs, resulting in a net benefit to the P&amp;L as opposed to the duplicate costs we will be incurring in 2020. As we have said in the past, when this transition is complete, we expect to generate significant cost savings of 15% plus savings in technology costs portion of our cost of goods sold, and the technology costs portion of our cost of goods sold represents just under 15% of our total COGS; and a 25% reduction in our development spend, both in expense and capital. And we expect our new single data fabric and cloud-based applications to accelerate innovation and new products that will be accretive to our growth rate.</p><p>Now for 2020 guidance. We expect total revenue to be between $3.65 billion and $3.75 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 4% to 7%. This assumes the U.S. mortgage market will be about flat in 2020. FX will negatively impact revenue by almost 1% and adjusted EPS by about $0.03. USIS revenue is expected to be up mid-single digits in 2020. EWS revenue will continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth, with very strong growth in Verification Services. Employer Services is expected to be flat to down. International revenue will grow mid-single digits, with growth strengthening in the second half of '20 due to expected economic improvement in Australia and Europe. GCS revenue will also grow mid-single digits in 2020, with continued growth in our partner business, at ID Watchdog and in our U.K. and Canada consumer direct businesses. We expect U.S. consumer direct to return to growth late in 2020.</p><p>For 2020, we expect adjusted EPS to be $5.60 to $5.80 per share, reflecting constant currency growth of approximately flat to 3.5% versus 2019. As I discussed earlier, impacting adjusted EPS in 2020 is $0.40 to $0.50 per share of increased depreciation and additional system transition costs. This represents approximately 8 percentage points of growth in adjusted EPS. As such, excluding this tech transition impact, adjusted EPS growth is 8% to 11%, which helps give a clearer picture of the post-Equifax 2020 earnings power of Equifax.</p><p>Due to the substantial increase in depreciation, we will, in 2020, add our -- add to our discussion with you more focus on adjusted EBITDA margins, which we believe will better reflect the true earnings power of Equifax. In 2020, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to expand by approximately 50 to 100 basis points. This includes a drag of about 50 basis points from the additional system transition costs. Excluding this transition cost, adjusted EBITDA margins would expand between 100 to 150 basis points in 2020. As we discussed, the duplicate legacy and cloud costs will be in place during 2020 and 2021 as we migrate customers to the new cloud environments and decommission legacy mainframe and server environments.</p><p>In 2020, we expect to incur approximately $255 million in nonrecurring expenses, comprised of $250 million in nonrecurring security and technology transformation expenses and less than $5 million in legal and regulatory expenses. This does not include the cost of any potential judgments or other regulatory outcomes should they occur. In 2020, as we have stated previously, we will no longer exclude -- sorry, in 2021, as we have stated previously, we will no longer exclude these nonrecurring expenses from our adjusted EPS.</p><p>Capital spending in 2020 is expected to be approximately $335 million. There are several important assumptions impacting 2020 in total as well as the individual quarters. U.S. mortgage market inquiries for all of 2020 are expected to be flat. However, 1Q '20 inquiries are expected to remain strong, up over 21% year-to-year. 2Q '20 inquiries are expected to be about flat, and we expect inquiries to decline about 10% in each of the third and fourth quarters. 2020 corporate costs are expected to increase approximately $45 million versus 2019. Depreciation expense within the corporate cost line is expected to increase over $15 million. 2020 corporate costs, excluding depreciation, are expected to increase year-over-year by about $30 million. The increases are principally in security and technology as well as equity compensation. The higher security and technology costs are partially a result of the system transitions in 2020 as we invest to ensure we maintain high levels of security in both the new cloud-native and legacy systems. As we decommission legacy systems at a more rapid pace beginning in late 2020, we would expect these security and technology costs to moderate. Over half of the 2020 total increase of $45 million in corporate costs will occur in 1Q '20. Interest expense is expected to increase about $13 million or $0.08 per share in 2020, reflecting the incremental borrowings to fund the legal settlement payments in 3Q '19 and 1Q '20. About 2/3 of this increase will occur in the first half of 2020. Note that our guidance does not reflect any incremental borrowings associated with approximately $355 million remaining in consumer legal settlements as the timing of that payment is still not known.</p><p>Our 2020 tax rate is expected to be slightly higher than the 2019 tax rate at 24%. We continue to expect our normal seasonal pattern for reported revenue and adjusted EPS, with 1Q being the lowest and 3Q and 4Q being the highest in dollar terms. However, in terms of year-over-year growth rates, we would expect 1Q to have the highest growth rates for revenue and adjusted EPS. For 1Q '20, we expect revenue in the range of $915 million to $930 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 9% to 11%. We are expecting adjusted EPS to be $1.29 to $1.34 per share. FX is expected to negatively impact revenue by over 1% in 1Q '20 and negatively impact adjusted EPS by $0.01 per share. Higher interest expense negatively impacts adjusted EPS by $0.03 per share versus 1Q '19. The tax rate in 1Q '20 is expected to be about 25%.</p><p>And with that, operator, please open it up for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.</p><p>ANDREW CHARLES STEINERMAN, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just wanted to understand how you're using the word mortgage inquiries, like to be flat in 2020, as your team's expectation, is that supposed to be a proxy for Equifax' revenues in 2020 for that part of the business which you said was about 19%? And if so, a 4% to 7% constant currency revenue growth would mean kind of high-single-digit non-mortgage revenue growth, right?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Yes. So the credit inquiries is exactly as it sounds, right? It's with each mortgage transaction, we get an inquiry. And we're simply trying to let you know what we forecast those inquiries to be for the year. And as I said, we estimate that based on the information we have in terms of the number of inquiries that we get per closed mortgage loan, and then we use the forecast provided by MBA and Freddie and Fannie to do an overall originations forecast, and then we translate it into credit inquiries. So it does reflect the inquiries we receive. It isn't necessarily a proxy for our revenue because, obviously, there's pricing changes in a year. We also get new records in Workforce Solutions, so we get growth from that. And we also launch new products in mortgage, which drives our growth higher.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: And we also get some penetration with some mortgage customers where they're using our either credit reports or the TWN records 2 times, 3 times, 4 times in their mortgage process. So that's another part of our revenue model.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Yes, absolutely. So -- and as you know, historically, we've tended to outperform the inquiry index. So it is to give you a view as to what we think the market is going to do in terms of the number of times the market will request information from the credit bureaus.</p><p>ANDREW CHARLES STEINERMAN: Right. And then, John, the second part was to do 4% to 7% constant currency revenue growth, you're assuming that 19% of your revenues is a headwind. So you would have to do kind of high-single-digit constant currency revenue growth in the non-mortgage segment, right?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: So certainly, our guidance indicates that non-mortgage is going to be higher, right? Is going to do better. Now again, but you have to keep in mind, we'll outperform that -- EWS, for example, as they continue to grow records, will certainly outperform in the mortgage segment the revenue they generate versus that inquiry index. So you can't just use the credit inquiries as a proxy directly to revenue because certainly, we do perform differently than that in certain circumstances.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p><p>KEVIN DAMIEN MCVEIGH, MD, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: So John, if I heard you right, it seems like if you added back the depreciation, the EPS would $6 to $6.20. That's a lot better than where The Street is on revenue, which is pretty much in line. Is that the mix in EWS? Or where else is that leverage coming through in the model?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Just ask the question one more time. I didn't fully follow. I'm sorry.</p><p>KEVIN DAMIEN MCVEIGH: Yes. So it looks like there's -- the depreciation, if I heard you right, it was kind of a $0.40 to $0.50 headwind, the duplicative depreciation, which would imply $6 to $6.20 versus -- or your guidance would be $6 to $6.20 versus The Street at $5.80. That's a lot better than kind of where The Street is, the adjusted EPS versus kind of where the revenue guidance is relative to The Street. Is that just the mix that's driving it? And I guess, I'm assuming there's some margin outperformance there. Is that margin outperformance in Workforce Solutions, or am I just not thinking about that right?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: So what we indicated was it was $0.40 to $0.50 per share for both the increase in depreciation, and the duplicate costs were occurring because we're running both cloud systems and our legacy systems until those legacy systems are decommissioned. So that is 40% to 50%. And yes, we did say that's about 8 points of growth in the year. So relative to where The Street was, I can't specifically address that. But I can indicate that we did, in the third quarter, give pretty specific guidance as to how much we thought our depreciation would go up, right? So I think there was a pretty good understanding generally prior to the fourth quarter beginning, following our third quarter earnings call, that we were going to see significantly increased depreciation in 2020. And we are also going to see significant increases in cloud costs in 2020. So I think that information was broadly out there before.</p><p>KEVIN DAMIEN MCVEIGH: That's helpful. And then, just with the indictments, does that open the potential that maybe you can recover some of those costs you have incurred already, the outcome insurance? Or does that change the outcome in terms of what you've already incurred?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: I think we've fully taken advantage of our insurance coverage there as far as any recovery. So our expectation is that the charges that we took last year and the charge we took in the fourth quarter will be Equifax-funded. These are all net -- the numbers we shared with you are net of insurance.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK, DIRECTOR &amp; LEAD RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mark, you've -- over the course of the year, talked a lot about how the pipeline will be improving, new products and all the progress you've made. But at the same time, I think it's been a few quarters where you said the ex-mortgage, USIS, has been short of your expectations. So I was just curious if you could just help us bridge that gap? And maybe what is your expectation for USIS ex-mortgage for 2020?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes, I think that John talked about, we expect that USIS overall to be in the mid-single digits. With regards to expectations, we've got a high bar here. That's how I operate. I think that's -- Manav, you know that we want that business to return to its historical growth rates. It's making great progress. I think you know, a year ago, when we were on this call with fourth quarter of 2018, that business was in the flat-to-negative mode and was just getting out of the penalty box with our customers. And we're now 4 quarters or so into that recovery. We're making great progress as far as their pipeline's building and their win rates, and we see some really positive momentum as we move into 2020. We expect that business to continue to improve as we go through the year and expect it to return to its historical growth rate. It's just a matter of time. It's still one that -- the non-mortgage growth, there's a lot of variables there as far as pipelines being rebuilt and the timing of closing deals that we've talked about virtually every quarter that since the cybersecurity incident. But we're just seeing deeper pipelines and better win rates, which gives us confidence as we go into 2020.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: I just want to make sure -- to Andrew's initial question, just to make sure I was clear, right? So Equifax has historically performed better than the mortgage index in terms of our revenue. So again, as you're doing your analysis on the implications of our mortgage market guidance in terms of its implication to our non-mortgage revenue growth, you need to please recognize and take a look at history of the fact that we've generally significantly outperformed the mortgage index in terms of our own mortgage revenue growth.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: Got it. John, just 2 clarifications on the guidance. So one, could you just -- is there any M&amp;A baked into it, whether that's India or any of the other tuck-ins you did from this prior year? And then I lost you a little bit on the $0.40 to $0.50 that you're incurring this year and how that -- the savings that you said was 1/3 of the cloud cost or something. I was hoping if you could just help me with that in '21?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Yes. So in terms -- the only thing we include in our guidance is acquisitions that have actually closed, so there'll be no new acquisitions included.</p><p>In terms of the -- I think you're asking about the $0.40 to $0.50 per share in transition costs, in system transition costs?</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: Yes.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: That $0.40 to $0.50 per share is made up of 2 things. We said about 2/3 of it is incremental depreciation, right? So we've been investing heavily over the past several years, building new production systems, cloud-native production systems in the cloud. And as they go into production, obviously, we start to depreciate them. So of that $0.40 to $0.50, we've said about 2/3 of it will be substantial increase in depreciation in 2020 versus 2019. And that's -- and then about 1/3 of the incremental costs is related to duplicate costs in operations because we're running cloud systems as well as our legacy systems in parallel for an extended period of time while we migrate customers. So we're incurring effectively double cost, the cost of the existing legacy premise system as well as the cost of the cloud system during the transition period. And we said that transition cost, the period of running 2 sets of systems, would be about 1/3 of that $0.40 to $0.50 per share. And the final comment I made is on that specific cost, the duplicate cost of running 2 sets of systems, we had said as we move into 2021, as we move through the year, we expect that to actually become a positive, where the savings related to shutting down legacy systems will exceed cloud costs, and that will start to become a positive for the company.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: And Manav, just to add to that. It's Mark. I think as you know, a lot of our investors have asked for some transparency around that because number one, on the second point John raised on the duplicative cloud costs, as you know, those aren't going to be here forever. And those are going to start, as we decommission systems, that will turn into being a positive. There will be some of that 2020. That's in our guidance now and the numbers John talked about, and that only accelerate in 2021, and we'll get to a fully migrated basis sometime in the future, and we'll give you guidance on that. So that was that element. And then on the increased amortization, same thing. That's a temporary element, if you will, which will be there for a number of years of that increased amortization, which is a noncash item, and that's going to work its way down as we amortize off our investments in the cloud costs. And as you know, our intention is to reduce our CapEx spending in 2021 as we complete the cloud migration. So our intention is to be clear about our guidance, which John gave you, but also give the additional visibility of what's inside that guidance so you can be aware and think about what Equifax looks like on the other side.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: And just what was the M&amp;A contribution, John? I know you assume only deals closed. So what is that in 2020?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: It's relatively small, right? If you think about -- we closed PayNet in the -- I think, in the second quarter of 2019, and that was the largest acquisition for the year. So there -- in the fourth quarter, we gave some indication. Total -- the total amount of acquisition revenue was just over 1% of revenue, so not a significant number, and it should decline as we move through 2020. Well, it's -- move through 2020.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from George Mihalos with Cowen.</p><p>ALLISON MICHELLE JORDAN, ASSOCIATE, COWEN AND COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Allison on for George. I wanted to follow up on the comments made about Workforce Solutions margins in the quarter. I think I heard that the year-over-year decline was driven by third-party implementation royalty costs. I'm just curious if there's anything else to call out there, maybe mix? And how we should think about segment margins going forward in 2020?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes, I also mentioned, Allison, that there was some additional sales costs in the fourth quarter in that business, which puts some pressure on margins. I think John also said that we expect that business to expand margins in 2020. And we don't see any change in that, but they're high growth in their inherent margins. That's a business that we expect expanding margins going forward.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: And just to make sure you were clear. The royalty costs are actually separate from the third-party implementation costs, right? So those are 2 different cost items that affected us in the quarter. As well as, obviously, increased sales expense.</p><p>ALLISON MICHELLE JORDAN: Okay, great. That's super helpful. And then just one quick follow-up. Mark, I heard you mention the solid progress being made with positive data in Australia. I'm curious if we should expect any impact from this in 2020?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes, we hope it will be accretive as we go through the year. We've seen in all the markets where positive data comes in, it obviously first takes a lot of time to get that data from the contributors into Equifax and the other credit bureaus and then turning that into usable information that we can take to the marketplace has a lag to it. The good news is we have the data now, which we've been working to get there. So we expect it will be a positive element for that team in 2020.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.</p><p>HAMZAH MAZARI, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: My first question is just if you could just talk about how long your sales cycle today is on new products currently? And maybe how much they're contributing to growth today versus sort of pre-breach, just to give us a sense?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Go. Take it, John.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Perfect. So sales cycle, it really depends on the product, right? So if it's a batch product, something that we've sold historically, that's effectively reselling. It's something that can sometimes be initiated and transacted within a period. For implementing a new online service with a customer, the implementation period can be over a year, right? And it really depends on the service. In terms of NPI contribution, new product contribution in 2019 versus prior years, I think what we tried to be clear on is the level of acceleration we're seeing in new product launches, which we think is very beneficial as we go forward into 2020 and 2021. Obviously, the level of new product revenue we generated in 2019 and 2018 was certainly down from what we saw historically because of the fact that we didn't have the same level of product generation over the 2017-28 (sic) [2018] period. So that was a -- so we're seeing a period of lower new product revenue generation, but we see very good signs that, that will start to recover as we move into 2020 and then certainly, 2021.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: If you heard my comments, just to add on that. New product innovation is a real priority of ours, and it's one that obviously, we had some pressures on following the cybersecurity incident with all our focus on security and remediation and everything else. And I'm pleased that our efforts in 2019 to make this a priority central to Equifax' strategy. And you saw the performance of us rolling out the highest new products in a number of years in 2019, and that emphasis is going to continue. We really believe that our cloud transformation and having our single data fabric and our having our products in the cloud is going to allow us to even accelerate that going forward. And this is an area that we're going to continue to invest resources, time and money on because of the positive impact it will have in the future around our top line by investing in more new products.</p><p>HAMZAH MAZARI: Very helpful. Just a follow-up question, I'll turn it over. Could you give us a sense of how much of your portfolio is sort of directly linked to the credit cycle versus how much of the portfolio is just data similar to sort of an info services company? Any sense of rough percentage? Or qualitatively, anything -- any comments there?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: I think the best thing I can suggest is if you take a look at the earnings deck that we published, we published obviously last quarter, and there'll be one published today. In it, we show revenue by market segment for Equifax and for the -- for each of the business units. And that's probably the best place to take a look to -- so you can judge based on where we sell and how you think that is impacted by the credit cycle. I think that's the best source for you.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: I think the other thing that you should be aware of is that our business and our industry, during a credit cycle, obviously, expenditures by our customers on new originations may come down, but then there's a shift in the focus to the back book, to managing credit lines. So there's an element of counter cyclicality to it. And then the other element that's quite different at Equifax today versus the last economic cycle is the mix of our businesses. We're obviously larger internationally than we were in the last economic cycle. And then second, Workforce Solutions is a very different scale in our business in size. And Workforce Solutions has that additional lever in a credit cycle of the ability to continue to add new data records that are monetizable. So that's another element of -- that's how we think about ourselves if there is a credit cycle, we're very different, in a positive way, than we were in the last credit cycle.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Barry -- Gary Bisbee with Bank of America.</p><p>GARY ELFTMAN BISBEE, MD &amp; RESEARCH ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: I was hoping to dig in a little bit more to the USIS growth organic ex-mortgage slowing from, I guess, it was 3% to slightly positive. Part of it, clearly, I understand financial marketing and an outsized growth quarter last quarter and maybe a more normalized trend number this quarter. And so that's part of it. And you called out a couple of the end markets that were a little weaker. But can you give us any other color just to understand this, and maybe how we think about the cadence of that into Q1? That would be helpful.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Go, John.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Sure. So the -- yes, I think in Mark's script, right, he talked specifically about direct -- our D2C business, which is the transactions we do with our competitors. And part of the reason that was down obviously was because we had a transaction that occurred in -- a sale that occurred in the fourth quarter of '18, that was one-time that didn't recur, and that directly impacted the organic growth in the period.</p><p>And then also, we talked about telco, and yes, it was down, but we think we see very nice path to growth as we get into second quarter and beyond in 2020. So I think overall, we're expecting to see nice improvement in our level of organic non-mortgage growth as we move into 2020 and beyond. So we do like the trend, right? We said it would be choppy, so that doesn't mean the trend is always straight up. But we do like the trend, we do see continuing improvement, that the sales metrics are very good, the level of growth in pipeline is outstanding and we're very happy with our performance. So I think overall, we're expecting to see nice improvement in 2020 relative to 2019 in total and certainly relative to where we ended the year.</p><p>GARY ELFTMAN BISBEE: And then a follow-up, just on the pipeline, you've referred to improvement and growth, but in absolute terms, is like the -- is the pipeline back to where it was in mid-2017? Or are you still below that? And as part of that, historically, with NPI, you guys talked about a 3-year build to sort of mature revenues. '17 and '18, you had a lot less product development in NPI or new products as you were trying to fix some of the challenges. Is the fact that you had those product launches in '19, should we think it's a 3-year process to really get a lot of that stuff, particularly in USIS, getting the business back churning the way one might expect it to on a normalized basis?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: You hit a lot of the challenges that we've had following the cyber event. First was we had a pipeline in place the day before the cyber event happened, and that pipeline went virtually to 0 for the balance of 2017 and through the bulk of 2018. As you know, we were on security freeze for much of 2018. And as we finished '18 and moved into '19, we were able to start getting into a more commercial mode when customers grew quite comfortable about our security protocols and our investments, and that pipeline has been building rapidly through 2019. And John, I don't know if it's -- I believe it's actually back or above where it was pre 2017, and we've seen real growth in that. We've also got a different leader in the business, who's got a real commercial cadence to him, and so there's real intensity around pulling that forward. I wouldn't think about a new product taking a full 3 years to get to revenue. I think we've talked about before that there's a maturity element in that. But each of these new products have a different cycle depending upon the customer. You've got a customer that the operations team or the marketing team or the risk team really likes the product and then they want to test it, and then they go -- we go through a contracting process with their sourcing team many times. And then, of course, then you go into implementation mode, which sometimes includes their IT team. And that creates some unpredictability in a pipeline that, maybe to your point, is less mature, meaning you don't have 2-year-old deals in there, 3-year-old deals, 1-year-old, 6-months, you don't have that layering. Our pipeline today is more of a, call it, a 12-month kind of build versus a historical would have 2, 3 and -- 2- and 3-year kind of deals in there that sometimes take that amount of time. So I think that layering creates some of the choppiness. But the fact that the pipeline is building, we're seeing better win rates out of the pipeline in the second half of the year than the first half, which tells us that we've got a better pipeline. And that commercial activity gives us the enthusiasm about the continued progress of USIS going forward as we get into first quarter in 2020.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: And Mark specifically referenced new deals won in his script. And yes, that is -- that's up higher than we saw prior to 2017.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Right.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: So we think the momentum is good.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>TONI MICHELE KAPLAN, SENIOR ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: In an interview the other day, Mark, you mentioned that you're about 2/3 of the way through the tech transformation. And you mentioned some color earlier in terms of what you've done and what you have left to do. I guess, my question is can you just give some color on how much risk is left in terms of execution? Like have a lot of the difficult items been done already, or is there still a lot to come? And just any color on that would be helpful.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Sure. And I talked a bunch of my comments earlier, Toni, about that. And I think, first off, as you know, these kind of tech transformations are not for the faint of heart, meaning that you use the term risk, but there's a lot to do and a lot to work on. We're 2 years into it, call it that, whatever, that kind of time frame. And the milestones we're achieving around this -- when I think about a tech transformation like this, and I've done them before, obviously, not at this scale, but I've done them before. First off, you have to make sure does the technology work? Meaning, can we get our databases from our legacy applications into the cloud. And I think we're making this big move of going from siloed databases to a single data fabric. And that's in place. We did that in 2019. We've started moving our exchanges. As you know, we have -- I don't know what the number is, but probably a couple hundred exchanges around the globe, close to 50 here in the U.S., where we have some big ones. And we're moving big ones into that new Google Cloud fabric, and it's working. We have customers accessing it. So that's kind of risk #1 is, will the technology work. And I think we're over that hurdle. The second one is you've got to migrate your customers. And we've been very clear with you that the feedback from customers is extremely positive. If you think about it, if you're a customer, do you want to do business with a company that has the very latest technology, that's going to deliver always-on capabilities, that's going to deliver a latency and speed that is not possible in the industry today, and with security that's second to none given the focus on data security. And so customers all want to do it. The wildcard or that one complexity that I talked about in my comments earlier is getting into their schedule. And every one of our customers has an IT team, they've got their own priorities for 2019, '20 and '21, and we just have to make sure we fit into that. So that's, that scheduling or forecasting element that I talked about earlier. But as you also heard in the comments, we're really rolling, meaning we're moving thousands of customers. And so there's real progress there, but it just takes time. And of course, we need to move all our customers off each of our different mainframe or server environments at different data centers we have in order to decommission those and get the savings that we're looking for from the technology transformation. So to me, it's really around execution. And you've heard our transparency around the technology element, and we feel very good about that. And we're making real progress around the customer migrations, but there's still work to be done there.</p><p>TONI MICHELE KAPLAN: Great. And then with the legal settlement almost behind you, pending the final payment, I guess, any new thoughts around capital allocation, notably, like when we could start seeing share repurchases?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes, I think you're leading me towards our financial framework, which, as you know, we pulled in 2017. We've been clear with you that we want to put that back in place. We're getting closer to that time frame. We've been very consistent. We talked about 3 areas that we wanted to make sure we had clarity on before we put that framework back in place, which will include our capital allocation model. One was real clarity on the legal settlements. And with today's announcement of the finalization of the U.S. issues, we're at that stage with that first item.</p><p>Number two is the tech transformation. We already talked about that. Really having some clarity about timetable, our execution, our confidence in that. And I'd say every day and week, we get closer to completing that one.</p><p>And number three is USIS. And we're way further along than we were a year ago, and even in the fourth quarter with our confidence in USIS. And so just a long-winded answer that it's our expectation that the way we're pacing that we're looking to put that framework back in place for sure in 2020.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank next question will come from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.</p><p>WILLIAM ARTHUR WARMINGTON, MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: So first off, a tip of the hat to Jeff Dodge. It's one of those, just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in situations, I think.</p><p>So my question is, you gave some strong new stats on the new deals won in the fourth quarter. I was just hoping to get some color there. You mentioned some on telco, some wins and win backs. But for the new wins, how many are going to new customers? How many are share gains? How many are just additional sales into the same customers?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes, Bill, it's probably hard to split. I would just tell you that it's all of the above. First off, new wins, as you know, a competitive takeaway is hard, and it's one that we all work on, but we've had a handful of those. So that's in that bucket. New products are really a fuel for us, whether it's InstaTouch or Ignite rollouts or some of the new products and scores that we talked about that we've got in the marketplace. Those are bread and butter, really helping our customers grow their originations, solving on fraud. So that's a positive. And then share gains, we've had a handful of those, too. And I think you're talking mostly about USIS in your comments or that's where your question is directed. But of course, broadly, that's the fuel for our growth in Equifax is to look for expanding either new customers, new verticals, penetration and share gains with existing customers. New products are really a big fuel for growth. And I hope you get a sense of the focus we have around the new products. It's a real priority of mine. It's one that I think our tech transformation is going to leverage. It's going to give us real fuel in '20 and '21 and beyond as we go forward to really be more aggressive around funding new products, investing in new products and then bringing them into the marketplace.</p><p>WILLIAM ARTHUR WARMINGTON: And for a follow-up question. Just wanted to see if we could get an update on the FICO partnership, how that's been going? And maybe some comments on the Inflection score that you're putting together with Verisk?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes, first on the FICO partnership, as you know, we announced that last March. We're in the marketplace with our integrated decisioning system inside of FICO with our data piped in there. And we're in with a handful of customer POCs. We've had a handful of customer wins around the globe. So we're pleased with that performance with FICO. And I think you know, we're rolling out some other products, including an AML/KYC here in the United States that's going to be in market in the first quarter. And we've got some other opportunities there. So there's a great collaboration between Equifax and FICO around how we can leverage our respective capabilities in the marketplace, and we'll look forward to that growth going forward.</p><p>The score with Verisk is new. It's just in the marketplace. We've had good response from customers so far. I think it's another example of what we -- what I like to do and we like to do is really collaborating with strong partners like FICO or Verisk to really leverage our respective assets and market capabilities to bring new solutions to the marketplace, and that's just another example. So that one's just newly launched in the marketplace.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from Jeff Meuler with Baird.</p><p>JEFFREY P. MEULER, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes, it sounds like, given the CapEx guidance for 2020, that depreciation is going to continue to build in '21. So can you give us some sense of once you're through EFX2020, and I know there's some spillover into '21, what does CapEx go to as a percentage of revenue on an ongoing basis? Because I think the 25% development savings are both OpEx and CapEx. So that would be part one of the question, so we can get to EBITDA less CapEx.</p><p>And then part two, on the 15%-plus of tax savings within COGS, do you get the substantial majority of that on a gross basis in 2022? And I understood there could be some reinvestment. Just trying to figure out the timing of when you'll get the step-up on that?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Jeff, you're leading us quite tactfully into a financial framework, so let me give you my best response to that. I think they're very good questions. And first, on the CapEx, we're not ready to give '21 guidance, but -- or a financial framework for our capital allocation in the future. But we've been clear with you that we expect: number one, the incremental spend that we've had in '18, '19 and '20, to fund the EFX2020 cloud transformation. We've been very clear that, that's going to come down in '21 and will continue at a more normal rate going forward, meaning versus this incremental rate that we've had in '18, '19 and '20. And we've really shown you what the incremental dollars are. So I think you can think about what it looks like on the other side. And then as you pointed out, we've also been clear that we expect to see development savings, meaning with a new tech stack, with a single standardized set of products, we expect to see savings in the future. So that will be a part of that CapEx benefit in the future post-2020. And where we get the full run rate will be something we'll come to you when we put the financial framework in place.</p><p>On the operating cost savings, we've also been clear that we expect to see inside of our cost structure for technology real savings from going from legacy to cloud. That is -- we have some of that feathering in our guidance. It's in our numbers for 2019 -- I'm sorry, for 2020. That will continue to accelerate through the year as we decommission legacy environments, and that will continue into 2021. And we're not ready to give a run rate on that, but we tried to give you both by sharing what we view as the duplicate costs as well as that guidance around our expectation of 15% to 20% operating cost savings from technology going forward so you can think about what Equifax looks like in the future. And as you know, those 2 benefits, along with -- we expect some accretion to our top line from ability to roll out more new products from the new technology investment are the 3 benefits that we're driving to as a part of this big tech investment.</p><p>JEFFREY P. MEULER: Okay. And then just how meaningful is this EWS data hub concept like the new data sources beyond employment and income data? Just any additional color on that or how meaningful this is.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes. It's another element, Jeff. I think we've been very clear that we think more data results in better decisions for our customers. And EWS has a very unique position in a lot of verticals with their income and employment data that they provide. As you know, it's really the only place to go to get that data set, and a lot of our customers have to go to other data sets to get other data. And either us building that out, us partnering on it or making acquisitions to add those data sets we think is another lever for growth for EWS. It's part of that theme that I've used with the team internally and with you and others in the investment community that while Workforce Solutions is clearly our best business, it's performing way above the rest of Equifax. We think about it being in the second inning with the opportunities in front of it, both in its core business, but also in what it can do around things like leveraging its market position and its unique data assets with other capabilities in order to bring more value to our customers.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.</p><p>ANDREW OWEN NICHOLAS, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: You touched briefly on your decision to increase your ownership stake to 100% in ECIS in India, which is obviously a fast-growing market. Can you talk a little bit more about your business in India today, how you think about the opportunity set there? And then any color on ECIS' competitive positioning? That would be helpful.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes. It's a business that, as you know, we've been in for a long time. We like the market a lot. We had the opportunity and strategically owning 100% of the business makes it easier to operate, easier to control, and then we kind of own our whole destiny. So we're very pleased to move forward on that. I think it's a market we want to be in. It's a market that we want to grow. You may know that we're doing a build of Workforce Solutions in India, as an example. We started that a couple of years ago, and that's got some traction on it. We just think it's a market that we want to play in. And one that's a big market.</p><p>ANDREW OWEN NICHOLAS: Great. And then just back on organic revenue growth guidance, just to ask it another way. Can you just walk us through what you consider to be the primary factors that would drive you to the top and bottom ends of that guide outside of any changes to mortgage inquiry volumes?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes, I'll give you a few thoughts. I don't want to go too far in this. But obviously, USIS is still not back to where it was before the cyber event. And we're convinced -- I've been very clear. It's not a matter of if, it's only when. But their recovery, which we see great momentum in, if that accelerates, that's a real positive for us near term and long term, so that's a very positive one.</p><p>International, I think as you know, we gave guidance on where we expect the year to be, but we're still battling some economic headwinds. Brexit, while it's resolved, there's still some uncertainty on implementation and what it's going to do to the economy over there, so I think that's a little bit of a headwind. Latin America seems to have settled down, but that tends to be temporary. There's always issues and challenges down there. And of course, Australia, we've seen some positive momentum, but the recent wildfires there, some are saying could have an economic impact there. So I think that's another factor in there.</p><p>And then the real positive is, obviously, Workforce Solutions has some great momentum, is performing extremely well, and that's kind of a bedrock inside of Equifax that we've got a lot of confidence in, that they continue to perform. And they performed last year above our expectations quite significantly. And we expect them to continue to perform very, very well in 20 -- 2020.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Just want to be clear, right? So we provided overall guidance, and we provided mortgage market inquiry guidance, right? We didn't give mortgage guide -- mortgage revenue guidance or non-mortgage revenue guidance. And again, just to repeat where we started, right? So we did say flat for the total mortgage inquiry market, but people should keep in mind that historically, we have performed -- our revenue has performed better than the overall mortgage inquiry market, in some cases, substantially. So that's a judgment you're going to have to make for yourself.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes, [Brian] on for George. So I was just looking at your 2020 revenue guidance, which I know comes below your prior long-term target of 6% to 8%. I know you haven't reinstated financial targets yet. But based on customer conversation, to what degree do you believe long-term organic growth potential of the business isn't halted?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes. Again, got a similar question earlier, [Brian], on long-term guidance, we clearly gave you our guidance for 2020. We're not ready to put a long-term financial framework back in place. Although we're working towards that in 2020. We talked about the things we want to see, and we're getting really close to that. So I think I'll just leave it at that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay. And then for your revenue guidance, what level of price increases are baked into that?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Yes. So we didn't give specific information on price increases, right? So generally speaking, there's some level of price increase in the market. However, for credit reports, in general, if you think about those, they tend to go down in price over time. So we haven't given specific price increase guidance as part of this process.</p><p>And operator, we have time for one more.</p><p>OPERATOR: And our final question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.</p><p>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM, MD, STIFEL, NICOLAUS &amp; COMPANY, INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: The company used to just give straight-out organic growth, excluding mortgage. And I was just wondering, there's a lot of positivity in terms of the sales momentum. That's not a number, though, that you're providing now. And I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more just clarity -- just as the rubber meets the road, the organic growth of the business, excluding the mortgage, just so that we can track. Was it a little bit up? Was it a little bit down? Where are we doing in terms of actual sales and things coming into revenue?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: So we actually are giving that -- we gave that number, I think, each quarter last year, right, in terms of organic non-mortgage growth. We indicated this quarter, it was up slightly. Last quarter, I think it was just under 3%. And I think we gave it each of the first 2 quarters as well. So we are trying to give that indication. And we're also trying to separately give a view of just what the market did so you can have some perspective. So I think the depth of information is actually quite good in terms of how USIS is performing to let you kind of disaggregate the performance by piece.</p><p>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM: So this -- I'm talking about for the whole company. So that net numbers -- the numbers you're referring to for the whole company?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: That's for USIS.</p><p>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM: Okay. And just -- if I took the whole company together just in mortgage, and should I look at it as like 8.5% growth, minus 4% that would be implied by -- inquiries?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: So Shlomo, we do give mortgage as what percentage of the total company mortgage revenue is, right? So I think from that, you can get a good view as what -- of what mortgage revenue is for the entire company and how it's changing. And that's information we also provide.</p><p>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM: So is it going up or down? I mean, just -- it's just a question. If I look at it, is the mortgage, the non-mortgage revenue organically up or down? And just -- I know it's choppy. I'm just trying to see if I can do the calculation the way I used to do it.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: So that isn't something specifically we disclose, right? So -- but I kind of walked you through what we do disclose, and that I think the information is available for you to do whatever analytics you'd like, okay?</p><p>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM: Okay. And then what drove the strong EBITDA margins in international?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Yes. So I think Mark walked through that in his discussion, right? So we got back to growth. They did some very significant cost reduction actions. As you take a look at fourth quarter of '18 and 2019 through that entire period. So their cost structure got nicely better. And as they return to growth, they got a lot of leverage from that in the fourth quarter. And they also had some benefit from income from some minority investments. So those 3 things drove their higher EBITDA margin.</p><p>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM: So is that -- were the cost takeouts a way that we can look at them kind of establishing a base here? Or as that ramps, that we should be ramping from this kind of level?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Yes. So the significant majority of the cost actions, I think, that they plan to take have been executed. So yes, this is kind of the base of cost that we're starting from. The base that we ended with in 4Q '19.</p><p>Okay. We'd like to thank everybody for participating, and we'll talk to you again soon.</p><p>OPERATOR: And that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Rodney Alfv\u00e9n, and I'm heading the Investor Relations at Nordea. We will start with a presentation by the President and Group CEO, Frank Vang-Jensen. That will then be followed by a Q&amp;A session with Frank; the group CFO, Christopher Rees and myself.</p><p>So Frank, please.</p><p>FRANK VANG-JENSEN, PRESIDENT &amp; GROUP CEO, NORDEA BANK ABP: Thank you, Rodney. So good morning. Today, we have published our fourth quarter and full year results for 2019. Moreover, this has been the first quarter of the new phase of Nordea, and we have taken the first steps to deliver on our business plans and financial targets. The Q4 results reflects our priorities are now very much as planned. As a part of the first steps in our updated business plan, we announced a new organizational structure with clear roles and responsibilities and full accountability in the business areas. It means that the business areas now have greater influence over the size and cost of internal processes and tools, as well as the level of support functions they need and can afford.</p><p>In relation to the new organization structure, I'm happy to announce that we have now established the new group leadership team, with new senior leaders being appointed. The team is committed to our targets and is ready to deliver. There are several promising signs that we are delivering towards the financial targets for '22 with higher income and business volume and lower costs. But of course, we have a lot of hard work ahead of us to get to where we want to be. Therefore, we will continue to focus on our 3 key priorities to deliver on our '22 financial targets. And these are to optimize operational efficiency, to drive income growth initiatives and to create great customer experiences.</p><p>In the last quarter of the year, we started executing on the updated business plan. We continued to grow in all markets and gain market shares. We had good business activity and solid lending growth, especially in the private and SME segments. One good example of how we are exploring opportunities, to strengthen our customer offerings, build a stronger market position and grow income took place in December last year, when we announced the acquisition of SG Finans. The company runs a successful business with very satisfied customers in 3 of our 4 home markets. The acquisition strengthens us and our ability to advise and help small and mid-sized corporates with their financial needs.</p><p>In Q4, cost-to-income ratio was down to 57%. We are targeting 50% in '22. The key drivers for the improved cost-to-income ratio are our customer focus and income initiatives. It is now starting to be evident in the top line. Compared to the fourth quarter of '18, revenue increased by 6%. We have also been able to improve our efficiency and delivered on our '19 cost plans. The number of people was down in Q4. The number of external consultants was down 9%, and internal traveling was clearly lower. We have taken the first steps to establish a new cost culture. We are proceeding as planned and as communicated at the Capital Markets Day in October.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, our net loan losses were somewhat higher than normal. And the reason for that -- for this was additional provisions on a couple of large corporate exposures. Our expectations for the coming quarters is that the credit quality will remain largely unchanged. The common equity tier 1 ratio increased to 16.3%, which is 120 basis points above our management buffer. This strong capital position enables us to meet any potential changes in regulatory requirements and capture growth opportunities. We had a return on equity of 7.6%. We are targeting above 10%, which means that we have a lot of work ahead of us.</p><p>To deliver on our targets, we need to take steps forward to create better customer experiences, and we have started to make gradual progress. We have managed to shorten waiting times significantly in our 24/7 contact centers. The number of customer complaints have decreased by 20%, and we have better stability in our systems.</p><p>In '19, we launched our new Nordic mobile banking platform, which has been very well received by our customers. Of course, we are far from being satisfied in particular customers in the broader segments, they should expect more of us. But at least, we have a positive trend in the customer satisfaction across all business areas.</p><p>As announced and communicated in connection with our financial targets, in October, the Board proposes EUR 0.40 dividend to the AGM.</p><p>Let me now go deeper into the fourth quarter results. I'll talk about these items individually in a moment. But I'm encouraged by the fact that we are making progress on cost to income, both compared to the previous quarter and to the same quarter last year. We have a long way to go, but it's good to see the direction. Total revenues were up 6%, while costs were down 5% compared to the same quarter in '18. Return on equity increased compared to the fourth quarter of '18.</p><p>To compare the full year results, '19 to '18, total income was 1% lower than last year, but also cost declines by 1%, reaching our '19 absolute cost targets of EUR 4.9 billion. The cost-to-income ratio was thus unchanged compared to '18, and return on equity was 8.1%.</p><p>When we compare with same quarter last year, you can see that net interest income is not contributing to the group's income growth of 6%, since margin pressure had a negative impact. However, we see an encouraging development when comparing with Q3. The net interest income was up 2% or 3% in local currencies, supported by increased volumes in all business areas. Lending margins were under pressure throughout '19, but stabilized somewhat in the latter part of '19. Interest rate movements in the same period had a negative impact on deposit margins in both Denmark and Finland. Compared to Q3, our funding cost improved, leading to an unchanged total margin for the group. Other income compared to the previous quarter was stable over the year.</p><p>Business volumes grew in '19 after several years of decline. Personal Banking volumes increased in all countries. In Business Banking, volumes showed a positive trend in large corporates and institutions. We gained volume growth in Finland and in Sweden. Lending volumes were up 5% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. We regained market shares in mortgages and grew volume in all countries. Our customer focus and income initiatives improved performance.</p><p>Deposit volumes were higher, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Assets under management were at an all-time high, up 16% year-on-year despite the difficult start of the year. We had a total net inflow of EUR 9 billion in '19 -- or in 2019. We expect the net inflow to continue in '20.</p><p>Net fee and commission income was a major driver of our solid income growth in the quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, net fee and commission income increased by 9% in local currencies. Assets and wealth management was the main contributor and generates half of the group's fee and commission income. Lending activity remained at a high level, driving -- driven by our debt capital markets and from high refinancing activities in Denmark.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, we had a broad-based improvement in customer-driven net fair value, which was up 46% compared to the same quarter last year. Corporate activity in Business Banking was especially strong, driven by both FX and interest rates. In large corporates and institutions, customer activity increased somewhat and market-making activities improved during the end of the year but are still at subdued levels. Asset management, where most of the net fair value result stems from, life and pensions, was seasonally strong in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Time to move on to the business areas results. In Personal Banking, total income was 2% higher compared to a year ago, since we have seen tough margin pressure in the last 12 months. So we have more to do in Personal Banking to develop the results we aim for and expect. In setting this, we also see signs of stabilizing margins, which makes us slightly more comfortable regarding revenue development. Costs were largely unchanged, and the cost-to-income ratio improved by 1 percentage point to 58%.</p><p>Our volume trend in mortgages represents higher customer activity for us. There is a positive volume growth quarter-on-quarter in all markets. During '19, we incrementally increased our activities within this business, and we are now seeing a much stronger momentum compared to earlier years. Our omni-channel and service offering supports business development by creating a better customer experience and offering the scale we need to improve our sales.</p><p>In Business Banking, key ratios continued to improve, driven by better business activity and our initiative is to free up more time for our advisers. Sweden was the key income driver with double-digit growth, and Norway also had a solid growth. Revenue increased by 5% and costs decreased by 5%, leading to a 4 percentage point improvement in the cost-to-income ratio to 49%. Pressured deposit margins are partly offsetting the results.</p><p>The acquisition of SG Finans is now in the closing progress -- process. SG Finans has a diversified customer base of about 50,000 corporates in Norway, in Sweden and in Denmark, that will get access to Nordea's full product offering throughout this acquisition.</p><p>In our newly named business area, Large Corporates &amp; Institutions, we started our strategic repositioning during latter part of '19. We are in early stage of the execution, but the first actions has been taking effect. Total costs came down by 4% in the quarter, including a minus 6% in the number of staff. Economic capital has been reduced by EUR 400 million compared to the previous quarter in '19. Of the reduction of economic capital, approximately EUR 250 million comes from the ECB decision to lower the risk weights from 100% to 50% on commercial real estate in Sweden and in Norway. The Swedish FSA decision to increase risk weights for Swedish banks to 25% to 35% improves our ability to compete on a more level playing field in Sweden. However, our risk weights are still higher than our Swedish peers. So it is important for us to improve the internal-based risk models.</p><p>On the income side, net fair value was up 19% compared to Q3, and net interest income up 3% quarter-on-quarter, following higher lending volumes and customer margins. With improving revenues and cost discipline, the cost-to-income ratio improved from 66% to 51% compared to a year ago. However, the return is still far away from a satisfactory level, but we are determined to meet the '22 targets, which is the first milestone.</p><p>Asset &amp; Wealth Management continued to deliver good investment performance and reported positive net inflows for the fourth consecutive quarter. 85% of funds have outperformed indices over the last 3 years, which we are very satisfied with, given our focus on actively managed assets.</p><p>Our ESG funds attracted a lot of interest, and the value of these assets increased by 140% over the year and represent 40% of net inflow during '19. Net flows were lower compared to the previous quarter, but stronger in retail and private banking. The total net inflow during '19 was EUR 9 billion. Revenues increased by 7% compared to the fourth quarter of '18. And costs decreased by 13%. It's promising that the cost-to-income ratio decreased to 40% in Q4.</p><p>Let me come back to the group results. First, let's look at costs. Our actions in '19 followed the cost plan. Costs were reduced by 4% compared to '18. In Q4, the number of staffs was down by 2%. Depreciation amounted to EUR 156 million. All of this led to a cost-to-income ratio of 57%. In '20, we expect to reduce costs by approximately EUR 200 million and reach a cost base of below EUR 4.7 billion, with planned continued net cost reductions beyond 2020. All of this is in line with our communicated cost plan, and we are proceeding as planned towards our '22 targets.</p><p>At our Capital Markets Day, we said that the cost target would require some EUR 700 million to EUR 800 million in gross savings. I would like to emphasize that, one thing is short term to take down a structurally too high cost base. Another thing is our long-term way of working. For me, it is critical that we build a strong cost culture. This work will take several years. We are fully committed to scrutinize all corners of our business and group functions to find ways to operate smarter and more efficient toward complex solutions. We should be proud of always improving our cost efficiency.</p><p>This work has started. And as I said in the beginning, the number of people is falling, the number of consultants is falling and traveling spend is declining. In Q4, we identified over 70 cost savings initiatives, and the first ones have already been implemented. For example, we have consolidated expenses for legal services with a small number of preferred legal firms and strengthening our internal procedures to optimize value for money. We have also been able to simplify our product offering and closed 80 account products. We will proceed with a wide range of cost initiatives also in '20.</p><p>Our cost plan will have staff impacts. We need to be fewer people going forward. And we will do our utmost to support our people and assist those impacted by changes. We will also make sure that the changes will not hurt our business. Today, we have better solutions and tools to face this new business environment. Our asset quality continues to be solid and impaired loans have been stable throughout the year.</p><p>As mentioned before, additional provisions on a couple of specific corporate exposures in Q4 increased loan losses provisions somewhat to reach 17 basis points for the quarter. Based on the current macroeconomic environment, our expectations for the coming years -- or coming quarters, sorry, is that the credit quality will remain largely unchanged.</p><p>With the current, somewhat weaker macroeconomic environment and geopolitical risks, trade tensions and now even potential health risks, business needs solid grounds under their feet. Our balance sheet gives us a very strong foundation in an uncertain environment. In 2019, total assets amounted to EUR 555 billion. The group's common equity tier 1 capital ratio increased to 16.3%, at the end of the Q4 2019, which is 120 basis points above our management buffer. This increase was mainly driven by the reduction in risk weights of -- on commercial real estate in Sweden and in Norway from 100% to 50%, following an updated decision from the ECB as a part of the annual supervisory dialogue.</p><p>The acquisition of SG Finans will consume some 40 basis points of the excess capital. We have a strong balance sheet that enables us to meet potential changes in regulatory requirements and to continue to capture growth opportunities.</p><p>In Nordea, we are here to help people to realize their dreams and everyday aspirations. Our balance sheet provides good opportunities to handle the unknown and grow business. Eventually, our success is dependent on our customers. At the end of the day, it is the only way to achieve sustainable growth. Everything we do starts and ends with the customers. Our target is to meet and exceed our customers' expectations. We will do that with a proactive approach. We understand that we need to step up, and we have started to make progress. We have invested throughout the organization to improve our customer experiences. We have increased advisers availability and reduced the time spent on administrative tasks. Waiting times in our contact centers have decreased significantly. We have increased flexibility to open our doors wider with extended opening hours on evenings and weekends. Nordea is truly available anywhere and anytime 24/7.</p><p>We want to do banking smoother and easier for our customers. With the major investments we are making in technology, we are continuously expanding our digital offers. We have launched a new Nordic mobile platform, which has been very well received by our customers. And our digital platform has now 1 billion touchpoints per year. More recently, we have introduced an easy digital solution to help our customers track their carbon footprint on the mobile.</p><p>We want to lead the way by taking actions. We are keen to lead a sustainable banking operation. We integrate sustainability throughout the bank, benefiting both our customers and the societies around us. This is a clear strength in the industry, and we want to accelerate our actions to help customers make sustainable choices. And in '19, we had a wide range of new initiatives, including 11 new funds, expanding green corporate loans and mortgages as well as offering green car loans. I expect this development to continue throughout '20.</p><p>We published our new financial targets in the Q3 report. Our new capital and dividend policy states that we should have a management buffer of 150 to 200 basis points above the requirements, and a dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of net profit. We intend to distribute excess capital through our buybacks. The Board proposes a dividend per share of EUR 0.40, in line with the communication in Q3.</p><p>When we decided on our 3 years' financial targets, we analyzed the current macroeconomic and operational environment. We also analyzed the big trends of the banking industry. For example, the low rate environment, low cost-based services in assets and wealth management, a megatrend of digitalization as well as new competition with big tech and fintechs. We are convinced that we will meet our targets by focusing on 3 priorities: to optimize operational efficiency, to drive income growth initiatives and to create great customer experiences. We are focused on execution, and we are committed to moving forward in the right direction step-by-step and determined to deliver. Thank you for your attention.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00e9N: Thank you for that, Frank. We now close this webcast, and we will start an audio telephone conference where you can ask questions to Frank; to Christopher Rees, the CFO; and to myself. So please move over to the audio.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The first question we have is from the line of Peter Kessiakoff from SEB.</p><p>PETER KESSIAKOFF, RESEARCH ANALYST, SEB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Peter Kessiakoff from SEB here. Just a short -- a few short questions to you, Frank. I mean first of all, looking at the capital ratio, which clearly was strong in the quarter, what's your kind of updated view on the likelihood of buybacks now perhaps coming during the early parts of 2020? And also how do you pair that with the potential for further acquisitions? I mean you've made a few smaller bolt-on acquisitions like SG Finans recently. Could they be coming more in the short term? Or are you basically integrating this? Those are my first 2 questions.</p><p>FRANK VANG-JENSEN: Thank you for the question. We have a very strong capital base. And we have a policy having a 150 to 200 basis points above requirement. And at the moment, we are running 320 basis points above. There are some incoming factors we need to be aware of. The one is, of course, SG Finans. That will -- for that, we will use around 40 basis points -- no, 40 percentage points -- 40 basis points, yes, of course. And then we have incoming, you can say, local buffer demands. For example, in Denmark, we have an increased countercyclical buffer. All in all, some 60 basis points we expect to have an impact from these actions. And then what will happen in -- during '20, we, of course, will carefully follow. But of course, the law -- our intention is not to run the bank with too much capital. We want to basically stay within our buffers. That is our intentions. But the timing of when we will be ready for buybacks is still an open question.</p><p>PETER KESSIAKOFF: All right. And then just on risk exposure amount and the reduction that we saw in this quarter, which is then, to some extent, perhaps, front-loading some of the benefits from model approvals with ECB that you've mentioned might come during the end of this year. What's the updated communication around that? Should we still expect some benefits coming through during the end of this year?</p><p>FRANK VANG-JENSEN: Chris, would you take that one?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES, GROUP CFO, HEAD OF GROUP FINANCE &amp; TREASURY, NORDEA BANK ABP: Yes, thank you. As you've pointed out, we had a reduction in risk-weighted assets this quarter. And as Frank mentioned in his speech, that is mainly due to the dialogue we've had in our ongoing discussions with the ECB as part of the SREP, in terms of reducing the risk weight floors on the corporate real estate portfolios in Norway and Sweden. That's the main reason for that. So that is actually not necessarily a model change per se. So as we continue and progress according to plans with our model development program, which we have previously announced, we would submit those applications during this year. Then, ECB will take a certain amount of time in terms of reverting back to us with respect to the outcome of those models. And as such, that timing is unclear and uncertain for us. So I expect we deliver this year, and then we'll see where the ECB comes back. But I suspect that will go into '21.</p><p>PETER KESSIAKOFF: Okay. Any comments on kind of the magnitude of that?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: No, we can't comment on the magnitude of that, I'm afraid.</p><p>PETER KESSIAKOFF: Okay. I thought I'd try. Then just a final question. On margins, where it seems like you have a bit more optimistic message around margins that the pressures are leveling off and so on. Is that -- are those comments based on kind of the trends you're seeing on the lending margin side? Or is it mainly impacted by that we have had kind of ECB tiering, implementation of negative deposit rates in Denmark and so on, which could, to some extent, be seen as kind of one-off improvements? So what's your view on the margin trend throughout 2020?</p><p>FRANK VANG-JENSEN: If I should start, Chris. So on the mortgage side, I think we have seen stabilizing trends now recent quarter. And of course, the difference between the countries, but Denmark quite stable, a little bit up in Sweden. Finland and Norway, yes, a little bit down. But all in all, I think we -- it seems more stable than it did a quarter ago. Then we have the deposit side and deposit side, you can say is, of course, we had an impact earlier, or it was in Q3, after the change of the ECB rate. And remember that the changes or adjustments we have done in Denmark, charging negative interest rates for deposits above EUR 100,000 has not been implemented. Actually, it has been implemented, but from 1st of February. So all in all, including the corporate segment, we -- with the information we have right now at the end of Q4, I think it looks more stable than in Q3.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question we have is from Robin Rane from Kepler Cheuvreux.</p><p>ROBIN RANE, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, KEPLER CHEUVREUX, RESEARCH DIVISION: So if I start with, in the quarter, staff costs were down partly due to lower variable costs. But now as the business momentum seems to improve, how sustainable is the lower staff cost that we saw in the quarter? That's my first question.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Yes, thank you for the question. We -- as you pointed out, yes, variable compensation was lower. That is, of course, related to the fact that performance for the firm was lower. But you also look at the salaries for the staff, the fixed salaries, and they were also lower this quarter. And this quarter, we've also reduced head count by 500 FTEs. So we do think that we need to work with both the income line, continue focusing on the priorities that Frank set out, and some of the activities as well as the cost line. We can see that the run rate of our fixed salary costs have actually come down quite a lot in the second half of this year, and we expect a continuation of that.</p><p>ROBIN RANE: All right. And then on fees. So in Denmark, as -- in 2019, as rates have come down, there has been a lot of remortgaging activity, to my understanding. How has that -- this impacted fees in 2019?</p><p>FRANK VANG-JENSEN: Yes. Chris?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: In Denmark, as you know, we have a very specific mortgage market. And there, yes, we have had a lot of activity in Q3, and that impacted revenues and fees in a good way, particularly in Q3, both for Personal Banking and for Business Banking. We also had a good level of that activity in Q4, not quite as good as Q3, but still good. As we look forward, I would suspect that, that will come down and soften up a little bit as we move into Q1. But overall, that has been a good revenue generator in the second half of this year -- or last year, '19, I guess.</p><p>ROBIN RANE: All right. And then last question. As the risk weights on corporate real estate was lowered now at the end of the quarter, will you -- will this, in a way, affect your pricing in this segment?</p><p>FRANK VANG-JENSEN: No, it will not. It will lead to that our, you can say, competitiveness will -- has been -- will increase. But remember, we came from 100% to 50%, and we are still competing in the Swedish market with banks having lower risk weights within the segment. So it will not impact our prices, at least not by design from here.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question we have is from the line of Andreas Hakansson from Danske Bank.</p><p>ANDREAS HAKANSSON, RESEARCH ANALYST, DANSKE BANK MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Two follow-up questions really. On the NII, I mean we saw in the fourth quarter that finally -- that the lending volume impact was bigger than the lending margin impact, but that you had a negative deposit margin impact. But given the items you talked about with Danish negative rates, but then we also had the Swedish rate hike and ECB tiering, do you think that the deposit margin will actually turn into a positive in Q1? That's the first question.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00e9N: Thank you, Andreas. Chris, will you take that one, please.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Andreas, as we look forward...</p><p>ANDREAS HAKANSSON: We can hardly hear you.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Sorry. Thanks, Andreas. Yes, I think if we look forward, of course, the deposit margin this quarter -- or last quarter was impacted by the rate movements, and in particular, the deposit margin in Denmark and Finland, therefore. I think there will be some, not fully adjustments in Denmark, as Frank pointed out. So I think there's still some pressure on deposit margins there. I think we have a tailwind in Sweden, but we also have a headwind in Finland. So I would still suspect a subdued deposit margin as we go forward in Q1.</p><p>ANDREAS HAKANSSON: But not the same magnitude, right, or...</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Not the same magnitude, but it still would be a headwind.</p><p>ANDREAS HAKANSSON: Sure. And then on the staff cost side. You talked about quite large FTE reductions. Could you tell us how did that develop over the quarter, and -- i.e., did -- was the impact really small in the fourth quarter in terms of costs since people were fired in the end of the year? And how much of the restructuring charge have you used by now?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: So your first question with respect to staff, I think over the year, we're broadly flattish in staff. We've reduced the Nordics somewhat. But of course, we've also hired in Poland. If you look at the quarter, the last quarter, we saw a clear reduction in net staff of 500 FTEs approximately. That was also including the fact that we hired 250 in Poland as part of that shift. We expected a lot of that...</p><p>ANDREAS HAKANSSON: Yes, but I meant when did the net reduction happen in the quarter? So -- because it didn't happen on the first day of the quarter and it rather happened towards the end since you launched the plan. So is the cost savings rather going to come through in Q1?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: So it happens throughout the -- evenly throughout the quarter. And so you will see -- if you look at large corporate institution, where a large part of that was, costs came down by 4%, but FTEs were down by 6%. So yes, you will see some of that effect coming into Q1.</p><p>ANDREAS HAKANSSON: And how much of a restructuring charge have you used up by now?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: That we can't comment upon, yes, but of course, we have utilized the restructuring charges that we took in Q3 as part of this. But it is -- remember, the restructuring charge is for the whole of '20 and beyond. So that is something that we will be using continuously throughout next year.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question we have is from the line of Magnus Andersson from ABG.</p><p>MAGNUS ANDERSSON, RESEARCH ANALYST, ABG SUNDAL COLLIER HOLDING ASA, RESEARCH DIVISION: If I can follow-up on Andreas' questions, just on the head count. It's, of course, encouraging to see the FTEs down by 500 quarter-on-quarter and also that is quite broad-based, both in Personal Banking, large corporate institutions and group functions. Can you say anything about what we should expect in terms of head count progression during 2020?</p><p>FRANK VANG-JENSEN: Yes, I can take that. No, no, we don't guide on the number of FTEs. Of course, I understand why you're asking, but we don't do that. So we focus on the cost to income. And as we have a -- as we don't have the right balance between cost and income, and 70% of our cost base is related to people, of course, it will lead to -- unfortunately, to be towards having fewer people. And I think what we have seen in Q4 is as planned.</p><p>MAGNUS ANDERSSON: Okay. But given that you took a restructuring charge of more than EUR 200 million in Q3, I guess it's fair to assume that this number should continue to decline every quarter until your plan is fulfilled, right?</p><p>FRANK VANG-JENSEN: That would be fair to believe, yes.</p><p>MAGNUS ANDERSSON: Yes. Okay. And then just on NII. Is there anything that prevents you from introducing negative rates in Finland, on the deposit side, like you've done in Denmark?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00e9N: We have no such plans. It is -- you can say basically, the question is relevant in 2 countries. It is Denmark and it is Finland. These are either euro countries or connected to the euro. And in Denmark, you know where we are. And in Finland, I should say that the structure, you could say, structural question, of course, it's the same, but you also need to have a market that are -- that is ready to handle the negative interest rates. And as I see it now, that is not the case at the moment.</p><p>MAGNUS ANDERSSON: Okay. But it is -- I think the Finnish FSA was out saying that it would be okay before Christmas, right?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00e9N: The information I have is not showing any hinder technically to do it. But of course, the question is more complex than just using a technical approach. So at the moment, we don't have any plans to introduce negative interest rates in Finland.</p><p>MAGNUS ANDERSSON: Okay. And then just on your acquisition on SG Finans. I just have a question there. Since in the press release you said you expect an income impact of EUR 140 million, but if I annualize the 9-month '19 number, I get to EUR 155 million, and they've had quite good growth historically. So what am I missing here? I'm arriving at a larger impact than you suggest. Do you expect any client runoff? Any clients to stay with SG? Or are you not buying the whole company? Or what's the reason for your estimate there relative to what they are actually reporting?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00e9N: Yes, thank you. I guess it's a positive question, so but a very relevant question. So Chris, any information around that question.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Yes. I mean we obviously purchased them and had a discussion with them before the -- earlier in the year. And there is a little bit of crossover, but not that much. And then, of course, we hope to be able to leverage that acquisition even further as -- and their client base because we do think that they has a very good complement to our business, both geographically and technology, and also the way they do the business and how they approach credit. So in that sense, it's a good acquisition for us. And we hope to leverage it as we go forward into '21.</p><p>MAGNUS ANDERSSON: Yes. But I mean, my question was really, why do you estimate the income impact to be EUR 140 million? And that's -- the acquisition will go through in Q4 2020 perhaps. So that should be 2021 or so, while they are already now making EUR 155 million and growing quite rapidly. Shouldn't that number be significantly higher?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: I think that is the number that we have used. There is a little bit of a crossover on clients and so contracts that we overlap with. So there will be some reduction. And I think that's the estimate. But of course, as we go forward, we would like to grow that business as well when it's on board.</p><p>MAGNUS ANDERSSON: Okay. But you're buying the whole company. There's no carve-out or anything?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: No. Behind the Nordic business, yes.</p><p>MAGNUS ANDERSSON: Yes. Okay. And finally, just a detailed question, follow-up on Robin's question on net commission income. Your lending fees remained very strong in Q4. Is that mainly remortgaging fees?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Remortgaging was positive, as I mentioned, in Q3 and Q4. And as I said, it might become a little bit softer as we go into Q1. But it was also related to the capital markets business that we've had, that's been very strong in the second half of the year. And we -- that momentum, we have been -- we hope to continue. So it's not just mortgaging fees. It's also lending PCM.</p><p>MAGNUS ANDERSSON: Okay. And just on income, so just the EUR 150 million you mentioned at the Capital Markets Day as a potential decline in what you formerly called wholesale banking because of your reduction there. Is that estimate still valid? And how should we think about it in terms of timing?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Yes. The -- if you remember what we said in the Capital Markets Day, what our targets were for wholesale banking and what we need to improve, both our operational efficiency as well, and most importantly, our returns. And that number was part of the fact that we do need to reduce risk-weighted assets for wholesale banking. And those targets communicated in the Capital Markets Day remain the same now as well. So there's no change in that. And that timing will obviously be over the next few years to achieve those targets in '22.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question we have is from the line of Sofie Peterzens from JPMorgan.</p><p>SOFIE CAROLINE ELISABET PETERZENS, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Here is Sofie from JPMorgan. I just had a question on net interest income. Some of the -- when we look at a divisional level, most of the quarter-on-quarter improvement actually comes from group functions. And also got a new LC and I division and still you always have a higher fourth quarter NII, given that you have some bridge financing and other things. How should we think about kind of NII in the first quarter? Are there any like group functions? Should it remain at the current level of plus EUR 8 million? Or will it change? Or how should we basically think about that going forward? That's my question.</p><p>FRANK VANG-JENSEN: Chris, please?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: In terms of the group functions, there were a couple of specific events, tiering -- ECB tiering came in, in November. That is actually going to be stable income that we are going to distribute, and that should be in the business areas. So that will be supportive for the business areas. Then we also had a call of some sub-debt that improved our cost of funds, which is more of a one-off. As we look forward on that line, I would expect that line to, again, be more in the negative territory, call it, EUR 0 to EUR 10 million negative. So this is a positive quarter with respect to that. But going forward, it would be more normalized.</p><p>SOFIE CAROLINE ELISABET PETERZENS: Okay. That's very clear. And then my second question would be on your intangibles. They increased by EUR 100 million in the quarter. Could you just explain what drove the EUR 100 million increase in intangibles this quarter? And could you also confirm that you're not taking any kind of restructuring costs through the balance sheet?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: I mean the intangibles was basically part of our continued investments in our -- both our digital platforms and our core banking platforms. So that's relatively normal. And I can confirm that. Of course, we have -- we -- on a semiannual basis, we do look at our assets, but we looked -- we had a change in our business plans, as you know, in Q3, and made a large impairment then. So I expect those to be very much more significantly smaller, if at all, going forward.</p><p>SOFIE CAROLINE ELISABET PETERZENS: Okay. Yes. Last question, sorry. On the credit quality, you say that it should remain broadly unchanged, that is versus loan losses, that was the previous guidance. How should we think about the kind of loan losses going forward? So when you talk about stable credit quality, should we use the fourth quarter as the base? Or should we use 2019 as a base? Or what would be a good base for kind of stable asset quality?</p><p>FRANK VANG-JENSEN: Rod, do you want to take that one?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00e9N: Yes. Thanks, Sofie. The reason we moved from loan loss guidance to credit quality guidance is simply the fact that the loan losses are as low as they have been in previous years, and we expect them to continue to be low. Also small movements make big changes in percentage points. So therefore, we want to refer to the credit quality instead. Then if you're looking at the loan losses, I would like to answer it this way. If you look at our website, we have published consensus on loan losses of EUR 354 million, and that's not the number that makes us nervous.</p><p>SOFIE CAROLINE ELISABET PETERZENS: So you -- basically, you're saying, consensus estimates on loan losses look reasonable, do you?</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00e9N: They look sensible. Yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question we have is from the line of Jacob Kruse from Autonomous.</p><p>JACOB MAX KRUSE, PARTNER, SCANDINAVIAN BANKS, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: So 2 questions, I guess. Firstly, on the capital side. When it comes to buybacks and the discussion there, do you need to apply with regulators? And if so, have you done that? And also, your capital policy, I thought was pretty clear if there was excess capital and no clear use for it, you would return it to shareholders. So assuming you run through this year and you don't deplete that 60 basis points on top of your management buffer upper end, should we expect that to be, almost by definition, used as a special distribution to shareholders? And then I just wanted to follow-up on Sofie's question on the credit guidance. Should we basically take this to be a change in how you want to define it rather than a change in your expectation for the outlook for credit losses?</p><p>FRANK VANG-JENSEN: Can you take it, Chris, please?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Yes, I can start with the first question. So if I -- there were 3 questions here. If I recall the first one correctly, it was regarding approvals? Yes. We do need to have approvals both from our -- from the AGM, but also from our regulators in terms of executing on buybacks. And as I mentioned also in the CMD, but also now, we will and have -- are actually having conversations throughout -- now and throughout this year on that particular topic with our regulators. And I want to be clear here. We are, of course, very happy that we have a very strong balance sheet, that gives us the opportunity to grow the business, also take other opportunities that may or may not come along. And, of course, manage the potential regulatory change that Frank talked about earlier on as well as consume SG Finans. But as we go through this, we are not in the position to hoard capital. So excess capital that we don't have these uses for, when we have clarity, we will -- we intend to use the tool of buybacks to distribute excess capital to shareholders.</p><p>And then I think the third question was loan losses. Yes, we want to point out that Phase 3 losses were actually down this quarter. So we are very comfortable with the credit quality. So it's more a way how we talk about it, given that 1 quarter to the next, 1 specific event can actually have a big percentage change. So we want to be comfortable that our underlying credit quality in our business is and remains strong.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question we have is from the line of Martin Leitgeb from Goldman Sachs.</p><p>MARTIN LEITGEB, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: First, just a follow-up on the various capital questions. And I was just thinking more broader, I would like to know how you think about capital for the bank on a kind of more medium-term perspective? Do you think, given how the balance sheet is now, that there is the right level of capital you're running the bank at? Or do you see scope for either the capital base you have to underline to that business to be the higher or lower over kind of more medium term, 3, 4, 5 years period? And then secondly, I was just keen to understand, in terms of grow ambitions, and obviously, your comments on how regaining market share, which grow areas are you most excited about at this moment in time?</p><p>FRANK VANG-JENSEN: Yes, thank you for the question. So let me take the second question and start with that one. So we have 4 business areas, and the by far largest business areas in Nordea is Personal Banking and Business Banking. That is a traditional household business, and it is an SME business. And we grow -- grew last year in both business areas and actually for a very long time, since -- and that's the first time since several years of quite flat development. So we, of course, would like to continue to develop that business in line with the market growth, you can say. And I think what we see now after having struggled there some years in the mortgage business, for example, which is very important for Nordea, is that we are back in business, we have turned it around, and we are both growing and have increased the growth rate during the year in all countries, and actually is now more or less meeting our back book now. And the same goes actually for the SME market share. So at least, there is -- there you see and find our -- you can say, our -- one of -- some of our focus areas. Then of course, we have large corporate institutions, that is also a very important business area, and we want to develop that one. But of course, we want to develop the business within areas where it's profitable. So how that will play out, it's not to be seen.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00e9N: Before Chris takes the next question, in Helsinki it's 10:00 a.m. now in the morning. And unfortunately, Frank needs to leave us for interviews. But me and Chris will be here, so we continue the Q&amp;A here. Thank you, Frank.</p><p>FRANK VANG-JENSEN: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: So thank you, Frank. Now you mentioned -- you asked about the growth, but you also had a first question. Would you mind just repeating that question for me?</p><p>MARTIN LEITGEB: Yes. I was just wondering on capital. So just kind of the medium -- I mean obviously, we're aware of the more immediate moving parts for capital requirements going forward. But I was just trying to understand what your expectation would be for the bank going forward? So would you -- do you see essentially that capital targets, the capital levels you run the bank at will stay broadly similar in terms of -- if you just think about the absolute quantum of core tier 1 capital you run the bank with? Or do you see the upward or downward pressure to that capital requirement base?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Yes. I mean, as I said, we're happy that we have a strong balance sheet now. And then, of course, we are utilizing some of that already for SG, and then we'll see what the regulatory requirements are throughout this year. But if you look beyond that, we have a management buffer and a capital policy of 150 to 200 basis points above the requirement. And long term, of course, our intent is to be within that. And hence, that -- and then, of course, really, long term, it's very difficult to see how Basel IV plays out and so on and so forth. There's so many changing things in the regulatory landscape. But given the current capital policy, the buffer that we have, if that remains the same, we would like to remain -- be within that buffer. And hence, again, any excess capital that we don't see utilization for, we will distribute to shareholders.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question we have is from the line of Chris Hartley from Redburn.</p><p>CHRIS HARTLEY, ANALYST, REDBURN (EUROPE) LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a quick 1 for me, actually. Just -- I was looking at your net fair value line and you used to give us a chart in your presentation that split that out between sort of customer activity and then market-making, some derivative valuations, et cetera. I couldn't see that this time around. If I have missed it, do let me know. But if not, are you able to give us a sense of how the EUR 266 million this quarter is split up amongst those categories, please?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Yes, well spotted. I think what is -- how we see the business going forward in the net fair value line, particularly on what is very clearly customer related, and that is that it is a customer business, and we need to focus on the customers. So all the flows that we get is to support the customer franchise. And also, given recent changes in regulation, it is very difficult to what is exactly trading and what is customer. To us, it is a customer business, and that is why we want to show the customer business more in totality. Then, if you look at the various lines in this quarter, we did have some revaluations in treasury, which is -- which we've had in the previous quarter as well, which is roughly around EUR 30 million of that. I do also want to point out that we sold LR Realkredit in the back end of last quarter, which is a capital gain of EUR 138 million, and that one we've actually booked in other income lines.</p><p>CHRIS HARTLEY: Okay. And there isn't anything significant from the derivative valuations in there, is there? In either direction?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: There is a positive compared to Q3 in terms of the valuation adjustments. So there is -- there was some tailwind in this quarter on that.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00e9N: They were EUR 10 million higher compared to Q3.</p><p>OPERATOR: Final question we have is from Riccardo, I think it's from Mediabank -- or Mediobanca.</p><p>RICCARDO ROVERE, BANCA DI CREDITO FINANZIARIO S.P.A., RESEARCH DIVISION - RESEARCH ANALYST, MEDIOBANCA: I'm sorry, I had to connect to the call with a little bit of delay. Sorry, if someone has already asked this question. The first one is on the guidance you provide in credit losses. When I read the boarding, it sounds to me, it sounds a little bit more conservative than the previous one. But I'm not 100% sure, this is your mindset, this is the way you're thinking about it. And the second question I have is, in this set of numbers, in the quarter -- fourth quarter numbers, do you see anything that you would consider really one-off or by nature or by magnitude, let's say?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Let me maybe comment on the first question, I think we have -- as you said, you connected late. We talked a bit about this. We've changed it to, call it -- talk about the underlying credit quality. And as you see, last quarter, actually, our Stage 3 came down somewhat, and that is because when loan losses are at this low, and you have 1 or 2 specific events that may or may not occur, which happened in Q4, so specific exposure, the percentage change is quite significant. So we are very comfortable with our underlying credit quality. And I'd also like to just highlight the consensus that we have published, and we are very comfortable with that consensus number. So there's nothing I intend to say that will change any of that outlook. And then I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch your second question.</p><p>RICCARDO ROVERE: It was just to get an idea from you, if you think there is anything one-off in the fourth quarter results, by nature, right? Or maybe by magnitude? And not by -- let's say, not a one-off in itself, but just the magnitude of some lines could be a little bit above normal or below normality? Or what you think could be a normality level?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: See, The only real item affecting comparability, if you talk in accounting terms, is our sale of LR Realkredit at the end of last quarter, which was a gain of EUR 138 million that we have in other income lines. Then there are some smaller things that is more normal course of business that happens. But that is the main, let's call it, one-off in Q4.</p><p>RICCARDO ROVERE: Okay, okay. No, no, no. I was mentioned -- I was thinking about except that, of course. Very clear.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00e9N: I think, Riccardo, what you can see is that, when you do your models now for 2020, the starting point on all lines are fair to start with, so to say.</p><p>OPERATOR: At this time, there are no further questions in the queue.</p><p>RODNEY ALFV\u00e9N: As there are no further questions, so we conclude this call. Thank you very much for attending and asking questions. And as you know, the IR team, we are available 24/7, if you have more calls. Thank you.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER REES: Thank you very much. Have a good day.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes your call for today.

(Operator Instructions) Please note this conference is being recorded.</p><p>I will now turn the conference over to our host, Evan Masyr, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. You may begin.</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, SALEM MEDIA GROUP, INC.: Thank you, and thank you all for joining us today for Salem Media Group's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. As a reminder, if you get disconnected at any time, you can dial back in or listen from our website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.salemmedia.com\">www.salemmedia.com</url>.

We'll begin in just a moment with our prepared remarks.

In conformity with Regulation G, information required to accompany the disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures is available on the Investor Relations portion of the company's website at salemmedia.com.</p><p>I'll now turn the call over to Edward Atsinger. Ed?</p><p>EDWARD G. ATSINGER, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, SALEM MEDIA GROUP, INC.: Thank you, Evan, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us for this quarterly update. Let me begin my prepared remarks with an overview of Salem's fourth quarter financial performance, and then I'll provide you an update on recent M&amp;A activity, and we'll conclude with a brief comment on our quarterly cash distribution. I'll then give the call back to Evan, who will provide more detailed information on fourth quarter performance and provide guidance for the first quarter of 2020.</p><p>For the fourth quarter 2019, revenue declined 3.8%. Expenses were down 2.2%, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA decline of 11.6%. Let's look at the numbers by division to get a better understanding of the specific performances.</p><p>For the quarter, broadcast revenue declined 1.2% or $600,000. Considering the fact that we disposed the 16 radio stations in 2019, it makes sense to look at the -- at revenue on the same-station basis. Excluding the impact of recently sold stations, broadcast revenue was up 1.2%. And that's before taking into account political revenue, which was $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to only $400,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. So if we exclude the impact on revenue from the station sales and the impact of political revenue, our core broadcast businesses -- core Broadcast revenue was up 4% in the fourth quarter. We're encouraged by that growth.</p><p>A leading factor in the fourth quarter growth was the continued expansion of our local digital businesses, which was up 57% to $4.7 million, clearly driven by our investment in Salem Surround, which we commented on over several of the last quarterly reports. This growth has been consistent throughout the year and doesn't appear to be slowing down. For the entire year, local digital revenue increased 57.4%.</p><p>Additionally, our national business, which includes network and national spot revenue, increased 6.8% on a same-station basis due to the continued productivity and strength of our national syndicated lineup and recently completed listener trip to Israel. Local spot revenue was down 8.8%, but again, much of that decline was due to the lack of political revenue in Q4 of 2019 compared to Q4 of 2018.</p><p>Broadcast expenses declined 1.3%, resulting in a 0.8% decline in station operating income. Both page views and programmatic revenue in our national digital division were up. However, the continued competition, particularly from the programmatic digital competition from Facebook, Google and now Amazon, for our direct advertising dollars continues to impact our national digital performance. The result was a revenue decline of 15% in the fourth quarter of 2019. We were able to reduce expenses by 8.1%, partially offsetting the revenue decline.</p><p>Finally, at our publishing division, it was down 5.1% driven largely by a 15.3% decline in our self-publishing business. A major problem over the last several quarters impacting the self-publishing business has been the difficulty finding and retaining quality sellers in a very tight employment market. However, we have been making good progress in this area, and we're now fully staffed.</p><p>Our larger publishing business, the traditional book publisher, Regnery, was up 4.6% based on a stronger book release schedule in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. During the quarter, we released Guilty By Reason of Insanity: Why The Democrats Must Not Win by David Limbaugh and another installment of Marlon Bundo's series, Marlon Bundo's Best Christmas Ever by Charlotte and Karen Pence.</p><p>As we transition to the 2020 presidential election year, we expect to have a solid year of publishing books with a political and public policy perspective. In the first quarter, we've already released Grace Canceled: How Outrage is Destroying Lives, Ending Debate, and Endangering Democracy by Dana Loesch; also Crisis on the Border: An Eyewitness Account of Illegal Aliens, Violent Crime, and Cartels by Matt Pinsker; and The Manipulators: Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Big Tech's War on Conservatives by Peter Hasson. A number of good titles will be released as we get closer to the latter part of the election cycle. We're particularly enthused about the upcoming release from Diamond and Silk, the duo that's taking the country by storm.</p><p>Turn our attention to M&amp;A, I don't have a lot of new information to report. We did close on the sale of 9 radio stations for $8.7 million on November 14, along with the sale of 4 stations that closed on September 26. We sold 13 radio stations to Relevant Radio for $17 million. We used the proceeds of those sales to pay down our debt, both on the revolver and the bonds. During the quarter, we used $10.6 million of the proceeds to buy $12.1 million of bonds in the open market. This resulted in a reduction of our leverage ratio from 6.57 at the end of the third quarter to 6.18 at the end of this year.</p><p>Let me conclude with a discussion of our cash distribution. Given the level of debt and the elevated leverage ratio, the Board of Directors concluded in December the cash distribution of $0.065 per quarter or $0.26 per year was too high. The Board voted to reduce the payout rate by 62% to $0.025 per quarter or $0.10 per year. This will result in increased cash available to continue reducing debt. And we announced earlier this week that the Board approved another $0.025 per share cash distribution payable to be made on March 31. Even at this reduced level, this represents a 9.2% dividend yield based upon the current stock price.</p><p>And with that, Evan, I'll turn the call back to you for additional details on the quarter's performance and to provide guidance for Q1 2020.</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: Thank you, Ed. For the fourth quarter, total revenue decreased 3.8% to $64.6 million. Operating expenses on a recurring basis decreased 2.2% to $54.4 million, which resulted in an 11.6% decrease in adjusted EBITDA to $10.2 million. Net broadcast revenue decreased 1.2% to $50.5 million and broadcast operating expenses decreased 1.3% to $38 million, resulting in station operating income of $12.5 million, a decline of 0.8%.</p><p>On a same-station basis, net broadcast revenue increased 1.2% to $49.4 million, and SOI decreased 0.5% to $12.8 million. These same-station results include broadcast revenue of our -- from 95 of our 100 radio stations in our network operations and represents 97.8% of net broadcasting revenue.</p><p>I'll briefly review revenue performance of our strategic formats. 37 of our radio stations are programmed in our foundational Christian teaching and talk format. These stations contributed 38% of total broadcast revenue and decreased 6.5% for the quarter. Our 32 news talk stations had a decrease of 3.0% in revenue for the quarter, and some of this decrease was due to the lack of political revenue, as Ed had already talked about. Overall, these stations contributed 20% of total broadcast revenue.</p><p>Revenue from our 12 contemporary Christian music stations contributed 19% of total broadcast revenue and decreased 4.1% for the quarter. Our network revenue increased 7.6% for the quarter and represents 10% of total broadcast revenue. Revenue from our digital media businesses decreased 15.0% to $9.8 million and represents 15% of total revenue. Our publishing revenue decreased 5.1% to $4.3 million and represents 7% of total revenue.</p><p>As of December 31, we had $219.8 million outstanding on our bonds and $12.4 million outstanding under the revolver. Our leverage ratio was 6.18. And for the first quarter of 2020, we are projecting total revenue to be between flat and a decrease of 2% compared to first quarter 2019 total revenue of $60.5 million. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions and dispositions, we are projecting total revenue to be between flat and an increase of 2%.</p><p>We're also projecting operating expenses before gains or losses on disposition of assets, stock-based compensation expense, changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, impairments, depreciation expense and amortization expense, to be between flat and an increase of 3% compared to the first quarter of 2019 non-GAAP operating expenses of $53.0 million.</p><p>With that, that concludes our prepared remarks, and we'd now like to answer any questions. Operator?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Michael Kupinski with NOBLE Capital Markets.</p><p>MICHAEL A. KUPINSKI, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AND SENIOR MEDIA &amp; ENTERTAINMENT ANALYST, NOBLE CAPITAL MARKETS, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: A couple of questions here. Regarding your guidance in the first quarter, can you give us a sense of how much political you may have received in the quarter? For some radio broadcasters, they were giving some thoughts on the political. And I was wondering, embedded into your guidance, if you can just talk a little bit about if there is a certain level of political in those numbers.</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: Yes. I don't expect a significant amount of political in the first quarter. If you think about where majority of the political spending has been, thus far, certainly, on the presidential side, it's been on the Democrats side, and we have not seen much. But I would expect, probably, for the quarter, it will be a couple hundred thousand dollars.</p><p>MICHAEL A. KUPINSKI: And in terms of the full year, have you guys given some thought about what you might -- what we might anticipate in terms of political? Any internal thoughts there?</p><p>EVAN D. MASYR: The only thing -- political, as you know, is difficult to predict. I guess if you look at what we've done in the last 2 election cycles have been north of $4 million. Don't know where the key races are going to be relative to where our stations are, but to get something in that range seems to make sense to us.</p><p>MICHAEL A. KUPINSKI: And then can you give us a sense on the publishing side, I'm just -- how many titles that maybe you -- you're anticipating this year versus your -- the past election cycles, if that's the way to look at it? I know that this is a kind of -- always a hit-miss type of -- with popular books and things like that, that you never really have a good way of knowing but maybe looking at it in terms of the number of titles.</p><p>DAVID A. R. EVANS, PRESIDENT OF NEW MEDIA, SALEM MEDIA GROUP, INC.: So we will publish a similar number of titles in 2020 compared to 2019. In total, it's going to be about 55 titles between political, Christian and history titles. We think we've got a pretty good lineup. We're obviously very excited about Diamond and Silk. Election years are typically a little better than nonelection years. So we're expecting a little bit of growth in 2019, and it will be dependent upon the big 2 or 3 titles.</p><p>MICHAEL A. KUPINSKI: And in -- on terms of the self-publishing segment, you indicated some staffing issues there. I was just wondering if you can kind of explain a little bit better how that impacted the business, whether or not you're seeing competitiveness in that business and how things are just bearing overall. Just kind of give us a sense of -- outside of some issues that you may have had in the last quarter, whether or not these are ongoing issues. Or should we actually see things now back on a better growth trajectory?</p><p>DAVID A. R. EVANS: Well, the self-publishing business has been -- it's certainly a mature business. We did have difficulty retaining a full sales staff during 2019, and the sales staff is critical in terms of acquiring authors. When an author decides to self-publish, there is a process we have to go through to convince them that you're the right publisher to work with. And that sales team is critical. We lost some key members, and it took some time to replace them. We are fully staffed again, and we think 2020 will be better than 2019.</p><p>MICHAEL A. KUPINSKI: And in terms of the business, just overall in the broadcast segment, I was just wondering -- obviously, you have some very positive momentum in the fourth quarter. I mean the broadcast business overachieved expectations and -- based on my estimates. And in fact, like you mentioned, you did sell some stations. So for that to outperform as well as it did, it's a little surprising. Can you give us a little sense on 2 things: one, on your block programming, what type of rate increases that you're passing through in January? And then secondly, just kind of give us a sense of what the pacing of that business looks like in the first quarter.</p><p>DAVID P. SANTRELLA, PRESIDENT OF BROADCAST MEDIA, SALEM MEDIA GROUP, INC.: Yes. The block programming was up 2% to 3% in terms of rate increases. We have very favorable renewals with -- in fact, I don't know, Michael, that I can think of any cancellations that we took coming into the new year that we are competing against a few ministries that exited last year in Q1. But we have great renewals this year and fair rate increases, so we're really pleased with that and that's going well. And then, of course, the other driver, of course, as Ed mentioned -- or as Evan mentioned, was Salem Surround. So what we're doing local -- on the local digital front is a revenue driver right now.</p><p>MICHAEL A. KUPINSKI: Got you. One last question, I promise. Going back to the digital business, I know there's some secular headwinds there. But traditionally, in the past, you got a lift, a nice little lift up through the traffic, given -- in the election year. I was just wondering, if we looked in the past cycles, do we anticipate that there's going to be a lift this year? Or do you think that's going to be muted just because of the competitive issues?</p><p>DAVID A. R. EVANS: I think there will be a surge in website traffic in September, October and the first week of November. But the third isn't going to be as big in -- as prior years because there's been so much interest in -- from the last couple of years, with the Supreme Court nominations, with the impeachment fight. Page views have been kind of on fire for the last year or 2. So yes, I'm sure there will be a surge close to the election, but it's not going to be as big a percentage growth as in prior cycles.</p><p>OPERATOR: I'll now turn the call back to Edward Atsinger for closing remarks.</p><p>EDWARD G. ATSINGER: Again, thanks to all of you for joining the call. We look forward to visiting with you again when we report on Q1 2020 results.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. This concludes today's call.

First of all, thank you all for joining this conference call. And now we will begin the conference of the fiscal year 2019 fourth quarter earnings results by Samsung Fire &amp; Marine Insurance. This conference will start with a presentation followed by a divisional Q&amp;A session.</p><p>(Operator Instructions) Now we shall commence the presentation by Samsung Fire &amp; Marine Insurance.</p><p>CHANG JOON, HEAD OF IR, SAMSUNG FIRE &amp; MARINE INSURANCE CO., LTD.: Good afternoon. I am Joon Chang Ho, Head of the IR team at Samsung Fire &amp; Marine. We'd like to start the earnings conference call for fiscal year 2019. Today, CFO will present key earnings highlights for 2019 and business strategies for 2020, which will be followed by the Q&amp;A session with the participating executives.</p><p>Now CFO, Bae will start the report.</p><p>TAE-YEONG BAE, CFO, SENIOR VP &amp; DIRECTOR, SAMSUNG FIRE &amp; MARINE INSURANCE CO., LTD.: Good afternoon. I am Tae-Yeong Bae, CFO of Samsung Fire &amp; Marine. I will give you a brief summary of the key earnings highlights for fiscal year 2019 and then discuss our views on the business for 2020 and future outlook.</p><p>First is 2019 earnings report. On Page 1, the direct premium written was up 3.3% to post KRW 18.8 trillion, and the net profit fell 42.4% year-over-year to KRW 609.2 billion. The DPS was determined at KRW 8,500, and the dividend payout ratio was up 10.3 percentage points to 56%.</p><p>On Page 2, as for the long-term line, we achieved 29.5% growth in terms of health insurance new business and the risk premiums earned grew 6% year-over-year. The risk loss ratio was up 5.2 percentage points to stand at 84.2%, and expense ratio was up 2 percentage points.</p><p>On Page 3, the auto insurance revenue was up 8.5% year-on-year, thanks to the online channel growth. The loss ratio increased to 6.1 percentage points to 91.4% and while the expense ratio improved 1.3 percentage points to post 16.3%.</p><p>Turning to Page 4. General insurance revenue grew 4.1% year-over-year, and the recurring premiums grew 8.8% but the underwriting process fell 8.2%, mainly due to one-off flood damages in the Middle East in the second half of 2019.</p><p>On Page 5, the investment profit declined 6.8% year-over-year, but when excluding one-off factors, such as Samsung Electronics stake disposal gains in 2018, it grew 1.7%. The investment yield is 2.9%, and the adjusted yield is 3.2%.</p><p>On Page 6, the asset liability spread margin was down 5 basis points compared to the end of last year to post 34 basis points and the duration matching ratio is 85%.</p><p>Now I'd like to brief you on where the company is currently standing in 2020. As for the whole industry, the total accumulated underwriting income from January to September last year is estimated to be about KRW 270 billion. Yes, the underwriting income posted by Samsung Fire &amp; Marine was KRW 450 billion, which means that our market share in terms of underwriting income is 167%. Many insurance companies are struggling with deterioration of their underwriting profitability, and most companies are forecasted to post underwriting losses on a full year consolidated basis, except Samsung Fire &amp; Marine.</p><p>We're improving the quality of long-term business by expanding health protection coverages and focusing on selling more policies rather than pursuing bigger premiums, all of which are our efforts to secure solid profit streams. In fact, the monthly number of policies sold increased from 187,000 in the second half of 2019 to 243,000 policies in January 2020, which shows that we are pursuing qualitative growth in our sales efforts. In the month of January this year, the health care and illness products accounted for 81%, and the risk and loading premiums accounted for 83%. These results will lead to stable sources of income when they are coupled with recurring premium increase and persistency ratios.</p><p>This year, we will closely monitor the market with profitability as our top priority and boost underwriting profitability as well. For this, we're taking measures to gradually strengthen underwriting and strictly managing profitability by coverage type.</p><p>As for the auto insurance, we believe that the auto insurance profit will certainly bottom out this year in terms of the denominator of the loss ratio, standard premium hikes, revised policy portfolio and efforts to cover for more costs are already resulting in an accelerated growth of recurring premiums. In terms of the numerator of the loss ratio, in terms of accident frequency and risks, the number of car accidents has already been declining and also claims growth is expected to slow down in light of expected regulatory improvements, including the increase of deductibles for drunk driving and the government agencies guidelines on auto insurance medical treatment assessment.</p><p>We're making efforts to improve profitability through stronger underwriting for policies that are expected to have more than 100% combined ratios. In January of this year, the share of online sales increased to 46% and the share of high-margin policies, including insurance for larger passenger vehicles was up 2 percentage points to 38% year-over-year.</p><p>Since the domestic general insurance business has favorable loss ratio and profit contribution, we will continue to strengthen our market position, driven by profitability. Overseas facultative inward business was a burden on general insurance earnings, so we are restructuring the portfolio based on profitability by reducing the share of high-risk coverages. We will also strictly manage variability by reducing the long tail burden and presenting one-off accidents like those that happened last year.</p><p>In terms of asset management, we will flexibly respond to the lower interest rate environment and improve the medium and long-term returns. We will increase the share of high-yield quality assets such as infrastructure financing, and invest more in alternative assets through global asset managers in order to secure additional gains. At the same time, we will adjust offering rates more flexibly in consideration of the market rate to realize steeper spread margin.</p><p>Next, I'd like to share with you our internal views on future outlooks on the sources of profits for the next 2 to 3 years. First, on long-term line, the number of policies and protection premiums will continue to increase. As a result, we expect the steady growth of the risk premiums, loading premiums and recurring premiums that will be carefully managed for profit generation. As the industry is recognizing the importance of loss ratio management, it is crucial to develop strong claims management capabilities based on good underwriting and data analysis. The industry competition is going to be based more on profitability. And Samsung Fire &amp; Marine will lead these industry-wide trends.</p><p>The auto insurance loss ratio peaked in 2019 and the auto cycle is expected to improve from 2020. In anticipation of this change, we preemptively increased sales last year in order to grow the size of the recurring premiums. We will work hard to move up the turnaround point for auto insurance.</p><p>In the general insurance line, we are pursuing joint growth opportunities in the U.S. and the Asia Pacific markets with Canopius, a lowest participants in order to overcome the limitations of the domestic market. Currently, we're discussing joint business management options in the U.S. and the Asian markets. Samsung Fire &amp; Marine is the only Korean insurer capable of conducting financially and strategically meaningful general insurance business overseas. Likewise, we will create new revenue pipelines in general insurance business.</p><p>We believe that the P&amp;C industry competitive landscape is going to diversify even further. It will not only involve the incumbents, but also the growth of bank-based financial holding companies and the entrance of big tech companies in the insurance market, thereby, potentially creating a triangular competition landscape in the industry. In this ever-changing environment, P&amp;C companies cannot guarantee sustainable growth if they maintain their business as usual. The nature of insurance business will change fundamentally, and you can only be successful when you're prepared to build up your capabilities and take the lead. In recognition of this, Samsung Fire &amp; Marine is carrying out restructuring and innovative measures internally and externally so that we can achieve sustainable growth in these changing times. These efforts include the creation of a joint venture with Kakao and pursuit of joint business with Canopius in Asia and the U.S.</p><p>We are using a telescope to look into the future and a microscope to carefully examine the current situation. Using the telescope, we will explore new market opportunities while we manage the details using the microscope. Samsung Fire &amp; Marine is setting its own course, and we're fully equipped with innovation. Being #1 is not just shown in financial numbers, I'd like to ask for your continued support and interest. Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Now we will have a Q&amp;A session, please limit the number of questions per person to 2.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The first question will be presented by Seung-Gun Kang from HI Investment &amp; Securities.</p><p>SEUNG-GUN KANG, RESEARCH ANALYST, HI INVESTMENT &amp; SECURITIES CO., LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: Hello, I am Kang Seung-Gun from HI Investment &amp; Securities. I'd like to ask questions regarding risk loss ratio trends and the underwriting strategies. Currently, I understand that it's not easy for you to increase indemnity premium rates because of regulatory issues. And also, there are changes in the behaviors of the policyholders. Therefore, stricter underwriting may have limitations as to how much impact it can create on the loss ratio trend, and that has been shown on your loss ratio trend recently. Therefore, the market is interested in understanding the percentages of death benefits and living benefits in your portfolio. So I'd like to ask you to give us some numbers as to such percentages in 2017, that was when -- that was before, competition became fiercer. So in 2017, what was the percentage of death benefits versus living benefits? And how did these numbers change in 2019? And you mentioned that you are going to continue to strengthen underwriting in 2020 as well. So do you think that these numbers will change this year?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Hello, I am [Choi Bu Gyu] from Actuarial RM Team. Let me answer your question.</p><p>Let me give you numbers as to the death and property-related benefits that do not include living benefits. So as for death and property benefits, the percentage in 2017 was 41%, and it went down to 37% in 2019.</p><p>The reason for the decline in the percentage is because of heated competition in 2018 and 2019 related to death benefits.</p><p>In 2020, we expect that market competition is going to slow down slightly. So we will continue to put focus on profitability. And we will continue to make sure that we will have more percentage for high-margin coverages through product designing and underwriting.</p><p>Already, we have been taking measures starting from February by limiting the ceilings for some coverage types and also making it mandatory for people to sign up for death benefits when they're purchasing insurance.</p><p>So I believe that we will be able to increase the share of high-margin coverages in this year.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question will be presented by Byung Gun Lee from DB Finance and Investments (sic) [DB Financial Investment].</p><p>BYUNG GUN LEE, TEAM LEADER, DB FINANCIAL INVESTMENT CO., LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: Hello, I am [Lee Byung Gun] from DB Finance and Investment. I'd like to ask you 2 questions. The first question is about dividends. Previously, you mentioned that you were going to increase your dividend payout ratio gradually to 50% by 2021. However, the earnings results for 2019 were rather disappointing. So in order to maintain the dividend amount, your dividend payout ratio has already surpassed 50%. So is it going to be something of temporary nature? Or are you going to continue on with your existing capital policy until 2021? Right now, there are not many clear numbers about earnings outlook. And currently, the business environment is not favorable. So even though your business improved, your DPS is not going to increase if you maintain the previously announced dividend policy. So I'd like to ask you to provide us with some color on that. And the second question is about new business, and I'd like to thank you for providing us with some meaningful comments about your plans going forward. However, when we look at the sales of pseudo cancer-related coverages from December to recently, I can see that there were some differences between what Samsung Fire &amp; Marine has been doing versus the others in the industry. Because in early February, this year, some companies already reduced limits or coverages for pseudo cancer products and has already happened in December. However, Samsung Fire &amp; Marine has been maintaining and underwriting these products. So because of when some companies reduce underwriting for these kinds of products, of course, those who have such needs will go to companies that would allow underwriting of such coverages. So the problem is what's happening in the industry? Who is going to stop this? And for the past couple of months, I can see that Samsung Fire &amp; Marine seems to be focused more on volume growth rather than quality growth. And that has been shown in your new business numbers from December to January this year. So what is your plan going forward? Are you going to reduce underwriting for pseudo cancer-related products? Or are you going to tighten your underwriting in this regard?</p><p>TAE-YEONG BAE: Hello. I am CFO, Bae Tae-Yeong, and I will be addressing your question on dividend policy. One year ago, during the conference call, we mentioned we were going to gradually increase our dividend payout ratio to 50% by 2021. But as you mentioned, the actual business results for last year fell below the market expectations. So after much consideration, we decided to increase the dividend payout ratio to 56% for this year. And because we announced that we're going to maintain our capital policy by 2021, we will -- we are planning to maintain that policy. However, there are many factors that we need to continue to monitor, including the market conditions and also valuation-related issues within the company. So by considering these factors, we may take additional measures if necessary.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Hello, I am [Joon Chang Ho] from the channel product and customer planning team. Let me entertain your question on new business and underwriting.</p><p>In October last year, we went through reshuffling of our product portfolio in order to increase competitiveness of our products as expected and demanded in the market. And as a result, until December, you could see a growing number of sales for health insurance.</p><p>As for the reasons why we had -- we experienced growth in long-term health insurance in January and February, it's because, first of all, we have a large customer base of 10 million policyholders, and there has been an improved brand recognition among customers. And as a result, our sales grew.</p><p>Starting from January and also in February, we have been taking gradual measures to strengthen underwriting in order to manage profitability and so the growth of new business starting from February has been slowing down as -- has been going down to the level of last year.</p><p>And as for your point about the difference between Samsung Fire &amp; Marine and competitors when it comes to pseudo cancer coverages, we will continue to monitor loss ratio trend for these types of coverages, and we will consider adjusting the limit for coverage.</p><p>In addition to pseudo cancer-related coverages. As for high-risk or low-margin coverages such as policyholders with existing health conditions, we've already strengthened underwriting for these coverages, and we're going to do the same thing for pseudo cancer-related coverages as well.</p><p>I would like to once again remind you that in 2020, in conducting our sales activities and distribution activities, we will put priority on profitability in terms of our product mix and sales. And I'd like to ask you for your understanding on that.</p><p>BYUNG GUN LEE: I'd like to ask you a follow-up question. So is it correct for me to understand that in December last year and January this year, your new business growth was much higher than usual. But starting from February, of course, there are issues related to assumed rates. But other than that, can we say that your new business growth is going to be similar to the level of last year in the first quarter?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So yes, as you mentioned, the level of new growth -- new business growth is going to be similar to that of last year, starting from February.</p><p>TAE-YEONG BAE: And I am CFO, Bae, I'd like to add some more comments. We -- as the company is understanding that there are some market concerns about volume growth for Samsung Fire &amp; Marine, but it's been more -- it's been about 1.5 months into this new year. And for the remainder of this year, we will make sure to put tight control over distribution costs and sales volume growth on a yearly basis so that it will be put under control.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question will be presented by Jin-Sang Kim from Hyundai Motor Securities.</p><p>JIN-SANG KIM, ANALYST, HMC INVESTMENT SECURITIES CO., LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: Hello, I am Kim Jin-Sang from Hyundai Motor Securities. I have 2 questions. The first question is about capital management strategies. Of course, cash dividend and dividend payout ratio, all these things are very important, but I start to think that this may be the right time to consider the possibility of terminating, the cancellating the treasury shares. Of course, I understand that there are many regulatory changes taking place in the industry, including the introduction of IFRS 17 and K-ICS. So maybe you would say that this may be too early to consider these options. But given the fact that Samsung Fire &amp; Marine had excellent capital position, this may be time for the company to differentiate in terms of its capital management strategy. So considering options such as additional share buyback or cancellation of treasury shares, I'd like to ask you, if -- what is your position among these 3 options? Number one, are you not going to do this because of the timing issue, in line with the regulatory changes? Or second option is, are you actually considering such options of share buyback or cancellation? And number three option is you are not going to consider any of these options because you believe that cash dividend is -- cash dividend payout is the right way to do. So I'd like to ask you to provide us with some color on your position.</p><p>The second question is about competition. As the CFO mentioned in the presentation, competition is fierce -- getting fiercer, and the landscape is changing and there are online players and tech companies and also bank-based insurance business is growing. And at the same time, we see competition coming from life insurance companies as well when it comes to health care protection products and already Samsung Life Insurance has a market share of 8.3% in this product category. As a market leader, you said you are going to solidify your market leadership position and what are the specific strategies and what are the plans that you're going to implement in order to maintain and further strengthen your position in the market?</p><p>TAE-YEONG BAE: I am CFO, Bae. Let me entertain your question regarding capital policy. As I mentioned during the conference call earlier last year, we had this timeframe of the introduction of IFRS by 2021. And after the IFRS 17 is introduced, our management regime would have to be changed fundamentally. So our plan was to increase the dividend payout ratio gradually by that timeframe for 3 years. As for the current policy, of course, we will continue to put priority on cash dividend payout and it is because of our understanding that treasury share cancellation is not -- the share buyback without cancellation is not going to help shareholders. And if we do decide to cancel treasury shares then the stake of Samsung Life for Samsung Fire &amp; Marine will increase to a degree that by regulation of Samsung Fire &amp; Marine will become a subsidiary of Samsung Life, which we do not want. And that is why the cancellation option has not been considered.</p><p>As for buyback option with the cash dividend payout ratio to be around 50%, this buyback option is not something that we completely ignore because we have to look at the payout ratio of tendency. And currently, the company's [PBR] is really low in the market. So as for payout options and buyback options, we will consider them in line with the valuation changes in the market. And as you may know, IFRS 17 introduction has been further postponed after discussion. So after 2021, we will progressively and aggressively consider various options going forward.</p><p>Let me also comment on the second question, which is quite comprehensive. The way I understand the question is that you want to know on what grounds we believe that we're going to be able to maintain and strengthen our market leadership position. First of all, as you may know, Samsung Fire &amp; Marine has excellent capital position compared to the peers in the industry, even based on results, we have very strong capital adequacy. And the market has been wondering what we're going to do with this capital strength. When you think about bank insurance business or big tech companies coming into the insurance market, they are ultimately going to be regulated by the government because when they start doing insurance business, but compared to these new players, we have accumulated capital strength, and we have the know-hows, and we're going to utilize this capital for strategic growth.</p><p>For instance, we are going to pursue inorganic growth opportunities by creating new growth pipelines and by increasing the efficiency of the capital itself, we're going to increase the ROI.</p><p>Secondly, we're going to internally innovate our business. Currently, the industry landscape or competition is mainly based on top line growth, which is about volume growth for new business, which is quite inefficient. But we're going to take different approaches. For the long-term line, we have a very efficient and productive TA channel. These Tight Agents are highly professional and well-trained and not like the GA channel. We are able to implement our strategies using the TA channel effectively. For the auto insurance, the loss amount is, for instance, for this category is KRW 230 billion. And if we reach the breakeven point, this means that we will have KRW 230 billion of profit for auto insurance. And as I mentioned in my presentation, we will do our best to advance the turnaround point for auto insurance business.</p><p>Now moving on to general insurance. Right now, domestically, the premium income for general insurance has been flat, standing at around KRW 5 trillion. And of course, we do have the captive customers but -- and in Korea, it is quite unique when it comes to P&amp;C insurance industry, that in Korea, we have a large portion of health care and protection products. But indeed, the essence of P&amp;C business is general insurance. Therefore, we're going to continue to look for growth opportunities of general insurance, both domestically and overseas. And I believe that these will satisfy your question regarding the ground for our confidence.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question will be presented by Sara Lee from Morgan Stanley.</p><p>SARA LEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Hello, I am Sara Lee from Morgan Stanley. Thank you for a very detailed presentation about your plans for 2020. But my question may be a little overlapping to the previous questions, but I would once again like to ask you what the management is thinking in terms of overall management objectives and also where the source is of your competitiveness. Because you said that you are going to continue to focus on profitability, but considering the past strategies for the past 2 to 3 years, it makes me wonder if that's really what you mean as an investor, this is a big question. Let me give you some examples. In 2017, for auto insurance, you implemented a 4% premium rate cut and you said that this was going to help boost the market share in the online channel, which will lead to scale of economy, which will later lead to better profitability. However, 2 years have passed. Of course, your market share has increased in the online channel for auto insurance. However, as a result of price-based competition, your loss ratio for auto insurance has worsened. And I wonder if you've decided to take this path and implement the strategy of increasing the market share with the recognition that the loss ratio for auto insurance was going to deteriorate. And in 2018 and 2019 when you look at the health insurance business, there was a very steep competition coming from the peers in the market for health insurance new business and you jumped in, in competing based on commissions. And I wonder if you knew that this was going to deteriorate the profitability of health care-related products. And again, in October last year, you implemented additional premium rate cuts, which were going to affect the margin for these products. And I wonder if this was something that you really needed to do? Or was it just for top line growth.</p><p>So overall, in my view, for the past 2 to 3 years, it seems that your strategies have not been focused solely on profitability, or is it something that is related to the changing or the constraints of the Korean insurance industry as a whole because of the underwriting cycle, there was no other option but to compete based on pricing and capital strength. Right now, as you mentioned, the landscape is changing, the industry is changing. You do have a good capital adequacy, but other than your capital strength, what other sources of competitiveness do you think you have? So what is the true definition or a sense of your #1 DNA for Samsung Fire &amp; Marine?</p><p>TAE-YEONG BAE: I'm CFO, Bae Tae-Yeong, let me give you some overall answer to your question. And then the auto insurance and other related executives will answer.</p><p>So when it comes to long-term insurance, it is usually very long dated. And depending on your perspective, you may have different views. When you compare earnings results for Samsung Fire &amp; Marine against other companies, and when you make such comparisons, it is possible that you have such a view. However, for our company, we are maintaining a long timeframe in running our business.</p><p>So I'd like to interpret your question as this. You say that we have been emphasizing the importance of quality business and profitability. But you may wonder if Samsung Fire &amp; Marine's actions have actually triggered more competition in the industry. My answer to your question is rather clear. We have 2 very big principles. Number one, we will continue to generate profit, so profit generation is number one. And secondly, sustainability is the second important principle.</p><p>And your question was about our own DNA as #1 in the marketplace other than having a lot of capital. What else do we have? Like I mentioned, we have profit generation and sustainability as the 2 pillars and in conducting long-durated business, it is crucial for you to be able to maintain such long duration business without much volatility so that you can continue on with generating profit. And this is where you can differentiate from #1 player, Samsung Fire &amp; Marine and others. And it is almost comparing between a very -- a singer with a very popular fan base versus a one-hit wonder.</p><p>And secondly, our key competence is the ability to be able to generate new ideas and innovate ourselves. Such innovation efforts may not show immediate results right away, but these will lead to more actions in the future. And after that, I will turn over to the relevant executives.</p><p>IL-PYEONG KIM, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR &amp; HEAD OF CAR INSURANCE STRATEGY TEAM, SAMSUNG FIRE &amp; MARINE INSURANCE CO., LTD.: I'm Kim Il-pyeong from Automobile Insurance Strategy team. Let me comment on auto business.</p><p>As you may know -- so your question was about this decision that Samsung Fire &amp; Marine has taken in growing our auto insurance revenue when there was a possibility of deteriorating loss ratio. As you may know, there is auto -- in the auto insurance business, there is a very clear cycle. So the crucial point here is to understand when there will be the upside type cycle and when there will be the downward cycle.</p><p>And this kind of auto underwriting cycle is not just impacting us, but all the other participants of the auto insurance industry. So we're all competing based on the fixed size of the pie, and we're all under the same regulation. So depending on the regulation and the environment, the cycles may affect us in a synced way.</p><p>So of course, generating a large volume of profit is crucial. But at the same time, as this auto -- considering the characteristics of auto business, you have to be able to maintain relative competitiveness compared to the peers. So when you look at the gap of combined ratio between Samsung Fire &amp; Marine and the others in the market, in 2017 it was 3.3% and the gap was reduced to 2.5% in 2018. However, it actually has been expanded to 2.6% last year.</p><p>As we increased the market share, there was a certain level of scale of economy with higher efficiency, thereby being able to increase this gap between us and the other players and as you may know, the recurring premiums for auto insurance will be realized in the next years and going forward, so the sales that we incurred this year will lead to higher denominator in the loss ratio calculation by providing more profit sources for next year. And we believe that the auto underwriting cycle is going to improve in 2020. And that is why, with this recognition, we increased the sales of auto insurance, starting from the second half of last year, which will -- which have already been resulting in the increase of recurring premiums already.</p><p>I'd like to add one more comment. If you were going to do this business for only a short period of time, if your profitability was worsening, then you could reduce sales, thereby increasing your profit ratio. However, Samsung Fire &amp; Marine is going concern, and we want to pursue sustainable growth. And that is the basis on which we conduct our sales strategies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I'm [Joon Chang Ho] from Channel product and customer planning team. Let me answer your question related to long-term insurance.</p><p>As the CFO already mentioned, we, at Samsung Fire &amp; Marine consider long-term business as a very important source of profitability. And in conducting long-term business, we do not consider this just as product categories for competition in the industry, but rather, we are running our long-term business with the strategy for sustained profit generation.</p><p>Of course, in the '19 -- for the time frame of 2018 and 2019, the health insurance market itself has been growing in size. This means that there are growing needs for health care products in the market, and there are growing needs for such products.</p><p>So many insurance companies in Korea have been introducing new health care insurance products in order to satisfy these diversifying health care insurance needs in the market. However, in Korea, there is this impact of distribution channel on the business, and there have been more options for customers to choose from based on prices and other characteristics. And in this environment, in October last year, there was a mission for us to offer good quality health care insurance products for customers so that they can choose to sign up policies with us and be satisfied with them. And this was our strategy to acquire additional customers and retain them.</p><p>And in conducting long-term insurance business, it is very meaningful and crucial for us to acquire new customers and retain them so that we can generate a very stable flow of recurring premiums, which will be used for further profit generation. In October last year, we reshuffled our new product lineup, and we learned a lot of lessons, and we will continue to do our best to acquire new customers.</p><p>As the industry is engaged in fierce competition, there may have been some market views that Samsung Fire &amp; Marine's policies were only focused on new business growth. However, as I mentioned and as was mentioned by -- in the presentation, in 2020, we will strengthen underwriting, and we will put focus more on profitability for this year. And in doing the long-term business, we will make sure that this will continue to generate a stable basis for profit for Samsung Fire &amp; Marine in a sustainable manner.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question will be presented by Myung Wook Kim from JPMorgan.</p><p>MYUNG WOOK KIM, VP, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: I am Kim Myung Wook from JPMorgan. I'd like to present to you 3 questions. The first question is that when we reflect on all the comments that were made for the past 3 conference calls, it seems to me that strategies for the company has been revised or changing because it is my impression that in the past, you put more focus on growth and top line growth, but now you seem to be focused more on the bottom line growth. And you mentioned that in 2020 and going forward, there will be new kinds of competition coming from financial holding companies, Fintech and other elements. So in -- given the assumption that there will be stronger competition in the industry. Are you still going to maintain the priority on profitability, even though this would mean that you will lose your market share? This means that you would have possibility of losing the #1 position in terms of market share because I really want to know what your stance is?</p><p>You've been talking about long-term profitability. However, there are some mixed views about your market share movements versus management's comments and decisions. So it's been rather confusing. So I'd like to know how strong you are or how determined you are in terms of putting priority on profitability, even though this would mean that you will lose significant market share.</p><p>The second question is about embedded value. Of course, you're not disclosing the EV numbers, but I'd like to know a little more about the value of in-force and the value of new business. So I'd like to know how much of the value that you estimate for in-force policies and how much added value coming from the new business for 2019? The reason why I'm asking this question is nowadays, you're selling more longer-dated policies. But I wonder if these long-term insurance and such policies would add to profitability to what extent and how much cash flow will be generated from these long-dated policies?</p><p>And if possible, one more question is that I'd like to know why you are putting a limit on dividend payout ratio to be around 50%, why not 60%, 70% or 80%? I wonder if you are considering this option within the timeframe of 2 to 3 years?</p><p>TAE-YEONG BAE: You presented us with 3 questions. I will answer the first and the third one. And the second one will be addressed by a relevant executive.</p><p>So I can understand that your question is basically that Samsung Fire &amp; Marine willing to sacrifice its market position in pursuit of profitability. I think this is more of a rhetoric because we have to think about the definition of market leadership or market position. For a very long time in the insurance mid-industry in Korea, we have been ranking companies based on new business volume, let's say, KRW 15 billion or KRW 13 billion and then you would rank all these insurance companies on the basis of new business volume growth. And for Samsung Fire &amp; Marine, new health care, new business volume would be, let's say, KRW 14 billion. But when you think about the amount of recurring premiums per month it's about KRW 800 billion. So which criteria should we use to determine the market position? As for us, being #1 in terms of new business growth doesn't really mean much because we're interested in generating stable profit for sustainable business growth, as was mentioned by Mr. [Kyung] from CPC Planning team.</p><p>So in that sense, if we take that approach, I believe that our profitability and the market leadership position is not so much of an apple-to-apple comparison, but more of an apple-to-orange comparison. We are managing many different KPIs, but we have to make a distinction between the current numbers and future profitability.</p><p>And now I'd like to address your question regarding dividend policies. So basically, you're asking why 50% cap for a dividend payout ratio. As I mentioned 1 year ago, we explained the overall 3-year plans for capital management, and this is the second year according to that plan. Of course, there are many options that we can consider, including cash dividend payout, payout ratio and buyback and so on. We will maintain the overall dividend policy for the announced timeframe. But considering the market conditions, we may consider other options. But overall, our next dividend policy will be announced after the 2021 period is over.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I'm [Choi Bu Gyu] from Actuarial RM Team. Let me address your question regarding EV.</p><p>Let me answer -- give you some numbers. For instance, there were some adjustments of assumed rates and the figures related to cancellation last year. As a result, the unit profitability for new business has gone down from 9.3% in 2018 to 7.8% in 2019.</p><p>But compared to the figure in 2018, the protection-type new business was 14.4% in -- KRW 14.4 billion in 2018 but it increased to KRW 17.4 billion in 2019. So as a whole, the value of new business has grown by 4% from 2018 to KRW 870 billion in 2019.</p><p>As for the disclosure of EV numbers, there are differences in terms of assumptions used for IFRS 17 and [K-ICS] versus the existing EV calculation method. So if we disclose EV numbers, this would lead to some confusion in the market. So after all the assumptions and methodologies are streamed out, we will announce them.</p><p>However, to add a little bit if the embedded value of new business is converted to a CSM method, then it's going to increase by about 1.5x</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: As we're running out of time, we will entertain one more question.</p><p>OPERATOR: The last question will be presented by Yong Hoon Sung from Hanwha Investment &amp; Securities.</p><p>YONG HOON SUNG, ANALYST, HANWHA INVESTMENT &amp; SECURITIES CO., LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: I am Sung Hoon Yong from Hanwha Investment &amp; Securities. First of all, I'd like to know more about this joint venture initiative that you are pursuing with Kakao. Personally, I believe this is a very good move that you are working with a platform provider rather than a telecommunications company. As for this joint venture initiative with Kakao, are there any specifics that you could share with us at this point in time, including what kinds of products you are planning to offer through this channel?</p><p>The second question is related to your plan for overseas growth. You've been talking about possibilities for overseas general insurance and reinsurance and many other ideas have been proposed for the past 10 years. But there are some views in the marketplace that you may be a little too conservative, you may be a little too cautious about these initiatives. You may not be able to tell us exactly when these things will be materialized, but I'd like to know whether you are really determined and committed to this? And do you have any specific ideas that you are implementing right now?</p><p>TAE-YEONG BAE: I am CFO, Bae Tae-Yeong. Let me give you some explanation about this joint venture initiative with Kakao. We actually made an offer to Kakao first. And we talked to them and explained to them about the market changes. And we said that we have been doing P&amp;C business for the past 68 years with expertise in underwriting and product design and claims management, while Kakao has a wonderful platform, even though it doesn't have any experience in doing insurance business because we have been trying to carry out some innovation internally within Samsung Fire &amp; Marine, but there were some limitations. So we decided to make that offer, I did it myself. And there have been consultations for the past 2 years. And last year, finally, we made an agreement. Right now, we are working to apply for a preliminary approval from the regulators. And we believe that it will come maybe within this year or early next year.</p><p>And currently, at the working level, discussions are underway between Kakao and SFM regarding the details on products and vehicles and concepts. I cannot give you some details. But what I can say is that these are going to be IT based and this will be very close to our everyday lives, so that these will be sort of integrated into our daily lives.</p><p>Currently, we're not only looking at the aging population, but also this young generation in their 20s and 30s, so which could be fascinated by the new offerings that we are planning to offer.</p><p>And about your second question, I'd like to make a brief comment. It is true that we've been talking about all these inorganic growth opportunities for a long time, but you may think that not a lot of tangible outcome has been made. But as you may know, last year, we acquired $150 million of equity in Canopius, and we are actively communicating with the major shareholders of this company. And indeed, the executives representing Samsung Fire &amp; Marine's general insurance line of business is a Board member of this company and are observers as well. We're currently discussing many ideas regarding the Asian Pacific market. And this is so much I can tell you, but a lot of things are happening right now.</p><p>CHANG JOON: I'd like to thank you for your participation. If you have any further inquiries, please contact the IR team. And with this, let us close the earnings conference call for fiscal year 2019.

And welcome to the Zillow Group Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.</p><p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Berning, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p><p>BRADLEY ALLEN BERNING, VP OF IR, ZILLOW GROUP, INC.: Thank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, and welcome to Zillow Group's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Conference Call. For those on the call that I haven't met yet, I'd like to look forward to doing so soon. Joining me today to discuss our Q4 and full year results are Zillow Group's Co-Founder and CEO, Rich Barton; and CFO, Allen Parker.</p><p>During the call, we'll make forward-looking statements about our future performance and operating plans based on current expectations and assumptions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and we encourage you to consider the risk factors described in our SEC filings for additional information. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events, except as required by law. This call is being broadcast on the Internet and is accessible on our Investor Relations website. A recording of the call will be available later today.</p><p>During the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, which we refer to as EBITDA. We encourage you to read our shareholder letter and earnings release, which can be found on our Investor Relations website, as they contain important information about our GAAP and non-GAAP results, including reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures.</p><p>In addition, please note, we refer to our Internet, Media &amp; Technology segment as our IMT segment. We will open the call with brief remarks, followed by live Q&amp;A.</p><p>And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO, ZILLOW GROUP, INC.: Thank you, Brad. I'd like to start by officially welcoming you to our team. Many of you know Brad from his work on the other side of this phone, most recently as a sell-side analyst covering Zillow and other companies. He has decades of experience with deep expertise in housing and financial services. We are delighted to have him on our team, and we expect the call to take half as long now that he's not asking his usual multipart questions. Wink, wink. Seriously, Brad's already making a significant contribution, and we look forward to introducing him on the road in the weeks and months ahead.</p><p>Okay. It's been exactly 363 days since Allen and I joined you for our first quarterly conference call. As we sit here a year later, our 2019 results clearly demonstrate we're making progress against our plan to replatform real estate and move down funnel to deliver our customers a seamless and integrated transaction experience. I'm pleased with our team's strong execution, which delivered Q4 and full year results that beat our outlook. This multiyear expedition has us on course to not only streamline the moving experience but also to dramatically expand our market opportunity and profit potential.</p><p>I'd like to start by calling out just a few of our 2019 accomplishments. First, we stabilized, then reaccelerated growth in our core Premier Agent business, growth that we expect to carry on in 2020. We continue to be methodical, innovating and optimizing monetization of our lead flow and are optimistic about the future of Premier Agent.</p><p>Second, we grew our new Zillow Offers business in the Homes segment to $1.4 billion in revenue in 2019, up from a mere $52 million the year before and ending the year on a $2.4 billion annual revenue run rate. We did this while opening 17 new markets and executing within the unit profit guardrails we laid out for our launch phase. This was extraordinary execution against a rich vein of consumer demand for a novel consumer service.</p><p>Third, the addition of transaction-oriented businesses has necessitated a leveling up in how we operate, infusing cost discipline and operational rigor into every business and corporate function. Internally, we call this getting fit with a sharp focus on scaling efficiently. Much more disciplined and accountable planning and review processes have been critical here. Fitness is essential for the expedition. It's foundational for profit leverage and demanding a perpetual focus and improvement.</p><p>Next, we strengthened our balance sheet and then ended 2019 with $2.4 billion in cash and investments. Our strong balance sheet with increasingly diversified funding sources provides us with the flexibility to pursue our growth opportunities in a disciplined way.</p><p>Next, we filled out our management bench with seasoned operators in mortgage, title and escrow, corporate relations, marketing, finance, operations and more. All the while, we continue to attract outstanding tech industry talent and are consistently recognized as a great place to work and build a career. Our team is strong, and we continue to add and up-level key positions as we grow.</p><p>And finally, we are in the process of galvanizing our employees around a new mission statement that animates our transition to Zillow 2.0. At Zillow, our mission is to give the people the power to unlock life's next chapter. I got to do it again. At Zillow, our mission is to give people the power to unlock life's next chapter. It was meant to be more dramatic.</p><p>Our homes represent distinct chapters of our lives, and we are building our technology, services and operations to make it easier to, as Bob Seger says, turn the page. In our quarterly shareholder letter, you will find a link to a short video you might enjoy watching about our new mission. It never fails to bring a tear to my eye.</p><p>Okay. To wrap my brief year-end review introduction, I'll reiterate that I'm extremely proud of what our team has accomplished over the past year, especially in light of how much business and cultural change I have asked for.</p><p>Allen will take you through the Q4 and full year results and 2020 outlook. But first, I want to spend a couple of minutes on our Premier Agent and Homes businesses and share our areas of focus for 2020.</p><p>Starting with Premier Agent. While we entered 2019 with significantly heightened partner churn versus the prior year, we have started 2020 with some of the best retention rates we've seen in recent history. Our connection rates are on the rise. And through our work to partner with the best agents, we saw customer satisfaction continue to increase during the quarter. This has been driven primarily by solid execution as our team has heightened its focus on making connections between our customers and our best partners, which contributed to strong Premier Agent revenue growth. I want to commend Susan Daimler, who leads our Premier Agent business, and her entire extended team for, first, stabilizing this core business and then leading a reacceleration of it.</p><p>As you can see in the Premier Agent same-store sales chart in our shareholder letter, when we back out the impact of our 2019 Flex tests, we ended December with 12% year-over-year same-store sales growth in monthly recurring revenue, up from 5% at the end of September.</p><p>Looking down on our Premier Agent business from 50,000 feet, our goal is to, a, increase our big C conversion rate from visitor to transactor; and b, increase our revenue and profit yield per lead. We believe there's room for growth in both of these metrics. Our whole history with Premier Agent has been about continual business model innovation and testing in service of long-term growth maximization and customer satisfaction. Since introducing the Best of Zillow program and focusing Premier Agent on connection rates, service quality and most importantly transaction conversion, we've seen significant improvements in our business fundamentals.</p><p>Specifically, we've had to dig in on the capabilities and the productivity of our Premier Agent partners who are best at converting leads into transactions. And this is why we are expanding our Flex tests with high-performing partners in select markets. We're learning that conversion is a key driver of performance, regardless of whether the monetization model is Flex or our larger market-based pricing model. So as we continue to test and grow Premier Agent, I ultimately think of Premier Agent business models we will deploy as an optimization problem and opportunity. We continue to be methodical in our tests, and we are making progress.</p><p>The improving performance of Premier Agent has provided a strong foundation of cash flows for the rapid expansion and growth we've seen in our Homes segment. We delivered more than $603 million in revenue in Q4 from Zillow Offers, up from just $41 million in Q4 of 2018. Our outperformance in Homes was driven by strong consumer demand as well as applying learnings to inform our resale strategies. We also experienced less impact from seasonality than we anticipated.</p><p>In Q4, we sold over 1,900 homes and purchased nearly 1,790 homes. And we ended the quarter with 2,707 Homes in inventory. Since the inception of Zillow Offers, we purchased approximately 7,200 homes and sold 4,500 homes. It's still early days, but we are learning as we grow, and consumer signals are strong.</p><p>In all, we launched a remarkable 17 new markets in 2019, most of which came online in the back half of the year and all on or ahead of schedule, bringing total ZO markets at the end of January to 23. Additionally, we remain on track to be in at least 26 markets by midyear, approximating a national footprint. For 2020, we expect continued strong growth in the ZO business will be driven primarily by servicing high demand in young existing markets and less so on opening new markets.</p><p>Zillow Offers is the first time we've owned the transaction, which we know is a hub from which multiple other adjacent transaction services hinge. And we're gaining traction in building out those adjacent services as well. We are progressing with Zillow Home Loans and have confidence that our new mortgages management along with 2019 and 2020 investments will set the stage for future growth acceleration.</p><p>And as another important adjacency, in 2019, we stood up a new title and escrow business, Zillow Closing Services, to further support Zillow Offers expansion and deliver an integrated transaction experience for our customers.</p><p>A recent Zillow Offers success story is Cathy and Robert Bowen of Atlanta, who wanted a larger home that could accommodate their growing family of 7 and someday their parents as they age. A Premier Agent helped them find a big yellow house with hardwood floors that they love, but it was at the top of their budget range. They couldn't make the down payment without selling their current home, and a traditional sale wasn't feasible with 2 full time jobs, 5 kids and a dog. They turned to Zillow Offers and were able to time the 2 transactions on the same day, allowing them to move with confidence and convenience. It fit together just like a jigsaw puzzle Cathy said.</p><p>Their successful trade in is a story that's now playing out for thousands of families around the country. This is fundamentally why we are here, and these success stories prove to me and our team that people are ready for a better way. I don't say this here but -- it doesn't say it on here, but there's a link from the shareholder letter to that video as well. And if you're only going to watch one video, watch this one. It's a great story.</p><p>Okay. For 2020, we expect to continue to grow and gain leverage on our core IMT segment operations and use those EBITDA profits to fund our promising high-growth transaction-oriented businesses of Zillow Offers, Zillow Home Loans and Zillow Closing Services. Our team is focused on 4 key growth strategies: one, grow Premier Agent while maximizing revenue and profit yield per lead; two, scale Zillow Offers and increase transactions while gaining operating leverage; three, increase company-wide operational efficiency and improve profitability; and four, continue to invest in adjacent services to deliver a seamless integrated customer experience and expand our total addressable market.</p><p>In all, I'd characterize 2019 as tumultuously remarkable. Personally, it was one of the most challenging years of my career. And we've been working to -- as we've been working to simultaneously evolve the hearts and minds of our employees, our industry partners and our investor base while reinvigorating our core businesses and dramatically expanding new ones.</p><p>While we have miles to go before we sleep and the way will surely be lumpy, the great progress we've made in a short period of time gives me confidence that Zillow Group is in the pull position in the race to replatform the largest industry. Our talented team here is making it happen. But I also want to thank you, our investors, who have given me and the team the space and support to turn the page and to move to the next exciting chapter in the story of Zillow.</p><p>Before I turn the call over to Allen to take you through our numbers and outlook, I want to acknowledge his leadership and impact on defining the more rigorous, planful and accountable operating culture of Zillow 2.0. It's great to be sitting next to you, Allen.</p><p>ALLEN PARKER, CFO, ZILLOW GROUP, INC.: Thank you, Rich. It's great to be here. I'm going to quickly summarize a few key financial results, starting with the fourth quarter and then moving to our full year results.</p><p>Overall, we're pleased with our Q4 and full year 2019 results as we exceeded the high end of our expectations for our revenue and EBITDA outlook on both the consolidated basis and across all of our segments. We reported Q4 consolidated revenue of $944 million, up $579 million or 158% year-over-year. The outperformance in revenue was due primarily to strong demand in our Homes segment as we applied learnings to inform our retail strategies and as we saw less seasonal impact than expected on home sales. Consolidated Q4 EBITDA outperformed our expectations at a loss of $3.2 million and was driven by not only the health of our IMT business but also the operational rigor across the organization as all 3 of our segments delivered better-than-expected EBITDA.</p><p>IMT segment revenue grew 6% year-over-year in Q4 to $320 million, exceeding our outlook. Premier Agent revenue accelerated more than we expected in the quarter to $234 million, up 6% year-over-year from 3% growth year-over-year in Q3 and what was essentially flat growth in Q2. Our decision to partner more closely with the best agent partners is not surprisingly yielding strong results with connections, customer satisfaction and agent retention all on a clear upward trajectory. These inputs are key drivers on why MBP same-store sales, monthly recurring revenue growth accelerated at the end of December to 12%. As we did last quarter, we provided same-store sales for monthly recurring revenue for our non-Flex markets, which we estimate represented approximately 95% of our Premier Agent monthly recurring revenue at the end of 2019.</p><p>IMT segment EBITDA margins expanded over 800 basis points in Q4 year-over-year to 27.4% and exceeded the high end of our expectations. Our focus on cost discipline and operational rigor across the company is yielding tangible results. Total IMT segment operating expenses declined nearly $10 million year-over-year in Q4, excluding the impact of certain onetime items we recorded in Q4 2018 as we continue to focus on delivering operating leverage.</p><p>Moving to full year 2019. In the full year 2019, consolidated revenue grew to $2.7 billion, which more than doubled from $1.3 billion in 2018, primarily as a result of the rapid expansion of our Homes segment. Consolidated EBITDA for the year was $39 million as we invested our IMT segment profits into our Homes and Mortgages business.</p><p>2019 IMT segment revenue was $1.3 billion, and IMT segment EBITDA was $304 million. Put that in context, we grew revenue by 6% year-over-year while growing EBITDA 27%, expanding margins by 381 basis points. Premier Agent revenue grew 3% during 2019 to $924 million. We were pleased with the progress to stabilize the Premier Agent business in the first half of the year and the reacceleration in the second half of the year. Homes segment revenue was $1.4 billion for full year 2019, up from just $52 million a year ago.</p><p>As I've stated on previous earnings calls, during this transformational time at Zillow Group, my focus as CFO continues to be on establishing processes and mechanisms in support of 3 key priorities, scaling our new businesses, executing within our IMT segment in order to fund investments into the new segments along with additional growth opportunities and implementing focused cost discipline and operational rigor across the company as we scale. I am pleased with how we executed on these priorities in 2019 and believe these efforts have positioned us for even stronger IMT segment EBITDA performance in 2020 to fund our investments in new businesses.</p><p>Before moving to your questions, I'd like to provide some select thoughts around our Q1 and full year 2020 outlook in comparison to 2019. Due to the recovery and strong trends we are seeing in our Premier Agent business, we expect Premier Agent revenue growth to accelerate further in Q1. We expect Q1 Premier Agent revenue to be between $238 million to $243 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year at the midpoint of the outlook range compared to 6% growth in Q4 and 2% growth in Q1 2019. This accelerating revenue growth is our first quarter outlook -- in our first quarter outlook includes the net impact of delayed revenue from Flex tests. Without the impact of Flex tests, we estimate Q1 year-over-year Premier Agent revenue growth would be approximately 14% at the midpoint of our outlook range.</p><p>Turning to IMT margins. In Q1, we are forecasting IMT EBITDA margins to expand 90 to 120 basis points to between 21.6% to 22.7% despite a couple of onetime items that benefit -- benefited Q1 prior year margins by 290 basis points.</p><p>In the Homes segment, we expect another year of strong growth in 2020 as we apply learnings, grow into the 23 markets we've opened in the last 20 months and launch a handful of additional markets. Given how new this business is and our continuous testing and learning, we will continue to provide a quarterly outlook for Homes segment in 2020. In Q1, we expect Homes segment revenue to be between $675 million and $700 million. Homes segment EBITDA in Q1 is expected to be between a loss of $95 million to a loss of $85 million. We expect to maintain the current unit economic guardrails of plus or minus 200 basis points on average return on homes sold before interest expense as we continue to test and innovate.</p><p>With regard to our Mortgages segment, the new management team is in place and is making progress to develop our technology platform and expand operations of -- expand the operations of Zillow Home Loans. As we work through this transition, we are moving the Mortgages segment to quarterly guidance, consistent with our approach to the Homes segment.</p><p>As Rich mentioned, in our Flex markets, we are seeing positive signals that our most productive agents convert transactions better than the average. Because of this, we will begin to expand our Flex test methodically with high-performing partners in select markets in the second quarter of 2020. Our full year outlook includes the potential for additional testing in the second half of the year if we decide to expand Flex further.</p><p>For full year 2020, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be between $980 million to $1.005 billion, up 7% over 2019 at the midpoint of our outlook range. This outlook range includes the net impact of delayed revenue from the Flex test I just discussed. Without this impact, we estimate the 2020 year-over-year Premier Agent revenue growth would be approximately 10% at the midpoint of our guidance range. We expect IMT segment EBITDA margins to expand an additional 300 to 400 basis points in 2020 to between 26.7% to 27.9% for the full year and IMT EBITDA to grow 24% for the full year at the midpoint of our outlook range.</p><p>Please note that the pace of investment is in our control to execute our key growth strategies as Rich discussed previously. While we are not providing outlook on consolidated 2020 revenue or EBITDA, philosophically, we are managing towards a breakeven range as we use the contributions from our IMT segment to help fund the expansion and growth of our Homes and segment -- Homes and Mortgages segments. Furthermore, our balance sheet remains strong and provides a significant flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities to gain scale and operating leverage in our new businesses.</p><p>We ended the year with $2.4 billion in cash and investments along with $900 million in undrawn credit facilities and lines of credit to further support the growth of Zillow Offers and Zillow Home Loans. We remain mindful of our cost of capital, and we invest in these -- as we invest in these opportunities and will continue to prudently manage expenses.</p><p>In all, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full year 2019 performance, the momentum we're carrying into 2020 and the progress we're making towards streamlining real estate transactions to better help our customers unlock the next chapter of their lives.</p><p>With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities.</p><p>RONALD VICTOR JOSEY, MD AND SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Lots to talk about here for sure. But maybe, Rich and Allen, I wanted to focus a little bit on the just Premier Agent business at first with guidance calling for revenue growth accelerating -- the acceleration to continue and I think 7.5% growth at the midpoint. I hear you on agent retention rates and improving CSAT scores. But with the unknowns around Flex and just rolling out to new markets in 2Q and maybe even more markets in the back half of the year, just -- can you just talk a little bit more about the confidence in that accelerating growth in Premier Agents, which clearly is the bread and butter at least, what underlines the investments going forward.</p><p>And if I could sneak just a follow-up on Flex. Rich, you mentioned in the letter high-performing agents are just converting leads at a higher rate. Just any additional insights there would be helpful.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: Okay. Ron, this is Rich. Let me let Allen start out on that one, and then I'll jump in.</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: Yes. Thanks for the question. So yes, I'll reiterate. I know you mentioned it, but our confidence really does come from the improvements we've seen in some of the underlying inputs over the past 6 months. Both connections and CSAT metrics are up substantially, and our retention has been trending near the highest levels ever.</p><p>So while -- what I would say is as we look to and what's incorporated in the guidance, it's still early on Flex. We thought it was appropriate to include some flexibility to increase our testing in Flex. We control the Flex testing. And some of the early signs are leading us to feel confident that our higher-performing partners can provide returns and be accretive earlier than a full market flip.</p><p>But again, given just the basic inputs of our core business, which is still the majority of the revenue that we report from PA, these trends along with continuing product innovations, investments we're making in connections and operational improvements are driving strong forward indicators. So we feel very comfortable. The guidance range we provided gives us the ability to continue to test a variety of monetization models, including Flex, while still supporting this core MBP business.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: And yes, I mean, the inputs are -- all the inputs are improving. On the high-performing partners question and providing more clarity, it's really what it is. It's unsurprisingly when we find partners who use our software, understand our system, we explain our system well, and they -- and give good customer service and convert those customers into buyers, transactors of homes, those are the partners we're looking for. And we are testing and learning different things in different markets. It's too early to make any broad generalizations to characterize what those partners look like, but we're finding them. We're finding enough of them. We're seeing enough good results to continue to methodically expand our Flex tests.</p><p>I would say we're looking for high-performance partners across the universe of PA, too. Flex is a very small part of the overall Premier Agent business. And the whole -- the company's new focus on the transaction itself and what it takes to get a customer into a new home has actually brought goodness to the whole of the Premier Agent business as well and taught us how to focus on what customers really want. So...</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY, MD &amp; LEAD INTERNET RESEARCH ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: I had 2 questions on the Homes business. But Rich, thanks for quoting Bob Seger. On the Homes business, the one thing that looks a lot is that there was a sequential decline in homes inventory. So could you not find enough homes that you wanted to purchase? Is it harder for you? Is there some reason? Is that a more competitive market? Just explain why this is the first time in which you -- that kind of that -- those 2 numbers have flipped, homes sold and homes purchased.</p><p>And then secondly, in the homes, thanks for the business economics, that kind of drill down is really valuable. And I know it's a small part of the cost equation here. You've got this nice leverage in home acquisition cost, but you've got this deleverage and renovation costs. And I don't know why that would be, but that's kind of offsetting everything and kind of driving you. I know it's within your guardrails, but it did turn your return on homes sold negative before interest expense. Just explain what's happening with the renovation costs.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: Yes. Okay. Okay. Great. Maybe I'll turn the second one, Mark, over to Allen on that. But on the first part of your question, I guess I'd deflect first and say we had remarkable growth in selling our Zillow-owned homes, right? It's $603 million in revenue. That was up, I don't know, almost 15x from the year before. So it's turned into a really big number, and that's pretty remarkable.</p><p>On the purchase deceleration or decline that you asked about, we actually planned for purchases to be down sequentially going into Q4 due to seasonality. Q4 is a slow -- historically a slow selling season. And so we were appropriately cautious heading into the quarter, and we fulfilled against our plan to do that. So that was not a surprise.</p><p>What did surprise us a bit was how good our resale volume was. It was much higher than expected. It made us a bigger net seller than we actually expected. And I would say this is a credit to applying all these learnings we're gaining. The unit numbers in this business are starting to build. They're still small but they're starting to build. And each new unit that we transact, it pumps data and learning into the machine and people. And we're getting better at pricing homes. We're getting better at price drop strategy. We're getting better at all the stuff that is required to price and sell the home. And so we were able to move a lot more homes than we anticipated.</p><p>I guess I'd say looking forward, because we still are in the early days, most of our markets are really young, we expect it to be -- it won't be a nice, clean -- it will be a lumpy path. It won't be a nice, clean, linear thing, which is one of the reasons we're only guiding one quarter out.</p><p>Now on the renovation deleverage, I'll turn it over to Allen.</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: Yes. Mark, it's Allen Parker. Yes. So as you called out, renovations as a percentage of average revenue was 4.69% in Q4 versus 4.02%, a negative -- basically an increase of 67 basis points quarter-over-quarter. I'll call out that we believe there's opportunity across all 4 lines. We did get 21 basis points improvement in home acquisition costs.</p><p>I wouldn't read too much of anything in the quarter-over-quarter trends right now as we're testing and iterating across all of these markets. What I will say is we have a team that's very focused on what's the right amount to spend on renovation to make the home great for our customer but without overdoing it and spending money on things we don't need to.</p><p>So we've got an opportunity. We obviously -- in total, we were 48 basis points negative as a percentage of revenue and well within our, as you mentioned, our plus or minus 200 basis points. I wouldn't read too much into changes, but that's definitely an area we're focused on, in renovation, although we're focused across all 4 expense lines as well.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question comes from Justin Patterson with Raymond James.</p><p>JUSTIN TYLER PATTERSON, INTERNET ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES &amp; ASSOCIATES, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Great. A couple on Flex. Could you talk about your learnings in 2019, the markets you're expanding to in 2020 and on the puts and takes around further expansion?</p><p>And then finally, I wanted to go back to Flex partners and extensibility. Is there anything you can do to help nudge that general agent population toward becoming higher performers in Flex? Or do you think it's a little more binary? It simply works for some but not everyone.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: Okay. Yes. I mean I think our big learnings for PA overall, but Flex included, for 2019 is how, regardless of business model, we are looking to, like any other funnel transaction business, increase conversion and increase take rate, increase yield, okay? And we have had an intuition that there's upside in those 2 big levers for quite some time, and we're starting to actually -- we're starting to actually see that. And we feel that both have room to grow.</p><p>The history of our Premier Agent business is a history of innovating on the business model, trying to drive those 2 levers. And Flex is simply the latest instance of that innovation. Now we had to start talking about it more specifically because of revenue recognition stuff, but it's really just an instance of that business model innovation.</p><p>And we're pretty early. The first big Flex markets were really Phoenix and Atlanta, which we launched in Q4. So we're still really in the early learning phases of this. But we've seen interesting stuff on these interesting results with these high-performing -- high-performance partners to give us the confidence to expand the test. So we've seen that data. We're expanding methodically. Allen has taken you through what we think the impact will be going forward in 2020. But we like what we're seeing.</p><p>And I guess the customer-oriented person in me also really likes that with Flex, we drive a better conversion percentage, a better conversion rate, and that is the single greatest driver towards customer satisfaction. And so we have happier customers as well. And so all of that is a long-winded way of me kind of saying we kind of look at this as an optimization problem now, and we're continuing to innovate on these models.</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: Yes. And I'll just add, Rich, that in terms of the launch plan, our market plan, it's still very fluid. As Rich said, it's early. We just felt that including the flexibility to have to expand testing as needed and calling out the impact of that in our 2020 outlook provided you guys with a little bit of stabilization on Flex' impact and gives us some of the flexibility to look at testing. I think initially, it's going to be a very small test that starts in Q2. But if we find that there are some benefits there and that we become accretive sooner, we've given ourselves some flexibility to expand those tests in Q3 and Q4, without having to come back with the guidance change, if that makes sense.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: And Justin, I think your last part of the question was about nudge and binary. Is there something we can do to nudge? We think we have a ton of upside in mechanizing and professionalizing and applying software and modern technology to this nurture funnel, to the sales funnel. And there has been a woeful, an embarrassing lack of tech investment in the real estate industry for pretty much its history. And so we're waiting into -- a gnarly problem, yes. But it's a really fertile field. There's a long pent-up desire to kind of mechanize and professionalize through software this industry. So we have a lot -- we see opportunity everywhere we look.</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: Right. And it's fair to say that, that opportunity can be spread across our MBP business, the learnings.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: No question, yes.</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: Which is a great lever. It's not just in Flex.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: Yes. And honestly, like a lot of the learnings we're gaining are coming from our Zillow Offers business as well because we're actually the primary with our Zillow-owned homes and Zillow Offers. And that has a way of focusing the mind and the development docket to when we're actually buying and selling homes, and we need to do it more efficiently, and we want to do it more efficiently. We're actually utilizing some of those processes. We're learning from ZO for our PA business as well.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Tom White with D.A. Davidson.</p><p>THOMAS CAUTHORN WHITE, SENIOR VP &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, D.A. DAVIDSON &amp; CO., RESEARCH DIVISION: A very nice quarter. A couple on the guidance, if I may. I guess what stood out most to me was the big ramp in implied EBITDA margins for the IMT segment. I think the midpoint was like 27%, and the high end was something like 28%. Can you just talk a bit more about the specific drivers of that leverage?</p><p>And then on the PA outlook for 2020, I think it sounds like back to double digits kind of ex Flex. Maybe -- it sounds like you're leaning into these kind of top-performing agents. I'm trying to reconcile that with the comments about retention at peak levels. Just kind of curious about how some of the other not peak performing agents are behaving or reacting to the fact that they're presumably getting fewer leads or fewer connections.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: Okay. Maybe, Allen, the first part?</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: Yes. Yes. Tom, thanks for the question. So before I get to 2020, I'm just going to step back to the performance we saw on margin expansion in 2019. So again, in 2019, we were able to expand IMT margins by 381% -- 381 basis points, sorry, 381 basis points. And that expansion is coming from and kind of reflects the fundamental health of our business. We have improved connections with our customers, which is leading to better retention rates with our agents and has driven accelerating revenues. And at the same time, our cost management is driving operational leverage.</p><p>So it's kind of a best of both worlds. Our teams have been focused on prudent resource allocation and cost controls and has led to efficiencies in our operations and overhead. We are investing. We're investing in connections. We're investing in products, but we've been able to fund those investments through prioritization and kind of a lot of discipline around discretionary spending.</p><p>So with that 381 basis points of expansion, looking into accelerating growth and our outlook for 2020, we feel like we can continue those trends, continue to invest to grow the business but also yield 300 to 400 basis points of leverage in margin. And you're right, at the midpoint, it's about 350 basis points of margin improvement and about 27.3% margin rate.</p><p>So again, we made a lot of traction this year. And as we grow, and we can grow with investments but funding those internally and taking a hard look at discretionary spend, leverage efficiency, we feel really good about our opportunity to grow next year and to grow EBITDA at a rate of 2.5 to 3x our top line.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: And that's really one of the big themes of the year, Tom, is this operating leverage mindset and this prioritization mindset and this mindset where teams don't go into budgeting thinking, oh, what is my add to what I already have, how many more heads am I going to add. It's actually having crisp priorities, OKRs against those priorities and having us all together make trade-offs all the way throughout the organization about what the priorities are. It's really bearing fruit. And I sense there's more leverage, but I don't know. I think Allen would agree with that.</p><p>Anyway, on your last bit, I mean I think we should probably kind of let -- it was about retention and how agents are feeling about the move to Flex in some markets and ZO move, which is unsettling to a lot of agents and what that's doing to retention. I think the numbers kind of can speak for themselves like -- although I guess we didn't share specifics, but we have said that we're seeing some of the highest retention rates in our MBP PA.</p><p>So the core traditional business, the big business that -- the one that you're worried about, we were seeing the highest -- some of the highest retention rates we've ever seen. And so despite the fact that we are doing all of these, making all of these -- some might characterize as aggressive moves but really just innovative moves in the space with Zillow Offers and with Flex, we are doing well with our traditional partners.</p><p>They sense real opportunity here. They also know that we get 173 million unique users a month that come to our sites and that our brand, Zillow, the word Zillow is searched more in Google than the term real estate. They know that. And so good news flows from that great relationship we have with all these customers.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.</p><p>LLOYD WHARTON WALMSLEY, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: I have 2, if I can. First, can you give us any sense for how monetization of Flex looks on a per lead basis versus the kind of traditional Premier Agent business? What are you seeing in terms of the ultimate rev per lead accretion? And what kind of rev rec lag should we be thinking about in terms of timing?</p><p>And I guess second one would just be can you walk us through the impact of adding the request a tour, the impact of that on the conversion to leads and kind of the timing of that rollout across the footprint. Anything you can help us with there would be great.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: Okay. Allen, maybe you can take the first part, yes.</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: I'll take the first one. So to answer, it's still really early in our testing as Rich mentioned. We just launched Phoenix and Atlanta in Q4, so we don't have enough data points yet to extrapolate a curve on what we think that multiplier impact will be. But as Rich mentioned, the goal of the program is to improve our revenue per lead. So we needed to be accretive for it to work. We control the testing here.</p><p>As we get further along, I think we will be able to have more information, and we'll share that as we feel good about what that extrapolation curve looks like. So what we have done right now is try to give you, like I said, just a guardrail of what we think the impact will be on our top line growth rate for the Flex programs. You can kind of have a with and without as you think about your growth curves. Same thing...</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: You're talking about the 300 basis points?</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: 300 basis points for the year, 400 basis points for Q1.</p><p>And then with respect to the rev recognition, we continue to assess that. We've made a lot of progress in improving and putting the structure in place to ensure that we understand when transactions occur and get paid for that. But the N is still fairly small just given when we started in Q4. So we don't have a good curve for cash, cash collection curve at the full cohort of, say, a month of lead. So we'll keep you posted on that.</p><p>On the impact of tours on lead conversion, do you want to get that?</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: Yes, sure. Okay. So if you think about the conversion funnel, I'm waving my arms, drawing a picture in the air here. At the very top of the funnel, we have visits. And at the bottom, we have somebody moving into their new home. Lots of steps in that conversion funnel, lots of levers and decision points all along the way to improve conversion.</p><p>For example, a visitor turning into a submit, a submit into a meeting, a meeting into a house tour or straight from submit to house tour, from house tour to offer, et cetera, et cetera. Every one of these levers, we have the opportunity to pull, we believe, twist and improve. And we can address a lot of these with better training but also with software, which is great.</p><p>The tour lever is just one of them, and it's an interesting one. As you might imagine, a lot of buyers are on Zillow and Trulia and StreetEasy, and what they really want to do is go see the place. And so we have done some great feature work in the last quarter to improve the coverage of Tour It Now for our customers. And that is just one of a patchwork or a collection of features and products that we're working on to improve that conversion.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.</p><p>BRIAN THOMAS NOWAK, RESEARCH ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Bob Seger and Robert Frost, same prepared remarks, tough act to follow, Rich. I have 2. So I know it's early in Flex with only 2 markets with Atlanta and Phoenix, but just maybe could you talk to us a little bit about 1 or 2 of the friction points or areas that you've really improved on in those 2 markets, whether it's measurement, tying things through, getting the right agents? Just talk us through some of the blocking and tackling that's improved that you think will make Flex go smoother going forward.</p><p>And then on Homes, maybe talk to us how you're thinking about sort of the profitability of your oldest markets throughout 2020 once you sort of have less upfront costs and start to get more potential leverage, et cetera?</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: Thanks for recognizing that, Brian. I don't know if I had any other embedded references in there. On the kind of Flex friction points and what's working and what's not, I mean we are really early, but we are discovering, as I said before, kind of a woeful lack of kind of application of software to better nurture the transaction experience in this industry.</p><p>Traditional brokerages do not have and have not had big tech and dev budgets. They have really -- they just haven't invested in technology. And that hasn't really necessarily been their primary concern anyway because their business models have been a little different. So we're seeing a tremendous amount of opportunity all along the nurture funnel of a customer.</p><p>And as we find things, we're automating it. We're finding the right partners who can -- who are better at converting these things. I mean even basic things like drip marketing and e-mail communication and when is the right time to call and when is the right time to send an e-mail and don't overwhelm consumers and bombard them with e-mails because they'll get turned off and they'll go away, these kinds of -- some basic stuff that we have been in the tech business for a long time kind of take for granted. But we're bringing those fresh skills to this industry, and we see a lot of opportunity.</p><p>On the Homes, the second part of Brian's question, Allen, do you want to try to do some Homes -- the Homes question?</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: Yes. Yes. So I think the question was how are we looking at profits in our oldest home markets in 2020. So again, with respect to Homes in all markets, actually, we're continuing to measure and look at ways to ensure we're improving year-over-year. But at the same time, even in our oldest markets, they're still not that old, and we are testing and iterating on resell and acquisition and a variety of other measures that could impact profitability quarter-over-quarter just given what that test is and what its outcome is.</p><p>So right now, what we're looking at Homes on is we expect to improve overall margin percentage on Homes on an annual basis. It may not always be sequentially quarterly. We are holding Homes accountable for improving efficiencies and processes and all of the automation things that are required for us to scale. So we have OKRs, as Rich mentioned, to ensure we're getting more productive and efficient. But at the same time, we are still very much iterating and learning around the sale -- acquire and resell process that could affect profits from time to time.</p><p>So I guess what I'd say is that we'll continue to look for that Homes profitability to improve annually as a percentage of revenue, but I don't think there's a bifurcation between what we'll call old home markets and new home markets today.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Naved Khan with SunTrust.</p><p>NAVED AHMAD KHAN, ANALYST, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. Maybe you can give us some sense around the expansion of Flex traditional markets. Is it going to be ZIP Codes? Or are these going to be entire markets you're thinking about maybe in second quarter or the back half? Can this 5% coverage that you have for Flex, can it go to 10% by year-end?</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: So we're learning really rapidly on the expansion of Flex. We've tried a bunch of different things in different markets. And hanging our strategy on a particular geography or ZIP Code is kind of not the way we're doing it. We're looking at high-performing partners, getting it working and then landing and expanding from there.</p><p>And so that will take a different shape for maybe how we've talked about it in the past. We can see Flex running simultaneously in markets right alongside MBP and us optimizing between the 2 as we grow and learn.</p><p>On the 5% question, I think what we're trying to do in our 2020 guidance, maybe I'll let Allen repeat it, we're trying to simply build some room to test Flex and expand Flex methodically right into our guidance.</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: Yes. And the way I would describe it is that a percentage of MRR can have a varying effect depending on what period of time throughout the year you do it. So we think the most appropriate metric to share with you guys to give you a feel for with and without Flex is what our expected impact of -- net impact of Flex is for the year, which is a 300 basis points of revenue growth that we called out in my prepared statements.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: The midpoint of the guide on 2020 is Premier Agent growing...</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: 7%.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: 7%?</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: Correct.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: And plus 300 basis points to 7.4%.</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: No, 300 basis points to 10%.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: Sorry, 300 basis points to 10%. Got it. Just adding it to the 7.4%.</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: Exactly.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: I just want to be clear.</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: Yes. And again, it is really fluid. I think the only thing we kind of know we're going to do is start some very small testing with high-performing partners in various markets, but that will be a small test in Q2. And then we'll have better learnings from our tests we launched last year as well as early reads on those to determine whether we do anything in the second half.</p><p>We just wanted to give ourselves the flexibility to provide you with those guardrails, so we weren't surprising. But as we learn stuff that -- around a lot of the questions that have been asked today, we'll continue to communicate where appropriate.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: Overall, in PA, we really like the growth we're seeing. We're impressed with the growth we're seeing. The growth of EBITDA is -- the growth rate of EBITDA is far exceeding the growth of revenue as well, which is nice. So we're showing leverage. This is a healthy business that we're optimistic about.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from John Campbell with Stephens Inc.</p><p>JOHN ROBERT CAMPBELL, MD, STEPHENS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Great job getting Premier Agent back on a firm footing. I'm sure you guys saw this with your Seattle rev in Redfin. They announced the pricing change. We were kind of viewing that as maybe serving as potential to increase the stickiness or drive some desired behavior around the home sellers, also using them on the buy side on the next home. I don't know. That was pretty interesting. But I don't know what you guys can do, but I'm curious, is there something that you can do to drive better adoption across the ancillary businesses or maybe help steer more customers to Flex conversions? I don't know if you can offer up lower closing costs or if there's some type of rebate that you can provide from the commission fees from Flex.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: We will test all kinds of things, and in fact, are testing all kinds of things. Some of you actually noticed us testing some things. Don't over extrapolate those things onto the whole business.</p><p>I guess what I'd say, at least with respect to Zillow Offers in that is -- and adjacencies is that we're really focused on getting the hub of the wheel of transaction of TAM solid and rolling. We want to get the wheel rolling and getting the Zillow Offers transaction to a place where it's solid, predictable and showing leverage first is our #1 priority. And then we have all these ancillary adjacent transaction that hang off of and are dependent upon or tied to that transaction, including title and escrow and mortgage and others in the future perhaps. We're working on those, and we have planted some good stakes in the ground, and they're showing good promise.</p><p>But the overall numbers of Zillow Offers home transactions are actually still pretty small. So we're not going to see a lot of -- we're not going to see a lot of action in that for a little while. We do feel like the whole wheel of transactions though provides us with a large amount of opportunity. And we believe that once they're integrated, we can offer a highly differentiated customer experience because they are all connected.</p><p>And so that -- a customer can approach on more one click like transaction. We're not really seeing that yet in real estate, but we're seeing it in car transactions at Tesla. We're seeing it in a lot of other major transactions that people wouldn't necessarily have thought of as e-commerce transactions. And we're going to see that in real estate, too. These transactions are going to get much more streamlined, efficient and integrated.</p><p>ALLEN PARKER: Right. And I think our partner agents are going to play a role in those innovative transactions as well. And that is what we're testing.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: Yes, no question. In fact, the Bowen -- the example I used -- watch the video. I'm serious. It's really good. That -- the Bowen transaction, the Atlanta couple -- the Atlanta family has started with a Premier Agent and it ended up incorporating Zillow Offers into that and enabling not a one click but a one step, like a same-weekend type transaction. And that's cool.</p><p>JOHN ROBERT CAMPBELL: And speaking of not extrapolating, I feel like I have to ask you this. But with the brokerage license you guys recently got in New York, I'm guessing that's because of Flex. But can you talk to why you need that and whether we should expect you to maybe continue picking that up on a state-by-state basis as you expand Flex?</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: Yes. Look, most people don't know this, but we've been brokers for a long time in most places. We're going around cleaning stuff up and doing that. Now we've done that in an abundance of caution, kind of belt and suspenders stuff because the amount of regulation in these industries we operate is quite high. And so long ago, we got our brokerage licenses. This happens to break into the surface and get into the open air in New York and attract a little attention. But really, there's no new news there.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rich Barton for any closing remarks.</p><p>RICHARD N. BARTON: Okay. Thanks for your time today, guys. We are really pleased with our progress to replatform the real estate industry. And we're, as you can tell, excited about what's yet to come. Today's on demand, always on consumers who're eager for a better way to move and we're the best positioned company with our audience size, our technical expertise, our great partners, our platform, our team. We're in the best position to lead this revolution.</p><p>Our investments are enabling Zillow to begin to participate directly in market making, dramatically expanding our TAM that we believe will drive top and bottom line results for us and for shareholder return over time. We really appreciate your support, your counsel and your feedback as partners in this journey. Thanks a lot. We'll talk to you soon.</p><p>OPERATOR: The conference has now concluded.

There were three drivers: The success of the iPhone, launched with a different pricing structure in September when Apple did not add a premium to the new model, making it relatively cheaper; Wearables, with over USD10bn in sales in the quarter, thanks to the success of the AirPods; Services, which has become a USD50bn a year business, with the launch of Apple TV+ this quarter. Apple reports 450mn subscribers to any of its services, out of an installed iOS base of 1.5bn. The latter is part of the company's long-term strategy, leveraging its strength in hardware. We expect Apple to bundle its different services under one monthly fee, and possibly add hardware to the mix, giving customers the possibility to upgrade as they wish. This is why the company will be looking to launch a cheaper iPhone to increase its addressable base and service penetration in emerging markets, while the launch of the first 5G iPhone towards the end of the year should provide another Q4 boost.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"336\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> iPhone, Services And Wearables Boost Apple</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Apple Revenues, 2019</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2085H6kFpxe8mx723\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Apple </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis> also reported record sales in the quarter of USD87.4bn. Key drivers were e-commerce, cloud and streaming, which offset a decline in physical stores' sales. The company benefited from its strong investment in terms of its logistics, reducing delivery times from two days to one day. This has raised the number of Prime subscribers to 150mn, with subscriptions revenues up 34% to reach close to USD20bn during 2019. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon Web Services</emphasis> (AWS) continues to be Amazon's main profit earner, with revenues of USD35bn during the year, while the company is increasingly moving into the advertising space. Amazon will continue to heavily invest as it has always done, and a core focus for the company is India.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"296\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> E-Commerce, Cloud Driving Amazon</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Amazon Y-o-Y Revenue Growth (%), Q419</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2018FQta8koy5B266\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Amazon </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Microsoft is another winner this quarter. Key drivers were Office subscriptions and cloud services, which were up by 17% and 27% y-o-y respectively; Azure, its dedicated cloud service, was up 62% during the year. And this offsets slower revenues and even declines for its other segments, such as hardware and gaming; Surface revenues were up by 6%, but down by 11% for Xbox, with overall gaming revenues declining by 21%.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"320\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Microsoft Increasingly A Service Company </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Microsoft Revenues (USDbn), 2018-2019</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2036wu7MNXfRS6941\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Microsoft </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netflix</emphasis> enters 2020 as both the incumbent in the streaming space, and the only pure player. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Disney</emphasis> reporting 26.5mn subscribers in its first quarter of launch in the US highlights the increased competition, in a market where its addressable base has become limited, because most US households who want Netflix are already subscribers. We still do not think that streaming will become a zero-sum game, with consumers choosing more than one service, but as price rises are unlikely, overseas expansion represents the best opportunity for growth. And as for all streaming services, content will be the crucial differentiator, and Netflix continues to be the company investing the most.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"304\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> Netflix Going International </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Netflix Net Additions (000), 2018-2019</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2088V22WIpDxHv905\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Netflix </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis> reported slowing revenue growth, even if its user base is still increasing. The company has invested heavily in its platform, impacting profitability, in order to make it more secure, but to further integrate Facebook, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Instagram </emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> WhatsApp </emphasis> before any potential regulation. Advertising still represents 98.5% of its revenues, and it needs to diversify, even as its efforts into financial services ( <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Libra </emphasis>) seem to have failed. Unlike <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis>, which has an operating system (Android) and a browser (Chrome), Facebook lacks these distribution channels which makes it vulnerable at a time of increased privacy regulation. Facebook also remains very reliant on the US market, and its stand regarding political advertising will have an impact in 2020, both in terms of profitability and reputation.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"264\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Facebook Relying On The US Market </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Facebook's ARPU (USD), Q419</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2033EAj1qe6rhy702\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Facebook </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet</emphasis> also reported slower growth, suggesting that privacy regulations may have had an impact in the digital advertising market.

AWS is the leader, but Azure is the biggest grower, despite having larger revenues than Google Cloud, which is increasingly distanced in third place. AWS benefits from its early-mover advantage, whereas Microsoft has leveraged the corporate relationships it has built over many years, as well as focusing on some key sectors, such as healthcare with recent deals with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Novartis</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nuance</emphasis>. The USD10bn Pentagon JEDI contract, awarded to Microsoft but disputed by Amazon, is evidence of that growing duopoly.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"280\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> AWS And Microsoft Pulling Away </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Cloud Revenues Growth (%), Q419</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2030QyrD8a58AB432\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Advertising is however starting to become a three-player race. Google and Facebook still dominate, but Amazon is increasingly making an impact. Unlike the other two, it is not the core part of its revenue stream, but it can still leverage the data it has on customers, not just through its website but also through its smart home strategy. Amazon also has greater control on the content which appears on its platform, and that is positive for brands, which have been looking to a new player to enter the market.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_8\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"448\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Amazon Increasingly Viable </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Advertising Revenues (USDbn) And Yearly Growth (%), 2019</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2007nobM8X0GZ8651\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>It is no surprise that the three companies which have performed the best - Apple, Amazon and Microsoft - are also the ones which have focused the most on subscriptions and services. Apple reported 450mn subscribers to any one of its services, out of an installed base of 1.5bn iOS devices, whereas Amazon announced 150mn Prime subscribers. Alongside Microsoft in the corporate space, this highlights another of our long-term view, the move from product to service, and the need for companies to have recurring revenues from their customers. We expect Apple, Amazon and Microsoft to continue to focus on services in 2020, extending their leadership in that space.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_9\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"312\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> The March To Recurring Revenues </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Subscriptions Revenues Growth (%), Q419</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2052rW5bjo0RDT948\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Wild Card: coronavirus?</emphasis> The coronavirus presents a downside risk to the tech sector in the coming months, and there are two aspects to consider.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_10\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"312\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> China Important For Apple In Q1 </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Apple China Revenues (USDbn), 2012-2019</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2065bT1MgXXmb1494\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Apple </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>The first is retail sales, with Lunar New Year being one of the most important periods of the year. Apple has closed its 42 retail stores in China, and this will have an impact as China usually has the most impact on its overall sales in Q1. Online sales could offset some of this, but the unusually large guidance, of between USD63bn and USD67bn for Q1, suggests some worries.The second is its impact on the global supply chain, as China remains the main manufacturing hub. Most companies will have enough stock for several weeks, but the longer the restrictions regarding movement continues, the more likely there may be delays or shortages of new products, because they cannot be assembled in time in China through lack of available labour.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_11\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"400\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> Semiconductors Indicative Of Supply Chain Reliance </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>China Revenue Share (%), 2019</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2076vcdDfeui50160\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Qualcomm, Intel </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BMINWS-1524957</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BMINWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6059-N091-JD33-J48P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1467\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Business Monitor International Ltd.

There were three drivers: The success of the iPhone, launched with a different pricing structure in September when Apple did not add a premium to the new model, making it relatively cheaper; Wearables, with over USD10bn in sales in the quarter, thanks to the success of the AirPods; Services, which has become a USD50bn a year business, with the launch of Apple TV+ this quarter. Apple reports 450mn subscribers to any of its services, out of an installed iOS base of 1.5bn. The latter is part of the company's long-term strategy, leveraging its strength in hardware. We expect Apple to bundle its different services under one monthly fee, and possibly add hardware to the mix, giving customers the possibility to upgrade as they wish. This is why the company will be looking to launch a cheaper iPhone to increase its addressable base and service penetration in emerging markets, while the launch of the first 5G iPhone towards the end of the year should provide another Q4 boost.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"336\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> iPhone, Services And Wearables Boost Apple </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Apple Revenues, 2019</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2085H6kFpxe8mx723\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Apple </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis> also reported record sales in the quarter of USD87.4bn. Key drivers were e-commerce, cloud and streaming, which offset a decline in physical stores' sales. The company benefited from its strong investment in terms of its logistics, reducing delivery times from two days to one day. This has raised the number of Prime subscribers to 150mn, with subscriptions revenues up 34% to reach close to USD20bn during 2019. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon Web Services</emphasis> (AWS) continues to be Amazon's main profit earner, with revenues of USD35bn during the year, while the company is increasingly moving into the advertising space. Amazon will continue to heavily invest as it has always done, and a core focus for the company is India.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"296\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> E-Commerce, Cloud Driving Amazon</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Amazon Y-o-Y Revenue Growth (%), Q419</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2018FQta8koy5B266\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Amazon </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Microsoft is another winner this quarter. Key drivers were Office subscriptions and cloud services, which were up by 17% and 27% y-o-y respectively; Azure, its dedicated cloud service, was up 62% during the year. And this offsets slower revenues and even declines for its other segments, such as hardware and gaming; Surface revenues were up by 6%, but down by 11% for Xbox, with overall gaming revenues declining by 21%.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"320\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Microsoft Increasingly A Service Company </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Microsoft Revenues (USDbn), 2018-2019</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2036wu7MNXfRS6941\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Microsoft </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netflix</emphasis> enters 2020 as both the incumbent in the streaming space, and the only pure player. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Disney</emphasis> reporting 26.5mn subscribers in its first quarter of launch in the US highlights the increased competition, in a market where its addressable base has become limited, because most US households who want Netflix are already subscribers. We still do not think that streaming will become a zero-sum game, with consumers choosing more than one service, but as price rises are unlikely, overseas expansion represents the best opportunity for growth. And as for all streaming services, content will be the crucial differentiator, and Netflix continues to be the company investing the most.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"304\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> Netflix Going International </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Netflix Net Additions (000), 2018-2019</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2088V22WIpDxHv905\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Netflix </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis> reported slowing revenue growth, even if its user base is still increasing. The company has invested heavily in its platform, impacting profitability, in order to make it more secure, but to further integrate Facebook, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Instagram </emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> WhatsApp </emphasis> before any potential regulation. Advertising still represents 98.5% of its revenues, and it needs to diversify, even as its efforts into financial services ( <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Libra </emphasis>) seem to have failed. Unlike <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis>, which has an operating system (Android) and a browser (Chrome), Facebook lacks these distribution channels which makes it vulnerable at a time of increased privacy regulation. Facebook also remains very reliant on the US market, and its stand regarding political advertising will have an impact in 2020, both in terms of profitability and reputation.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"264\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Facebook Relying On The US Market </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Facebook's ARPU (USD), Q419</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2033EAj1qe6rhy702\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Facebook </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet</emphasis> also reported slower growth, suggesting that privacy regulations may have had an impact in the digital advertising market. The company split out <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YouTube</emphasis> and cloud revenues for the first time, reaching over USD15bn and close to USD9bn respectively in 2019. But hardware continues to be a drag, with the limited success of the Pixel, and it shows Google lagging behind its rivals in a series of sectors; Apple when it comes to hardware and premium smartphones, Amazon when it comes to the smart home, and both AWS and Microsoft when it comes to cloud services.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_6\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"264\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> Search Still Google's Core Driver </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Alphabet Revenues (%), 2019</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file20566NkvA1mTxo857\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Alphabet </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Trends: Cloud, Advertising And Subscriptions</emphasis> Based on one of our core views that big tech companies are increasingly competing with each other, we want to highlight three areas where that has become increasingly the case in Q419.Cloud is increasingly become a two-player market between AWS and Microsoft Azure. AWS is the leader, but Azure is the biggest grower, despite having larger revenues than Google Cloud, which is increasingly distanced in third place. AWS benefits from its early-mover advantage, whereas Microsoft has leveraged the corporate relationships it has built over many years, as well as focusing on some key sectors, such as healthcare with recent deals with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Novartis</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nuance</emphasis>. The USD10bn Pentagon JEDI contract, awarded to Microsoft but disputed by Amazon, is evidence of that growing duopoly.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"280\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> AWS And Microsoft Pulling Away </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Cloud Revenues Growth (%), Q419</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2030QyrD8a58AB432\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Advertising is however starting to become a three-player race. Google and Facebook still dominate, but Amazon is increasingly making an impact. Unlike the other two, it is not the core part of its revenue stream, but it can still leverage the data it has on customers, not just through its website but also through its smart home strategy. Amazon also has greater control on the content which appears on its platform, and that is positive for brands, which have been looking to a new player to enter the market.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_8\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"448\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Amazon Increasingly Viable </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Advertising Revenues (USDbn) And Yearly Growth (%), 2019</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2007nobM8X0GZ8651\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>It is no surprise that the three companies which have performed the best - Apple, Amazon and Microsoft - are also the ones which have focused the most on subscriptions and services. Apple reported 450mn subscribers to any one of its services, out of an installed base of 1.5bn iOS devices, whereas Amazon announced 150mn Prime subscribers. Alongside Microsoft in the corporate space, this highlights another of our long-term view, the move from product to service, and the need for companies to have recurring revenues from their customers. We expect Apple, Amazon and Microsoft to continue to focus on services in 2020, extending their leadership in that space.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_9\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"312\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> The March To Recurring Revenues </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Subscriptions Revenues Growth (%), Q419</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2052rW5bjo0RDT948\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Wild Card: coronavirus?</emphasis> The coronavirus presents a downside risk to the tech sector in the coming months, and there are two aspects to consider.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_10\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"312\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> China Important For Apple In Q1 </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Apple China Revenues (USDbn), 2012-2019</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2065bT1MgXXmb1494\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Apple </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>The first is retail sales, with Lunar New Year being one of the most important periods of the year. Apple has closed its 42 retail stores in China, and this will have an impact as China usually has the most impact on its overall sales in Q1. Online sales could offset some of this, but the unusually large guidance, of between USD63bn and USD67bn for Q1, suggests some worries.The second is its impact on the global supply chain, as China remains the main manufacturing hub. Most companies will have enough stock for several weeks, but the longer the restrictions regarding movement continues, the more likely there may be delays or shortages of new products, because they cannot be assembled in time in China through lack of available labour.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_11\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"400\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> Semiconductors Indicative Of Supply Chain Reliance </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>China Revenue Share (%), 2019</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2076vcdDfeui50160\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Qualcomm, Intel </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMTEIN-1524957</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMTEIN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6056-08J1-JD33-J15W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">323177</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1467\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Business Monitor International Ltd.

Verdi Discusses Hollywood Deals and Tech Investments in Apple and NXT-ID Inc.'s (OTCQB: NXTD) Wocket<br/>NEW YORK and POINT ROBERTS, Washington - May 19, 2014 (Investorideas.com Newswire)</p><p><br/> Verdi to Produce/Executive Produce Three Films with Oscar winning Director Martin Scorsese: Star studded actors include <person><nameText>Liam Neeson, </nameText></person>Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver<br/> \"You may see a Wocket in a very famous Pocket\" - C. Verdi<br/> Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading topics and sectors including technology and entertainment, releases an exclusive QA with entrepreneurial movie producer, businessman and investor Chad A. Verdi of Rhode Island.<br/> Mr. Verdi discusses new and recent ventures including new movie deals and his investments in game-changing technologies, including Apple and biometric mobile security company NXT-ID Inc., (OTCQB: NXTD[1]), which is currently preparing to launch its smart wallet, the Wocket\u2122 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wocketwallet.com\">www.wocketwallet.com</url>[2]), with advance orders starting May 28th.<br/> Mr. Verdi notes, \"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies. Steve Jobs made Apple known for 'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto, 'Screw it , let's do it' and I live by 'Go big or go home'.\"<br/> QA Interview:<br/> Q: Investorideas.com<br/> This past year has already seen you reach some key milestones; making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less than a year. What are you most excited about for the balance of this year?<br/> A: Chad A. Verdi<br/> Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am the most excited about NXTD right now, only because they are about to launch the Wocket\u2122 this month. Wocket\u2122 is a smart wallet with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics.<br/> I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide. Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it. I think Wocket\u2122 has the right approach; separate from your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens if they lose their phone or it gets stolen - what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket\u2122, it's not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info are safe!<br/> It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the payment sector that I thought it would!<br/> Q: Investorideas.com<br/> In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks and invest in smaller companies with emerging technology like NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off?<br/> A: Chad A. Verdi<br/> I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like I have with NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works.<br/> Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but it's hard to know if the vision will stay intact. NXTD is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that.<br/> In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and currently needs. The Wocket\u2122 can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product; the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my second-largest holding.<br/> Q: Investorideas.com<br/> The company stated that they will launch the Wocket\u2122 May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking advance orders for the Wocket\u2122 once the event is done. Will you be attending and will you be buying one once advance orders are opened up?<br/> A: Chad A. Verdi<br/> For sure I will be there supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket\u2122 is embraced. And of course, I will be buying many, many Wockets\u2122! I will be giving them out to all of my actor and celebrity friends in Hollywood. Soon, you may see a Wocket\u2122 in a very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event.<br/> Q: Investorideas.com<br/> Speaking about Hollywood and movies, you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB you have signed on <person><nameText>Liam Neeson, </nameText></person>Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films. It seems like you are on fire! How did this all come about?<br/> A: Chad A. Verdi<br/> Yes, it's just nuts, crazy nuts! It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his producing partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,' Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and they invited us to the premiere of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called 'Bad Hurt' that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated to where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, 'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza.<br/> Q: Investorideas.com<br/> That is exciting and all happening very fast. How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the ten picture deal with Screen Media?<br/> A: Chad A. Verdi<br/> That's what's amazing. Eighteen months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for This and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later than fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December 2014. Then we begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is to meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to facilitate this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with.<br/> About the Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Production Company:<br/> Both Verdi Productions and The Woodhaven Production Company are fully funded film production companies, covering all aspects of filmmaking from conception of script through postproduction.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.woodhavenfilms.com\">http://www.woodhavenfilms.com</url>/[3],       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.verdifilms.com\">http://www.verdifilms.com</url>/[4]<br/> About Chad Verdi<br/> Chad A.

Mr. Verdi notes, \"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies. </p><p>Steve Jobs made Apple known for 'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto, 'Screw it , let's do it' and I live by 'Go big or go home'.\" Q&amp;A Interview: Q: Investorideas.com This past year has already seen you reach some key milestones; making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less than a year. What are you most excited about for the balance of this year? A: Chad A. Verdi Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am the most excited about NXTD right now, only because they are about to launch the Wocket\u2122 this month. Wocket\u2122 is a smart wallet with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics. I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide. Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it. I think Wocket\u2122 has the right approach; separate from your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens if they lose their phone or it gets stolen - what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket\u2122, it's not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info are safe! It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the payment sector that I thought it would! Q: Investorideas.com In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks and invest in smaller companies with emerging technology like NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off? A: Chad A. Verdi I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like I have with NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works. Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but it's hard to know if the vision will stay intact. NXTD is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that. In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and currently needs. The Wocket\u2122 can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product; the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my second-largest holding. Q: Investorideas.com The company stated that they will launch the Wocket\u2122 May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking advance orders for the Wocket\u2122 once the event is done. Will you be attending and will you be buying one once advance orders are opened up? A: Chad A. Verdi For sure I will be there supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket\u2122 is embraced. And of course, I will be buying many, many Wockets\u2122! I will be giving them out to all of my actor and celebrity friends in Hollywood. Soon, you may see a Wocket\u2122 in a very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event. Q: Investorideas.com Speaking about Hollywood and movies, you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB you have signed on Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films. It seems like you are on fire! How did this all come about? A: Chad A. Verdi Yes, it's just nuts, crazy nuts! It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his producing partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,' Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and they invited us to the premiere of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called 'Bad Hurt' that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated to where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, 'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza. Q: Investorideas.com That is exciting and all happening very fast. How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the ten picture deal with Screen Media? A: Chad A. Verdi That's what's amazing. Eighteen months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for This and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later than fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December 2014. Then we begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is to meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to facilitate this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with. About the Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Production Company: Both Verdi Productions and The Woodhaven Production Company are fully funded film production companies, covering all aspects of filmmaking from conception of script through postproduction.<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woodhavenfilms.com%2F\">http://www.woodhavenfilms.com/</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verdifilms.com%2F\">http://www.verdifilms.com/</url>About Chad Verdi Chad A.

Verdi Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading topics and sectors including technology and entertainment, releases an exclusive Q&amp;A with entrepreneurial movie producer, businessman and investor Chad A.

Mr. Verdi notes, \"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies. </p><p>Steve Jobs made Apple known for 'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto, 'Screw it , let's do it' and I live by 'Go big or go home'.\" Q&amp;A Interview: Q: Investorideas.com This past year has already seen you reach some key milestones; making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less than a year. What are you most excited about for the balance of this year? A: Chad A. Verdi Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am the most excited about NXTD right now, only because they are about to launch the Wocket\u2122 this month. Wocket\u2122 is a smart wallet with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics. I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide. Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it. I think Wocket\u2122 has the right approach; separate from your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens if they lose their phone or it gets stolen - what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket\u2122, it's not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info are safe! It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the payment sector that I thought it would! Q: Investorideas.com In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks and invest in smaller companies with emerging technology like NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off? A: Chad A. Verdi I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like I have with NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works. Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but it's hard to know if the vision will stay intact. NXTD is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that. In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and currently needs. The Wocket\u2122 can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product; the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my second-largest holding. Q: Investorideas.com The company stated that they will launch the Wocket\u2122 May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking advance orders for the Wocket\u2122 once the event is done. Will you be attending and will you be buying one once advance orders are opened up? A: Chad A. Verdi For sure I will be there supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket\u2122 is embraced. And of course, I will be buying many, many Wockets\u2122! I will be giving them out to all of my actor and celebrity friends in Hollywood. Soon, you may see a Wocket\u2122 in a very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event. Q: Investorideas.com Speaking about Hollywood and movies, you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB you have signed on Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films. It seems like you are on fire! How did this all come about? A: Chad A. Verdi Yes, it's just nuts, crazy nuts! It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his producing partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,' Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and they invited us to the premiere of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called 'Bad Hurt' that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated to where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, 'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza.

As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December 2014. Then we begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is to meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to facilitate this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with. About the Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Production Company: Both Verdi Productions and The Woodhaven Production Company are fully funded film production companies, covering all aspects of filmmaking from conception of script through postproduction.<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woodhavenfilms.com%2F\">http://www.woodhavenfilms.com/</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verdifilms.com%2F\">http://www.verdifilms.com/</url>About Chad Verdi Chad A.

Verdi of Rhode Island.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Verdi discusses new and recent ventures including new movie deals and\u00a0his investments in\u00a0game-changing\u00a0technologies,\u00a0including Apple and\u00a0biometric mobile security company NXT-ID Inc., (OTCQB: NXTD),\u00a0which\u00a0is currently\u00a0preparing\u00a0to launch its smart wallet, the Wocket(TM), with advance orders starting May 28th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr.\u00a0Verdi notes,\u00a0\"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies.\u00a0Steve Jobs made Apple known for\u00a0'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto,\u00a0'Screw it ,\u00a0let's\u00a0do it'\u00a0and I live by 'Go big or go\u00a0home'.\"</p><p>Q&amp;A Interview:<br/><br/>Q:\u00a0Investorideas.com<br/>This past year has already seen\u00a0you reach\u00a0some key milestones;\u00a0making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less\u00a0than a\u00a0year. What\u00a0are you most excited about for the balance of this year?</p><p>A:\u00a0Chad\u00a0A. Verdi<br/>Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am\u00a0the\u00a0most excited about NXTD right now,\u00a0only because they are about to launch the Wocket(TM)\u00a0this month.\u00a0Wocket(TM)\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0smart wallet\u00a0with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics.</p><p>I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide.\u00a0Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps\u00a0like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it.\u00a0I think Wocket(TM)\u00a0has the right approach; separate from\u00a0your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens\u00a0if\u00a0they\u00a0lose\u00a0their phone or it gets stolen\u00a0-\u00a0what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket(TM),\u00a0it's\u00a0not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info\u00a0are\u00a0safe!</p><p>It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the\u00a0payment sector that I thought it would!\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Q:\u00a0Investorideas.com<br/>In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and\u00a0Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks\u00a0and invest in smaller\u00a0companies with emerging technology like\u00a0NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off?</p><p>A:\u00a0Chad\u00a0A. Verdi<br/>I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like\u00a0I\u00a0have with\u00a0NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works.</p><p>Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but\u00a0it's\u00a0hard to know if the vision will stay intact. \u00a0NXTD\u00a0is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that.\u00a0</p><p>In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and\u00a0currently\u00a0needs. The Wocket(TM)\u00a0can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's\u00a0never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product;\u00a0the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my\u00a0second-largest\u00a0holding.</p><p>Q:\u00a0Investorideas.com<br/>The company stated that they will launch the Wocket(TM)\u00a0May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking\u00a0advance orders\u00a0for the\u00a0Wocket(TM)\u00a0once the event is done.\u00a0Will you be attending and will you be buying one\u00a0once advance orders are opened up?</p><p>A:\u00a0Chad\u00a0A. Verdi<br/>For sure I will be there\u00a0supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket(TM)\u00a0is embraced.\u00a0And of course,\u00a0I will be buying many, many\u00a0Wockets(TM)!\u00a0I will be giving\u00a0them out\u00a0to all\u00a0of\u00a0my actor and\u00a0celebrity\u00a0friends in Hollywood.\u00a0Soon, you\u00a0may see a Wocket(TM)\u00a0in a\u00a0very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event.</p><p>Q:\u00a0Investorideas.com<br/>Speaking about Hollywood and movies,\u00a0you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB\u00a0you have signed on\u00a0Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you\u00a0have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films.\u00a0It seems like you are on fire!\u00a0How did this all come about?</p><p>A:\u00a0Chad A. Verdi\u00a0</p><p>Yes, it's just\u00a0nuts, crazy nuts!\u00a0It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his\u00a0producing\u00a0partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,'\u00a0Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and\u00a0they invited us to the premiere\u00a0of 'The Wolf\u00a0of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called\u00a0'Bad Hurt'\u00a0that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated\u00a0to\u00a0where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, \u00a0'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza.</p><p>Q:\u00a0Investorideas.com<br/>That is exciting and all\u00a0happening\u00a0very fast.\u00a0How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the\u00a0ten\u00a0picture deal with Screen Media?</p><p>A:\u00a0Chad A. Verdi\u00a0</p><p>That's\u00a0what's\u00a0amazing. Eighteen\u00a0months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for\u00a0This\u00a0and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later\u00a0than\u00a0fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December\u00a02014. Then\u00a0we\u00a0begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is\u00a0to\u00a0meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to\u00a0facilitate\u00a0this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions.

I do think that wage growth will stay low. There's an issue in regards to the employment participation rate, which right now is 62.6 percent. That is the lowest rate it has been in 38 years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do think the interest rates will go up but very, very slowly. There's a lot of pressure to increase the rates. The dollar is strengthening so much that there's a lot of pressure to raise the rates, which will devalue the dollar so that exports can do better. I don't see any reason to raise the rates, but I do think they will raise gradually.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0~ John Sorensen\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SONTAG: Last quarter our national real gross domestic product was only 1.5. That's not very strong at all; that's not healthy at all. Most economists forecast the GDP going up by the end of 2017, gradually migrating toward 2, almost to 2.5. To really have a vibrant national economy, we need to be up more around 4.0 GDP. So that's what I hope will happen.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HALTEH: As it relates to the general economy, this is uncharted territory for us. These are near low rates. There's talk of negative returns on deposits. You've got talk of larger banks diversifying their deposits with clients and penalizing their high-deposit clients and giving them negative returns. So when you have such low interest rates and the economy still shaky--I don't think there's confidence in the general population that we have come out of this recession. Maybe as bankers we were all scarred by it in one way or another. Hopefully it left an indelible mark on who we are as individuals and made us better bankers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the Fed has to look at raising rates, otherwise its credibility is at stake. They keep saying we're going to raise it by the end of the year. And there could be some good in raising short-term rates by a small percentage, a quarter percent, provide some stability in the marketplace. Long-term rates have already built that in anyway. And maybe interest income will increase as well, especially on deposits, and make up for it.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CHRISTIANSEN: Bank of America is very optimistic about the national economy. We're worried more about the implications of long-term rates being low and what potentially that does to us as consumers, as businesses and ultimately a government. All that being said though, we're very, very optimistic about the economy. The projected growth rate is positive. We're not going backwards. You do hear people talk about the softening of the economy. I personally believe that if we go along kind of status quo, that's good. It's not the growth rates that we all hope, but it's good. We're not retracting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DEFRIES: One thing I am still confused about is the whole roll off of quantitative easing funds. They've stopped doing it, but they're still replacing everything that's there. This is a tool. They've used up a lot of economic tools to get us where we're at, and with these low rates, what other tools are there? I guess we could have the next QE and kind of keep doing it again. But we aren't what we were eight years ago as far as what the Fed's involvement is in monitoring markets and their own securities. Until that gets back to where it's good, a lot of things we look at might be looked at as more advantageous than they really are. But right now we're taking advantage of it.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I think rates will go up in the short term. They probably need to go up more than what they are. But it seems like Fed is concerned about dealing with outside factors that aren't just the economic factors. They spend more time trying to make sure things are smooth and everything is sitting correctly. I thought there should have been a raise in rates a couple of months ago, and it didn't happen.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You don't see a contradiction between this bullish outlook and the low interest rate forecast for the year? Shouldn't the interest rates go up when the economy does better?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's not doing better, though.

They need to and they're probably going to do that just to keep some semblance of order going forward.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HALL: I've been doing this for 43 years, and I'm not sure anybody around this table or anybody in the U.S. really knows where we're going. When we talk about the economy doing well, we just haven't performed. The GEP has never got going. Now, we're just a little bank, and we feel very bullish about what's going to happen in our local market. We do a lot of ag lending. Ag prices, as you know, have really taken a dip. But through the years we've weeded out a lot of inefficient operators. Now we have some real good people there. But that's a concern. And really is the economy doing everything we think it's doing? Are we on kind of a steroid and we're not really doing as well as we think we're doing? That's a concern to us.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LEARY: I'm the regulator in the room. We're the paid professional worriers. We always have a jaundiced view of everything. My big-picture thought is, particularly in Utah, we went through the downturn, the Great Recession. Yes, we were probably fortunate being one of the states that popped out of it quicker, better and in a more sustained manner than most states. So we're comfortable with where we're at. All of the indicators for Utah show signs of good strength, good growth. But then the regulator in me immediately takes over and starts worrying about what's next. Whether we talk on an international scale, catastrophic events, terrorist events, local disasters, they just seem to keep coming at people. And so the warning is always be ready, be prepared and be careful.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HEATON: I sit on the board of a small bank. We were told by regulators we ought to increase our stress test to cover 400 basis points, 4 percent swings. Does that mean you're worried about a 400-basis point swing in rates?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LEARY: I would take it from the limit scenario. It's probably good for an exercise. Is that realistic? I don't believe so. But that's Ed Leary speaking. Some of the federal regulators are very concerned about those kinds of shocks, yes.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0JENSEN: Before I decided to start a community bank in Southern Utah, I spent 30 years managing short-duration fixed-income portfolios for big banks like BFA and Wells and a couple of others in Chicago and London. So my perspective is a little different. We had to do a lot of soothsaying in our job. So it really came down to if the Fed raises rates, what's that impact going to be on the economy. And I just don't see it. I mean there's a lot of pressure for rates to rise, mainly political. But I don't think the economic activity warrants an increase--not to say we're not going to see it. But it's pretty basic. Wages are the story, wages and labor participation. You see a rise in rates, there's going to be an impact. And I just don't see that there's a strong basis.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, Utah has been kind of a bright shiny jewel in the United States. And I am somewhat optimistic for our ability to produce for basic fundamental reasons. We've got a hard-working community. We have great job creation. So we have all the ingredients in Utah to continue to perform. Down in St. George, where I'm based, we're looking at lower vacancies, we're looking at much more profitability, a lot more construction projects, which is what drives our community. So we're reasonably excited about what's going on in Utah and in our market. But nationally, we're just plodding along. And you don't raise rates to cool a plodding-along economy. Now, again, it still could happen for political reasons, but I don't think it's warranted economically or financially.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let's talk specifically about Utah. What are the economic trends here?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the aspects of my job that I love is getting out and visiting with businesses, customers, prospects, advisors like attorneys and CPAs.

We see a really strong market. We do see some slowing in regards to real estate sales. It's very minor, but we are seeing that. And I do think personal income is not keeping pace with rising home values. So we're seeing some slowing. It's taking place in Arizona and Southern California. It has not happened here.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I don't think you can have a strong GDP if the participation rate continues to fall. The best you can do is about 2.5 percent. We have a large amount of people that are not working compared to people that are working. If that participation rate continues to drop, which I think it will, that will put more pressure on and decrease the effectiveness of the economy.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HEATON: I'm in Utah County, and I see all of those new condo units, the apartment units. I see all of the commercial buildings going in at Thanksgiving Point, and I'm saying: How long is it going to take to absorb all of this? Are you worried about that?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SONTAG: My quick answer would be, yes, we're absolutely worried. Any time a market is very hot, it leads to ruinous competition and things start eroding.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the aspects of my job that I love is getting out and visiting with businesses, customers, prospects, advisors like attorneys and CPAs. I just enjoy trying to get a pulse for what's going on in our community. And the general sense is that their businesses are doing well.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HALTEH: We deal primarily with commercial real estate, and we're seeing somewhat inflated values in commercial real estate, particularly on the construction portion of it. We're looking at project costs that are not appraising. We looked at a $5.5 million project cost. We did an evaluation as-is and as-completed. And as-completed came up $700,000 shy, which is pretty significant.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The big money in real estate hunkered down during the recession, held onto their real estate, and the average business owner at the time didn't have access to capital. Banks weren't lending, and they weren't profitable because they had suffered. So they couldn't go out and be prognostic about buying a piece of real estate. But the big investors are getting out now, and they're selling those off to our business owners. If they're trying to build it, there's a shortage in that commercial real estate space, especially here in Salt Lake. So it's driven up values. And when we're trying to look at numbers, they just don't pencil out.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being said, three to four years ago, three out of five clients we looked at weren't profitable. Now pretty much just about every business we're looking at is profitable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0VAN WAGONER: We're mainly in Utah County, and residential real estate is a big issue. People have been priced out of the market. It's forced people into townhomes and other high-density housing. So if rates go up on the long-term, are those people able to qualify? That's a big concern we have. If rates do go up, that person is not eligible to purchase that home.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CHRISTIANSEN: I cover both Utah and Nevada. So really a tale of two cities in terms of the economy. Utah has a fantastic economy. Utah has either the fourth or fifth most diverse economy in the country. And that is very, very important obviously from a banker's standpoint.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Southern Utah there's a lot of construction. Las Vegas and Southern Nevada is very similar. You look at that compared to Utah, where we've got distribution, transportation, healthcare.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You've got some energy, but not a tremendous amount. So we love the fact that Utah has a diverse economy. We've got a very young population. We've got an educated workforce. There are so many great things about Utah and the economy. And in our opinion there's no doubt that is going to continue.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PIGNANELLI: The great thing about industrial banks is most of the customers are outside the state. They're all across the 50 states. But what we see happening internally, number one is that Utah continues to be the bright spot. And those industrial banks that are expanding, the parent companies are not telling them to go anywhere else, but to expand in Utah. So they like what they've experienced here in Utah.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0KIEFFER: Offices are getting built like they never have in the last three years. At first it seemed like you had a lot of class B office tenants moving into class A and filling that up. Now it seems everything that's being built is for a single tenant or they've got the building 50 percent leased. We're doing a couple projects down at the Point of the Mountain. There's a lot of other buildings going up on the west side of 1-15 at Thanksgiving Park. Those buildings are pretty much leased before they're built, or at least 50 percent. So they're getting filled. All that class B space that's been vacated seems to be getting filled. I guess all these companies are doing well because the space is getting filled and developers are building the buildings. There's a lot of spec office buildings being built right now. And before we ever get complete, it seems like they've got tenants and they're filling the space. So they're very optimistic, and the office market is very strong.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DEFRIES: Given our experience in the last downturn, we haven't lessened the lending standards at all. In fact they've gotten even tighter from the standpoint of looking at the quality of borrowers or pre-lease rates. I just look at the people doing business now in this hot environment, and they are those that really do have a low basis in land or they've found some other advantage or they have very sufficient outside cash flow to cover whatever they're doing without even earning from that project, which wasn't the case prior. From that standpoint, there's obviously a lot of smart money doing things now because it's a good time to do it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ANDERSON: We 're similar to a lot of other banks. We haven't changed our underwriting standards. We're still remembering the past and trying not to get caught up. We are seeing many exceptions being asked for with the way our policies are. We're bullish, but we're trying to still maintain some conservatism in the underwriting.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The election will have an impact, too, on the direction of the economy. So much of the consumer confidence is intangible. Decisions that are made in terms of investment and spending and that kind of thing, if there's a change from the perceived patterns of regulation that the current administration is undertaking right now, I think that could make a difference as well.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Southern Utah, we've got to see the master plan that calls for a big tech corridor down on the road towards the airport. And we've already seen a number of companies that have made commitments, so that will be interesting to watch. Additionally, population growth continues to burgeon in St. George. We had a little respite there during the downturn. Much of Utah is very homogenous, but St. George is starting to become a mini Park City. We're getting in migration from Delaware, from Belgium. So we're getting a very eclectic mix of people, and the population is expected to double from the 2010 census numbers in 15 years.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0~ Bruce Jensen\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During my career, I've seen the number of banks fall from almost 14,000 to less than 6,000. That's unprecedented in terms of consolidation. What do you see for banking specifically? Do you think the trend will continue to be fewer and fewer banks and larger and larger banks?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Increased regulation puts a lot of stress on community banks and big banks. You'll see a lot of consolidation.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0~ Ram Halteh\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HEADLEE: I think it's important for people to connect these two dots--the regulatory environment that is so popular in Washington D.C. is directly tied to the consolidation of this industry. And if you don't like fewer, bigger banks then you have to support changes to Dodd-Frank. It's that simple. Dodd-Frank has so many misguided provisions that most everybody agrees need to be fixed.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Banks are like the popular whipping boy, but everybody sits around and is rightly concerned that we continue to see fewer institutions and larger institutions. And you can't have both. You can't continue to beat on the industry for political purposes and not be troubled by the fact that it's going to just continue to consolidate. And exacerbating all of this, the FDIC is not approving any new charters. The fact that they've approved maybe a couple of charters in the last seven years is an unbelievable anomaly. It's never, ever, ever occurred before. Somebody needs to be held accountable for what is happening to this industry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HEATON: Have we seen any new ILCs? I haven't even heard of any yet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PIGNANELLI: No. The FDIC is constipated. We're an $18 trillion economy, and they've approved two banks in eight years. Plus they're not approving any changes in charters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I compare it to this: Dodd-Frank is a leprosy on our economy, slowing killing parts of our economy because it's preventing the extension of credit. It's killing the banks. But it's also really making it hard to make loans. Minority groups are upset with Dodd-Frank because it's tougher and tougher for people of color and people of low income to get loans approved with Dodd-Frank. You have the concerns with small businesses. But what should be of greater concern in this country is more and more financial services are no longer being regulated. So 60 percent are now unregulated because it's getting tougher for the regulatory process.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do blame the PR effort; it isn't just the elected officials. But I also blame the banking industry because we're allowing this revisionist history to go forward that somehow we were responsible for the Great Recession. We weren't. It was a government policy being pushed out of the door by both parties and a lot of people who participated in that. But we've allowed the PR machine to dump all over the banking industry, and it's not our fault that there was a housing policy that took off.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Howard pointed out, we've become the whipping boys. And we're not doing a good job of educating the public as to why we need credit in the marketplace. I look at all these Republican debates; I look at the Democratic debates. How often do you hear them mentioning Dodd-Frank? How often are they talking about allowing credit into the economy? Never. There's no discussion about this. It's all about tax cuts, or it's all about government programs. We have to do a better job of educating our customers, the general public and elected officials that if we don't succeed, you don't succeed.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SORENSEN: I agree. Basically I'm a numbers guy because I'm an overpaid accountant. But basically, there's 680 banks that are over a billion dollars. Right now there's a total of 6,300 banks, and 680 banks that are a billion dollars or more control 92.7 percent of all of the assets. Now, when I was a CPA if we had a customer that had to have a balance sheet reclassified and it was less than 5 percent, it was immaterial and we would pass on that adjustment. So what I'm saying is that if you take the remaining balance of all of the banks and they go away, it would have very little impact in regards to the financial situation of the United States of America.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There's still going to be small banks. But the regulations are extremely onerous to small banks. I'm a small bank, and I'm an owner operator. When we have an exam, 16 examiners come into our facility. I have 14 employees. Now, if that group goes to another bank that is 10 times larger than me, the number of examiners that show up are 16 examiners. Fortunately I only have to see them every 18 months. But it's extremely difficult. They literally put you out of business for a couple of weeks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PIGNANELLI: I'm going to argue that's intentional. It's a definite policy of this administration, of the Treasury Department, of the FDIC to go to Canadian-style banking. They want six to seven large banks, a handful of community banks. That's what they want. That's what they're pushing for. It's very plain and obvious. We have to push back.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SORENSEN: The real threat to the banking industry is not the credit unions or the ILCs. The real threat is the non-banks that are now coming online--the Lending Trees, those banks that basically are coming online that are not regulated like we are. And they will eat our lunch; they will put us out of business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They don't have an originator. They can provide an approval on a real estate loan in eight seconds. And basically they have these platforms set up. The people who are actually funding them are from money centers from back East, and they will buy the platform. But they can approve a real estate transaction subject to an appraisal and title in eight seconds, and they're going to go into commercial real estate lending too. It's going to be very, very difficult to compete with that type of organization.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SONTAG: I had the opportunity to go with the Salt Lake Chamber to Washington. We had the opportunity to meet with our senators, our congressmen and congresswoman. And what was a real eye opener to me was in Senator Lee's office, he demonstrated to us what congress had passed in bills in the last year--it was about seven inches. And then in his credenza he had 12 feet high all the rules and agency enactments like the IRS, the EPA and all of those kinds of regulator issues--12 feet compared to seven inches. As a banking industry, that's what we're dealing with.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HEADLEE: It's important for everybody to understand that all flows downhill. We have to hire more people to make sure we're complying with those rules, and it affects our customers. It affects our pricing, it affects the amount of time it takes to process. And then to John's point, those who are lending in the community that aren't subject to those regulations, they can do it faster. We've got to deal with this in order to make sure that capital is flowing and the economy is growing. That is the illness of our time; it's why we're seeing a stagnant GDP, why job numbers have just never gotten where they needed to get. It's because of the 12 feet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People have to stop jumping on this bandwagon of it's fun and exciting to beat on the banks. Well, the banks are us. The banks cannot outperform the communities they serve. And when a community is hurting, their banks hurt. And when the bank is hurt, the community is hurt. We're all in this together. So as people jump around thinking, yeah, let's take it to the banks, they're just sticking it to themselves. We've got to connect the dots. We have to help them understand how the 12 feet of those regulations are flowing downstream and affecting every transaction that they do with us.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nationally, the number of branches is shrinking. Is that happening in Utah? What are we going to see in the future?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SONTAG: What were hearing from our customers is their appetite for mobile banking. We deal with a lot of commercial companies and we do remote captured deposit and a lot of other electronic capabilities, but they still like the branch. They like to know it's there. They're doing most of their transactions electronically, but they still periodically want to come into the branch and know those people are there supporting them. As we're growing in some of the states and particularly in Utah, we see a lot of pressure to build more branches in better locations. So we will start increasing branches, not reducing them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0JENSEN: Yeah, there's fewer transactions done at the bank. There's some megalomania going on too, though, that we're ignoring. We didn't see this going on 20, 30 years ago. Now everybody wants to expand their footprint for the very reason that, well, we don't need as many branches in our market. But if we're going to thrive, we want to find other strategic markets.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the desire to have a physical branch, one thing that can't be downplayed is there's some provincialism out there. We take advantage of it in St. George. So we can talk about these triple electronic providers coming in and doing loans and so forth. But relationships are really, really important. And small banks are nimble, they're well positioned to take advantage of the provincialism. I think there still is going to be a future, but there's this conflict with the cost of regulation, of cyber security, the megalomania--there's going to be a continual shrinkage, but there's going to be the community's desire to have that relationship with the local provider that they know and trust. They can go in and kick the tires, and that gives a community bank an opportunity to differentiate itself, which is the strategy we've taken.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HEADLEE: If there's one thing we learned from the downturn, it's relationships are critical. When the crisis hit, everybody was looking for somebody to talk to, and those relationships when banks had to de-lever, those loans that they made went to their best long-term customers with the relationships. These folks that show up on your iPhone and they can do something in eight seconds, they go away just as quickly. So there is a huge future for community banks if we can get this regulatory environment right-sized and normalized.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ed, can you give us a two-minute summary of what you're seeing from regulatory side?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LEARY: I have always felt once I became commissioner and had to take a statewide view, Utah is served very well from a banking perspective because we have the large national banks with branches here. We have the large regional banks headquartered here. We have the community banks, and we diversify even more with the industrial banks here. So from a competitive standpoint, what you're looking at is the ability to offer consumers or commercial clients good ground and very efficient banking services.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Looking forward, as a regulator, I see concentrations coming back in portfolios. That's what we would be concerned about. The lesson of the last downturn was banks being too concentrated in certain areas. If they can manage that concentration, we're a little more comfortable. We'll keep looking at it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other issue on my mind daily is cyber security. All of the threats are continuing to grow exponentially. As a state department head, I am concerned about it for my department, for the examiners, for the banks and for all businesses. We've got to do more and be better prepared in that cyber security arena.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The hard part is Dodd-Frank is still being implemented. So there will be attempts at tightening because Dodd-Frank rules are still coming online. They're still having to write them. They're still trying to punish the large banks for being large. And so the overall feeling of bankers is like it's really tightening around them.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0</pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP LNWP 443366728</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J45-J1Y1-JCBJ-K0P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4873\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2016 Utah Business Publishers LLC</copyright><publicationName>Utah Business</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 1091-1707</issn><volume>Vol. 30</volume><aggregationName>ASAP LNWP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 1, 2016</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0005XAH</classCode><className>BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0005XAH</classCode><className>BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC8299 SCHOOLS &amp;

He reports on social and communications.He previously covered the technology of marketing and advertising for Ad Age. His work has been referenced by dozens of major publications, from The New Yorker to The Wall Street Journal to Sports Illustrated.Kantrowitz is a graduate of Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. He started his career buying digital ads for New York City's Economic Development Corp. </p><p>and selling ad-tech software. Kantrowitz is the author of a new book called 'Always Day One: How the Tech Titans plan to Stay on Top Forever,' published by Penguin.Through 130 interviews with insiders from Mark Zuckerberg to hourly workers, Kantrowitz writes about the culture, technology and processes the tech giants have developed to sustain success in a business world where no advantage is safe.Kantrowitz spoke Thursday by Zoom with Talking Biz News. What follows is an edited transcript.How did you get interested in writing about business and technology?So I started my career buying ads for New York City's Economic Development Corp. and when I came in all the ads they were running print. I had been going to some meetups in New York City to learn about what was going on in the internet and said, hey, maybe we can start experimenting with placing some ads online. And so that sort of gave me this introduction to the business of the internet. And so I shifted like a good percentage of the budget from print to online advertising and learn how to advertise on LinkedIn and Facebook and Google, and it ended up proving to be pretty effective venues for us to get our message across.And after a couple years of that, there was a lot of discussion how tech was the future. And I just wanted to go see that firsthand. So I actually became an inside sales rep for an ad tech company for a year, which was an interesting, weird experience that cued me into the business of the internet.And then after a while, I had been reading what was going on in the press and I thought that there was big parts of the story that the media was missing. I always had this interest in being a storyteller, but just never really thought it was possible. I started writing on the side a little bit for for places like Forbes and Fortune. And then at a certain point, I was enjoyng this much more than I enjoy making cold calls trying to sell an ad tech system. So I just decided to take the leap and see if there was a future in that.Tell me a little bit about how BuzzFeed covers technology and how is that different from other media outlets.BuzzFeed is concerned with how these platforms impact our everyday lives than in the business, the nuts-and-bolts earnings of these companies. We do our best work when we examine how these companies are changing the lives of everyday people. And I think when you start from there, you start to see things differently. How is something like Facebook's real name policy impacting advocates in countries who might be in trouble if their real name gets gets exposed?What happens when people share news that's fake? What happens when people working inside these companies might be conscripted by foreign governments to provide information? And what's the consequences for those decisions?So if you start with how did these decisions impact real people on the ground, it just ends up opening a perspective to a whole slew of stories that might not get told otherwise. And I think when BuzzFeed does that, well, that's when the company's at its best.What types of stories do you like to personally focus on?I like two types of stories. One is I really enjoy digging into systems and figuring out how they impact people. There are so many things that we take for granted about the internet that if we actually start to interrogate them a little bit, we might see cracks there. To me, the most interesting one has been the share or the retweet button on Facebook and Twitter. You know, these are just standard fundamental parts of these company's products.But when you take a little bit deeper, you see that they are more than algorithms. These are the things that have been responsible for the spread of sensationalized news and fake news because people tend to hit them without a second thought. And I think there is research that shows that if people stopped to think for a second, they're actually more thoughtful about the things that they share with their friends and family. By taking all the friction out these companies have led to some bad outcomes.The other type of story I like is just to sort of take something that that we might have glanced over. It is a story that the news media might have glanced over but has some pretty intricate details if you dig and take the time and then just seeing what lies underneath the surface. And I think one example of that is I wrote this story about how Twitter employees were conscripted by an associate of Saudi prince Mohammad bin Salman.This is all according to an FBI complaint, but they were conscripted to access user information and allegedly pass it along to this person and the users were all like Saudi dissidents. But I asked what if we learn a little bit more about who these people were, what type of access they they had by the systems inside Twitter allowed them to access this information and what companies might be able to do to prevent things like this in the future.I like being able to spend time and dig deeply into what ended up leading to a story that wasn't a straight news story but something that people could read and understand what exactly happened there and give people this idea of like how this might happen again in the future.What was the process and deciding to write a book about the success of big tech companies?Coming up as an online journalist, I never really imagined writing a book. I felt people were processing information then in 140 characters, now in 280 characters, and taking all this time to write a book seem like a fool's errand to me. But I had studied industrial and labor relations at Cornell, which taught me all about how workplaces work, how organizations behave, how company culture is influential.I got to San Francisco and spent a couple of years speaking with the leaders in Silicon Valley and just realized that there was something different going on here. Something that I hadn't been taught about in school. And I took a step back and asked why the tech giants were so successful.The reason they were so successful was because they had just developed different cultures, different styles in a way of working. That just isn't common in the rest of the world in traditional businesses. And so that's when I thought, OK, this should be a book because it is something that merits exploration in a deep investigative way.I thought that by taking the time and really looking deeply into the processes that these companies use gave everybody else that's competing with them, a chance to even the field. And people working in so-called traditional jobs could have an idea of what's coming next. So for me, it became this adventure because it went from writing about the symptoms \u2014 what these companies produce \u2014 to actually digging in and trying to understand the physiology.Were some companies more interested in cooperating and others?I had interviews through the front door for Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft and this is the first book that included Amazon since 'The Everything Store,' which surprised me. The key was always to have a balance, and for each one of these companies I spoke with more people not sanctioned than the ones that the company's presented to me, which I felt was important to deliver a balanced story to readers.But I feel like there are a bunch of great interviews in the book that come from the companies themselves, including Mark Zuckerberg, and a number of executives in Google's executive suite. They're talking about how they're addressing the dissent inside the companies.Apple denied access. We had some conversations about it but they eventually said no, which is fine because I really don't believe you need access to tell the stories of these companies. But I did cold email Steve Wozniak and met him for an interview at a diner down in Cupertino. I wasn't 100% sure he was going to show up, but he walked in around 11 a.m. with his business partner and wife, and we all sat down for omelets and just talked.How did you get the lower level employees to talk to you?It was a process. I put a post it on my monitor and it just said fill your days with interviews. I'd literally sit down and be diligent about spending an hour, two hours a day, going through LinkedIn and just sending cold messages saying, Hey, I'm writing this book about the inner workings of these companies and I'd very much like to get the story right and would love to speak with you about your experiences there. And as you might imagine, the vast majority ignored the message, but every now and again, somebody said, Yeah, let's talk.People were very generous with their time because I think they know that these are important companies, and the story about how they work inside really matters. And they were dedicated to making sure that story was told right.This being your first book, how hard was it to kind of organize and write the book?It was pretty difficult. And we also went into the process with this big question mark, which I didn't know the answer: What are these companies doing differently? It's helped them become successful. We had seen a few things that we thought were interesting.We thought that these companies use technology pretty effectively inside the organization that might be one thing that was worth exploring. We saw that the CEOs of these companies were not typical boisterous CEOs. You might imagine leading the world's top companies and of them will hop on top of a picnic bench with a megaphone with everybody gathered around and scream out their vision and have everybody follow. They're much more their engineers, so they're much more about listening to folks than about telling them what to do.And we just said, OK, well, these are an interesting set of data points and how do we connect them? So I think the book really only crystallized, and at the end of the ninth month.There really is a debate inside companies all the time that is do you keep investing in the flagship product and put all your energy into that, or go back to day one and figure out what the future is going to be and how do you build for that?Then I had looked at the book and I said I need to rewrite the whole thing. So basically went back chapter by chapter and said, OK, what's my intro? What's the thesis here in the Amazon chapter? I'm trying to figure out how to make this one cohesive story, but I think in the end it worked.What do you think the average person who's interested in these companies can learn from reading the book?The average person can learn that that work is going to change for a lot of folks in a good way. Oftentimes, standing existing procedures are just supporting things to ensure that we can keep them wanting and it sort of creates interest in them. What these companies have done really well is they've taken that treadmill and put it on autopilot and given their employees a lot more room to come up with new ideas and bring them to life.They use automation technology collaboration tools. And I think those are going to roll out into everyday people's lives pretty soon and give people time to be more inventive than spending their days just making sure that the that the car is running, which I think is a pretty cool feature for people who are able to do it.What do you hope the book accomplishes for other business leaders who are reading this?There's a problem that I've been pointing out for a while, is that these companies, the tech titans are too powerful. And so there's a number of ways that you address that. One is, the government could come in and step in and regulate them and sort of put pressure on them to to adjust and change and be more accountable to the public.What I think what I'm doing is giving business leaders access to the systems that have made them so successful and say, you might be doing something one way if you get access to the systems of the tech giants are using. This is not the way that they they pursue growth at all costs. This is really how they become inventive. And if we have more inventive companies in the economy, then we'll end up evening the playing field. And that's what I'm hoping for is that people take the systems and tools that I described in the book and put them into play, even if they're not in the tech giants.One of the things that I believe is that companies have a larger influence on people than most people believe. Would you agree that's the case with tech companies?Yeah. If you look at the way that we process and receive information today, a lot of that is just determined by the whims of Facebook, Google and YouTube's algorithms and the mechanisms they put in their products like the share button. So it comes to us. It looks the same, but it's different. There's a lot of work being done behind the scenes that really influences the way we perceive the world.What's the lesson for business journalists?I would say is that there's a lesson in here for your audience like business reporters and writers and editors, and that is toooften we'll cover what I call the symptoms like a bit of news and move on without spending time eamining the underlying systems. Generally it's sort of less rewarding. Like, you don't get journalism awards for sort of figuring out the machinery of the company, but I do believe that once we understand the machinery and understand the physiology inside the companies we cover then we're in a much better place to write about why they're doing what they do. And I've certainly learned that myself going through this process. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TKBZ108982158706399819175776100184</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TKBZ-7393</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YP2-N801-JCMN-Y1DT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2359\"/><timeReceived>7:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Talking Biz News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
