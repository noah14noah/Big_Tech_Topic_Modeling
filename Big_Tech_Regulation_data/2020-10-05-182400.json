Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican from Missouri, in his Capitol Hill office. Zuckerberg left the hourlong meeting - one of several with lawmakers on Capitol Hill - without answering questions from a throng of reporters and photographers pursuing him down a hallway.</p><p>Hawley, though, had plenty to say. \"The company talks a lot. I'd like to see some action,\" he told reporters. \"I will believe Facebook when I see some real action out of Facebook.\"</p><p>Rather than moving users' personal data from properties such as WhatsApp and Instagram to the core Facebook platform, the company should put a wall around the services or, better yet, sell them off, Hawley said he told Zuckerberg.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who requested the meeting, \"did not think that was a great idea,\" he said.</p><p>Zuckerberg \"had a good, constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House today,\" a Facebook spokesman said. On Facebook and Twitter, Trump posted a photo with the caption, \"Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook in the Oval Office today.\"</p><p>No details were given on the meeting, first reported by the Axios website.</p><p>Trump has persistently criticized social media companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and his platform of choice, Twitter, embracing conservative critics' accusations that they censor religious, anti-abortion and politically conservative views. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>A Facebook spokesman declined to comment on Hawley's remarks concerning his meeting with Zuckerberg.</p><p>The popular services WhatsApp and Instagram are among some 70 companies that Facebook has acquired over the past 15 years or so, giving it what critics say is massive market power that has allowed it to snuff out competition.</p><p>Zuckerberg's discussion with Hawley touched on industry competition, data privacy legislation, election security and accusations by conservatives that Facebook and other social media giants are biased against right-leaning content.</p><p>During his visit, Zuckerberg also met with other senators including Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mike Lee, R-Utah, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, and John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Tom Cotton, R-Ark. He also declined to answer reporters' questions when he left Lee's office earlier in the afternoon.</p><p>Lee's office said the two discussed bias against conservatives on Facebook's platform, regulation of online services, enforcement of antitrust laws in the tech industry and data privacy issues.</p><p>Congress has been debating a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to collect and make money off users' personal data. A national law, which would be the first of its kind in the U.S., could allow people to see or prohibit use of their data.</p><p>Acting preemptively, Zuckerberg last spring called for tighter regulations to protect consumers' data, control harmful online content and ensure election integrity and data portability. The internet \"needs new rules,\" he said.</p><p>It was Zuckerberg's first public visit to Washington since he testified before Congress last spring about privacy, election interference and other issues.</p><p>Facebook, a social media giant based in Menlo Park, California, with nearly 2.5 billion users, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of privacy scandals and amid accusations of abuse of its market power to squash competition.</p><p>The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting antitrust investigations of the big tech companies, and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general has opened a competition probe specifically of Facebook.</p><p>At Facebook's request, Warner helped organize a dinner meeting in Washington on Wednesday night for Zuckerberg and a group of senators.</p><p>Warner told The Associated Press he wanted Zuckerberg to hear his Senate colleagues' \"enormous concerns about privacy and about protecting the integrity of our political system.\"</p><p>Their message for the Facebook chief was \"self-regulation is not going to be the answer,\" Warner said. \"I think Zuckerberg understood that.\"</p><p>Warner and Hawley have proposed legislation that would force the tech giants to tell users what data they're collecting and how much it's worth. The proposal goes to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable business model of commerce in users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like, and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to individuals they want to reach.</p><p>The tech companies view with particular alarm a separate legislative proposal from Hawley that would require them to prove to regulators that they're not using political bias to filter content. Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its long-held immunity from legal action.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-e02c186734de4a469bec830b05bd3968</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X38-PS71-JC65-52V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"898\"/><timeReceived>00:24 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 20, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican from Missouri, in his Capitol Hill office. Zuckerberg left the hourlong meeting - one of several with lawmakers on Capitol Hill - without answering questions from a throng of reporters and photographers pursuing him down a hallway.</p><p>Hawley, though, had plenty to say. \"The company talks a lot. I'd like to see some action,\" he told reporters. \"I will believe Facebook when I see some real action out of Facebook.\"</p><p>Rather than moving users' personal data from properties such as WhatsApp and Instagram to the core Facebook platform, the company should put a wall around the services or, better yet, sell them off, Hawley said he told Zuckerberg.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who requested the meeting, \"did not think that was a great idea,\" he said.</p><p>Zuckerberg \"had a good, constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House today,\" a Facebook spokesman said. On Facebook and Twitter, Trump posted a photo with the caption, \"Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook in the Oval Office today.\"</p><p>No details were given on the meeting, first reported by the Axios website.</p><p>Trump has persistently criticized social media companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and his platform of choice, Twitter, embracing conservative critics' accusations that they censor religious, anti-abortion and politically conservative views. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>A Facebook spokesman declined to comment on Hawley's remarks concerning his meeting with Zuckerberg.</p><p>The popular services WhatsApp and Instagram are among some 70 companies that Facebook has acquired over the past 15 years or so, giving it what critics say is massive market power that has allowed it to snuff out competition.</p><p>Zuckerberg's discussion with Hawley touched on industry competition, data privacy legislation, election security and accusations by conservatives that Facebook and other social media giants are biased against right-leaning content.</p><p>During his visit, Zuckerberg also met with other senators including Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mike Lee, R-Utah, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, and John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Tom Cotton, R-Ark. He also declined to answer reporters' questions when he left Lee's office earlier in the afternoon.</p><p>Lee's office said the two discussed bias against conservatives on Facebook's platform, regulation of online services, enforcement of antitrust laws in the tech industry and data privacy issues.</p><p>Congress has been debating a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to collect and make money off users' personal data. A national law, which would be the first of its kind in the U.S., could allow people to see or prohibit use of their data.</p><p>Acting preemptively, Zuckerberg last spring called for tighter regulations to protect consumers' data, control harmful online content and ensure election integrity and data portability. The internet \"needs new rules,\" he said.</p><p>It was Zuckerberg's first public visit to Washington since he testified before Congress last spring about privacy, election interference and other issues.</p><p>Facebook, a social media giant based in Menlo Park, California, with nearly 2.5 billion users, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of privacy scandals and amid accusations of abuse of its market power to squash competition.</p><p>The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting antitrust investigations of the big tech companies, and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general has opened a competition probe specifically of Facebook.</p><p>At Facebook's request, Warner helped organize a dinner meeting in Washington on Wednesday night for Zuckerberg and a group of senators.</p><p>Warner told The Associated Press he wanted Zuckerberg to hear his Senate colleagues' \"enormous concerns about privacy and about protecting the integrity of our political system.\"</p><p>Their message for the Facebook chief was \"self-regulation is not going to be the answer,\" Warner said. \"I think Zuckerberg understood that.\"</p><p>Warner and Hawley have proposed legislation that would force the tech giants to tell users what data they're collecting and how much it's worth. The proposal goes to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable business model of commerce in users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like, and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to individuals they want to reach.</p><p>The tech companies view with particular alarm a separate legislative proposal from Hawley that would require them to prove to regulators that they're not using political bias to filter content. Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its long-held immunity from legal action.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-e02c186734de4a469bec830b05bd3968</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X38-PS91-DYN6-W395-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"898\"/><timeReceived>00:24 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 20, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican from Missouri, in his Capitol Hill office. Zuckerberg left the hourlong meeting - one of several with lawmakers on Capitol Hill - without answering questions from a throng of reporters and photographers pursuing him down a hallway.</p><p>Hawley, though, had plenty to say. \"The company talks a lot. I'd like to see some action,\" he told reporters. \"I will believe Facebook when I see some real action out of Facebook.\"</p><p>Rather than moving users' personal data from properties such as WhatsApp and Instagram to the core Facebook platform, the company should put a wall around the services or, better yet, sell them off, Hawley said he told Zuckerberg.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who requested the meeting, \"did not think that was a great idea,\" he said.</p><p>A Facebook spokesman declined to comment.</p><p>The popular services are among some 70 companies that Facebook has acquired over the past 15 years or so, giving it what critics say is massive market power that has allowed it to snuff out competition.</p><p>Zuckerberg's discussion with Hawley touched on industry competition, data privacy legislation, election security and accusations by conservatives that Facebook and other social media giants are biased against right-leaning content.</p><p>During his visit, Zuckerberg also met with other senators including Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Mike Lee, R-Utah, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee. He also declined to answer reporters' questions when he left Lee's office earlier in the afternoon.</p><p>Lee's office said the two discussed bias against conservatives on Facebook's platform, regulation of online services, enforcement of antitrust laws in the tech industry and data privacy issues.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/c897d4f2242047189b62b40b0ea7aadc\">Congress has been debating a privacy law</url> that could sharply rein in the ability of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to collect and make money off users' personal data. A national law, which would be the first of its kind in the U.S., could allow people to see or prohibit use of their data.</p><p>Acting preemptively, Zuckerberg last spring called for tighter regulations to protect consumers' data, control harmful online content and ensure election integrity and data portability. The internet \"needs new rules,\" he said.</p><p>It was Zuckerberg's first public visit to Washington since he testified before Congress last spring about privacy, election interference and other issues.</p><p>Facebook, a social media giant based in Menlo Park, California, with nearly 2.5 billion users, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of privacy scandals and amid accusations of abuse of its market power to squash competition.</p><p>The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting antitrust investigations of the big tech companies, and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general has opened a competition probe specifically of Facebook.</p><p>At Facebook's request, Warner helped organize a dinner meeting in Washington on Wednesday night for Zuckerberg and a group of senators.</p><p>Warner told The Associated Press he wanted Zuckerberg to hear his Senate colleagues' \"enormous concerns about privacy and about protecting the integrity of our political system.\"</p><p>Their message for the Facebook chief was \"self-regulation is not going to be the answer,\" Warner said. \"I think Zuckerberg understood that.\"</p><p>Warner and Hawley have proposed legislation that would force the tech giants to tell users what data they're collecting and how much it's worth. The proposal goes to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable business model of commerce in users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like, and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to individuals they want to reach.</p><p>The tech companies view with particular alarm a separate legislative proposal from Hawley that would require them to prove to regulators that they're not using political bias to filter content. Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its long-held immunity from legal action.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5d8417f8df7b0image\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p/><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5d8417fb114bdimage\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>FILE - In this April 11, 2018, file photo, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before a House Energy and Commerce hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington about the use of Facebook data to target American voters in the 2016 election and data privacy.

Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican from Missouri, in his Capitol Hill office. Zuckerberg left the hourlong meeting - one of several with lawmakers on Capitol Hill - without answering questions from a throng of reporters and photographers pursuing him down a hallway.</p><p>Hawley, though, had plenty to say. \"The company talks a lot. I'd like to see some action,\" he told reporters. \"I will believe Facebook when I see some real action out of Facebook.\"</p><p>Rather than moving users' personal data from properties such as WhatsApp and Instagram to the core Facebook platform, the company should put a wall around the services or, better yet, sell them off, Hawley said he told Zuckerberg.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who requested the meeting, \"did not think that was a great idea,\" he said.</p><p>Zuckerberg \"had a good, constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House today,\" a Facebook spokesman said. On Facebook and Twitter, Trump posted a photo with the caption, \"Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook in the Oval Office today.\"</p><p>No details were given on the meeting, first reported by the Axios website.</p><p>Trump has persistently criticized social media companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and his platform of choice, Twitter, embracing conservative critics' accusations that they censor religious, anti-abortion and politically conservative views. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>A Facebook spokesman declined to comment on Hawley's remarks concerning his meeting with Zuckerberg.</p><p>The popular services WhatsApp and Instagram are among some 70 companies that Facebook has acquired over the past 15 years or so, giving it what critics say is massive market power that has allowed it to snuff out competition.</p><p>Zuckerberg's discussion with Hawley touched on industry competition, data privacy legislation, election security and accusations by conservatives that Facebook and other social media giants are biased against right-leaning content.</p><p>During his visit, Zuckerberg also met with other senators including Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mike Lee, R-Utah, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, and John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Tom Cotton, R-Ark. He also declined to answer reporters' questions when he left Lee's office earlier in the afternoon.</p><p>Lee's office said the two discussed bias against conservatives on Facebook's platform, regulation of online services, enforcement of antitrust laws in the tech industry and data privacy issues.</p><p>Congress has been debating a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to collect and make money off users' personal data. A national law, which would be the first of its kind in the U.S., could allow people to see or prohibit use of their data.</p><p>Acting preemptively, Zuckerberg last spring called for tighter regulations to protect consumers' data, control harmful online content and ensure election integrity and data portability. The internet \"needs new rules,\" he said.</p><p>It was Zuckerberg's first public visit to Washington since he testified before Congress last spring about privacy, election interference and other issues.</p><p>Facebook, a social media giant based in Menlo Park, California, with nearly 2.5 billion users, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of privacy scandals and amid accusations of abuse of its market power to squash competition.</p><p>The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting antitrust investigations of the big tech companies, and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general has opened a competition probe specifically of Facebook.</p><p>At Facebook's request, Warner helped organize a dinner meeting in Washington on Wednesday night for Zuckerberg and a group of senators.</p><p>Warner told The Associated Press he wanted Zuckerberg to hear his Senate colleagues' \"enormous concerns about privacy and about protecting the integrity of our political system.\"</p><p>Their message for the Facebook chief was \"self-regulation is not going to be the answer,\" Warner said. \"I think Zuckerberg understood that.\"</p><p>Warner and Hawley have proposed legislation that would force the tech giants to tell users what data they're collecting and how much it's worth. The proposal goes to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable business model of commerce in users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like, and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to individuals they want to reach.</p><p>The tech companies view with particular alarm a separate legislative proposal from Hawley that would require them to prove to regulators that they're not using political bias to filter content. Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its long-held immunity from legal action.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-e02c186734de4a469bec830b05bd3968</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X38-PS51-JC65-52PY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"898\"/><timeReceived>00:24 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 20, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican from Missouri, in his Capitol Hill office. Zuckerberg left the hourlong meeting   one of several with lawmakers on Capitol Hill   without answering questions from a throng of reporters and photographers pursuing him down a hallway. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-04/B42DB9E4-51CB-4D96-A8C1-9266D4DF61BF.jpg?itok=se52fqD-FILE\">https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-04/B42DB9E4-51CB-4D96-A8C1-9266D4DF61BF.jpg?itok=se52fqD-FILE</url> - Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., speaks during a hearing of a Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington, March 6, 2019. Hawley, though, had plenty to say. \"The company talks a lot. I'd like to see some action,\" he told reporters. \"I will believe Facebook when I see some real action out of Facebook.\"Rather than moving users' personal data from properties such as WhatsApp and Instagram to the core Facebook platform, the company should put a wall around the services or, better yet, sell them off, Hawley said he told Zuckerberg.Zuckerberg, who requested the meeting, \"did not think that was a great idea,\" he said.Zuckerberg \"had a good, constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House today,\" a Facebook spokesman said. On Facebook and Twitter, Trump posted a photo with the caption, \"Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook in the Oval Office today.\"Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of @Facebook[1] in the Oval Office today.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/k5ofQREfOc\">https://t.co/k5ofQREfOc</url>[2]pic.twitter.com/jNt93F2BsG[3]   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2019[4] No details were given on the meeting, first reported by the Axios website.;Trump has persistently criticized social media companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and his platform of choice, Twitter, embracing conservative critics' accusations that they censor religious, anti-abortion and politically conservative views. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment on Hawley's remarks concerning his meeting with Zuckerberg.The popular services WhatsApp and Instagram are among some 70 companies that Facebook has acquired over the past 15 years or so, giving it what critics say is massive market power that has allowed it to snuff out competition.Zuckerberg's discussion with Hawley touched on industry competition, data privacy legislation, election security and accusations by conservatives that Facebook and other social media giants are biased against right-leaning content.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-06/4DDEB37E-4449-4C8E-8434-87D3E426349A.jpg?itok=w3vNMXTjFILE\">https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-06/4DDEB37E-4449-4C8E-8434-87D3E426349A.jpg?itok=w3vNMXTjFILE</url> - Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, speaks at a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Jan. 30, 2019. During his visit, Zuckerberg also met with other senators including Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee;Mike Lee, R-Utah, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee;and John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Tom Cotton, R-Ark. He also declined to answer reporters' questions when he left Lee's office earlier in the afternoon.Lee's office said the two discussed bias against conservatives on Facebook's platform, regulation of online services, enforcement of antitrust laws in the tech industry and data privacy issues.Congress has been debating a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to collect and make money off users' personal data. A national law, which would be the first of its kind in the U.S., could allow people to see or prohibit use of their data.'New rules' neededActing preemptively, Zuckerberg last spring called for tighter regulations to protect consumers' data, control harmful online content, and ensure election integrity and data portability. The internet \"needs new rules,\" he said.It was Zuckerberg's first public visit to Washington since he testified before Congress last spring about privacy, election interference and other issues.Facebook, a social media giant based in Menlo Park, California, with nearly 2.5 billion users, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of privacy scandals and amid accusations of abuse of its market power to squash competition.The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting antitrust investigations of the big tech companies, and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general has opened a competition probe specifically of Facebook.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.voanews.com/s3/files/styles/sourced/s3/2019-09/AP_19129751999892.jpg?itok=Z4QWpnIMFILE\">https://www.voanews.com/s3/files/styles/sourced/s3/2019-09/AP_19129751999892.jpg?itok=Z4QWpnIMFILE</url> - Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Mark Warner, D-Va., departs after a meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, May 9, 2019. At Facebook's request, Warner helped organize a dinner meeting in Washington on Wednesday night for Zuckerberg and a group of senators.Warner told The Associated Press he wanted Zuckerberg to hear his Senate colleagues' \"enormous concerns about privacy and about protecting the integrity of our political system.\"Their message for the Facebook chief was \"self-regulation is not going to be the answer,\" Warner said. \"I think Zuckerberg understood that.\"Warner and Hawley have proposed legislation that would force the tech giants to tell users what data they're collecting and how much it's worth. The proposal goes to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable business model of commerce in users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like, and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to individuals they want to reach.The tech companies view with particular alarm a separate legislative proposal from Hawley that would require them to prove to regulators that they're not using political bias to filter content. Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its long-held immunity from legal action.

Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican from Missouri, in his Capitol Hill office. Zuckerberg left the hourlong meeting - one of several with lawmakers on Capitol Hill - without answering questions from a throng of reporters and photographers pursuing him down a hallway.</p><p>Hawley, though, had plenty to say. \"The company talks a lot. I'd like to see some action,\" he told reporters. \"I will believe Facebook when I see some real action out of Facebook.\"</p><p>Rather than moving users' personal data from properties such as WhatsApp and Instagram to the core Facebook platform, the company should put a wall around the services or, better yet, sell them off, Hawley said he told Zuckerberg.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who requested the meeting, \"did not think that was a great idea,\" he said.</p><p>Zuckerberg \"had a good, constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House today,\" a Facebook spokesman said. On Facebook and Twitter, Trump posted a photo with the caption, \"Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook in the Oval Office today.\"</p><p>No details were given on the meeting, first reported by the Axios website.</p><p>Trump has persistently criticized social media companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and his platform of choice, Twitter, embracing conservative critics' accusations that they censor religious, anti-abortion and politically conservative views. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>A Facebook spokesman declined to comment on Hawley's remarks concerning his meeting with Zuckerberg.</p><p>The popular services WhatsApp and Instagram are among some 70 companies that Facebook has acquired over the past 15 years or so, giving it what critics say is massive market power that has allowed it to snuff out competition.</p><p>Zuckerberg's discussion with Hawley touched on industry competition, data privacy legislation, election security and accusations by conservatives that Facebook and other social media giants are biased against right-leaning content.</p><p>During his visit, Zuckerberg also met with other senators including Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mike Lee, R-Utah, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, and John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Tom Cotton, R-Ark. He also declined to answer reporters' questions when he left Lee's office earlier in the afternoon.</p><p>Lee's office said the two discussed bias against conservatives on Facebook's platform, regulation of online services, enforcement of antitrust laws in the tech industry and data privacy issues.</p><p>Congress has been debating a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to collect and make money off users' personal data. A national law, which would be the first of its kind in the U.S., could allow people to see or prohibit use of their data.</p><p>Acting preemptively, Zuckerberg last spring called for tighter regulations to protect consumers' data, control harmful online content and ensure election integrity and data portability. The internet \"needs new rules,\" he said.</p><p>It was Zuckerberg's first public visit to Washington since he testified before Congress last spring about privacy, election interference and other issues.</p><p>Facebook, a social media giant based in Menlo Park, California, with nearly 2.5 billion users, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of privacy scandals and amid accusations of abuse of its market power to squash competition.</p><p>The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting antitrust investigations of the big tech companies, and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general has opened a competition probe specifically of Facebook.</p><p>At Facebook's request, Warner helped organize a dinner meeting in Washington on Wednesday night for Zuckerberg and a group of senators.</p><p>Warner told The Associated Press he wanted Zuckerberg to hear his Senate colleagues' \"enormous concerns about privacy and about protecting the integrity of our political system.\"</p><p>Their message for the Facebook chief was \"self-regulation is not going to be the answer,\" Warner said. \"I think Zuckerberg understood that.\"</p><p>Warner and Hawley have proposed legislation that would force the tech giants to tell users what data they're collecting and how much it's worth. The proposal goes to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable business model of commerce in users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like, and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to individuals they want to reach.</p><p>The tech companies view with particular alarm a separate legislative proposal from Hawley that would require them to prove to regulators that they're not using political bias to filter content. Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its long-held immunity from legal action.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-e02c186734de4a469bec830b05bd3968</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3B-4PD1-DY9S-T137-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"897\"/><timeReceived>08:24 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Tuesday, January 21st.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump speaking in Davos, Switzerland, last hour, highlighting the strength of the American economy. Trade deals, regulation, deregulation, getting out of the way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meantime, the impeachment trial officially gets underway on Capitol Hill at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time. This coming after back and forth arguments from both sides of the aisle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pneumonia-like virus spreading rapidly in China. The number of confirmed cases tripling. What you need to know as it reaches major cities in China.</p><p>Investors on edge because of that coronavirus in China. We have losses across the board. Again, investors, they bet on what they can quantify, possible economic impacts. People are thinking about the SARS virus, what that did to the Asian economies. We have a 45 point loss on the Dow futures. The markets were closed yesterday as we honored Dr. Martin Luther King Junior on the annual holiday.</p><p>In Europe, there are declines across the board as well. A loss of about 1 percent on the FTSE 100 in England, the hardest hit there.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, the Shanghai composite sliding nearly 1.5 percent, its worst day in two months. But the worst performer, the Hang Seng, lost almost 3 percent. Moody's downgrading Hong Kong's credit rating, citing the months of ongoing protests.</p><p>Counting down to the Super Bowl LIV, and one of the most watched moments, the halftime show. We have a preview.</p><p>Here to break it all down with me, Turning Point USA spokesperson, Iraq War veteran, Rob Smith, columnist for \"The Hill\" and Fox News contributor Liz Peek, and \"Wall Street Journal\" senior writer, Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>So we get --</p><p>HILSENRATH: I don't care about Super Bowl halftime shows.</p><p>SMITH: What?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, you can't --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Do you care about them? It doesn't matter.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You better -- you better stop --</p><p>SMITH: Come on. Halftime shows are fun.</p><p>HILSENRATH: That's when I go and get a refill.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You better stifle before I throw you off this set for saying -- that is blasphemy.</p><p>Meantime, we want to get to Cheryl.</p><p>Fears growing over an outbreak of a new virus in China.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details.</p><p>Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Dagen, good morning.</p><p>Well, Chinese officials say that a fourth person has died from the corona illness. Several U.S. airports increasing medical screenings for travelers coming in from China. More than 200 people have fallen ill since just last month.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron says he and President Trump had a, quote, great discussion on a possible digital tax. The U.S. and France reaching a truce over the French tax that would tax revenue from digital services at big tech companies like FaceBook, Google parent Alphabet, even Amazon. Macron has agreed to postpone the tax until the end of the year. President Trump has agreed to delay tariffs on up to 100 percent of things like French wine, cheese, handbags. We can all breathe a little easier.</p><p>All right, Puerto Rico's governor firing two more officials there, bringing the total to three people after this video emerged of thousands of cases of supplies that were meant for Hurricane Maria victims. They were found unused in a warehouse. Protesters took to the streets yesterday. They called for the resignation of Wanda Vazquez. The National Guard says they are going to deliver some of those unused supplies to areas affected by the recent earthquakes that have been hitting the island.</p><p>And Delta divvying up a massive amount of money between its employees. The airline has announced it is sharing $1.6 billion with its 90,000 employees. Each employee going to get a check for 16.6 percent of their annual salary. That's about two months pay. But this isn't a first for Delta. They have doled out these bonuses for the last six straight years. The airline's always getting so beat up, Dagen, for, well, you know, cancellation, lost baggage, but at least they're treating their employees a little bit better over at Delta.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, indeed. And that's why you get great service on Delta.</p><p>CASONE: I've heard.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's my opinion.</p><p>HILSENRATH: How about lower fares? That would be nice.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hey, I told you, you keep talking, I'll throw you off the set.</p><p>Meantime, President Trump speaking last hour at the World Economic Forum in Davos, touting the strength of the U.S. economy and trade.</p><p>Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have a tremendous upside potential when all of the trade deals and the massive deregulation starts kicking in, which will be during this year, especially toward the end of the year. Those trade deals are starting to kick in already. The regulations are kicking in right now.</p><p>And I see such tremendous potential for the future. We have not even started, because the numbers we're talking about are massive.</p><p>The time for skepticism is over. People are flowing back into our country. Companies are coming back into our country. Many of you who I know are coming back in with your plants and your factories. Thank you very much.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jon, your reaction?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, the president want to be talking about the economy right now. The economy is in really strong shape. It's a great juxtaposition for him against these impeachment proceedings that are underway.</p><p>The one other thing I'd say is, I always listen when -- when somebody talks to what they don't say, and it was interesting to me that the president, in this global setting, didn't say anything about immigration, which is such a resining issue for him here in the states. He started talking about teaming cities in Europe. I thought, oh, now he's going to talk about migration, immigration, but he was talking about teaming culture and commerce. So it's something that just jumped out at me.</p><p>PEEK: I thought it was interesting, the clip we just showed there speaks to something I just wrote about on \"The Hill,\" which is the possibility the economy actually accelerates in 2020. No one is anticipating that. Everyone's talking about down beat kind of numbers. The IMF came out with sort of down beat numbers for global growth.</p><p>I think with -- with the trade agreements in place, and also with housing beginning to surge, there's a real chance that estimates of growth are going to be going up. And as we go into the election, the economy is going to get stronger.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, but the IMF numbers --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Was that --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the IMF numbers were raised to 3.3 percent, global growth from 2.9 percent. So north of 3 percent. And one of the central reasons was loser monetary policy, but also trade deals and the easing of tensions.</p><p>PEEK: Without a doubt.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I think it's totally reasonable to expect the economy to accelerate.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: You've mentioned low interest rates. You mentioned trade deals.</p><p>PEEK: But I don't think the American people know that because if you look at the headlines on \"The New York Times\" and all the other places, it's impeachment.</p><p>SMITH: Impeachment, impeachment, impeachment,</p><p>PEEK: But also things -- like \"The New York Times\" had a headline last week, manufacturing at nine year low or something. It was so misleading. It had to do with an index of sentiment about manufacturing.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>PEEK: Really dishonest. And that's the messaging.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: One other thing, low interest rates --</p><p>SMITH: Well, I think the great thing -- well, I think the great thing about this right now is that we have so many people who are getting a lot of their information via social media, via conservative influencers that they follow and so now we don't have to depend so much on things like \"The New York Times\" --</p><p>PEEK: I hope so.</p><p>SMITH: To kind of like fit the narrative. It's really true.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But that is -- but that is where people on the left get it wrong because they feel like we need to educate you and tell you and explain to you how the economy's doing.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, every American understands that.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If they can get a job, if they can get a better job --</p><p>PEEK: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If their wages will go up -- going up, they know that.</p><p>SMITH: People know whether they're doing better now than they were a year ago or two years ago.</p><p>PEEK: Bingo.</p><p>SMITH: They know it. They can feel it. They feel it when they open their wallet. They feel it when they go to the bank. So people know. They realize. And they don't need to depend on \"The New York Times.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: I -- I want to just --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Can I just throw in one other point --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Really quickly, because I want to get to impeachment.</p><p>HILSENRATH: We talk -- we talked about low interest rates and trade deals helping the economy. Let's also not forget that those folks back in Washington, Republicans and Democrats alike, are spending like there's no nozzle on the fire hose.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, that's true.</p><p>HILSENRATH: It's just flying out of there, flying out of Washington.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, which is not conservative, but that's a conversation for many hours --</p><p>HILSENRATH: I'm just trying to rain on everyone's parade.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, no, no, it is -- but it is. And it's something that comes up often because the Democrats are trying to use that now against President Trump and the Republicans --</p><p>PEEK: Which is hilarious.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right or wrong, but they are -- again, but look how low interest rates are. Yes, and the market's not worried right now.</p><p>Turning to the impeachment trial.</p><p>President Trump in Davos, while here at home the Senate is expected to take up the impeachment trial again. The president's legal team released more than 100 pages of its defense brief, slamming the Democrats. The essential argument in the brief having, read it yesterday, is that the two articles of impeachment, Liz, that they do not rise to the level of impeachment, period.</p><p>PEEK: Exactly. They're not crimes. I mean that's the essential argument. I think people are going to be responding to that.</p><p>I -- I -- look, what we've actually seen, Jon mentioned earlier, for months now that this thing has been underway, no one has changed their opinion. The president's approval rating, if anything, has gone up, which I think is sort of interesting and does probably reflect the strength of the economy. But people are really not paying attention to this because I think that the Republicans did a very good job of representing the House inquiry and investigation and then vote as terribly partisan, very unfair to the president. Now, the Democrats are trying to do the same thing about the Senate trial.</p><p>I honestly think people are bored with this. You know, yes, there's going to be some audience for these next few crimped hours of presentation. But it's sort of like what happened in the House. We know -- everything's out there that's going to be in this presentation. And in this discussion --</p><p>(COSS TALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: I think not -- not everything -- not everything is out there. We haven't heard from Mick Mulvaney and we haven't heard from Bolton --</p><p>PEEK: Yes, but that's if -- if they get to witnesses, that's a new thing. But this initial is not going to be.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But this is the business they wanted to see. Like, if the Democrats were serious about hearing from Mulvaney and Bolton --</p><p>PEEK: Yes, they would have done it before.</p><p>HILSENRATH: They would have taken this through the courts.</p><p>PEEK: Totally. I agree with you.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So, I mean, there's still -- there's still more -- like if there was a real serious investigation --</p><p>PEEK: Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH: We would have gone through the courts and heard from these people.</p><p>PEEK: But -- but let's talk about --</p><p>SMITH: And what you guys are both --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let -- let Rob get in.</p><p>SMITH: What you guys are both missing is how much money the RNC has raised off of this sham.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, that's so true.</p><p>SMITH: I don't think that people realize, we're talking tens of millions of dollars they have raised off of this. It -- it -- it makes the president and the Republicans seem like they're fighting the swamp, which they are.</p><p>PEEK: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: It does really well for fundraising. This is money that they are going to need coming up in an election year. And I really do think that the Democrats overplayed their hand with this impeachment.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, let -- let -- we need to --</p><p>HILSENRATH: And, by -- by the way --</p><p>MCDOWELL: We need to go -- we need to move on because I want to talk about this, but let me end with this. They rushed it. The Democrats rushed it in the House so they could slap the label of impeachment on President Trump. They didn't pursue these witnesses because they wanted to get it done by the end of the year. Then they tried to argue, we need to impeach him now because he might -- again, not a constitutional violation, that they were preemptively impeaching him because he might do something during an election year. Then Nancy Pelosi sits on those articles of impeachment for about a month. It's just -- the American -- again, the American people can see what is going on.</p><p>And one of the two articles is obstruction of Congress --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Which is essential -- essentially the president defending the power of his office.</p><p>PEEK: Exactly. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That is it. So that's a lot of what you're going to hear during that impeachment trial.</p><p>Andy McCarthy is coming up in a few minutes, but I want to get to this.</p><p>The Virginia Second Amendment rally. There were thousands of pro-gun activists. It was roughly 22,000 people showed up. Holding a demonstration around the Virginia state capitol yesterday. The relatively -- the rally, peaceful, no injuries. There was one arrest. And I'll just point this out, that what I have seen in publications like \"The New York Times\" comparing this to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that resulted in the death of someone is just -- it sets my hair on fire because these are -- this is a grassroots rally of people in the state of Virginia where the majority of counties in the state have become Second Amendment sanctuaries because of what the Democrats that took power in Virginia have tried to do in terms of cracking down on people's gun rights and cracking down on the Second Amendment.</p><p>Governor Ralph Northam put this statement out yesterday after the rally. I -- the team successfully deescalated what could have been a volatile situation. And Charles Cook from \"The National Review\" writes this, you deescalating nothing barred that which was of your own making.</p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>PEEK: Amen.</p><p>SMITH: Dagen, I cannot say strongly enough how much I reject the idea that what happened in Virginia was any sort of white supremacist rally, anything like that. I reject it.</p><p>There are -- there were African-Americans at that rally. Antonia Okafor, who is a two -- a female too right -- 2A rights activist, spoke at that event. This group, started by Maj Toure called Black Guns Matter, those people were at this protest. So these were law abiding citizens of all races and genders exercising their constitutional right to bear arms. And there are so many people in the liberal media that would like to spin that and pretend as if all of these people were white supremacist, as if all of these people were trouble, that I fundamentally reject.</p><p>And Governor blackface, by the way, is not the one that should be calling for calm or anything like that. Like, he's not the one.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to point out too that people like Cam Edwards, who's a Second Amendment -- pro-Second Amendment activist, they put out letters to all of those people attending that rally before the rally saying, we stand together regardless of color, class or creed in support of these rights. This is not an insurrection or a violent protest. This -- and he pointed out, this is a grassroots movement where 91 of 95 counties in the state of Virginia have become sanctuaries where they will protect your Second Amendment rights.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I am fired up.</p><p>More after the break.</p><p>MCDOWELL: President Trump in Davos for the World Economic Forum and back here at home all eyes on Capitol Hill. The Senate expected to take up the impeachment trial against President Trump today.</p><p>The president's legal team releasing more than 100 pages of defense, slamming -- yesterday, slamming the Democrats' charges, defending how the president handled his phone call with the Ukrainian president. Quote, House Democrats' charge of obstruction is both frivolous and dangerous at the very outset. The very suggestion that President Trump has somehow obstructed Congress is preposterous. The president has been extraordinarily transparent about his interactions with President Zelensky. The president was not obstructing when he freely released the central piece of evidence in this case.</p><p>Joining me now, former federals prosecutor, Fox News contributor, Andy McCarthy. Excuse me, Andrew McCarthy.</p><p>ANDREW MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Andy, good to see you.</p><p>What happens today? This is about Mitch McConnell, the Senate leaders' resolution about how the trial will be handled. Walk us through that really quickly.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, here's what the Republicans would like to do. They'd like to have a couple of days of argument by the House impeachment managers, a couple of days of rebuttal by the president's counsel, about a day and a half to two days of questions by the senators that would be asked through the chief justice. In other words, they would submit written questions and the chief justice would put them to the different sides. And then what they would like to do is begin closing arguments with an idea toward deliberation and connect -- and in connection with that, have whatever argument they're going to have about whether they need additional witnesses and documentary evidence.</p><p>And this, I think, is going to be the sticking point today because from the Democrats' perspective, if the additional witnesses and documentary evidence are part of the case that they want to present, you would think it would be unacceptable to them to defer that until the very end of the case, on the precipice of having deliberations over the final verdict. They what that to be part of the narrative they're presenting. The Republicans are going to counter that, you know, look, if it was so crucial to your case, you would have developed it in the House investigation and we're not going to a allow that to happen. You should be -- you should count yourself fortunate that we're entertaining this at all. And we're going to have it at the end. So that's what the big fight today, I think, will be about.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you think we end up having witnesses at the end? OK, we've talked about this. There were three witnesses in the Clinton impeachment. They were deposed behind closed doors. One representative from the Republicans and the Democrats were present. It was videotaped. They did air excerpts of it.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you think we get to witnesses? Because, again, and correct me if I'm wrong, the Senate has to vote on these witnesses and it requires a simple majority vote, does it not? So the Democrats would need four Republicans to flip sides.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes, here's I think what the problem is. If I -- if it were up to me, I think the articles of impeachment are insufficient on their face and I would entertain a motion to dismiss them because we've already had a full-blown proceeding in the House. It's not like we don't know what the case is, right?</p><p>PEEK: Exactly. Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: But there's some sentiment among the Republicans that the trial has to have integrity in order for it to be accepted by the public as legitimate. And to some of them, that means there has to be at least some nod toward having witnesses. Seems to me that the Clinton impeachment formula is probably the best way to do that because they can get whatever witnesses they want, interview them outside the confines of the public Senate trial, and then what happened in the Clinton thing was I think it was Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and one other witness, they had the arguments about what was admissible outside the Senate trial and then they just played video snippets in a very kind of tight, short way. And that was the witnesses. That was it. So they could --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Will Justice Roberts have anything to say about whether witnesses show up?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes, this will be very interesting how this evolves because I've always thought the chief justice's role in the trial is more ornamental than substantive, in the sense that the Constitution makes the Senate in charge of impeachment, not the court. The reason the chief justice is presiding is because normally the vice president presides over Senate proceedings.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because he's the president of the Senate.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes, but there's a conflict of interest, obviously, because if the president is removed, the vice president becomes president. So the framers thought it would be unseemly to have that kind of a situation. So the chief justice is there. But how much he has to do is questionable.</p><p>Chief Justice Rehnquist, when he presided over the Clinton impeachment, said, I did virtually nothing but I did it very well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Andy, I can always talk to you forever. More time next time.</p><p>Andy McCarthy. Thank you so much.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Countdown to the Super Bowl. Shakira and J-Lo, Jennifer Lopez to us mortals, putting the final touches on their much anticipated halftime show.</p><p>Kristina Partsinevelos taking a look at how the performance can boost an artist's career.</p><p>Hey.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS: We know that it can do so, but I'm going to steal this quote from billboard because they said, you can't do a comparison apples to apples because a lot of these artists don't have maybe a current album, they don't have an upcoming tour, so it is difficult to really say, hey, this guy made this much one year and this person made another.</p><p>But, what we know from the past, and we do have some big stars, J-Lo, Jennifer Lopez, like you mentioned, and Shakira, they're going to be performing together. This is going to be a big thing for the Latina community because they're both Latina stars. I know that J-Lo, too, even put out a quote saying that this is going to be really good for the girls out there and it's going to be Shakira's birthday.</p><p>Both have done very well with sales, sold over 75 million records worldwide. But what does this mean for actual sales of albums? So we've got to go back in the past.</p><p>Neilson Music says Maroon 5, for example, they performed last year, they saw a sales gain, and that's who you're seeing on your screen right now, of 488 percent on the day of the Super Bowl half show. Then -- they even saw their songs downloaded just skyrocket. They had Travis Scott, the rapper, some of you may or may not be familiar with Travis Scott, he saw some of his music jump about 80 percent. This is also according to Nielsen Music.</p><p>And then it's not just about the actual sales. We're talking about streaming on Spotify. Justin Timberlake, for example, he performed in 2018. He saw a 214 percent increase just in streams for his -- after his halftime show.</p><p>But not everything's good. And I'm going to bring it back to this because in was a monumental moment in the halftime show. Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, we don't have video of it, we don't have video of it, but after that little slip-up over there, unfortunately her album didn't do as well. Damita Jo, she had no singles off of that album. And that's a big deal for her because she's had seven singles just off of one.</p><p>And if you're wondering how much does a ticket cost, the most expensive is over $21,000 for this upcoming Super Bowl.</p><p>And Demi Lovato is going to be doing the national anthem. So that's a big deal too.</p><p>SMITH: First of all, Janet's my number one, so got to defend her.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: I love you too, yes.</p><p>SMITH: Second of all, Liz Peek told me Travis Scott's her favorite rapper.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: What? Really? Do you sing along?</p><p>PEEK: You are such a creative writer.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: I'm impressed, Liz.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, best Super Bowl performance ever?</p><p>Prince.</p><p>SMITH: Gaga.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Prince in the rain.</p><p>PEEK: Oh, yes.</p><p>SMITH: OK, that was amazing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you remember that?</p><p>SMITH: I remember that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because I'm a lot older than you are.</p><p>SMITH: I think I saw it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it was during a -- it was during a downpour. It was -- it actually wasn't that long ago. It was 2007.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I think the best part of the Super Bowl is that the Patriots aren't going to be in it.</p><p>SMITH: Oh.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: You're suffering from fatigue?</p><p>HILSENRATH: I'm just a suffering New York Giants fan.</p><p>SMITH: Yes, long-suffering.</p><p>PEEK: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But they're --</p><p>PEEK: You're not alone.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's some logic in that, though. That, again, you get sick of seeing the same people show up and play --</p><p>PEEK: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And you have two incredible quarterbacks, Garoppolo and Mahomes, say that eight times fast.</p><p>SMITH: Whoa, back to this Super Bowl. We've got to have justice for J-Lo. She was snubbed for an Oscar nomination. And --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You were very upset about that because you thought --</p><p>SMITH: I was very upset.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You thought \"Hustlers\" was this --</p><p>SMITH: \"Hustlers\" was a legitimately good movie. I'm sorry.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Oh, so we should have Adam Sandler up there too.</p><p>SMITH: Yes, exactly.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, there you go.</p><p>SMITH: Maybe he'll come and cameo.</p><p>HILSENRATH: That's it.</p><p>PEEK: Aye, yi, yi.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: The Chief, though, they haven't played -- enter the Super Bowl since 1970.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, it's 50 years ago. And they were -- they --</p><p>PEEK: And, man --</p><p>HILSENRATH: It's going to be a good game.</p><p>PEEK: It's going to be a good game.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Chiefs and 49ers, it's going to be a very good game.</p><p>PEEK: It should be a good game. For once it should be a good game.</p><p>SMITH: For once.</p><p>PEEK: And it usually is not, right?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: For once?</p><p>PEEK: No, I mean usually it's so lopsided.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Chiefs --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: I take some offense with you. I'm a little bit upset about that. It's fun to watch.</p><p>PEEK: Oh, it's fun to miss --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: (INAUDIBLE) those that don't really care, the halftime show.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Chiefs were in the first Super Bowl, Super Bowl I. They played the Green Bay Packers. I said that yesterday. So the Green Bay Packers, denied. I love it.</p><p>Kristina, thank you.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: J-Lo all day and Shakira.</p><p>Coming up, 2020 market outlook. We're talking about it with the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick.</p><p>Kids making money. How much they're getting for allowance ahead.</p><p>We're back after the break.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Tesla slamming claims its cars have an acceleration defect. Cheryl Casone has the details. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right, Dagen. Tesla is responding to a petition filed by a short seller and Tesla stuck with national safety regulators. The petition calls for an investigation into the alleged problem which could involve about 500,000 cars. Tesla says that the accusation is, quote, completely false. There is Tesla in the premarket, down about $3.69.</p><p>The grounding of Boeing 737 Max jet having long-term effects on that company. Boeing reportedly is now in talks with various banks to secure loans upward of $10 billion to help the company deal with the ongoing situation. At least $6 billion has been secured so far. Boeing ended the last quarter with $10.9 billion in cash on-hand and apparently they need more.</p><p>And millennials are not keeping up with the older Americans when it comes to the housing market. According to the Federal Reserve, the millennials groups only owned four percent of American real estate last year, that's a stark contrast to baby boomers who owned a third of it when they were the same age.</p><p>Experts point to a larger amount of debt that they have and the higher median price of a home as major reasons that millennials lag behind.</p><p>But there's also Dagen, one other point to this, and that's that these millennials saw their parents go through the great recession, the housing crisis of 2008, obviously, and that kind of scarred them a little bit.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Cheryl, thank you so much for that. Cheryl Casone.</p><p>Impeachment in focus on the world stage, ahead of his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the president tried to dismiss today's trial as a distraction to our U.S. economic success.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're bringing back tremendous business to the United States and they're all here to see. I'll be making the speech and then we'll be leaving shortly. But I think it's very important that the other is just a hoax, it's the witch hunt that's been going on for years and it's frankly, it's disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Meantime, back at home, the impeachment trial gets underway later today. Joining us live from Davos, Switzerland, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick. Howard, always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>HOWARD LUTNICK, CEO, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Great to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Howard, is anyone talking about the impeachment trial there?</p><p>LUTNICK: No. In fact, as I -- as I walked around and asked international people about it, they all see it as a domestic issue. You know, he's running for re-election. They view the impeachment from a global stage as much more like the Democrats, this is their -- you know, this is their sort of try at taking out the president who has got of course a really good economy and really good economic numbers which he highlighted in his speech.</p><p>So that's sort of the way the world's looking at it, it sort of the give and take of Democrats versus Republicans.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Howard, can we talk for a second about stocks and interest rates. We ended the year on the stock market on a really high note. How much room does this market have left to run on the stock front? And interest rates are exceptionally low right now; do you see any indication that they're going to go up at any time in the future?</p><p>LUTNICK: So I love when Davos is nice and sunny because basically that's my outlook. I mean, look behind me. It's a beautiful -- it's a beautiful day. It's a sunny day. Gorgeous mountains behind me. That's what the U.S. economy looks like. And I think the rest of the world's economy is coming up.</p><p>So, low interest rates are going to keep the gas on the fire. You're going to see that. And the president's going to push for it. You're going to see that through the election at the end of the year.</p><p>So, low interest rates, maybe in a dream the Fed gets to knock them up one notch but it's unlikely. I think low interest rates; I think you've got a nice stock market going to keep creeping upward, creeping upward as you had at all last year.</p><p>So basically, I think the U.S. economy's in excellent, excellent shape. Slow growth, not what the president would like. But you know, in the two percent range, I think we're in really good shape and it's good to be American again. Last year was good to be American. This year it's good to be American.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Howard, what about the rest of the world, though? Is the -- is our -- is our strong economy, is that helping the rest of the world? Are we seeing a rising tide, so-to-speak, lift additional boats, say in Europe and even in Asia?</p><p>LUTNICK: Well, I think the -- I think the trade spat with China sort of helped the rest of the world. You've got now China going out, shopping for their own deals around to the rest of the world. So now they're investing their dollars and spreading it out less to America, and around the rest of the world.</p><p>The supply chain started moving away from China, start of diversifying around the rest of the world and I think you're getting a little bit of an uptake from all of that. So you're seeing the rest of the world doing a little better, you're seeing the IMF saying the world's going to do a little better. So I think the world's doing a little better.</p><p>But they're not -- look, Europe is in no way close to the U.S. The U.S. is in a strong position, it's going to continue to grow at a nice rate.</p><p>And you know, the European interest rates at negative, that's such an odd thing. I don't even know how to discuss what it means to have a negative interest rate. You know, that shouldn't even be on the menu. It shouldn't be a choice to say you have to pay to store your money. But that's helping -- at least it's helping Europe start to grow and maybe, maybe you're going to see Europe grow a little bit this year. That would be really nice.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you bump -- if you bump into the president, tell him that, Howard. Liz Peek is here. She has a question.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: So Howard, one of the questions we've been talking about last day or so is whether the president's message of lower taxes, less regulation, could possibly percolate through to the heads of state in the European community and whether they might begin to follow that path.</p><p>I mean, obviously Macron has run into huge trouble trying to change their labor model, you've had 50 days of demonstrations and stuff.</p><p>But surely someone in Europe has got to begin to say, you know, maybe we need to change our path here and follow this guy, you know, and try and boost our GDP growth.</p><p>LUTNICK: Well, look, you're seeing it for sure in Greece. You know, they went from strong left to a -- to a middle right government.</p><p>You know, that's what he tried to do today in his speech. He tried to say, you know, in a very Donald Trump way, look how great we are, we are, we are, maybe you should copy us.</p><p>PEEK: Right.</p><p>LUTNICK: Only Donald Trump can do it that way. I think most other people would stare at their shoes rather than do say it that way.</p><p>But you know, that was his message which is we're doing well; maybe you should think about cutting your regulation and try to pay attention to your workers.</p><p>But the fact is, the U.S., he had a better set of cards than other people. You know, we don't have the union issues that France does and Germany does. We don't have the industrial -- you know, choking that a lot of Europe does.</p><p>So I think the U.S. continues to lead and I think it's going to keep the rest of the world a little higher and the fact that we took on China and we're still taking on China, I think it's helping the world. At least get its moxie back in being a little stronger.</p><p>So I think the U.S. is in a good place. You know, lots of time in Davos people look for pessimism and they look for, -- you know, every year when I come on the show, people always ask me, what are the dark clouds out there.</p><p>The answer is, look behind me, there just aren't dark clouds this year. I think 2020 is a repeat of 2019, a really, really nice, good year ahead.</p><p>ROB SMITH, SPOKESPERSON, TURNING POINT USA: So Howard, we see that a couple of emerging markets like Brazil, India, Mexico and Russia are expected to see more accelerations and growth in 2020, probably by about a full percentage point.</p><p>So what in your mind are the reasons behind some of that growth that we're getting?</p><p>LUTNICK: Well, look, you have -- you know, these economies, they need growth, right. So, Brazil, for example, it's a minerals country, right. It's a raw materials country. They've got off to export their raw materials.</p><p>If they can export their raw material, it's going to lift them up. So that's an example where if the world is growing and the IMF is correct and the world grows a little, they'll be able to market their minerals, they'll be able to market their natural resources and the world will buy them.</p><p>So emerging markets need to export, they need the world to grow to lift them up. And I think that's what's going to help these countries grow.</p><p>Obviously, Russia is all about minerals and mining, right. These are the kind of countries that need the world to grow to help lift them up and I think you're feeling it and you're seeing it and that's what's happening.</p><p>So the world will be up a little bit and that's -- I think that's good. It's good for the world. It's good for the world's people. I think we're going to have an excellent year, just like 19 -- just like 2019, 2020 feels really, really good and I'm much more optimistic than most. If you talk to most people, they've always got to put a dark cloud on it. There's just not one out there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Not me. I'm a bond nerd and I try not to put dark clouds on everything. You know, fixed income people traditionally, again, they're looking for the negative. And equity people are looking for the positive.</p><p>But all I can say, Howard, is you enjoy that sunshine there in Davos.</p><p>LUTNICK: Thank you very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In the days and weeks and months ahead, Howard Lutnick, thank you so much, Howard. Great to see you.</p><p>Coming up, China virus outbreak growing, what's being done to stem it from spreading further? And we watched these markets; this is one of the concerns that's front and center today.</p><p>Plus, women working for free. The eye-opening number of extra hours they're putting in for unpaid tasks. Stay with us.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The deadly coronavirus, at least six people have been killed by the outbreak, nearly 300 infected, this is according to the National Health Commission. The number of cases now tripling as Beijing confirms the first case of human to human transmission.</p><p>It is sending Asian markets lower, sparking fears this could become like the SARS virus. Again, there were almost 8,100 cases of the SARS virus back in 2002, 2003.</p><p>Joining us now, Fox News contributor, NYU Langone Center associate professor of medicine, Dr. Marc Siegel. Tell us about this virus, Doctor. Great to see you.</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you, Dagen.</p><p>So, in the city of Wuhan, which is 19 million people, this virus appeared to emerge in a seafood market from seafood and they didn't know initially in China that it was transmissible human to human. They thought it was just people that were exposed at that market.</p><p>So by the time they figured it out that it was spreading from human to human, it had already spread beyond Wuhan. And that's actually the problem now. Because as you said, it's in Beijing, it's in Shanghai, it's in South Korea, it's in Japan and the mathematical model of this, suspects -- from Imperial College of London suspects that there's actually well over a thousand cases already.</p><p>It's very hard to track it because the Chinese health authorities are waiting until you have a confirmed case before they isolate you. Our Centers for Disease Control here likes to stay ahead of it and look at contacts, who was in contact with someone who has this virus, get them isolated. Otherwise it spreads around, especially since its flu season in China now as well.</p><p>So how do you know whether you have coronavirus versus whether you have the flu?</p><p>HILSENRATH: It's also Chinese New Year and you have a lot of people traveling.</p><p>But I wanted to ask you, why is it that so many of these flus and viruses seem to start in China? What is it about what's happening in China and how it's related to the rest of the world that it always seems to come from particularly Southern China?</p><p>SIEGEL: Jon, that's an excellent question. And I think that the answer we believe, health authorities believe it has to do with how close people live together and how close they live to their animals. That hasn't really changed.</p><p>Because most of these viruses start in animals, they either start in animals or in this case, in fish, in seafood.</p><p>So, close contact and then people spread it more easily. It mutates. It changes to a form that then spreads from one human to another. The coronavirus is very unstable so it mutates.</p><p>PEEK: Is there a cure for this?</p><p>SIEGEL: No, there's no cure for this. There's no treatment for it. But before everyone out there gets scared, it's kind of a cousin of the common cold. It's a severer form of the common cold.</p><p>And I think the biggest thing that's driving the markets today is fear. It's not even the virus itself because we saw that with SARS back in 2003, which is it did kill 800 people. It's nothing to take lightly.</p><p>PEEK: Suppress travel, remember -- if you remember, people stayed home because they were afraid of this. So it actually had an economic impact too.</p><p>SIEGEL: And that -- I think that's likely to happen here. Our hospitals in the West Coast of the United States are already gearing up for this.</p><p>As you know, some airports are already screening people. LAX, San Francisco Airport, JFK, looking to see people that come in with fevers and with heart rate changes. But Dagen, that can be from a lot of things.</p><p>SMITH: If they find out they have this, do they turn them back around or do they stop them from coming, do they quarantine them? I'm curious.</p><p>SIEGEL: They quarantine them at the airport and then they'll test them. And clearly if they have the virus, they're going to keep them out of the general public.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is always a reminder of how great the CDC is in terms of operating and trying to get ahead and on top of these outbreaks, whether it's a norovirus or something like this. I think you agree with that.</p><p>SIEGEL: Completely agree with that and not just the CDC. It's also -- I understand that some of our major medical centers on the West Coast are preparing for this.</p><p>Again, don't want to spread the virus of fear here. But I expect we're going to see cases in California.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We've got to run. Thank you, Dr. Mark Siegel. Great to see you.</p><p>SIEGEL: Good to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, kids making money, how much they're getting for allowance, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: More morning buzz, first up, any mom would agree, women spend two hours more per day than men cleaning, cooking and doing other unpaid tasks. Do the math, that adds up to more than 95 additional eight-hour work days a year that women work for free. If there was a paycheck it would a hall totaling nearly $1.5 trillion.</p><p>Liz, why isn't this changing more? Why isn't the -- I guess the duties distributed more evenly in a household?</p><p>PEEK: Well, I think that -- I think it happens to some households. Most women I know would prefer to do those things rather than to have their husband do it because I think the husbands intentionally screw it up the first time they try and you're like OK, I'll do it myself. No, I'm just kidding. I just think that's --</p><p>HILSENRATH: By the way, I'd call this strategic incompetence.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, exactly. I've seen some of that up close and personal.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But this isn't just men versus women, this is in a couple. I think this is an even -- like, somebody is carrying the load around the house and then the other person is playing video games.</p><p>SMITH: I think those numbers speak to how much we can sometimes devalue that type of work as well. And so, when you see the number like trillions a year, it's really --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- financial compensation the only measure of a -- of a person's value and what they're getting back or giving for their time. I mean, very often this is part of running and raising a family.</p><p>SMITH: Absolutely.</p><p>HILSENRATH: It comes with all kinds of psychic value.</p><p>PEEK: You know, I actually don't like this story because Hillary Clinton in her endless, endless book about what went wrong in her election spends a chapter talking about how sad it is that she has to plan the family's travel, etcetera. And I thought that was the whiniest thing I ever read.</p><p>SMITH: Are you kidding me? You read it so we don't have to.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, let's move on to something less whining, kids doing OK without actually having a full-time job. The average child nets a weekly allowance of $10.00, adding up to about $500 a year. About two-thirds of parents asked say they do a weekly payout with nearly half of the children survey saying that they saved about half of the money. That's according to a study by RoosterMoney, a kids allowance and chores app.</p><p>Jon, did you pay your kids allowance?</p><p>HILSENRATH: No. I can't say we did. I guess we dropped the ball on that one. You know, I think a lot of families --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now they're financially dependent on you, even well into college.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, they're going to college and I think that a lot of families and parents these days are investing in their kids getting in and going through college because the payoffs are so large in the long run that we end up kind of devaluing things like allowance.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I'm going to be the old man sort of like waving his fist (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Get off my lawn.</p><p>SMITH: Because I didn't get an allowance when I was a kid. I mowed lawns for $10.00 an hour, and that's how I earned my money. And we got a soft generation.</p><p>PEEK: By the way, I know a 6-year-old who gets $10.00 for a tooth that comes out. The tooth fairy brings $10.00. That's inflation.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I agree with you, I didn't get an allowance either. I worked (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to get to the -- I want to get to the story about the royals, so Harry is back in Canada. They're moving to North America. Harry and Meghan started their new life, Harry flew into Canada joined Meghan and baby Archie. Rob, you get this one.</p><p>SMITH: Oh, Megxit, yes look, they're done. I'm not super interested in this. I hope that they make a lot of money, Meghan Markle is gorgeous. I hope that they're happy. I mean, that's all I've got to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, that was --</p><p>HILSENRATH: For me it's like the half time show, it's like eh.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome to North America, Harry and Meghan.</p><p>SMITH: Yes, I mean, I don't --</p><p>MCDOWELL: We'll be right back. Maria in Davos next hour.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

But quote, \"In coming weeks\" as he  strongly defends himself against allegations of sexual misconduct. This is  bare-knuckle political hardball. The push is now on for a democrat Senate  majority to upend the Trump agenda. We have the details.</p><p>Also the House is passing a two week spending bill to avoid a government  shutdown tomorrow night. This continuing resolution simply renews all  existing programs for -- through basically the stroke of midnight December  22nd. We're on that story for you. </p><p>And Bitcoin crossing the 19,000 threshold for the very first time today.  This crypto currency is in a staggering dizzying ascend surging from about  3500 in mid-September to its current price.</p><p>Did you miss the chance to get in on the action or to short Bitcoin? We're  going to let you know. We have an all-star guest line-up including the co- authors of the new bestseller \"Let Trump be Trump,\" they are David Bossie  and Corey Lewandowski, also attorney Gregg Jarrett on the Mueller probe,  and Fox News host Steve Hilton on the fight between Trump and Britain's  Theresa May, all here all tonight.</p><p>I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. Risk and Reward starts right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL FRANKEN, (D) UNITED STATES SENATOR:  We were finally beginning to listen  to women about the ways in which men's actions affect them. I was excited  for that conversation. Then the conversation turned to me. Some of the  allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember very  differently. </p><p>I have used my power to be a champion of women. Nothing I have done as a  senator, nothing has brought this honor on this institution. Nevertheless,  today, I am announcing that in the coming weeks I will be resigning as a  member of the United States Senate. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  He struck a defiant tone on the floor of the Senate. Senator Al  Franken defended himself before announcing he will step down but with the  caveat in coming weeks. That's what the Washington, D.C. echo chamber into  overdrive that Al Franken may be trying to buy time to get a new lifeline  out of the outcome of the Roy Moore Alabama Senate race.</p><p>This, after eight women now accuse Al Franken of touching them  inappropriately. More than three dozen Senate democrats call for Al  Franken's resignation, including Charles Schumer, Bernie Sanders, and Diane  Feinstein. Al Franken is the second lawmaker to depart over sexual  misconduct allegations in the last week after John Conyers said he would  require. </p><p>The push is now on in the Senate for the democrats to seize control. And  here's the math if democrats win the seats from retiring Senators Blake and  Corker and there is a Roy Moore Senate loss that will put the democrats up  51-49. </p><p>Let's bring in the co-authors of \"Let Trump be Trump: The Inside Story of  His Rise to the Presidency\" David Bossie and Corey Lewandowski join me now.  Good to see you, guys. First, what do you think of Al Franken resigning,  first to you, Corey. </p><p>COREY LEWANDOWSKI, CO-AUTHOR, LET TRUMP BE TRUMP:  Look, I'd love to hear  the definitive date that Al Franken is actually to walk away from the U.S.  Senate because in Washington, D.C., Liz, I think you're exactly right. He  says he's going to do it sometime in the future. The uproar goes away and  Al Franken still sitting in the U.S. Senate a week, a month or a year from  now because nobody is going to force him out. </p><p>More than 75 percent of his own democratic caucus has asked for him to  resign. He's made the statement let's get the definitive date when he's  going to leave. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, David, the republicans now have Roy Moore problem.  The democrats, David, are trying to rebrand themselves as a party above  moral reproach. But you know, none have given back the Harvey Weinstein  donations. And only one, Kirsten Gillibrand barely criticizes Bill Clinton.</p><p>Go ahead, David.</p><p>DAVID BOSSIE, CO-AUTHOR, LET TRUMP BE TRUMP:  Yes. You know, I think that  we are going to have to have this conversation continuously over the next,  you know, coming weeks and months. You know, I think that when Alabama  voters decide next week then the Senate will get to decide if they want to  take action through the ethics committee on then-Senator Moore if he's  elected.</p><p>So, we'll see. Look, this is not going away. It's not a conversation that  should go away. You know, the members of the media, members of the  political class, you know, need to be held to account. And whether you're  in Hollywood, New York, Washington, you know, I am glad that this  conversation is happening.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Especially with that slush fund paying off sexual harassment  cases and more. Let's get back to Franken. Corey, Al Franken is saying  while in office he has used his power against women. Let's roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANKEN:  You know, an important part of the conversation we've been having  in the last few months has been about how men abuse their power and  privilege to hurt women. I am proud that during my time in the Senate I  have used my power to be a champion of women. I know there's been a very  different picture of me painted over the last few weeks but I know who I  really am. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right, guys. OK, of course, Al Franken will say that. He  has already made similar statements. He also took a shot of President Trump  and Roy Moore. But you know, you talked in your book about the Access  Hollywood tape, Corey. What was -- we want to know, what was the first  lady's reaction to that and the first family, the president's daughters,  what was their reaction to the Access Hollywood tape?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  You know, Melania Trump said that she knows her husband and  this was locker room talk. It was boy talk is what she said. And she stood  by her husband. She was very clear. And the president has said that he  never did those things, which is very different than what Senator Franken  has said. </p><p>Senator Franken has now admitted that he has done some of the things he has  been accused of, some of those women have come forward and said that he did  this while he was the United States senator. We have a picture of him  groping a woman's breast while she's asleep on an airplane. </p><p>Look, where I come from there is something called street justice. If you  were to do that where I come there would be a very different resolution and  potentially going to the Senate ethics committee to determine if this was  right or wrong. </p><p>It is uncalled for, it's egregious and Senator Franken should step down  immediately and not some arbitrary date in the future where he hasn't told  us when he is going to leave.</p><p>MACDONALD:  David, speak about the 16 women who have accused President  Trump in misconduct. Go ahead.</p><p>BOSSIE:  Well, it is exactly what Corey said, which is one is -- one is  locker room talk. One is, you know, guys talking among themselves whether  you like it or not we all know what happens and that's what the president  acknowledge. </p><p>But there is a difference between photographic evidence like in Al  Franken's case or in these congressional race -- congressional cases where  they use taxpayer dollars to pay the women off. So, we know there is  evidence in those cases.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>BOSSIE:  Here there is just a big difference between the two. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I want to get to FBI director Christopher Wray defending the  FBI after President Trump's criticism as the president -- excuse me --  Representative Jim Jordan really pushed card on the Robert Mueller Russia  probe calling for a second special counsel to look into the FISA warrant  and how they came about to basically spy on Trump campaign aides. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM JORDAN, (R) UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE:  Peter Strzok, Mr. Super- agent at the FBI, I think he's the guy who took the application to the FISA  court. And if that happened, I mean, think, if this happened if you have  the FBI working with a campaign, the democrats campaign taken opposition  research dressing it all up and turn it into an intelligence document and  taking it to the FISA court so they can spy on the other campaign, if that  happened that is as wrong as it gets.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. You guys were on the campaign, tell us what was  going on behind the scenes of the campaign. Did you, Corey, did you -- did  you know anybody or anyone else connected to the Trump campaign who is  working with the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's campaign. </p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Never. And let me say this. I sat next to candidate Trump for  18 months, 18 hours a day seven days a week. Never was the collusion,  cooperation or coordination with Russia in any way shape or form. </p><p>And what I have said very publicly and I stand by. If anybody attempted to  or did manipulate the outcome of this election for a foreign government  that person should go to jail for the rest of their life. And that would  include FBI agents who potentially used their power in the deep state to  manipulate government agencies like in court to list -- enlist FISA warrant  or to change rules and regulations as it relate to Hillary Clinton  investigation. </p><p>I am gravely concerned about this agent. And right now all we know is that  he's been demoted to the human resources department which I think is still  circumspect at best.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, we're staying on the story here on this show. The Trump  empires real estate dealings, David, with Russians and money laundering is  now into the microscope. Have you ever heard anything about that any  Russians were using shell companies or real estate dealings with the Trump  empire.</p><p>BOSSIE:  You know, we got these questions about our book. Why we didn't  talk about Russia in the book. And the reality is because there was nothing  to it. You know, we just look at this case and say it was based on this  collusion accusation. And this investigation has been going on a year and a  half now. Eighteen months of an investigation. Not a scintilla of evidence  that there's been any collusion or cooperation between the Russians and our  campaign. </p><p>And let me just say, we acknowledged that the Russians were trying to  impact both campaigns and we disagree with that. We want them to never do  that again. We want American campaigns to be stood up so that they can't be  impacted again. And so we'd like to see that happen. </p><p>But there was no evidence of collusion. And that's why this case really has  gone nowhere except Paul Manafort and Rick Gates in what they did before  joining the campaign, and Mike Flynn and Papadopoulos about a lie they told  to the FBI. Again, nothing to do with collusion of the Trump campaign. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Let's move on. Now, you know, the press is on. The full  court press is on with Senate democrats to seize back control and get a  majority in the Senate. </p><p>The Dow powering forward on optimism about the Trump agenda and tax reform.  Look at this. It only took 32 trading days for the Dow to rise and 22,000  to the 23,000 mark. It was only seven days ago that the blue chip average  finished above 24,000 for the very first time.</p><p>We're now in the fifth 1,000 milestone in 2017 for the Dow, the most ever  in a calendar year. And the six 1,000-point milestone since Election Day. </p><p>But former President Obama is crediting himself for the strong economy  saying the thank should go to him. Watch the fast fall that President Obama  tried to whip by you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  As we took these  actions we saw the U.S. economy were all consistent, we saw the longest  stream of job creation in American history by far. The streak have stock  continues by the way. Thanks, Obama.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Did you catch the nuance of what Obama said, the quote,  \"longest winning streak.\" Obama is talking about back to back monthly job  creation 75 months straight versus Reagan at 48. But when you talk about  the actual number of jobs created Obama ranks down there with Jimmy Carter.  Reagan created more than 16 million, Clinton nearly 23 million. About 11  million for President Obama and 10 million for Carter. </p><p>I mean, Corey, every president can argue they inherited the recession going  back to FDR. That's what Obama is arguing. What do you make of those  numbers and what Obama is saying that he's the go to guy for the strength  in the economy.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Well, you know, Liz. It's amazing. This is the 12 year  presidency because for the first four years of the Obama administration all  he did was blame Bush for the terrible economy that he inherited. And now  for the year after this administration he's tried to take credit for what  Trump has done. </p><p>Look, Donald Trump has helped to add 5 trillion almost $6 million of market  cap to the economy right now. We have the lowest unemployment since 1973.  We have the highest home ownership in two generations. What we see is the  stock market is going like crazy. We're at 3.3 percent growth under the  Obama years.</p><p>Look, these are the governments numbers, 1.2 and 1.3 percent GDP. He  doubled our national deficit in eight years. From eight -- from eight to 16  and then from 10 to $20 trillion. The only thing he gets credit for is that  Donald Trump came in to save the economy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And facts are he created a record number of basic government  jobs, a lot of government jobs, a lot of minimum wage jobs that you can't  raise a family on. Those are the facts. You can check the government data  on that.</p><p>I want to get to the story first. Let me get back for a second to your new  tell-all book \"Let Trump Be Trump.\" David, you -- David and Corey, you  detailed how ABC News top producer Chris Vlasto gave you, David, as Trump  then-deputy campaign manager proprietary exit polling in election night.  Those numbers are usually only shared with the Associated Press and the  major TV networks and not to outsiders. </p><p>I mean, ABC I think you reported this, has now reprimanded the producer for  that. How did this go down, I mean, how did you get involved in that. Did  you feel badly about being involved in that?</p><p>BOSSIE:  Well, I didn't feel badly about being involved in it. Look,  reporters and political operatives all across the country in both parties  trade information all the time. And it is just part of the business. And so  I traded information with reporters for 30 years now. </p><p>And so I got that data and it was just -- it ended up being bad exit poll  data. It's really what it ended up being. So, we took about half an hour to  digest it and figure it out that it was bad exit poll data. We got it at 5,  by about 5.35 we had figured out that we're not in as bad a shape as it  looked like because the exit polls were wrong. </p><p>And Donald Trump ended up winning this massive landslide all across the  country winning states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, and Wisconsin.  States we weren't supposed to win. North Carolina and Florida by bug  numbers that they did not expect the Clintons, you know -- when they got  that same data, I might add, you know, they were celebrating and popping  champagne corks a little early. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Interesting. You know, you guys, you've worked with news  operations with the TV networks for some time. We broke this -- we reported  on the story about ABC News investigative divisions still reeling from the  suspension of chief investigative correspondent Brian Ross. </p><p>The Dow dropped, Corey, 350 points by his wrong report about General Flynn  and Trump. What has been your experience and can you tell you what has been  like to deal with the various networks in the integrity and credibility of  each of them. </p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Look, I think there are some good people who work at the  networks. But unfortunately, we're now in a cycle where reporters want to  make the news and not report the news. We saw this from Brian Ross, he put  out a false narrative. The Dow Jones falls 350 points.</p><p>ABC first has those in mistake. Now they've suspended him. They should fire  this person for what he did. How many people lost money because of this  false report? Look in just this week. We saw a report out that the Mueller  investigative team has subpoenaed records at Deutsche bank. That story was  pervasive across the networks only to be retracted in six hours later as a  complete facade.</p><p>The news media has no liability. Unfortunately, the networks go and say  whatever they want and their apology effort is not enough to the American  people. And that's why Donald Trump -- and we talked about this in the book  a lot -- coined the phrase \"fake news.\" </p><p>The American people are smart, they look through it and 97 percent of the  people after election they say they didn't allow the media's bias to change  their voting habits this election cycle.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. David and Corey, it's so good to see you, guys. Be  sure to buy their best-selling book \"Let Trump Be Trump.\" We love having  you on. We look forward to both of you coming back on again soon. It's a  great book, go buy it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Any time. Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's check your money markets closing up 70 points today. Our  own Nicole Petallides is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with  the latest. Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  A winning day on Wall Street.  The Dow came off this earlier high. It hit the highest point in the day  when Senator Al Franken said he was going to be resigning. It was up about  120 points. </p><p>But the Dow finished higher by 70 points. The S&amp;P 500 seven points,  snapping in the recent losing streak. The NASDAQ also gained. The winner  will be that Caterpillar, Visa, Nike, Boeing, and United Technologies. </p><p>For the week all three are still slightly lower. Also tomorrow is jobs  Friday. We'll watch for that with the estimates of roughly 200,000 4.1  percent. Maria Bartiromo love jobs in America especially here on Fox  Business so keep it right here on Fox Business. </p><p>Back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you much, Nicole. The Justice Department is now reading  through over 10,000 text between FBI investigator Peter Strzok and another  official. Initial text show anti-Trump bias but will the voters see them.  Will they see all of them. And will more shoes drop in the Mueller Russia  probe when it comes to bias. </p><p>A Justice Department official, another official involved in that probe now  demoted over bias allegations. We've got the details, next. Stay right  there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The attorney general needs to do his job and end this  witch hunt charade. We have a clear double standard. And you see in the  American people see it. Hillary Clinton is being investigated by her own  fan club before the 2016 election. And the only way you seem to get on  Mueller's team is to demonstrate a hatred for Donald Trump. </p><p>I think that the way Mueller built his team was finding people who had a  bias against the president and doing everything he could to include them in  this investigation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The time is now for Jeff Sessions to do his job, and if  he doesn't do his job, you know, he needs to step aside and let somebody  else do it. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  The Justice Department is now reading through over 10,000 texts  between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. Strzok is the FBI  official removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe over  alleged anti-Trump bias. </p><p>My next case is making the case that the Mueller investigation is  illegitimate and corrupt. Joining me now, attorney and Fox News  correspondent, Gregg Jarrett. Good to see you, Gregg. </p><p>GREGG JARRETT, ATTORNEY AND FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good to see you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Why do you say it's illegitimate and corrupt?</p><p>JARRETT:  Because Mueller is back to deck. This is a team of investigators  and lawyers that is rife with political prejudice and corrupt motives. And  you know, Peter Strzok is just the tip of the iceberg here. When the  inspector general report comes out I suspect it will be pretty damning  evidence of not just what Strzok did but others.</p><p>And that may include James Comey that they fix it deliberately for  political purposes that Hillary Clinton would be cleared so that it would  enable her to ascend to the presidency. And when that didn't happen they  set out to bring down the guy who won. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And they just demoted. The Justice Department official Peter  Strzok, right?</p><p>JARRETT:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  For bias, alleged bias, right?</p><p>JARRETT:  Look at the people that Mueller selected. Eight of the lawyers on  his team are democratic donors including one, Jeannie Rhee who actually  defended the Clinton Foundation into racketeering lawsuits. </p><p>The political opponent and the guy you are investigating. How could you  select Jeannie Rhee and Andrew Weissmann we now know was fawning all over  Sally Yates who defied the president. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Greg, democrats have been accusing President Trump of  attacking the institutions of our democracy. Let's roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think our democracy is under attack.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our institutions are under assault.</p><p>OBAMA:  Democracy itself is on the ballot right now. </p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, (D) FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This is  his final target, our democracy itself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But CNN's Chris Cuomo actually pointing out the hypocrisy over  what happened to Al Franken.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, HOST, CNN:  Democrats have been attacking Trump for attacking  democratic institutions. And now they're getting rid of Franken without due  process. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Due process, right, for Al Franken. I mean, some of  these...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JARRETT:  Franken was getting due process.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, some of these allegations -- some of these allegations  happened before he became a senator, right? But he wanted the investigation  to...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JARRETT:  He wanted an ethics investigation. And then the democratic  leadership went to him and said you got to leave and if you don't we'll  take you off every committee and get rid of you in other way. So, he quit.</p><p>Look, the clip you paid -- played are very revealing. They came from James  Clapper who lied to Congress. Eric Holder who was held in contempt of  Congress, and Hillary Clinton who likely violated the espionage actors.  Overwhelming evidence of it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So you're just saying that, you know, it's sort of like pot  calling the kettle black here, right?</p><p>JARRETT:  Yes. I mean, these are, you know democrats who have a political  agenda and animus for the president and they're lashing out. It's, you  know, it's politics. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. So, your forecast is that the inspector general report and  the Mueller probe is going to see more shoes to drop. </p><p>JARRETT:  Yes, but we can't wait for it early next year. I think you have  to have Jeff Sessions un- recuse himself for the sole purpose of firing the  entire Mueller staff plus Mueller and replace him with somebody who can be  fair and objective. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. The bombshell. Gregg Jarrett, thank you so much. We love  having you on. Come back soon.</p><p>JARRETT:  Sure.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Today marks the 76th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack.  The president now signing an action saying this is Pearl Harbor Remembrance  Day. Flags all around the country flying in half-staff today in honor of  the more than 2400 servicemen who were killed and the nearly 1200 wounded  in the surprise attack.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  December 7, 1941, a date which we'll live in infamy.  The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Next up, we have this story for you. Media pundits now  condemning President Trump for saying Jerusalem is the capital of Israel,  saying that the president broke 70 years of U.S. policy. But my next guest  he is an expert, he says the media pundits they've got it totally wrong. </p><p>He's former Israel elite Special Forces member. He is Aaron Cohen, he joins  me next. Stay right there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Whatever the outcome  of the negotiations, as stated in our democratic platform, Jerusalem is  still the capital of Israel, and must remain an undivided city accessible  to all.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  As soon as I take  office, I will begin the process of moving the United States ambassador to  the city of Israel as its capital. </p><p>OBAMA:  Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel and it must remain  undivided.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  President Trump followed through on his campaign promise. He  made Jerusalem; basically the United States will recognize Jerusalem as the  capital of Israel. It is the statement made by several past presidents. We  just showed you Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. As well as  democrat senators like Diane Feinstein have said the same thing. But the  media now condemning President Trump for the move, saying he broke 70 years  of U.S. policy. Roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On the other major news tonight. President Trump  reversing nearly 70 decades of U.S. policy, now recognizing Jerusalem as  Israel's capital.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He had promised this day would come, but to hear  these words from the White House was jaw-dropping. Not only signing a  proclamation reversing nearly 70 years of U.S. policy, but starting plans  to move the embassy to Jerusalem. No one else on earth has an embassy  there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The department is concern about any possible violent  reaction to President Trump's announcement today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The president here is making a risky bet that doing  something different will eventually end up productive for peace talks, but  he's about the only one making that bet.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Seven decades of U.S. policy changed in an instant. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Joining me now former Israel elite Special Forces member Aaron  Cohen. Good to see you, sir. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AARON COHEN, FORMER ISRAEL ELITE FORCES MEMBER:  Good to see you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Did President Trump reverse U.S. policy by acknowledging  Jerusalem as the capital of Israel?</p><p>COHEN:  If it's reversing U.S. policy, come again with that, sorry.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, did he reverse U.S. policy when he basically sign that  order?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COHEN:  No, I don't think so. I think this has nothing to do is reversing  any policy. Israel had a very strong standing policy with U.S. a very  strong standing relationship with Israel. It's been that way since Israel's  inception. And having a declaration it isn't changing anything in regards  to the U.S.'s ability to be able to continue to work with Israel working  with the peace for this.</p><p>No relationship between moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from tel Aviv.  There's no connection in terms of U.S. policy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  MSNBC's Chris Matthews wasted no time making doomsday  predictions. Let's roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST, MSNBC:  People are going to die now because of what  was said today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If we move that embassy to Jerusalem we could spark a  full on intifada and real people could die.</p><p>MATTHEWS:  I believe they will and I believe that's the horror. By the way,  deaths are coming now because of this. You can just bet in the next few  weeks we are going to help pay for this holy erratic decision by this  president.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  I mean, predictions like that they're just succeeding to  threats really. I mean, would they have this reaction in President Obama  had made this decision?</p><p>COHEN:  Probably not. Yes, not only the media hypocrisy coming, you know,  from the left regarding this move to Jerusalem. The fact is this. There  hasn't been peace in Israel; it went through Palestinians since the  Israel's inception. Israel is always had a very complicated security  apparatus. And again, I just don't think that there's any connection  between any increased violence and what we've seen in the last 70 years.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>COHEN:  There's no connections. It's absolutely ludicrous.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Aaron Cohen, you're going to stay right there. You'll be back  after the break. Next up, the president getting praise inside Israel for  his executive order in Jerusalem. But remember when the media accuse  President Trump of being anti-Semitic. We've got basically more discussion  about this coming up. Stay right there. Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The White House is now condemning the bomb threat.  This, after President Trump twice last week dance around questions about  anti-Semitism. The statement does not actually mentioned Jews, something  the White House was also criticized for after statement put out on  Holocaust Remembrance Day. </p><p>CUOMO:  He hasn't tweeted about this with the ordinary vigor that the  president usually brings the things he doesn't like. This is in no way  meant as a suggestion that the president is somehow OK with this. He's  never said anything like that. But it's what he doesn't say.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Why President Trump spoken out more vociferously  against the wave of anti-Semitism that we're seeing?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  You sort of hear between the lines there that the president was  being accused of being anti-Semitic. You sort of heard that, right. </p><p>The media taken back after President Trump, though, announced recognition  of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and that Tel Aviv would no longer  house the U.S. embassy removed to Jerusalem.</p><p>Back with me now, former Israeli elite Special Forces member, Aaron Cohen.  Did the media's anti-Semitic insinuations against Trump ever hold water?</p><p>COHEN:  No, they don't hold water. I think everybody who's listening to  these anti-Semitic claims knows to nod their head immediately. I mean,  calling Donald Trump anti-Semitic, especially as it pertains to Israel is  not only ludicrous. It's laughable. It's equivalent to calling Bibi  Netanyahu anti-Semitic was the prime minister of Israel.</p><p>The fact is, is that Israel as the presidents have stated four or five  incumbent presidents coming in have all stated that they are going to, you  know, claim Jerusalem as the capital and move the embassy to Jerusalem.  Trump did it. And so really what it shows is that he's able to stand on his  ground and he's committed to being part with this one. </p><p>I think this is what people don't really understand. The Trump's commitment  to Israel is a strategic decision as it relates to U.S. national security,  Liz, and I'll tell you why.</p><p>Israel shares intelligence with the Americans and Israel has the finest  intelligence agencies and apparatuses in the world. We have Jews who have  been kicked out by every Muslim country in the world and forced to move to  Israel, and therefore we can infiltrate those countries undetected and get  that human intelligence which Israel shares with the United States and  Trump understand that.</p><p>I don't think his concern with the anti-Sematic callouts.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>COHEN:  It's just not true. It's fable and just, you know, nonsense.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And the broader geopolitical point is that Israel is aligning  with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates against Iran and against  the Muslim Brotherhood, right?</p><p>COHEN:  Correct.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>COHEN:  And they are in these countries are Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood  are enemies who have sworn on the destruction of the U.S. and this western  values. So, all of those alignments are key to our national security.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>COHEN:  The only real bigotry that's going on here is the Arab world  against this little tiny nation surrounded by 20 Arab countries. The only  bigotry that is going on here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you, Aaron Cohen. Great to see you. We love having you  on. Come back soon. </p><p>COHEN:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  A big weakness in China's economy could threaten global growth.  It's China heavily indebted banks. Now the International Monetary Fund  recommended China's bank increase their capital buffers to protect against  any sudden economic downturn following a really inflated credit boom there. </p><p>It's the first looksee by the IMF into China's bank those seven years. The  IMF said its stress test show China's top four banks do have enough capital  but the nation's little guy, the smaller banks appear vulnerable. </p><p>Breaking up, breaking news. The republican operative tells Fox that -- FoxArizona Republican Representative Trent Frank -- Franks. Trent Franks is  expected to resign. </p><p>However, these are just reports so far, it is a fast-moving fluid  situation. This could possibly be. Again, this is an allegation their  charges. Reports coming in inappropriate behavior. That's not confirmed.  We're staying on top of this quick moving developing story for you.</p><p>Hollywood celebrities now evacuating homes in the Los Angeles area amid the  wildfire threat. Known liberal anti-Trump comic Chelsea Handler actually  blaming it on the president.</p><p>Meteorologist Joe Bastardi is here to give Chelsea Handler a science lesson  after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Numerous people in Los Angeles area, including celebrities  evacuating their homes amid the wildfires there. We have a liberal anti- Trump comic Chelsea Handler blaming it on the president. </p><p>Chelsea Handler tweeting out quote, \"Just evacuated my house. It's like  Donald Trump is setting the world of fire, literally and figuratively.\"  Handler tweeted yesterday. \"Stay safe, everyone. Dark times.\"</p><p>Let's get to Weatherbell.com meteorologist Joe Bastardi. Is that possible,  did Trump cause that fire to happen? I thought he was in Washington, D.C.</p><p>JOE BASTARDI, CHIEF FORECASTER, WEATHERBELL.COM:  Well, you know, any  comment I make will be portrayed as unsympathetic to the horrific situation  that's going on out there and I certainly don't want to appear that way. </p><p>But let's set the record straight. First of all, there was supposed to be a  permanent drought out in California, that's what we heard two or three  years ago. When that drought reversed last winter with the tremendous  rains, that proved that it wasn't a permanent drought. It was a temporary  drought, I guess. </p><p>But it also led to something that made by company, maybe Ms. Handler would  subscribe to our company. She would have known what was going to go on back  in the spring. </p><p>My company said that this means a big wildfire season is likely on the way.  Now why is that? Because when you have extra heavy rains in California  during the winter months it means there's going to be more vegetation. That  vegetation of course is going to dry out during the summer because the  summers are dry out there and what does that mean. There's more fuel for  these fires.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>BASTARDI:  In addition, there are many, many more people, Liz, living out  in California now than there were, let's say in the 1950s, so we have many  more people in harms, they build houses, great houses and that's fine, but  there is a high risk of this type of thing happening in getting out of  control in populated areas now because we more populated areas.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Chelsea Handler is just making a bad joke there. You  say it's possible though that these fires were started by human beings. How  so?</p><p>BASTARDI:  Well, you have to wonder sometimes whether -- I can't say this,  they have to investigate how these fires started whether it was arson,  whether it was by mistake. Someone was camping out or, you know, there was  a short-circuit in a transmission box. </p><p>You know, all these things are possible and certainly, I mean, there were  no thunderstorms around. I don't think to set these fires off. So the folks  that do that type of work will determine that. Now it's very warm and hot  out there in the West Coast. It's been hot out there in the West Coast and  that happens quite often when it does get very cold in the east. </p><p>One of the things we've been preaching since October is that December was  going to be cold and snowy in the eastern part of the United States and  Europe about to see that happen and this correlates quite often. So when  you have the dryness in the west and the heat in the west a lot of times  the cold air comes into the eastern part of the United States. And don't be  surprises someone blames him if he tries to snow in New Orleans and it  might try to snow as far south as New Orleans tomorrow afternoon or  tomorrow night. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow.</p><p>BASTARDI:  Someone to blame global warming or Donald Trump on that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Joe Bastardi, we love having you on. Come back soon, sir.</p><p>BASTARDI:  Well, thank you for having me.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Sure. Firefighters are breathing life-threatening conditions as  the Southern California wildfire hit the Los Angeles area.</p><p>Fox News Adam Housley is on the ground. Adam?</p><p>ADAM HOUSLEY, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Yes. Liz, right now we're in  front of the Thomas fires started Monday night, about 30 miles from where  I'm standing over near town called Santa Paula. And you're going to see how  airdrop here in a second here bringing in water.</p><p>This is one of the fingers of the fire, one of the front edges of the fire  heading towards the town called Carpenteria. It's actually a neighboring  Santa Barbara County; it's how far this fire has burned. And they're really  trying to knock it down right now. There's not a lot of wind but the air  quality is miserable as you can tell as I'm wearing a mask.</p><p>I'm going to step away. This is front edge right here. The helicopter is  going to come in here in a second you'll see it. There's hand crews up here  in very steep commissions and terrain. It's very dry right now but they're  getting a huge break from Mother Nature. </p><p>There is literally no wind here and there was supposed to be wind gust  today 30 to 40 miles an hour. We haven't seen wind gust at all, it's  completely calm, completely still which is allowing helicopters to get in  as well. They only can help campers how to battle when it's windy, it's  battling to safety and being able to fly in that.  </p><p>But also, when they drop the waters, it's likes spitting into the wind. In  this case it's not like that. You can see very little air movement which  really allows them to get them. What you're going to see them drop right  here in the front edge and you'll see the smoke go up as it knocks it down.</p><p>They really been hammering this area now for the last hour, is on  opportunity to stop this blanket the fire. Another point nearby burned down  right to the ocean and of course, that stopped it. There they goes right  there, you see how close they get in and basically knock the entire  flameout right there. A little bit left. He'll come back in here about  every three or two to three minutes he turns around and comes back.</p><p>But they're doing a great job in right now knocking this down. And Liz, as  you can tell it's quite a firefighters here in Southern California and you  see the red flag alert will continue into Saturday. </p><p>Back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Great report. Adam, stay safe there, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p>HOUSLEY:  We'll do.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That was terrific reporting. Thank you.</p><p>Let's get to this story. Bitcoin continuing its meteoric rise today. Early  investors the Winklevoss twins, a Facebook fame becoming Bitcoin  billionaires. </p><p>Now many Americans are thinking you know what? It could be their lottery  ticket too.</p><p>Next, our panel, managing money management on what to watch out for and  whether it's too late to get in there, after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news. The majority of the Senate voting to pass the  temporary two week spending measure that the House just passed all to avoid  a government shutdown tomorrow night. Voting continues both republican and  democrat leaders met at the White House today to discuss an agreement to  fund the federal government.</p><p>It's called the continuing resolution. It simply renews all existing money  for all government programs through midnight on December 22nd.</p><p>The price of Bitcoin swinging wildly today, rising to more than 19,000 only  to fall sharply within minutes, still at a new highs surpassing 17,000. The  frenzy surrounding this virtual currently escalating just days before it  start trading on a major U.S. exchange. </p><p>In recent months this crypto currency has undergone a staggering increase  in value surging from about 3500 in mid-September to its current price. Now  for its perspective the Bitcoin is worth about eight times now as gold as  the market cap higher than IBM, McDonald's or Disney. It's five times more  expensive than the .com stocks were at the height of the internet mania.</p><p>Let's bring in the money managers, the go to guys on Wall Street, Jonathan  Hoenig and Jason Rotman join me now.</p><p>Jonathan, without getting into the weeds can you explain to -- Bitcoin to  people?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOUNDING MEMBER, CAPITALIST PIG ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Yes,  it's a bubble. I mean, that's what this is at, E-Mac. This is a bubble. The  price of Bitcoin has doubled in just the last two weeks alone. But because  of the bubble, Liz, doesn't mean that the price can't continue to go up. I  think back when you talk about some of the .com stocks thing, one of the  '96, '97, '98, and then in '99 they went up another 100 percent.</p><p>So this doesn't matter what the technology is, what the assets are. The  hunt is on for Bitcoin and as long as the price continues to climb I think  buyers continue to show up especially since futures, as you mention,  launching this weekend. </p><p>This is a bubble with no sign of turning around.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. You know, to Jonathan's point, Jason, do you -- would you  get into it now or would you short it, what's your advice?</p><p>JASON ROTMAN, MANAGING PARTNER, LIDO ISLE ADVISORS:  I would do neither. I  would actually look at the other coins and other businesses in the block  chain space that are much cheaper that have much bigger upside that do much  more than just Bitcoin. Bitcoin is just money.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Like what?</p><p>ROTMAN:  There's other companies. Gosh, I mean, ethereum is kind of the  second one to Bitcoin from a market cap standpoint. Ethereum is a whole  platform there's another Chinese ethereum called nil. I think all these  different companies have a much bigger future because they are the backbone  of the whole decentralized economy. </p><p>Bitcoin is just money and I would not buy it up here especially.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, no store of value. Jonathan, what's going to cause this  bubble to burst?</p><p>HOENIG:  Well, you know, what's going to cause the bubble and the globe.com  to burst. I mean, we don't know, Liz. That was, you know, a big tech of  bigger play 20 years ago. Let's just emphasize, though, Bitcoin is not a  currency. It is not a medium of exchange. It's not a store value. It's a  speculation.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>HOENIG:  And you know what this bull mark can continue to keep going but I  wouldn't put my retirement fund there both in $20,000 coins.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Both of you think -- both of you think Bitcoin is a bubble  in search of a pen. Jonathan and Jason, you both are great one. We want to  have you back on soon. Thanks so much to you guys.</p><p>ROTMAN:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p>HOENIG:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We will be right back. Stay right there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, it looks like there will not be a Christmas government  shut down. The Senate voting to pass too temporary two week spending  measures the House passed it as well, all to avoid that government shut  down tomorrow night. The voting does continue.</p><p>We're staying on that story for you. We're simply with news all existing  programs money for them through midnight on December 22nd.</p><p>Thanks so much for having us in your homes. Charles Payne is here now with  Making Money.

But quote, \"In coming weeks\" as he  strongly defends himself against allegations of sexual misconduct. This is  bare-knuckle political hardball. The push is now on for a democrat Senate  majority to upend the Trump agenda. We have the details.</p><p>Also the House is passing a two week spending bill to avoid a government  shutdown tomorrow night. This continuing resolution simply renews all  existing programs for -- through basically the stroke of midnight December  22nd. We're on that story for you. </p><p>And Bitcoin crossing the 19,000 threshold for the very first time today.  This crypto currency is in a staggering dizzying ascend surging from about  3500 in mid-September to its current price.</p><p>Did you miss the chance to get in on the action or to short Bitcoin? We're  going to let you know. We have an all-star guest line-up including the co- authors of the new bestseller \"Let Trump be Trump,\" they are David Bossie  and Corey Lewandowski, also attorney Gregg Jarrett on the Mueller probe,  and Fox News host Steve Hilton on the fight between Trump and Britain's  Theresa May, all here all tonight.</p><p>I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. Risk and Reward starts right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL FRANKEN, (D) UNITED STATES SENATOR:  We were finally beginning to listen  to women about the ways in which men's actions affect them. I was excited  for that conversation. Then the conversation turned to me. Some of the  allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember very  differently. </p><p>I have used my power to be a champion of women. Nothing I have done as a  senator, nothing has brought this honor on this institution. Nevertheless,  today, I am announcing that in the coming weeks I will be resigning as a  member of the United States Senate. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  He struck a defiant tone on the floor of the Senate. Senator Al  Franken defended himself before announcing he will step down but with the  caveat in coming weeks. That's what the Washington, D.C. echo chamber into  overdrive that Al Franken may be trying to buy time to get a new lifeline  out of the outcome of the Roy Moore Alabama Senate race.</p><p>This, after eight women now accuse Al Franken of touching them  inappropriately. More than three dozen Senate democrats call for Al  Franken's resignation, including Charles Schumer, Bernie Sanders, and Diane  Feinstein. Al Franken is the second lawmaker to depart over sexual  misconduct allegations in the last week after John Conyers said he would  require. </p><p>The push is now on in the Senate for the democrats to seize control. And  here's the math if democrats win the seats from retiring Senators Blake and  Corker and there is a Roy Moore Senate loss that will put the democrats up  51-49. </p><p>Let's bring in the co-authors of \"Let Trump be Trump: The Inside Story of  His Rise to the Presidency\" David Bossie and Corey Lewandowski join me now.  Good to see you, guys. First, what do you think of Al Franken resigning,  first to you, Corey. </p><p>COREY LEWANDOWSKI, CO-AUTHOR, LET TRUMP BE TRUMP:  Look, I'd love to hear  the definitive date that Al Franken is actually to walk away from the U.S.  Senate because in Washington, D.C., Liz, I think you're exactly right. He  says he's going to do it sometime in the future. The uproar goes away and  Al Franken still sitting in the U.S. Senate a week, a month or a year from  now because nobody is going to force him out. </p><p>More than 75 percent of his own democratic caucus has asked for him to  resign. He's made the statement let's get the definitive date when he's  going to leave. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, David, the republicans now have Roy Moore problem.  The democrats, David, are trying to rebrand themselves as a party above  moral reproach. But you know, none have given back the Harvey Weinstein  donations. And only one, Kirsten Gillibrand barely criticizes Bill Clinton.</p><p>Go ahead, David.</p><p>DAVID BOSSIE, CO-AUTHOR, LET TRUMP BE TRUMP:  Yes. You know, I think that  we are going to have to have this conversation continuously over the next,  you know, coming weeks and months. You know, I think that when Alabama  voters decide next week then the Senate will get to decide if they want to  take action through the ethics committee on then-Senator Moore if he's  elected.</p><p>So, we'll see. Look, this is not going away. It's not a conversation that  should go away. You know, the members of the media, members of the  political class, you know, need to be held to account. And whether you're  in Hollywood, New York, Washington, you know, I am glad that this  conversation is happening.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Especially with that slush fund paying off sexual harassment  cases and more. Let's get back to Franken. Corey, Al Franken is saying  while in office he has used his power against women. Let's roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANKEN:  You know, an important part of the conversation we've been having  in the last few months has been about how men abuse their power and  privilege to hurt women. I am proud that during my time in the Senate I  have used my power to be a champion of women. I know there's been a very  different picture of me painted over the last few weeks but I know who I  really am. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right, guys. OK, of course, Al Franken will say that. He  has already made similar statements. He also took a shot of President Trump  and Roy Moore. But you know, you talked in your book about the Access  Hollywood tape, Corey. What was -- we want to know, what was the first  lady's reaction to that and the first family, the president's daughters,  what was their reaction to the Access Hollywood tape?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  You know, Melania Trump said that she knows her husband and  this was locker room talk. It was boy talk is what she said. And she stood  by her husband. She was very clear. And the president has said that he  never did those things, which is very different than what Senator Franken  has said. </p><p>Senator Franken has now admitted that he has done some of the things he has  been accused of, some of those women have come forward and said that he did  this while he was the United States senator. We have a picture of him  groping a woman's breast while she's asleep on an airplane. </p><p>Look, where I come from there is something called street justice. If you  were to do that where I come there would be a very different resolution and  potentially going to the Senate ethics committee to determine if this was  right or wrong. </p><p>It is uncalled for, it's egregious and Senator Franken should step down  immediately and not some arbitrary date in the future where he hasn't told  us when he is going to leave.</p><p>MACDONALD:  David, speak about the 16 women who have accused President  Trump in misconduct. Go ahead.</p><p>BOSSIE:  Well, it is exactly what Corey said, which is one is -- one is  locker room talk. One is, you know, guys talking among themselves whether  you like it or not we all know what happens and that's what the president  acknowledge. </p><p>But there is a difference between photographic evidence like in Al  Franken's case or in these congressional race -- congressional cases where  they use taxpayer dollars to pay the women off. So, we know there is  evidence in those cases.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>BOSSIE:  Here there is just a big difference between the two. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I want to get to FBI director Christopher Wray defending the  FBI after President Trump's criticism as the president -- excuse me --  Representative Jim Jordan really pushed card on the Robert Mueller Russia  probe calling for a second special counsel to look into the FISA warrant  and how they came about to basically spy on Trump campaign aides. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM JORDAN, (R) UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE:  Peter Strzok, Mr. Super- agent at the FBI, I think he's the guy who took the application to the FISA  court. And if that happened, I mean, think, if this happened if you have  the FBI working with a campaign, the democrats campaign taken opposition  research dressing it all up and turn it into an intelligence document and  taking it to the FISA court so they can spy on the other campaign, if that  happened that is as wrong as it gets.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. You guys were on the campaign, tell us what was  going on behind the scenes of the campaign. Did you, Corey, did you -- did  you know anybody or anyone else connected to the Trump campaign who is  working with the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's campaign. </p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Never. And let me say this. I sat next to candidate Trump for  18 months, 18 hours a day seven days a week. Never was the collusion,  cooperation or coordination with Russia in any way shape or form. </p><p>And what I have said very publicly and I stand by. If anybody attempted to  or did manipulate the outcome of this election for a foreign government  that person should go to jail for the rest of their life. And that would  include FBI agents who potentially used their power in the deep state to  manipulate government agencies like in court to list -- enlist FISA warrant  or to change rules and regulations as it relate to Hillary Clinton  investigation. </p><p>I am gravely concerned about this agent. And right now all we know is that  he's been demoted to the human resources department which I think is still  circumspect at best.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, we're staying on the story here on this show. The Trump  empires real estate dealings, David, with Russians and money laundering is  now into the microscope. Have you ever heard anything about that any  Russians were using shell companies or real estate dealings with the Trump  empire.</p><p>BOSSIE:  You know, we got these questions about our book. Why we didn't  talk about Russia in the book. And the reality is because there was nothing  to it. You know, we just look at this case and say it was based on this  collusion accusation. And this investigation has been going on a year and a  half now. Eighteen months of an investigation. Not a scintilla of evidence  that there's been any collusion or cooperation between the Russians and our  campaign. </p><p>And let me just say, we acknowledged that the Russians were trying to  impact both campaigns and we disagree with that. We want them to never do  that again. We want American campaigns to be stood up so that they can't be  impacted again. And so we'd like to see that happen. </p><p>But there was no evidence of collusion. And that's why this case really has  gone nowhere except Paul Manafort and Rick Gates in what they did before  joining the campaign, and Mike Flynn and Papadopoulos about a lie they told  to the FBI. Again, nothing to do with collusion of the Trump campaign. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Let's move on. Now, you know, the press is on. The full  court press is on with Senate democrats to seize back control and get a  majority in the Senate. </p><p>The Dow powering forward on optimism about the Trump agenda and tax reform.  Look at this. It only took 32 trading days for the Dow to rise and 22,000  to the 23,000 mark. It was only seven days ago that the blue chip average  finished above 24,000 for the very first time.</p><p>We're now in the fifth 1,000 milestone in 2017 for the Dow, the most ever  in a calendar year. And the six 1,000-point milestone since Election Day. </p><p>But former President Obama is crediting himself for the strong economy  saying the thank should go to him. Watch the fast fall that President Obama  tried to whip by you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  As we took these  actions we saw the U.S. economy were all consistent, we saw the longest  stream of job creation in American history by far. The streak have stock  continues by the way. Thanks, Obama.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Did you catch the nuance of what Obama said, the quote,  \"longest winning streak.\" Obama is talking about back to back monthly job  creation 75 months straight versus Reagan at 48. But when you talk about  the actual number of jobs created Obama ranks down there with Jimmy Carter.  Reagan created more than 16 million, Clinton nearly 23 million. About 11  million for President Obama and 10 million for Carter. </p><p>I mean, Corey, every president can argue they inherited the recession going  back to FDR. That's what Obama is arguing. What do you make of those  numbers and what Obama is saying that he's the go to guy for the strength  in the economy.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Well, you know, Liz. It's amazing. This is the 12 year  presidency because for the first four years of the Obama administration all  he did was blame Bush for the terrible economy that he inherited. And now  for the year after this administration he's tried to take credit for what  Trump has done. </p><p>Look, Donald Trump has helped to add 5 trillion almost $6 million of market  cap to the economy right now. We have the lowest unemployment since 1973.  We have the highest home ownership in two generations. What we see is the  stock market is going like crazy. We're at 3.3 percent growth under the  Obama years.</p><p>Look, these are the governments numbers, 1.2 and 1.3 percent GDP. He  doubled our national deficit in eight years. From eight -- from eight to 16  and then from 10 to $20 trillion. The only thing he gets credit for is that  Donald Trump came in to save the economy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And facts are he created a record number of basic government  jobs, a lot of government jobs, a lot of minimum wage jobs that you can't  raise a family on. Those are the facts. You can check the government data  on that.</p><p>I want to get to the story first. Let me get back for a second to your new  tell-all book \"Let Trump Be Trump.\" David, you -- David and Corey, you  detailed how ABC News top producer Chris Vlasto gave you, David, as Trump  then-deputy campaign manager proprietary exit polling in election night.  Those numbers are usually only shared with the Associated Press and the  major TV networks and not to outsiders. </p><p>I mean, ABC I think you reported this, has now reprimanded the producer for  that. How did this go down, I mean, how did you get involved in that. Did  you feel badly about being involved in that?</p><p>BOSSIE:  Well, I didn't feel badly about being involved in it. Look,  reporters and political operatives all across the country in both parties  trade information all the time. And it is just part of the business. And so  I traded information with reporters for 30 years now. </p><p>And so I got that data and it was just -- it ended up being bad exit poll  data. It's really what it ended up being. So, we took about half an hour to  digest it and figure it out that it was bad exit poll data. We got it at 5,  by about 5.35 we had figured out that we're not in as bad a shape as it  looked like because the exit polls were wrong. </p><p>And Donald Trump ended up winning this massive landslide all across the  country winning states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, and Wisconsin.  States we weren't supposed to win. North Carolina and Florida by bug  numbers that they did not expect the Clintons, you know -- when they got  that same data, I might add, you know, they were celebrating and popping  champagne corks a little early. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Interesting. You know, you guys, you've worked with news  operations with the TV networks for some time. We broke this -- we reported  on the story about ABC News investigative divisions still reeling from the  suspension of chief investigative correspondent Brian Ross. </p><p>The Dow dropped, Corey, 350 points by his wrong report about General Flynn  and Trump. What has been your experience and can you tell you what has been  like to deal with the various networks in the integrity and credibility of  each of them. </p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Look, I think there are some good people who work at the  networks. But unfortunately, we're now in a cycle where reporters want to  make the news and not report the news. We saw this from Brian Ross, he put  out a false narrative. The Dow Jones falls 350 points.</p><p>ABC first has those in mistake. Now they've suspended him. They should fire  this person for what he did. How many people lost money because of this  false report? Look in just this week. We saw a report out that the Mueller  investigative team has subpoenaed records at Deutsche bank. That story was  pervasive across the networks only to be retracted in six hours later as a  complete facade.</p><p>The news media has no liability. Unfortunately, the networks go and say  whatever they want and their apology effort is not enough to the American  people. And that's why Donald Trump -- and we talked about this in the book  a lot -- coined the phrase \"fake news.\" </p><p>The American people are smart, they look through it and 97 percent of the  people after election they say they didn't allow the media's bias to change  their voting habits this election cycle.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. David and Corey, it's so good to see you, guys. Be  sure to buy their best-selling book \"Let Trump Be Trump.\" We love having  you on. We look forward to both of you coming back on again soon. It's a  great book, go buy it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Any time. Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's check your money markets closing up 70 points today. Our  own Nicole Petallides is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with  the latest. Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  A winning day on Wall Street.  The Dow came off this earlier high. It hit the highest point in the day  when Senator Al Franken said he was going to be resigning. It was up about  120 points. </p><p>But the Dow finished higher by 70 points. The S&amp;P 500 seven points,  snapping in the recent losing streak. The NASDAQ also gained. The winner  will be that Caterpillar, Visa, Nike, Boeing, and United Technologies. </p><p>For the week all three are still slightly lower. Also tomorrow is jobs  Friday. We'll watch for that with the estimates of roughly 200,000 4.1  percent. Maria Bartiromo love jobs in America especially here on Fox  Business so keep it right here on Fox Business. </p><p>Back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you much, Nicole. The Justice Department is now reading  through over 10,000 text between FBI investigator Peter Strzok and another  official. Initial text show anti-Trump bias but will the voters see them.  Will they see all of them. And will more shoes drop in the Mueller Russia  probe when it comes to bias. </p><p>A Justice Department official, another official involved in that probe now  demoted over bias allegations. We've got the details, next. Stay right  there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The attorney general needs to do his job and end this  witch hunt charade. We have a clear double standard. And you see in the  American people see it. Hillary Clinton is being investigated by her own  fan club before the 2016 election. And the only way you seem to get on  Mueller's team is to demonstrate a hatred for Donald Trump. </p><p>I think that the way Mueller built his team was finding people who had a  bias against the president and doing everything he could to include them in  this investigation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The time is now for Jeff Sessions to do his job, and if  he doesn't do his job, you know, he needs to step aside and let somebody  else do it. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  The Justice Department is now reading through over 10,000 texts  between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. Strzok is the FBI  official removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe over  alleged anti-Trump bias. </p><p>My next case is making the case that the Mueller investigation is  illegitimate and corrupt. Joining me now, attorney and Fox News  correspondent, Gregg Jarrett. Good to see you, Gregg. </p><p>GREGG JARRETT, ATTORNEY AND FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good to see you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Why do you say it's illegitimate and corrupt?</p><p>JARRETT:  Because Mueller is back to deck. This is a team of investigators  and lawyers that is rife with political prejudice and corrupt motives. And  you know, Peter Strzok is just the tip of the iceberg here. When the  inspector general report comes out I suspect it will be pretty damning  evidence of not just what Strzok did but others.</p><p>And that may include James Comey that they fix it deliberately for  political purposes that Hillary Clinton would be cleared so that it would  enable her to ascend to the presidency. And when that didn't happen they  set out to bring down the guy who won. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And they just demoted. The Justice Department official Peter  Strzok, right?</p><p>JARRETT:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  For bias, alleged bias, right?</p><p>JARRETT:  Look at the people that Mueller selected. Eight of the lawyers on  his team are democratic donors including one, Jeannie Rhee who actually  defended the Clinton Foundation into racketeering lawsuits. </p><p>The political opponent and the guy you are investigating. How could you  select Jeannie Rhee and Andrew Weissmann we now know was fawning all over  Sally Yates who defied the president. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Greg, democrats have been accusing President Trump of  attacking the institutions of our democracy. Let's roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think our democracy is under attack.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our institutions are under assault.</p><p>OBAMA:  Democracy itself is on the ballot right now. </p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, (D) FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This is  his final target, our democracy itself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But CNN's Chris Cuomo actually pointing out the hypocrisy over  what happened to Al Franken.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, HOST, CNN:  Democrats have been attacking Trump for attacking  democratic institutions. And now they're getting rid of Franken without due  process. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Due process, right, for Al Franken. I mean, some of  these...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JARRETT:  Franken was getting due process.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, some of these allegations -- some of these allegations  happened before he became a senator, right? But he wanted the investigation  to...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JARRETT:  He wanted an ethics investigation. And then the democratic  leadership went to him and said you got to leave and if you don't we'll  take you off every committee and get rid of you in other way. So, he quit.</p><p>Look, the clip you paid -- played are very revealing. They came from James  Clapper who lied to Congress. Eric Holder who was held in contempt of  Congress, and Hillary Clinton who likely violated the espionage actors.  Overwhelming evidence of it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So you're just saying that, you know, it's sort of like pot  calling the kettle black here, right?</p><p>JARRETT:  Yes. I mean, these are, you know democrats who have a political  agenda and animus for the president and they're lashing out. It's, you  know, it's politics. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. So, your forecast is that the inspector general report and  the Mueller probe is going to see more shoes to drop. </p><p>JARRETT:  Yes, but we can't wait for it early next year. I think you have  to have Jeff Sessions un- recuse himself for the sole purpose of firing the  entire Mueller staff plus Mueller and replace him with somebody who can be  fair and objective. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. The bombshell. Gregg Jarrett, thank you so much. We love  having you on. Come back soon.</p><p>JARRETT:  Sure.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Today marks the 76th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack.  The president now signing an action saying this is Pearl Harbor Remembrance  Day. Flags all around the country flying in half-staff today in honor of  the more than 2400 servicemen who were killed and the nearly 1200 wounded  in the surprise attack.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  December 7, 1941, a date which we'll live in infamy.  The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Next up, we have this story for you. Media pundits now  condemning President Trump for saying Jerusalem is the capital of Israel,  saying that the president broke 70 years of U.S. policy. But my next guest  he is an expert, he says the media pundits they've got it totally wrong. </p><p>He's former Israel elite Special Forces member. He is Aaron Cohen, he joins  me next. Stay right there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Whatever the outcome  of the negotiations, as stated in our democratic platform, Jerusalem is  still the capital of Israel, and must remain an undivided city accessible  to all.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  As soon as I take  office, I will begin the process of moving the United States ambassador to  the city of Israel as its capital. </p><p>OBAMA:  Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel and it must remain  undivided.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  President Trump followed through on his campaign promise. He  made Jerusalem; basically the United States will recognize Jerusalem as the  capital of Israel. It is the statement made by several past presidents. We  just showed you Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. As well as  democrat senators like Diane Feinstein have said the same thing. But the  media now condemning President Trump for the move, saying he broke 70 years  of U.S. policy. Roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On the other major news tonight. President Trump  reversing nearly 70 decades of U.S. policy, now recognizing Jerusalem as  Israel's capital.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He had promised this day would come, but to hear  these words from the White House was jaw-dropping. Not only signing a  proclamation reversing nearly 70 years of U.S. policy, but starting plans  to move the embassy to Jerusalem. No one else on earth has an embassy  there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The department is concern about any possible violent  reaction to President Trump's announcement today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The president here is making a risky bet that doing  something different will eventually end up productive for peace talks, but  he's about the only one making that bet.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Seven decades of U.S. policy changed in an instant. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Joining me now former Israel elite Special Forces member Aaron  Cohen. Good to see you, sir. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AARON COHEN, FORMER ISRAEL ELITE FORCES MEMBER:  Good to see you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Did President Trump reverse U.S. policy by acknowledging  Jerusalem as the capital of Israel?</p><p>COHEN:  If it's reversing U.S. policy, come again with that, sorry.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, did he reverse U.S. policy when he basically sign that  order?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COHEN:  No, I don't think so. I think this has nothing to do is reversing  any policy. Israel had a very strong standing policy with U.S. a very  strong standing relationship with Israel. It's been that way since Israel's  inception. And having a declaration it isn't changing anything in regards  to the U.S.'s ability to be able to continue to work with Israel working  with the peace for this.</p><p>No relationship between moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from tel Aviv.  There's no connection in terms of U.S. policy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  MSNBC's Chris Matthews wasted no time making doomsday  predictions. Let's roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST, MSNBC:  People are going to die now because of what  was said today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If we move that embassy to Jerusalem we could spark a  full on intifada and real people could die.</p><p>MATTHEWS:  I believe they will and I believe that's the horror. By the way,  deaths are coming now because of this. You can just bet in the next few  weeks we are going to help pay for this holy erratic decision by this  president.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  I mean, predictions like that they're just succeeding to  threats really. I mean, would they have this reaction in President Obama  had made this decision?</p><p>COHEN:  Probably not. Yes, not only the media hypocrisy coming, you know,  from the left regarding this move to Jerusalem. The fact is this. There  hasn't been peace in Israel; it went through Palestinians since the  Israel's inception. Israel is always had a very complicated security  apparatus. And again, I just don't think that there's any connection  between any increased violence and what we've seen in the last 70 years.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>COHEN:  There's no connections. It's absolutely ludicrous.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Aaron Cohen, you're going to stay right there. You'll be back  after the break. Next up, the president getting praise inside Israel for  his executive order in Jerusalem. But remember when the media accuse  President Trump of being anti-Semitic. We've got basically more discussion  about this coming up. Stay right there. Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The White House is now condemning the bomb threat.  This, after President Trump twice last week dance around questions about  anti-Semitism. The statement does not actually mentioned Jews, something  the White House was also criticized for after statement put out on  Holocaust Remembrance Day. </p><p>CUOMO:  He hasn't tweeted about this with the ordinary vigor that the  president usually brings the things he doesn't like. This is in no way  meant as a suggestion that the president is somehow OK with this. He's  never said anything like that. But it's what he doesn't say.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Why President Trump spoken out more vociferously  against the wave of anti-Semitism that we're seeing?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  You sort of hear between the lines there that the president was  being accused of being anti-Semitic. You sort of heard that, right. </p><p>The media taken back after President Trump, though, announced recognition  of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and that Tel Aviv would no longer  house the U.S. embassy removed to Jerusalem.</p><p>Back with me now, former Israeli elite Special Forces member, Aaron Cohen.  Did the media's anti-Semitic insinuations against Trump ever hold water?</p><p>COHEN:  No, they don't hold water. I think everybody who's listening to  these anti-Semitic claims knows to nod their head immediately. I mean,  calling Donald Trump anti-Semitic, especially as it pertains to Israel is  not only ludicrous. It's laughable. It's equivalent to calling Bibi  Netanyahu anti-Semitic was the prime minister of Israel.</p><p>The fact is, is that Israel as the presidents have stated four or five  incumbent presidents coming in have all stated that they are going to, you  know, claim Jerusalem as the capital and move the embassy to Jerusalem.  Trump did it. And so really what it shows is that he's able to stand on his  ground and he's committed to being part with this one. </p><p>I think this is what people don't really understand. The Trump's commitment  to Israel is a strategic decision as it relates to U.S. national security,  Liz, and I'll tell you why.</p><p>Israel shares intelligence with the Americans and Israel has the finest  intelligence agencies and apparatuses in the world. We have Jews who have  been kicked out by every Muslim country in the world and forced to move to  Israel, and therefore we can infiltrate those countries undetected and get  that human intelligence which Israel shares with the United States and  Trump understand that.</p><p>I don't think his concern with the anti-Sematic callouts.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>COHEN:  It's just not true. It's fable and just, you know, nonsense.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And the broader geopolitical point is that Israel is aligning  with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates against Iran and against  the Muslim Brotherhood, right?</p><p>COHEN:  Correct.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>COHEN:  And they are in these countries are Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood  are enemies who have sworn on the destruction of the U.S. and this western  values. So, all of those alignments are key to our national security.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>COHEN:  The only real bigotry that's going on here is the Arab world  against this little tiny nation surrounded by 20 Arab countries. The only  bigotry that is going on here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you, Aaron Cohen. Great to see you. We love having you  on. Come back soon. </p><p>COHEN:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  A big weakness in China's economy could threaten global growth.  It's China heavily indebted banks. Now the International Monetary Fund  recommended China's bank increase their capital buffers to protect against  any sudden economic downturn following a really inflated credit boom there. </p><p>It's the first looksee by the IMF into China's bank those seven years. The  IMF said its stress test show China's top four banks do have enough capital  but the nation's little guy, the smaller banks appear vulnerable. </p><p>Breaking up, breaking news. The republican operative tells Fox that -- FoxArizona Republican Representative Trent Frank -- Franks. Trent Franks is  expected to resign. </p><p>However, these are just reports so far, it is a fast-moving fluid  situation. This could possibly be. Again, this is an allegation their  charges. Reports coming in inappropriate behavior. That's not confirmed.  We're staying on top of this quick moving developing story for you.</p><p>Hollywood celebrities now evacuating homes in the Los Angeles area amid the  wildfire threat. Known liberal anti-Trump comic Chelsea Handler actually  blaming it on the president.</p><p>Meteorologist Joe Bastardi is here to give Chelsea Handler a science lesson  after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Numerous people in Los Angeles area, including celebrities  evacuating their homes amid the wildfires there. We have a liberal anti- Trump comic Chelsea Handler blaming it on the president. </p><p>Chelsea Handler tweeting out quote, \"Just evacuated my house. It's like  Donald Trump is setting the world of fire, literally and figuratively.\"  Handler tweeted yesterday. \"Stay safe, everyone. Dark times.\"</p><p>Let's get to Weatherbell.com meteorologist Joe Bastardi. Is that possible,  did Trump cause that fire to happen? I thought he was in Washington, D.C.</p><p>JOE BASTARDI, CHIEF FORECASTER, WEATHERBELL.COM:  Well, you know, any  comment I make will be portrayed as unsympathetic to the horrific situation  that's going on out there and I certainly don't want to appear that way. </p><p>But let's set the record straight. First of all, there was supposed to be a  permanent drought out in California, that's what we heard two or three  years ago. When that drought reversed last winter with the tremendous  rains, that proved that it wasn't a permanent drought. It was a temporary  drought, I guess. </p><p>But it also led to something that made by company, maybe Ms. Handler would  subscribe to our company. She would have known what was going to go on back  in the spring. </p><p>My company said that this means a big wildfire season is likely on the way.  Now why is that? Because when you have extra heavy rains in California  during the winter months it means there's going to be more vegetation. That  vegetation of course is going to dry out during the summer because the  summers are dry out there and what does that mean. There's more fuel for  these fires.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>BASTARDI:  In addition, there are many, many more people, Liz, living out  in California now than there were, let's say in the 1950s, so we have many  more people in harms, they build houses, great houses and that's fine, but  there is a high risk of this type of thing happening in getting out of  control in populated areas now because we more populated areas.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Chelsea Handler is just making a bad joke there. You  say it's possible though that these fires were started by human beings. How  so?</p><p>BASTARDI:  Well, you have to wonder sometimes whether -- I can't say this,  they have to investigate how these fires started whether it was arson,  whether it was by mistake. Someone was camping out or, you know, there was  a short-circuit in a transmission box. </p><p>You know, all these things are possible and certainly, I mean, there were  no thunderstorms around. I don't think to set these fires off. So the folks  that do that type of work will determine that. Now it's very warm and hot  out there in the West Coast. It's been hot out there in the West Coast and  that happens quite often when it does get very cold in the east. </p><p>One of the things we've been preaching since October is that December was  going to be cold and snowy in the eastern part of the United States and  Europe about to see that happen and this correlates quite often. So when  you have the dryness in the west and the heat in the west a lot of times  the cold air comes into the eastern part of the United States. And don't be  surprises someone blames him if he tries to snow in New Orleans and it  might try to snow as far south as New Orleans tomorrow afternoon or  tomorrow night. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow.</p><p>BASTARDI:  Someone to blame global warming or Donald Trump on that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Joe Bastardi, we love having you on. Come back soon, sir.</p><p>BASTARDI:  Well, thank you for having me.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Sure. Firefighters are breathing life-threatening conditions as  the Southern California wildfire hit the Los Angeles area.</p><p>Fox News Adam Housley is on the ground. Adam?</p><p>ADAM HOUSLEY, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Yes. Liz, right now we're in  front of the Thomas fires started Monday night, about 30 miles from where  I'm standing over near town called Santa Paula. And you're going to see how  airdrop here in a second here bringing in water.</p><p>This is one of the fingers of the fire, one of the front edges of the fire  heading towards the town called Carpenteria. It's actually a neighboring  Santa Barbara County; it's how far this fire has burned. And they're really  trying to knock it down right now. There's not a lot of wind but the air  quality is miserable as you can tell as I'm wearing a mask.</p><p>I'm going to step away. This is front edge right here. The helicopter is  going to come in here in a second you'll see it. There's hand crews up here  in very steep commissions and terrain. It's very dry right now but they're  getting a huge break from Mother Nature. </p><p>There is literally no wind here and there was supposed to be wind gust  today 30 to 40 miles an hour. We haven't seen wind gust at all, it's  completely calm, completely still which is allowing helicopters to get in  as well. They only can help campers how to battle when it's windy, it's  battling to safety and being able to fly in that.  </p><p>But also, when they drop the waters, it's likes spitting into the wind. In  this case it's not like that. You can see very little air movement which  really allows them to get them. What you're going to see them drop right  here in the front edge and you'll see the smoke go up as it knocks it down.</p><p>They really been hammering this area now for the last hour, is on  opportunity to stop this blanket the fire. Another point nearby burned down  right to the ocean and of course, that stopped it. There they goes right  there, you see how close they get in and basically knock the entire  flameout right there. A little bit left. He'll come back in here about  every three or two to three minutes he turns around and comes back.</p><p>But they're doing a great job in right now knocking this down. And Liz, as  you can tell it's quite a firefighters here in Southern California and you  see the red flag alert will continue into Saturday. </p><p>Back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Great report. Adam, stay safe there, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p>HOUSLEY:  We'll do.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That was terrific reporting. Thank you.</p><p>Let's get to this story. Bitcoin continuing its meteoric rise today. Early  investors the Winklevoss twins, a Facebook fame becoming Bitcoin  billionaires. </p><p>Now many Americans are thinking you know what? It could be their lottery  ticket too.</p><p>Next, our panel, managing money management on what to watch out for and  whether it's too late to get in there, after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news. The majority of the Senate voting to pass the  temporary two week spending measure that the House just passed all to avoid  a government shutdown tomorrow night. Voting continues both republican and  democrat leaders met at the White House today to discuss an agreement to  fund the federal government.</p><p>It's called the continuing resolution. It simply renews all existing money  for all government programs through midnight on December 22nd.</p><p>The price of Bitcoin swinging wildly today, rising to more than 19,000 only  to fall sharply within minutes, still at a new highs surpassing 17,000. The  frenzy surrounding this virtual currently escalating just days before it  start trading on a major U.S. exchange. </p><p>In recent months this crypto currency has undergone a staggering increase  in value surging from about 3500 in mid-September to its current price. Now  for its perspective the Bitcoin is worth about eight times now as gold as  the market cap higher than IBM, McDonald's or Disney. It's five times more  expensive than the .com stocks were at the height of the internet mania.</p><p>Let's bring in the money managers, the go to guys on Wall Street, Jonathan  Hoenig and Jason Rotman join me now.</p><p>Jonathan, without getting into the weeds can you explain to -- Bitcoin to  people?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOUNDING MEMBER, CAPITALIST PIG ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Yes,  it's a bubble. I mean, that's what this is at, E-Mac. This is a bubble. The  price of Bitcoin has doubled in just the last two weeks alone. But because  of the bubble, Liz, doesn't mean that the price can't continue to go up. I  think back when you talk about some of the .com stocks thing, one of the  '96, '97, '98, and then in '99 they went up another 100 percent.</p><p>So this doesn't matter what the technology is, what the assets are. The  hunt is on for Bitcoin and as long as the price continues to climb I think  buyers continue to show up especially since futures, as you mention,  launching this weekend. </p><p>This is a bubble with no sign of turning around.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. You know, to Jonathan's point, Jason, do you -- would you  get into it now or would you short it, what's your advice?</p><p>JASON ROTMAN, MANAGING PARTNER, LIDO ISLE ADVISORS:  I would do neither. I  would actually look at the other coins and other businesses in the block  chain space that are much cheaper that have much bigger upside that do much  more than just Bitcoin. Bitcoin is just money.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Like what?</p><p>ROTMAN:  There's other companies. Gosh, I mean, ethereum is kind of the  second one to Bitcoin from a market cap standpoint. Ethereum is a whole  platform there's another Chinese ethereum called nil. I think all these  different companies have a much bigger future because they are the backbone  of the whole decentralized economy. </p><p>Bitcoin is just money and I would not buy it up here especially.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, no store of value. Jonathan, what's going to cause this  bubble to burst?</p><p>HOENIG:  Well, you know, what's going to cause the bubble and the globe.com  to burst. I mean, we don't know, Liz. That was, you know, a big tech of  bigger play 20 years ago. Let's just emphasize, though, Bitcoin is not a  currency. It is not a medium of exchange. It's not a store value. It's a  speculation.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>HOENIG:  And you know what this bull mark can continue to keep going but I  wouldn't put my retirement fund there both in $20,000 coins.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Both of you think -- both of you think Bitcoin is a bubble  in search of a pen. Jonathan and Jason, you both are great one. We want to  have you back on soon. Thanks so much to you guys.</p><p>ROTMAN:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p>HOENIG:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We will be right back. Stay right there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, it looks like there will not be a Christmas government  shut down. The Senate voting to pass too temporary two week spending  measures the House passed it as well, all to avoid that government shut  down tomorrow night. The voting does continue.</p><p>We're staying on that story for you. We're simply with news all existing  programs money for them through midnight on December 22nd.</p><p>Thanks so much for having us in your homes. Charles Payne is here now with  Making Money.

But quote, \"In coming weeks\" as he strongly defends himself against allegations of sexual misconduct. This is bare-knuckle political hardball. The push is now on for a democrat Senate majority to upend the Trump agenda. We have the details.</p><p>Also the House is passing a two week spending bill to avoid a government shutdown tomorrow night. This continuing resolution simply renews all existing programs for -- through basically the stroke of midnight December 22nd. We're on that story for you.</p><p>And Bitcoin crossing the 19,000 threshold for the very first time today. This crypto currency is in a staggering dizzying ascend surging from about 3500 in mid-September to its current price.</p><p>Did you miss the chance to get in on the action or to short Bitcoin? We're going to let you know. We have an all-star guest line-up including the co- authors of the new bestseller \"Let Trump be Trump,\" they are David Bossie and Corey Lewandowski, also attorney Gregg Jarrett on the Mueller probe, and Fox Newshost Steve Hilton on the fight between Trump and Britain's Theresa May, all here all tonight.</p><p>I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. Risk and Reward starts right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>AL FRANKEN, </nameText></person>(D) UNITED STATES SENATOR: We were finally beginning to listen to women about the ways in which men's actions affect them. I was excited for that conversation. Then the conversation turned to me. Some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember very differently.</p><p>I have used my power to be a champion of women. Nothing I have done as a senator, nothing has brought this honor on this institution. Nevertheless, today, I am announcing that in the coming weeks I will be resigning as a member of the United States Senate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: He struck a defiant tone on the floor of the Senate. Senator <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>defended himself before announcing he will step down but with the caveat in coming weeks. That's what the Washington, D.C. echo chamber into overdrive that <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>may be trying to buy time to get a new lifeline out of the outcome of the Roy Moore Alabama Senate race.</p><p>This, after eight women now accuse <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>of touching them inappropriately. More than three dozen Senate democrats call for <person><nameText>Al Franken's </nameText></person>resignation, including Charles Schumer, Bernie Sanders, and Diane Feinstein. <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>is the second lawmaker to depart over sexual misconduct allegations in the last week after John Conyers said he would require.</p><p>The push is now on in the Senate for the democrats to seize control. And here's the math if democrats win the seats from retiring Senators Blake and Corker and there is a Roy Moore Senate loss that will put the democrats up 51-49.</p><p>Let's bring in the co-authors of \"Let Trump be Trump: The Inside Story of His Rise to the Presidency\" David Bossie and Corey Lewandowski join me now. Good to see you, guys. First, what do you think of <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>resigning, first to you, Corey.</p><p>COREY LEWANDOWSKI, CO-AUTHOR, LET TRUMP BE TRUMP: Look, I'd love to hear the definitive date that <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>is actually to walk away from the U.S. Senate because in Washington, D.C., Liz, I think you're exactly right. He says he's going to do it sometime in the future. The uproar goes away and <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>still sitting in the U.S. Senate a week, a month or a year from now because nobody is going to force him out.</p><p>More than 75 percent of his own democratic caucus has asked for him to resign. He's made the statement let's get the definitive date when he's going to leave.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, David, the republicans now have Roy Moore problem. The democrats, David, are trying to rebrand themselves as a party above moral reproach. But you know, none have given back the Harvey Weinstein donations. And only one, Kirsten Gillibrand barely criticizes Bill Clinton.</p><p>Go ahead, David.</p><p>DAVID BOSSIE, CO-AUTHOR, LET TRUMP BE TRUMP: Yes. You know, I think that we are going to have to have this conversation continuously over the next, you know, coming weeks and months. You know, I think that when Alabama voters decide next week then the Senate will get to decide if they want to take action through the ethics committee on then-Senator Moore if he's elected.</p><p>So, we'll see. Look, this is not going away. It's not a conversation that should go away. You know, the members of the media, members of the political class, you know, need to be held to account. And whether you're in Hollywood, New York, Washington, you know, I am glad that this conversation is happening.</p><p>MACDONALD: Especially with that slush fund paying off sexual harassment cases and more. Let's get back to Franken. Corey, <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>is saying while in office he has used his power against women. Let's roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANKEN: You know, an important part of the conversation we've been having in the last few months has been about how men abuse their power and privilege to hurt women. I am proud that during my time in the Senate I have used my power to be a champion of women. I know there's been a very different picture of me painted over the last few weeks but I know who I really am.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, guys. OK, of course, <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>will say that. He has already made similar statements. He also took a shot of <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and Roy Moore. But you know, you talked in your book about the Access Hollywood tape, Corey. What was -- we want to know, what was the first lady's reaction to that and the first family, the president's daughters, what was their reaction to the Access Hollywood tape?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: You know, Melania Trump said that she knows her husband and this was locker room talk. It was boy talk is what she said. And she stood by her husband. She was very clear. And the president has said that he never did those things, which is very different than what Senator Franken has said.</p><p>Senator Franken has now admitted that he has done some of the things he has been accused of, some of those women have come forward and said that he did this while he was the United States senator. We have a picture of him groping a woman's breast while she's asleep on an airplane.</p><p>Look, where I come from there is something called street justice. If you were to do that where I come there would be a very different resolution and potentially going to the Senate ethics committee to determine if this was right or wrong.</p><p>It is uncalled for, it's egregious and Senator Franken should step down immediately and not some arbitrary date in the future where he hasn't told us when he is going to leave.</p><p>MACDONALD: David, speak about the 16 women who have accused <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>in misconduct. Go ahead.</p><p>BOSSIE: Well, it is exactly what Corey said, which is one is -- one is locker room talk. One is, you know, guys talking among themselves whether you like it or not we all know what happens and that's what the president acknowledge.</p><p>But there is a difference between photographic evidence like in <person><nameText>Al Franken's </nameText></person>case or in these congressional race -- congressional cases where they use taxpayer dollars to pay the women off. So, we know there is evidence in those cases.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>BOSSIE: Here there is just a big difference between the two.</p><p>MACDONALD: I want to get to FBI director Christopher Wray defending the FBI after <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>criticism as the president -- excuse me -- Representative Jim Jordan really pushed card on the Robert Mueller Russia probe calling for a second special counsel to look into the FISA warrant and how they came about to basically spy on Trump campaign aides. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM JORDAN, (R) UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE: Peter Strzok, Mr. Super- agent at the FBI, I think he's the guy who took the application to the FISA court. And if that happened, I mean, think, if this happened if you have the FBI working with a campaign, the democrats campaign taken opposition research dressing it all up and turn it into an intelligence document and taking it to the FISA court so they can spy on the other campaign, if that happened that is as wrong as it gets.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. You guys were on the campaign, tell us what was going on behind the scenes of the campaign. Did you, Corey, did you -- did you know anybody or anyone else connected to the Trump campaign who is working with the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's campaign.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Never. And let me say this. I sat next to candidate Trump for 18 months, 18 hours a day seven days a week. Never was the collusion, cooperation or coordination with Russia in any way shape or form.</p><p>And what I have said very publicly and I stand by. If anybody attempted to or did manipulate the outcome of this election for a foreign government that person should go to jail for the rest of their life. And that would include FBI agents who potentially used their power in the deep state to manipulate government agencies like in court to list -- enlist FISA warrant or to change rules and regulations as it relate to Hillary Clinton investigation.</p><p>I am gravely concerned about this agent. And right now all we know is that he's been demoted to the human resources department which I think is still circumspect at best.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, we're staying on the story here on this show. The Trump empires real estate dealings, David, with Russians and money laundering is now into the microscope. Have you ever heard anything about that any Russians were using shell companies or real estate dealings with the Trump empire.</p><p>BOSSIE: You know, we got these questions about our book. Why we didn't talk about Russia in the book. And the reality is because there was nothing to it. You know, we just look at this case and say it was based on this collusion accusation. And this investigation has been going on a year and a half now. Eighteen months of an investigation. Not a scintilla of evidence that there's been any collusion or cooperation between the Russians and our campaign.</p><p>And let me just say, we acknowledged that the Russians were trying to impact both campaigns and we disagree with that. We want them to never do that again. We want American campaigns to be stood up so that they can't be impacted again. And so we'd like to see that happen.</p><p>But there was no evidence of collusion. And that's why this case really has gone nowhere except Paul Manafort and Rick Gates in what they did before joining the campaign, and Mike Flynn and Papadopoulos about a lie they told to the FBI. Again, nothing to do with collusion of the Trump campaign.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Let's move on. Now, you know, the press is on. The full court press is on with Senate democrats to seize back control and get a majority in the Senate.</p><p>The Dow powering forward on optimism about the Trump agenda and tax reform. Look at this. It only took 32 trading days for the Dow to rise and 22,000 to the 23,000 mark. It was only seven days ago that the blue chip average finished above 24,000 for the very first time.</p><p>We're now in the fifth 1,000 milestone in 2017 for the Dow, the most ever in a calendar year. And the six 1,000-point milestone since Election Day.</p><p>But former <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>is crediting himself for the strong economy saying the thank should go to him. Watch the fast fall that <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>tried to whip by you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As we took these actions we saw the U.S. economy were all consistent, we saw the longest stream of job creation in American history by far. The streak have stock continues by the way. Thanks, Obama.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Did you catch the nuance of what Obama said, the quote, \"longest winning streak.\" Obama is talking about back to back monthly job creation 75 months straight versus Reagan at 48. But when you talk about the actual number of jobs created Obama ranks down there with Jimmy Carter. Reagan created more than 16 million, Clinton nearly 23 million. About 11 million for <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>and 10 million for Carter.</p><p>I mean, Corey, every president can argue they inherited the recession going back to FDR. That's what Obama is arguing. What do you make of those numbers and what Obama is saying that he's the go to guy for the strength in the economy.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Well, you know, Liz. It's amazing. This is the 12 year presidency because for the first four years of the Obama administration all he did was blame Bush for the terrible economy that he inherited. And now for the year after this administration he's tried to take credit for what Trump has done.</p><p>Look, Donald Trump has helped to add 5 trillion almost $6 million of market cap to the economy right now. We have the lowest unemployment since 1973. We have the highest home ownership in two generations. What we see is the stock market is going like crazy. We're at 3.3 percent growth under the Obama years.</p><p>Look, these are the governments numbers, 1.2 and 1.3 percent GDP. He doubled our national deficit in eight years. From eight -- from eight to 16 and then from 10 to $20 trillion. The only thing he gets credit for is that Donald Trump came in to save the economy.</p><p>MACDONALD: And facts are he created a record number of basic government jobs, a lot of government jobs, a lot of minimum wage jobs that you can't raise a family on. Those are the facts. You can check the government data on that.</p><p>I want to get to the story first. Let me get back for a second to your new tell-all book \"Let Trump Be Trump.\" David, you -- David and Corey, you detailed how ABC News top producer Chris Vlasto gave you, David, as Trump then-deputy campaign manager proprietary exit polling in election night. Those numbers are usually only shared with the Associated Press and the major TV networks and not to outsiders.</p><p>I mean, ABC I think you reported this, has now reprimanded the producer for that. How did this go down, I mean, how did you get involved in that. Did you feel badly about being involved in that?</p><p>BOSSIE: Well, I didn't feel badly about being involved in it. Look, reporters and political operatives all across the country in both parties trade information all the time. And it is just part of the business. And so I traded information with reporters for 30 years now.</p><p>And so I got that data and it was just -- it ended up being bad exit poll data. It's really what it ended up being. So, we took about half an hour to digest it and figure it out that it was bad exit poll data. We got it at 5, by about 5.35 we had figured out that we're not in as bad a shape as it looked like because the exit polls were wrong.</p><p>And Donald Trump ended up winning this massive landslide all across the country winning states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, and Wisconsin. States we weren't supposed to win. North Carolina and Florida by bug numbers that they did not expect the Clintons, you know -- when they got that same data, I might add, you know, they were celebrating and popping champagne corks a little early.</p><p>MACDONALD: Interesting. You know, you guys, you've worked with news operations with the TV networks for some time. We broke this -- we reported on the story about ABC News investigative divisions still reeling from the suspension of chief investigative correspondent Brian Ross.</p><p>The Dow dropped, Corey, 350 points by his wrong report about General Flynn and Trump. What has been your experience and can you tell you what has been like to deal with the various networks in the integrity and credibility of each of them.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Look, I think there are some good people who work at the networks. But unfortunately, we're now in a cycle where reporters want to make the news and not report the news. We saw this from Brian Ross, he put out a false narrative. The Dow Jones falls 350 points.</p><p>ABC first has those in mistake. Now they've suspended him. They should fire this person for what he did. How many people lost money because of this false report? Look in just this week. We saw a report out that the Mueller investigative team has subpoenaed records at Deutsche bank. That story was pervasive across the networks only to be retracted in six hours later as a complete facade.</p><p>The news media has no liability. Unfortunately, the networks go and say whatever they want and their apology effort is not enough to the American people. And that's why Donald Trump -- and we talked about this in the book a lot -- coined the phrase \"fake news.\"</p><p>The American people are smart, they look through it and 97 percent of the people after election they say they didn't allow the media's bias to change their voting habits this election cycle.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. David and Corey, it's so good to see you, guys. Be sure to buy their best-selling book \"Let Trump Be Trump.\" We love having you on. We look forward to both of you coming back on again soon. It's a great book, go buy it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Any time. Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's check your money markets closing up 70 points today. Our own Nicole Petallides is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the latest. Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: A winning day on Wall Street. The Dow came off this earlier high. It hit the highest point in the day when Senator <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>said he was going to be resigning. It was up about 120 points.</p><p>But the Dow finished higher by 70 points. The S&amp;P 500 seven points, snapping in the recent losing streak. The NASDAQ also gained. The winner will be that Caterpillar, Visa, Nike, Boeing, and United Technologies.</p><p>For the week all three are still slightly lower. Also tomorrow is jobs Friday. We'll watch for that with the estimates of roughly 200,000 4.1 percent. Maria Bartiromo love jobs in America especially here on Fox Business so keep it right here on Fox Business.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you much, Nicole. The Justice Department is now reading through over 10,000 text between FBI investigator Peter Strzok and another official. Initial text show anti-Trump bias but will the voters see them. Will they see all of them. And will more shoes drop in the Mueller Russia probe when it comes to bias.</p><p>A Justice Department official, another official involved in that probe now demoted over bias allegations. We've got the details, next. Stay right there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The attorney general needs to do his job and end this witch hunt charade. We have a clear double standard. And you see in the American people see it. Hillary Clinton is being investigated by her own fan club before the 2016 election. And the only way you seem to get on Mueller's team is to demonstrate a hatred for Donald Trump.</p><p>I think that the way Mueller built his team was finding people who had a bias against the president and doing everything he could to include them in this investigation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The time is now for Jeff Sessions to do his job, and if he doesn't do his job, you know, he needs to step aside and let somebody else do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: The Justice Department is now reading through over 10,000 texts between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. Strzok is the FBI official removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe over alleged anti-Trump bias.</p><p>My next case is making the case that the Mueller investigation is illegitimate and corrupt. Joining me now, attorney and Fox Newscorrespondent, Gregg Jarrett. Good to see you, Gregg.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, ATTORNEY AND FOX NEWSCORRESPONDENT: Good to see you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Why do you say it's illegitimate and corrupt?</p><p>JARRETT: Because Mueller is back to deck. This is a team of investigators and lawyers that is rife with political prejudice and corrupt motives. And you know, Peter Strzok is just the tip of the iceberg here. When the inspector general report comes out I suspect it will be pretty damning evidence of not just what Strzok did but others.</p><p>And that may include James Comey that they fix it deliberately for political purposes that Hillary Clinton would be cleared so that it would enable her to ascend to the presidency. And when that didn't happen they set out to bring down the guy who won.</p><p>MACDONALD: And they just demoted. The Justice Department official Peter Strzok, right?</p><p>JARRETT: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: For bias, alleged bias, right?</p><p>JARRETT: Look at the people that Mueller selected. Eight of the lawyers on his team are democratic donors including one, Jeannie Rhee who actually defended the Clinton Foundation into racketeering lawsuits.</p><p>The political opponent and the guy you are investigating. How could you select Jeannie Rhee and Andrew Weissmann we now know was fawning all over Sally Yates who defied the president.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Greg, democrats have been accusing <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>of attacking the institutions of our democracy. Let's roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think our democracy is under attack.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our institutions are under assault.</p><p>OBAMA: Democracy itself is on the ballot right now.</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, (D) FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is his final target, our democracy itself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: But CNN's Chris Cuomo actually pointing out the hypocrisy over what happened to <person><nameText>Al Franken.</nameText></person></p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, HOST, CNN: Democrats have been attacking Trump for attacking democratic institutions. And now they're getting rid of Franken without due process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Due process, right, for <person><nameText>Al Franken. </nameText></person>I mean, some of these...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JARRETT: Franken was getting due process.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, some of these allegations -- some of these allegations happened before he became a senator, right? But he wanted the investigation to...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JARRETT: He wanted an ethics investigation. And then the democratic leadership went to him and said you got to leave and if you don't we'll take you off every committee and get rid of you in other way. So, he quit.</p><p>Look, the clip you paid -- played are very revealing. They came from James Clapper who lied to Congress. Eric Holder who was held in contempt of Congress, and Hillary Clinton who likely violated the espionage actors. Overwhelming evidence of it.</p><p>MACDONALD: So you're just saying that, you know, it's sort of like pot calling the kettle black here, right?</p><p>JARRETT: Yes. I mean, these are, you know democrats who have a political agenda and animus for the president and they're lashing out. It's, you know, it's politics.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. So, your forecast is that the inspector general report and the Mueller probe is going to see more shoes to drop.</p><p>JARRETT: Yes, but we can't wait for it early next year. I think you have to have Jeff Sessions un- recuse himself for the sole purpose of firing the entire Mueller staff plus Mueller and replace him with somebody who can be fair and objective.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. The bombshell. Gregg Jarrett, thank you so much. We love having you on. Come back soon.</p><p>JARRETT: Sure.</p><p>MACDONALD: Today marks the 76th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack. The president now signing an action saying this is Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. Flags all around the country flying in half-staff today in honor of the more than 2400 servicemen who were killed and the nearly 1200 wounded in the surprise attack.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: December 7, 1941, a date which we'll live in infamy. The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Next up, we have this story for you. Media pundits now condemning <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>for saying Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, saying that the president broke 70 years of U.S. policy. But my next guest he is an expert, he says the media pundits they've got it totally wrong.</p><p>He's former Israel elite Special Forces member. He is Aaron Cohen, he joins me next. Stay right there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Whatever the outcome of the negotiations, as stated in our democratic platform, Jerusalem is still the capital of Israel, and must remain an undivided city accessible to all.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As soon as I take office, I will begin the process of moving the United States ambassador to the city of Israel as its capital.</p><p>OBAMA: Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel and it must remain undivided.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>followed through on his campaign promise. He made Jerusalem; basically the United States will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. It is the statement made by several past presidents. We just showed you Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. As well as democrat senators like Diane Feinstein have said the same thing. But the media now condemning <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>for the move, saying he broke 70 years of U.S. policy. Roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On the other major news tonight. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>reversing nearly 70 decades of U.S. policy, now recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He had promised this day would come, but to hear these words from the White House was jaw-dropping. Not only signing a proclamation reversing nearly 70 years of U.S. policy, but starting plans to move the embassy to Jerusalem. No one else on earth has an embassy there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The department is concern about any possible violent reaction to <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>announcement today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The president here is making a risky bet that doing something different will eventually end up productive for peace talks, but he's about the only one making that bet.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Seven decades of U.S. policy changed in an instant.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Joining me now former Israel elite Special Forces member Aaron Cohen. Good to see you, sir.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AARON COHEN, FORMER ISRAEL ELITE FORCES MEMBER: Good to see you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Did <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>reverse U.S. policy by acknowledging Jerusalem as the capital of Israel?</p><p>COHEN: If it's reversing U.S. policy, come again with that, sorry.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, did he reverse U.S. policy when he basically sign that order?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COHEN: No, I don't think so. I think this has nothing to do is reversing any policy. Israel had a very strong standing policy with U.S. a very strong standing relationship with Israel. It's been that way since Israel's inception. And having a declaration it isn't changing anything in regards to the U.S.'s ability to be able to continue to work with Israel working with the peace for this.</p><p>No relationship between moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from tel Aviv. There's no connection in terms of U.S. policy.</p><p>MACDONALD: MSNBC's Chris Matthews wasted no time making doomsday predictions. Let's roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST, MSNBC: People are going to die now because of what was said today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If we move that embassy to Jerusalem we could spark a full on intifada and real people could die.</p><p>MATTHEWS: I believe they will and I believe that's the horror. By the way, deaths are coming now because of this. You can just bet in the next few weeks we are going to help pay for this holy erratic decision by this president.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: I mean, predictions like that they're just succeeding to threats really. I mean, would they have this reaction in <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>had made this decision?</p><p>COHEN: Probably not. Yes, not only the media hypocrisy coming, you know, from the left regarding this move to Jerusalem. The fact is this. There hasn't been peace in Israel; it went through Palestinians since the Israel's inception. Israel is always had a very complicated security apparatus. And again, I just don't think that there's any connection between any increased violence and what we've seen in the last 70 years.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>COHEN: There's no connections. It's absolutely ludicrous.</p><p>MACDONALD: Aaron Cohen, you're going to stay right there. You'll be back after the break. Next up, the president getting praise inside Israel for his executive order in Jerusalem. But remember when the media accuse <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>of being anti-Semitic. We've got basically more discussion about this coming up. Stay right there. Don't go away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The White House is now condemning the bomb threat. This, after <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>twice last week dance around questions about anti-Semitism. The statement does not actually mentioned Jews, something the White House was also criticized for after statement put out on Holocaust Remembrance Day.</p><p>CUOMO: He hasn't tweeted about this with the ordinary vigor that the president usually brings the things he doesn't like. This is in no way meant as a suggestion that the president is somehow OK with this. He's never said anything like that. But it's what he doesn't say.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>spoken out more vociferously against the wave of anti-Semitism that we're seeing?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: You sort of hear between the lines there that the president was being accused of being anti-Semitic. You sort of heard that, right.</p><p>The media taken back after <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>though, announced recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and that Tel Aviv would no longer house the U.S. embassy removed to Jerusalem.</p><p>Back with me now, former Israeli elite Special Forces member, Aaron Cohen. Did the media's anti-Semitic insinuations against Trump ever hold water?</p><p>COHEN: No, they don't hold water. I think everybody who's listening to these anti-Semitic claims knows to nod their head immediately. I mean, calling Donald Trump anti-Semitic, especially as it pertains to Israel is not only ludicrous. It's laughable. It's equivalent to calling Bibi Netanyahu anti-Semitic was the prime minister of Israel.</p><p>The fact is, is that Israel as the presidents have stated four or five incumbent presidents coming in have all stated that they are going to, you know, claim Jerusalem as the capital and move the embassy to Jerusalem. Trump did it. And so really what it shows is that he's able to stand on his ground and he's committed to being part with this one.</p><p>I think this is what people don't really understand. The Trump's commitment to Israel is a strategic decision as it relates to U.S. national security, Liz, and I'll tell you why.</p><p>Israel shares intelligence with the Americans and Israel has the finest intelligence agencies and apparatuses in the world. We have Jews who have been kicked out by every Muslim country in the world and forced to move to Israel, and therefore we can infiltrate those countries undetected and get that human intelligence which Israel shares with the United States and Trump understand that.</p><p>I don't think his concern with the anti-Sematic callouts.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>COHEN: It's just not true. It's fable and just, you know, nonsense.</p><p>MACDONALD: And the broader geopolitical point is that Israel is aligning with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates against Iran and against the Muslim Brotherhood, right?</p><p>COHEN: Correct.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>COHEN: And they are in these countries are Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood are enemies who have sworn on the destruction of the U.S. and this western values. So, all of those alignments are key to our national security.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>COHEN: The only real bigotry that's going on here is the Arab world against this little tiny nation surrounded by 20 Arab countries. The only bigotry that is going on here.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you, Aaron Cohen. Great to see you. We love having you on. Come back soon.</p><p>COHEN: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: A big weakness in China's economy could threaten global growth. It's China heavily indebted banks. Now the International Monetary Fund recommended China's bank increase their capital buffers to protect against any sudden economic downturn following a really inflated credit boom there.</p><p>It's the first looksee by the IMF into China's bank those seven years. The IMF said its stress test show China's top four banks do have enough capital but the nation's little guy, the smaller banks appear vulnerable.</p><p>Breaking up, breaking news. The republican operative tells Fox that -- Fox Arizona Republican Representative Trent Frank -- Franks. Trent Franks is expected to resign.</p><p>However, these are just reports so far, it is a fast-moving fluid situation. This could possibly be. Again, this is an allegation their charges. Reports coming in inappropriate behavior. That's not confirmed. We're staying on top of this quick moving developing story for you.</p><p>Hollywood celebrities now evacuating homes in the Los Angeles area amid the wildfire threat. Known liberal anti-Trump comic Chelsea Handler actually blaming it on the president.</p><p>Meteorologist Joe Bastardi is here to give Chelsea Handler a science lesson after this.</p><p>MACDONALD: Numerous people in Los Angeles area, including celebrities evacuating their homes amid the wildfires there. We have a liberal anti- Trump comic Chelsea Handler blaming it on the president.</p><p>Chelsea Handler tweeting out quote, \"Just evacuated my house. It's like Donald Trump is setting the world of fire, literally and figuratively.\" Handler tweeted yesterday. \"Stay safe, everyone. Dark times.\"</p><p>Let's get to Weatherbell.com meteorologist Joe Bastardi. Is that possible, did Trump cause that fire to happen? I thought he was in Washington, D.C.</p><p>JOE BASTARDI, CHIEF FORECASTER, WEATHERBELL.COM: Well, you know, any comment I make will be portrayed as unsympathetic to the horrific situation that's going on out there and I certainly don't want to appear that way.</p><p>But let's set the record straight. First of all, there was supposed to be a permanent drought out in California, that's what we heard two or three years ago. When that drought reversed last winter with the tremendous rains, that proved that it wasn't a permanent drought. It was a temporary drought, I guess.</p><p>But it also led to something that made by company, maybe Ms. Handler would subscribe to our company. She would have known what was going to go on back in the spring.</p><p>My company said that this means a big wildfire season is likely on the way. Now why is that? Because when you have extra heavy rains in California during the winter months it means there's going to be more vegetation. That vegetation of course is going to dry out during the summer because the summers are dry out there and what does that mean. There's more fuel for these fires.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>BASTARDI: In addition, there are many, many more people, Liz, living out in California now than there were, let's say in the 1950s, so we have many more people in harms, they build houses, great houses and that's fine, but there is a high risk of this type of thing happening in getting out of control in populated areas now because we more populated areas.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Chelsea Handler is just making a bad joke there. You say it's possible though that these fires were started by human beings. How so?</p><p>BASTARDI: Well, you have to wonder sometimes whether -- I can't say this, they have to investigate how these fires started whether it was arson, whether it was by mistake. Someone was camping out or, you know, there was a short-circuit in a transmission box.</p><p>You know, all these things are possible and certainly, I mean, there were no thunderstorms around. I don't think to set these fires off. So the folks that do that type of work will determine that. Now it's very warm and hot out there in the West Coast. It's been hot out there in the West Coast and that happens quite often when it does get very cold in the east.</p><p>One of the things we've been preaching since October is that December was going to be cold and snowy in the eastern part of the United States and Europe about to see that happen and this correlates quite often. So when you have the dryness in the west and the heat in the west a lot of times the cold air comes into the eastern part of the United States. And don't be surprises someone blames him if he tries to snow in New Orleans and it might try to snow as far south as New Orleans tomorrow afternoon or tomorrow night.</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow.</p><p>BASTARDI: Someone to blame global warming or Donald Trump on that.</p><p>MACDONALD: Joe Bastardi, we love having you on. Come back soon, sir.</p><p>BASTARDI: Well, thank you for having me.</p><p>MACDONALD: Sure. Firefighters are breathing life-threatening conditions as the Southern California wildfire hit the Los Angeles area.</p><p>Fox NewsAdam Housley is on the ground. Adam?</p><p>ADAM HOUSLEY, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Yes. Liz, right now we're in front of the Thomas fires started Monday night, about 30 miles from where I'm standing over near town called Santa Paula. And you're going to see how airdrop here in a second here bringing in water.</p><p>This is one of the fingers of the fire, one of the front edges of the fire heading towards the town called Carpenteria. It's actually a neighboring Santa Barbara County; it's how far this fire has burned. And they're really trying to knock it down right now. There's not a lot of wind but the air quality is miserable as you can tell as I'm wearing a mask.</p><p>I'm going to step away. This is front edge right here. The helicopter is going to come in here in a second you'll see it. There's hand crews up here in very steep commissions and terrain. It's very dry right now but they're getting a huge break from Mother Nature.</p><p>There is literally no wind here and there was supposed to be wind gust today 30 to 40 miles an hour. We haven't seen wind gust at all, it's completely calm, completely still which is allowing helicopters to get in as well. They only can help campers how to battle when it's windy, it's battling to safety and being able to fly in that.</p><p>But also, when they drop the waters, it's likes spitting into the wind. In this case it's not like that. You can see very little air movement which really allows them to get them. What you're going to see them drop right here in the front edge and you'll see the smoke go up as it knocks it down.</p><p>They really been hammering this area now for the last hour, is on opportunity to stop this blanket the fire. Another point nearby burned down right to the ocean and of course, that stopped it. There they goes right there, you see how close they get in and basically knock the entire flameout right there. A little bit left. He'll come back in here about every three or two to three minutes he turns around and comes back.</p><p>But they're doing a great job in right now knocking this down. And Liz, as you can tell it's quite a firefighters here in Southern California and you see the red flag alert will continue into Saturday.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Great report. Adam, stay safe there, sir. Thank you so much.</p><p>HOUSLEY: We'll do.</p><p>MACDONALD: That was terrific reporting. Thank you.</p><p>Let's get to this story. Bitcoin continuing its meteoric rise today. Early investors the Winklevoss twins, a Facebook fame becoming Bitcoin billionaires.</p><p>Now many Americans are thinking you know what? It could be their lottery ticket too.</p><p>Next, our panel, managing money management on what to watch out for and whether it's too late to get in there, after this.</p><p>MACDONALD: Breaking news. The majority of the Senate voting to pass the temporary two week spending measure that the House just passed all to avoid a government shutdown tomorrow night. Voting continues both republican and democrat leaders met at the White House today to discuss an agreement to fund the federal government.</p><p>It's called the continuing resolution. It simply renews all existing money for all government programs through midnight on December 22nd.</p><p>The price of Bitcoin swinging wildly today, rising to more than 19,000 only to fall sharply within minutes, still at a new highs surpassing 17,000. The frenzy surrounding this virtual currently escalating just days before it start trading on a major U.S. exchange.</p><p>In recent months this crypto currency has undergone a staggering increase in value surging from about 3500 in mid-September to its current price. Now for its perspective the Bitcoin is worth about eight times now as gold as the market cap higher than IBM, McDonald's or Disney. It's five times more expensive than the .com stocks were at the height of the internet mania.</p><p>Let's bring in the money managers, the go to guys on Wall Street, Jonathan Hoenig and Jason Rotman join me now.</p><p>Jonathan, without getting into the weeds can you explain to -- Bitcoin to people?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOUNDING MEMBER, CAPITALIST PIG ASSET MANAGEMENT: Yes, it's a bubble. I mean, that's what this is at, E-Mac. This is a bubble. The price of Bitcoin has doubled in just the last two weeks alone. But because of the bubble, Liz, doesn't mean that the price can't continue to go up. I think back when you talk about some of the .com stocks thing, one of the '96, '97, '98, and then in '99 they went up another 100 percent.</p><p>So this doesn't matter what the technology is, what the assets are. The hunt is on for Bitcoin and as long as the price continues to climb I think buyers continue to show up especially since futures, as you mention, launching this weekend.</p><p>This is a bubble with no sign of turning around.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. You know, to Jonathan's point, Jason, do you -- would you get into it now or would you short it, what's your advice?</p><p>JASON ROTMAN, MANAGING PARTNER, LIDO ISLE ADVISORS: I would do neither. I would actually look at the other coins and other businesses in the block chain space that are much cheaper that have much bigger upside that do much more than just Bitcoin. Bitcoin is just money.</p><p>MACDONALD: Like what?</p><p>ROTMAN: There's other companies. Gosh, I mean, ethereum is kind of the second one to Bitcoin from a market cap standpoint. Ethereum is a whole platform there's another Chinese ethereum called nil. I think all these different companies have a much bigger future because they are the backbone of the whole decentralized economy.</p><p>Bitcoin is just money and I would not buy it up here especially.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, no store of value. Jonathan, what's going to cause this bubble to burst?</p><p>HOENIG: Well, you know, what's going to cause the bubble and the globe.com to burst. I mean, we don't know, Liz. That was, you know, a big tech of bigger play 20 years ago. Let's just emphasize, though, Bitcoin is not a currency. It is not a medium of exchange. It's not a store value. It's a speculation.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>HOENIG: And you know what this bull mark can continue to keep going but I wouldn't put my retirement fund there both in $20,000 coins.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Both of you think -- both of you think Bitcoin is a bubble in search of a pen. Jonathan and Jason, you both are great one. We want to have you back on soon. Thanks so much to you guys.</p><p>ROTMAN: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>HOENIG: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: We will be right back. Stay right there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, it looks like there will not be a Christmas government shut down. The Senate voting to pass too temporary two week spending measures the House passed it as well, all to avoid that government shut down tomorrow night. The voting does continue.</p><p>We're staying on that story for you. We're simply with news all existing programs money for them through midnight on December 22nd.</p><p>Thanks so much for having us in your homes. Charles Payne is here now with Making Money. Take it away, Charles.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Senator Al Franken, D-MN, suggested in a speech and an op-ed that rules requiring neutral treatment of information should be applied to giant tech platforms including Facebook, Google and Amazon. \"As tech giants become a new kind of Internet gatekeeper, I believe the same basic principles of net neutrality should apply here: no one company should have the power to pick and choose which content reaches consumers and which doesn't,\" Franken wrote in an op-ed for the Guardian[1]. \"Facebook, Google, and Amazon\u2014like ISPs\u2014should be 'neutral' in their treatment of the flow of lawful information and commerce on their platforms.\" </p><p>According to Franken, tech companies have consolidated so much power that they have effectively created monopolies in their own industries, leaving internet users with few or no viable alternatives. Net neutrality[2] prohibits ISPs from throttling or slowing a user's connection, blocking content, or providing preferential treatment to sites or services that pay extra for it. Such rules were applied to ISPs because most consumers only have the choice of one or two providers in their market. The rules did not extend to websites because users could easily visit any site they so chose as long as net neutrality was being enforced. Now, as users have grown reliant on just a few major platforms, some are beginning to size up those platforms as potential monopolies. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission can use its antitrust enforcement powers against sites, but Senator Franken is pushing for a new type of regulation that would specifically target the dominant web platforms. The senator wrote that while users may not like the fact that their activity on Facebook is used to dictate what kinds of advertisements are displayed in their feed or their web browsing history and information in their Gmail account helps the search giant deliver targeted ads, most people aren't going to delete their accounts because they have become necessary aspects of the online experience. He suggests consumers should have more options than to just have to submit to the potentially invasive behavior of the platforms they use. 'Big tech has taken it upon itself to sort through all the viewpoints, news, and entertainment, and decide for us what we should read, watch, buy, or even how we should engage in civil society,' Sen. Franken wrote. 'And they're doing it all under the shadow of complicated algorithms that make little sense to either the content creators whose livelihood depends on them or the users whose everyday decisions they're controlling.' The senator warned against the growing amount of traffic that web giants like Facebook and Google handle, noting that reliance on the sites offer the companies leverage in negotiating who gets to use their platforms and how\u2014the same way Amazon used its control over the e-book market against publishers to force them into unfavorable contracts. During a speech at the Open Markets Institute[3] Thursday, Franken again called for a sort of net neutrality for websites that would help prevent against discriminatory behavior that may harm consumers and organizations that use the platforms. The Senator has not proposed any specific policy regarding how website and platforms should be regulated, and his position runs counter to what what Democrats once argued in regard to net neutrality\u2014that it applied to internet service providers but not to websites. International Business Times contacted Facebook, Google, Amazon and the Internet Association\u2014a trade group that represents all three companies\u2014regarding Senator Franken's comments. Google, Facebook and the Internet Association did not respond at the time of publication. A spokesperson for Amazon declined to provide comment.

Such rules were applied to ISPs because most consumers only have the choice of one or two providers in their market. The rules did not extend to websites because users could easily visit any site they so chose as long as net neutrality was being enforced.</p><p>Now, as users have grown reliant on just a few major platforms, some are beginning to size up those platforms as potential monopolies. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission can use its antitrust enforcement powers against sites, but Senator Franken is pushing for a new type of regulation that would specifically target the dominant web platforms.</p><p>Matt Wood, the policy director of Free Press, told International Business Times \"It would be a mistake to say we should apply exactly the same rules to powerful edge companies that we have for the ISPs.\" Wood also noted that Franken didn't explicitly\u00a0say that, and while\u00a0his language may be \"a little bit unclear,\" that his intention is to suggest it's worth looking into the power of massive edge providers.</p><p>\"We don't want anybody to have the power to dictate somebody else's speech or commerce for them,\" Wood said.</p><p>The senator wrote that while users may not like the fact that their activity on Facebook is used to dictate what kinds of advertisements are displayed in their feed or their web browsing history and information in their Gmail account helps the search giant deliver targeted ads, most people aren't going to delete their accounts because they have become necessary aspects of the online experience.</p><p>He suggests consumers should have more options than to just have to submit to the potentially invasive behavior of the platforms they use.</p><p>\"Big tech has taken it upon itself to sort through all the viewpoints, news, and entertainment, and decide for us what we should read, watch, buy, or even how we should engage in civil society,\" Sen. Franken wrote. \"And they're doing it all under the shadow of complicated algorithms that make little sense to either the content creators whose livelihood depends on them or the users whose everyday decisions they're controlling.\"</p><p>The senator warned against the growing amount of traffic that web giants like Facebook and Google handle, noting that reliance on the sites offer the companies leverage in negotiating who gets to use their platforms and how-the same way Amazon used its control over the e-book market against publishers to force them into unfavorable contracts.</p><p>During a (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/openmarketsinstitute/videos/vb.1625194367547116/1626566080743278/?type=2&amp;theater&amp;link_id=1&amp;can_id=1aa9627b2b03ab5f4e433b8c9adbc378&amp;source=email-icymi-sen-al-franken-open-markets-institute-discuss-politics-and-policy-in-the-age-of-tech-giants&amp;email_referrer=email_260701&amp;email_subject=icymi-sen-al-franken-open-markets-institute-discuss-politics-and-policy-in-the-age-of-tech-giants\">https://www.facebook.com/openmarketsinstitute/videos/vb.1625194367547116/1626566080743278/?type=2&amp;theater&amp;link_id=1&amp;can_id=1aa9627b2b03ab5f4e433b8c9adbc378&amp;source=email-icymi-sen-al-franken-open-markets-institute-discuss-politics-and-policy-in-the-age-of-tech-giants&amp;email_referrer=email_260701&amp;email_subject=icymi-sen-al-franken-open-markets-institute-discuss-politics-and-policy-in-the-age-of-tech-giants</url>) speech at the Open Markets Institute Thursday, Franken again called for a sort of net neutrality for websites that would help prevent against discriminatory behavior that may harm consumers and organizations that use the platforms.</p><p>The Senator has not proposed any specific policy regarding how website and platforms should be regulated, and his position runs counter to what what Democrats once argued in regard to net neutrality-that it applied to internet service providers but not to websites.</p><p>International Business Times contacted Facebook, Google, Amazon and the Internet Association-a trade group that represents all three companies-regarding Senator Franken's comments.

And that is according to a new report in The New York Times. The newspaper obtained documents that show the social media giant allowed Microsoft's Bing search engine to see the names of virtually all Facebook users' friends without consent. The social network also permitted Amazon to obtain usernames and contact information through their friends.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AILSA CHANG:                 The data-sharing was meant to benefit all the companies. Facebook got more users and raked in advertising dollars. The Times reports that other companies acquired features to make the products more attractive. The question now is - what is the impact on all of us who use Facebook? Let's bring in Senator Amy Klobuchar.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 She's a Democrat from Minnesota. She sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, also the Senate Commerce Committee. She has introduced legislation to strengthen protection of people's privacy online, and she is here in our studio.             </p><p>                Senator, welcome.             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 Well, thanks, Mary Louise. It's great to be on.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 It does seem as though every day - or something like that - another shoe drops when we talk about Facebook. What is your top line reaction to this latest investigation by The New York Times?             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 Well, I'm not completely surprised. But I think the evidence is becoming so overwhelming that we can no longer be paralyzed. It feels like - these companies, they somehow thought for years that they could just be bystanders in what is a never-ending cyberwar. And in fact, they've been used, they've made money off of it big time, and it is time to step in. And at the same time, Congress has been paralyzed. Nothing has been happening. Whether it's because of lobbying, whether it's because of the complexity of this, we just have to put all that aside and move.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 On the specific revelations that are coming out, the part I found most unsettling is this revelation that Spotify and Netflix, two other big tech companies, could read our private messages on Facebook.             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 It is an unbelievable thought. So you are, you know, going back and forth with your mom and - about what movie they liked or what movie they were going to see and then - on Facebook. Never in a million years do people think that is then going to go to Netflix so that can presumably direct things at you, if you have an account with them, or try to lure you into their service by advertising things - or the same with music and Spotify.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 But to your point that we - you said we should not be surprised - I mean, should we be surprised? Or should we just accept that...             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 I'm not surprised...             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 ...If we type anything anywhere online, we don't quite know in 2019, 2018 - in the digital age - where it's going to end up and who might see it?             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 I think we have to expect more - more from these companies. And that means, first of all, that they can't be messing around with private data. And to me, they're clearly not going to police themselves. So that's why we have to pass privacy legislation. Think about if we had in place the legislation - bipartisan legislation that I've introduced with Senator Kennedy of Louisiana. First...             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 This is the legislation I referenced that you introduced in April.             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 I think it would have fixed a lot of this. First, plain language - you'd have to make a decision if you're going to share your data. You'd have to understand that more. Secondly, you'd have control over your data and that you would be able to opt out of any sharing arrangements. And the third thing is that you would be notified of any privacy breach. That is pretty common-sense legislation.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 If it's common-sense legislation, why weren't you able to get it out of committee? It never even came up for a vote.             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 Right. And I think a lot of that has to do with the lobbying that goes on from the tech industry. And I believe that our colleagues in both the Commerce Committee, Judiciary and the Republican majority is going to have to step up here because...             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 Is it also...             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 ...You can no longer just pretend - hey, we don't want to regulate things - when people's privacy is being breached on a daily basis.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 One question that's come up is whether Facebook violated the 2011 Federal Trade Commission settlement. The settlement...             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 The consent decree.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 Yeah, exactly. Consent degree, it required getting users' explicit consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings that Facebook has established. In your view, was that FTC agreement violated?             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 That FTC agreement was about not sharing personal data. So I don't quite understand how it couldn't have been violated. That is something that they are debating, I'm sure, at the FTC. But this feels like a different level of wrongdoing because when Mark Zuckerberg appeared before us, the joint Senate and Commerce committees, you know, we never heard anything about this. And when you think about it, a lot of this seemed to have ended right when they were getting caught.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 To Zuckerberg's role, how should he be held accountable? Should he go?             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 Well, one of the bills that's pretty interesting - and I'm not going to the internal decisions in the company - but is Data Care Act, which would put that kind of accountability on the company, creating a fiduciary duty for these companies to protect their information, just like you have for doctors, just like you have for lawyers. And I think we need to start...             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 But in terms of Congress, super-overseeing this company...             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 But that would be...             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 ...You're not going to get into what this company should do in terms of who should be leading it.             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 I think that that's going to be a decision of the company, of the shareholders. But I do think if you look at it in a bigger, more systemic way with tech, the answer is to create a standard, a fiduciary duty because, again, they have literally been coming into our office and saying - hey, we can take care of ourselves, and it's really complicated. Well, they can't. OK? They have created this monster, basically, that has so many good things that's part of it. There's a friendly part of the monster. But then it has created vulnerabilities for our democracy, vulnerabilities for cyberattacks, vulnerabilities for stealing data and intruding on people's privacy.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 Change of subject, if I may - are you running for president in 2020?             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 I am considering it. And...             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 You're smiling, I should say.             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 I'm considering it and talking to...             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 You showed up in Iowa recently.             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 There we are. Well, you know, Minnesotans like to go south for the winter.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 And talking with people who I've worked with for many years and with my family, I had the unfortunate experience, when I decided to look at running for Senate, of my husband finding out about it on the radio when I did an interview just like this before I had discussed it with him.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 Well, feel free to break news...             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 There you go.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 ...And surprise him again.             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 No, I don't think so. So anyway - so I'm considering it. I think it's important to have a lot of different voices from different parts of the country.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 What might tip the balance for you?             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 Again, you have to - it is a daunting decision, and you have to decide that you would want to do this, that you have that capacity to win, that you are someone that can beat Donald Trump and that would be a good president. And those are all separate things. And so I think you've got to make that decision with an affirmative yes to all of them.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 I do notice that some of your fellow senators and potential competitors, should you decide to run for the Democratic nomination, have been polishing the foreign policy pages of their resumes. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren just gave big foreign policy speeches recently. Kamala Harris just showed up in Afghanistan. Any travel plans - dropping by Afghanistan, Iraq over the holidays?             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 (Laughter) Well, I've gone to both places in the past and have really worked hard on some of these issues from my position on the Judiciary Committee because we had jurisdiction over some of the terrorism laws. I also am a former prosecutor. And I've also worked on...             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 Although you don't currently have a committee seat on Foreign Affairs or Armed Services...             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 No, but I'm on Judiciary...             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 ...Or Intelligence.             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 And then Minnesota has a huge refugee population, so I've worked on that issue all over the world as well. So I think any member of this Senate has to be able to show their foreign relations chops at any moment, whether it was the recent debate we had on Yemen or whether it is trade issues or working with our allies. So thinking, it's something that you have to do as part of being a senator.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota.             </p><p>                Best of luck as you make up your mind. And thanks for stopping by.             </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 Thank you.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 And to circle back to the Facebook part of that interview, we did ask them for a statement. And they sent us this - quote, \"Facebook's partners don't get to ignore people's privacy settings, and it's wrong to suggest that they do.\" Facebook also wrote, \"we know we've got work to do to regain people's trust. Protecting people's information requires stronger teams, better technology and clearer policies. And that's where we have been focused for most of 2018.\"             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-201812192001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V0W-VM21-JBJH-30RH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1922\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 19, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The BROWSER Act requires communications and technology companies to provide users with clear and conspicuous notice of their privacy policies and the ability to opt-in to the collection of sensitive information and to opt-out of the collection of non-sensitive information. It also prohibits these companies from denying their service to users who refuse to waive their privacy rights, empowers the Federal Trade Commission to enforce these rules, and ensures we have a consistent national law regarding online privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Watch Senator Blackburn's full floor remarks by clicking below or HERE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senator Blackburn previously introduced this bill in the House of Representatives during the 115th Congress.</p><p>Transcript of Floor Remarks (as prepared):</p><p>Today, I rise to speak to you about the legislation I introduced in the Senate this week: S. 1116, the BROWSER Act.</p><p>Broadband, or high-speed internet, has absolutely revolutionized the way we communicate, the way we conduct commerce and, actually, the way we participate in government.</p><p>Broadband is one of the greatest innovations in history.</p><p>It allows near instantaneous exchange of information and brings efficiencies to the daily lives of millions of Americans as they move more of their transactional life online.</p><p>Thanks to Broadband, entrepreneurs have been able to bring thousands of new applications to consumers.</p><p>These \"edge services\" are now an essential part of our lives.</p><p>We find ourselves everyday saying, \"I can't imagine what we did before we had this, or before we had that.\"</p><p>These \"apps\" give consumers access to entertainment, news, information, help us drive around town, and access to emergency services.</p><p>As consumers use these apps, they generate massive amounts of data about themselves... and that is the problem.</p><p>Many companies collect this data and use it for a range of purposes without the user's knowledge.</p><p>Without your knowledge. They're collecting all this.</p><p>Every bill you pay and every website that you visit.</p><p>These platforms are following you.</p><p>So, Mr. President, after all this information is shared, the question is:</p><p>Who owns the Virtual You?</p><p>Who owns you and your presence online? Our laws have not kept pace with technological change.</p><p>Now, we see some states and we've even got some cities that are adding more complexity to the problem by enacting their own privacy rules and standards, despite the fact that digital commerce is not restricted to one area.</p><p>Digital commerce is interstate and global in nature.</p><p>Mr. President, it is time we had a consistent national law regarding online privacy.</p><p>We need one set of rules and one regulator for the entire internet ecosystem. It just makes sense.</p><p>That is why I introduced the legislation I previously proposed as a member of the House of Representatives. And, as I said, it is called the BROWSER Act.</p><p>Americans want to be certain that their privacy is protected both in the physical and the virtual space.</p><p>Broadband users, which are each and every one of us, should have the right to say who can or cannot access their private data.</p><p>Think about it. At this point, how and when you pay your bills, the credit cards that you use, the sites that you visit, the merchandise that you shop for, friends that you connect with.</p><p>There is somebody tracking that activity.</p><p>Every move of the mouse: they're on it.</p><p>Consumers should have the right to clear and conspicuous notice of service provider's privacy policies, and the ability to either opt-in or opt-out depending on the sensitive nature of that data.</p><p>The BROWSER Act requires digital service to provide users with clear and conspicuous notice of their rights.</p><p>It also requires digital services to provide users the ability to opt-in to the collection of sensitive information while also giving users the ability to opt-out of the collection of non-sensitive information.</p><p>By allowing for a clear and conspicuous notification process, consumers will be able to make a more educated choice about the nature of the relationships they want to have with online vendors and with tech companies.</p><p>Furthermore, the BROWSER Act will prohibit digital services from denying the service to users who refuse to waive their personal privacy rights.</p><p>The BROWSER Act also empowers the FTC (the Federal Trade Commission) to enforce these rules using its unfair or deceptive acts or practices authorities.</p><p>Now, the FTC has been our privacy regulator in both the physical and the online space.</p><p>Just this week, Senator Klobuchar and I sent a letter to the FTC urging stronger action for bad actors in the tech space.</p><p>Companies like Facebook and Google have transformed society in revolutionary ways and need to recognize that with that great power, comes great responsibility.</p><p>This is the 21st century. It is not the Wild West.</p><p>These tech companies need to be respectful of your privacy rights.</p><p>My hope is through bipartisan effort, we will shed light on the need to protect online competition and privacy to keep up with the fast pace changes in technology.</p><p>The FTC has a responsibility to hold tech companies accountable for securing their platforms.</p><p>We need them to step up and be the cop on the beat in the virtual space.</p><p>Before I yield the floor, I want to make one last point.</p><p>The BROWSER Act treats everyone in broadband and edge companies the same.</p><p>One regulator, one set of rules: this is commonsense.</p><p>Unfortunately, yesterday, Democrats in the House passed a bill to regulate broadband service providers.</p><p>But, guess what? Guess what?</p><p>They didn't do anything to big tech.</p><p>They didn't do anything about privacy with Google, with Facebook, with Yahoo these people that collect your data and sell it to the highest bidder and then that person markets back to you.</p><p>When I chaired the Communications Subcommittee in the House, I repeatedly offered to work with the other side of the aisle to preserve a free and open internet.</p><p>I am always happy to work together to find a legislative solution and put this so-called Net Neutrality issue to rest once and for all.</p><p>But, rather than work together on this, the House pushed through a hyper-partisan bill to re-instate a controversial heavy-handed regulation of communications companies.</p><p>But, Heaven forbid, they do not want to touch Big Tech who are their big buddies.</p><p>Leader McConnell has said, and I am so grateful he has said, this bill coming from the House is \"dead on arrival\" in the Senate... and I look forward to continuing to work on this issue.</p><p>But, here is what my friends across the aisle and my friends in the House need to realize: the internet is not broken. The internet is not broken.</p><p>Many of you, Madam President, probably have an electronic device close at hand. It is working just fine.</p><p>The internet does not need the intervention of Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats. It is just fine. It is going to be fine by itself.</p><p>In fact, as an alternative, we could just strike out the text of the House bill and insert the BROWSER Act in its place.</p><p>One set of rules. One set of rules for the entire internet ecosystem.</p><p>One set of rules enforced by one federal regulator. That's the BROWSER Act. It's about fairness.</p><p>It's about encouraging innovation. It's about making certain we keep a fair and open Internet.</p><p>Madam President, I yield the floor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122889193</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0W-67R1-JCBF-S051-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1242\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

A young woman, Imani Tyson, she's sixteen-years-old, in high school in Bridgeport, and she's telling us: 'wake up / stand up / they gonna knock you down / stand up / they're gonna run you around / stand up!' The voice of Deon Forbes, ten-years old, six years younger than Imani. 'They kill us because we are strong. They kill us because we are powerful. Our lives matter. We deserve to breathe.'

During the second panel, Blumenthal continued to share the experiences of Black Connecticut residents, especially regarding their encounters with the police.

The bill will help create jobs and boost environmental preservation efforts by addressing maintenance backlogs on federal land and permanently funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF): \"The Senate's bipartisan passage of this legislation is a victory for the great outdoors of Connecticut and the nation. As our country continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, this bill provides a much-needed boost for the recreational economy and secures full, permanent funding for the indispensable Land and Water Conservation Fund. This landmark bill will help support outdoor recreation jobs including those in working forests like Skiff Mountain, preserve precious habitats like the Stewart McKinney National Wildlife Refuge, and protect our public lands for generations to come. I will fight to ensure that this bill swiftly passes the House and is promptly signed into law.\"</p><p>* During a hearing of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) demanded Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator Stephen Dickson take stronger action to reclaim authority over safety oversight it has previously delegated to aircraft manufacturers.

Whatever the criticisms I may have of the current law, using overblown claims of online \"anti-conservative bias\" to suppress free speech is absolutely unacceptable. My bipartisan efforts to narrow the scope of Section 230 have been carefully crafted to address Big Tech's most egregious failures to protect survivors of human trafficking and children who have been horrifically abused, while including ironclad protections for free expression. I'm deeply concerned that President Trump and Attorney General Barr are exploiting Big Tech's complicity in human misery to advance their own political agenda.\"</p><p>* U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released the following statement after the Supreme Court upheld protections for Dreamers and ordered the Trump Administration to halt its wind down of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program: \"My heart soars - for our beautiful, great nation, and for millions of young wonderful immigrants who will make it even greater. The rule of law has won against mean-spirited lawless leaders, renewing trust in our courts. We should be inspired by this historic legal victory to radically reform the present broken immigration system. Comprehensive immigration reform is no less urgent and vital. This ruling is a landmark legal victory that will prevent the immense heartbreak of draconian mass deportation, but can never erase the massive suffering caused by Trump's cruel, illegal policies. Today is a welcome reprieve. Dreamers need and deserve permanent status and a pathway to citizenship. Congress must act now and pass the Dream Act.\"</p><p>* U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, voted against the confirmation of Justin Walker to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Blumenthal spoke out against the nomination on the Senate Floor last night.

The Navy's decision follows the conclusion of its Command Investigation into the outbreak of COVID-19 aboard the vessel and the decision to remove Captain Crozier from command: \"We have serious reservations about this decision, which comes as a surprise. We will carefully review the Navy's report, but we are disappointed that the initial recommendation to reinstate Captain Crozier has been rescinded without any major new findings of fact. When the COVID-19 pandemic was beginning to take hold, there was no formal training in place and the military was responding - like the rest of the world - without clearly defined safety precautions. The Navy's decision now seems to apply a retroactive standard and after-the-fact procedures and practices to justify Captain Crozier's firing. In the absence of any solid new evidence, the perception will regrettably remain that Captain Crozier's removal was retaliation for his email raising concerns about the safety of his sailors.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COS1K506192020</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6066-T501-DYVR-P1N6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3241\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 19, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

Ron Wyden, (D-OR) proclaimed that Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg should face dire consequences for how he has chosen to run the platform. </p><p>However, he also calls for more censorship of the internet as a whole.Wyden also hammered the First Amendment, saying that 'A lot of people don't realize the First Amendment is what creates the biggest opportunity for hate speech.' He then noted by contrast that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act 'provides an opportunity to address hate speech without the bad guys going off to the Dark Web.'Wyden was one of the authors of 230, which protects social media companies from being prosecuted for illegal activity that happens on their platforms on the condition they behave as open platforms for public conversationIn a Willamette Week article[1] titled 'Ron Wyden Doesn't Apologize for Helping Build the Internet\u2014But He's Interested in Sending Mark Zuckerberg to Prison,' Wyden elaborated on the perils of the modern internet. Hespoke of Section 230's impact, which 'allowed the net to grow from being a niche tool for academics and well-off folks to creating enormous opportunities for people without clout.'Wyden specifically hammered Big Tech, though not for the reasons conservatives would. 'Your companies have done practically everything wrong since the 2016 election,' he wrote. He later added, 'If you don't get serious on moderation, you're going to have a lot of people coming after you. And they're going to be in a very strong position.\"He has a particularly venomous appraisal of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who he claimed: has repeatedly lied to the American people about privacy. I think he ought to be held personally accountable, which is everything from financial fines to\u2014and let me underline this\u2014the possibility of a prison term. Because he hurt a lot of people. He has called for better moderation, particularly against 'all the hatemongers,' which, to free speech advocates, is a step down the slippery slope to censorship. On the other hand, Wyden mentioned that when 'Barack Obama said you had to give up 10 percent of your liberty to have security,' he 'wanted to throw a rock at my television set.'In a statement[2] posted on his government website, Wyden said 'tech companies certainly need to continue to be far more vigorous about identifying, fingerprinting and blocking content and individuals who incite hate and violence.'

Ron Wyden, (D-OR) proclaimed that Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg should face dire consequences for how he has chosen to run the platform. </p><p>However, he also calls for more censorship of the internet as a whole.Wyden also hammered the First Amendment, saying that 'A lot of people don't realize the First Amendment is what creates the biggest opportunity for hate speech.' He then noted by contrast that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act 'provides an opportunity to address hate speech without the bad guys going off to the Dark Web.'Wyden was one of the authors of 230, which protects social media companies from being prosecuted for illegal activity that happens on their platforms on the condition they behave as open platforms for public conversationIn a Willamette Week article[1] titled 'Ron Wyden Doesn't Apologize for Helping Build the Internet But He's Interested in Sending Mark Zuckerberg to Prison,' Wyden elaborated on the perils of the modern internet. Hespoke of Section 230's impact, which 'allowed the net to grow from being a niche tool for academics and well-off folks to creating enormous opportunities for people without clout.'Wyden specifically hammered Big Tech, though not for the reasons conservatives would. 'Your companies have done practically everything wrong since the 2016 election,' he wrote. He later added, 'If you don't get serious on moderation, you're going to have a lot of people coming after you. And they're going to be in a very strong position.\"He has a particularly venomous appraisal of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who he claimed: has repeatedly lied to the American people about privacy. I think he ought to be held personally accountable, which is everything from financial fines to and let me underline this the possibility of a prison term. Because he hurt a lot of people. He has called for better moderation, particularly against 'all the hatemongers,' which, to free speech advocates, is a step down the slippery slope to censorship. On the other hand, Wyden mentioned that when 'Barack Obama said you had to give up 10 percent of your liberty to have security,' he 'wanted to throw a rock at my television set.'In a statement[2] posted on his government website, Wyden said 'tech companies certainly need to continue to be far more vigorous about identifying, fingerprinting and blocking content and individuals who incite hate and violence.' Big Tech, he said, should be doing far more to 'clean up their platforms' on their own.

Sen. Ron Wyden, (D-OR) proclaimed that Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg should face dire consequences for how he has chosen to run the platform. </p><p>However, he also calls for more censorship of the internet as a whole. Wyden also hammered the First Amendment, saying that 'A lot of people don't realize the First Amendment is what creates the biggest opportunity for hate speech.' He then noted by contrast that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act 'provides an opportunity to address hate speech without the bad guys going off to the Dark Web.' Wyden was one of the authors of 230, which protects social media companies from being prosecuted for illegal activity that happens on their platforms on the condition they behave as open platforms for public conversation In a Willamette Week article[1] titled 'Ron Wyden Doesn't Apologize for Helping Build the Internet\u2014But He's Interested in Sending Mark Zuckerberg to Prison,' Wyden elaborated on the perils of the modern internet. Hespoke of Section 230's impact, which 'allowed the net to grow from being a niche tool for academics and well-off folks to creating enormous opportunities for people without clout.' Wyden specifically hammered Big Tech, though not for the reasons conservatives would. 'Your companies have done practically everything wrong since the 2016 election,' he wrote. He later added, 'If you don't get serious on moderation, you're going to have a lot of people coming after you. And they're going to be in a very strong position.' He has a particularly venomous appraisal of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who he claimed: has repeatedly lied to the American people about privacy. I think he ought to be held personally accountable, which is everything from financial fines to\u2014and let me underline this\u2014the possibility of a prison term. Because he hurt a lot of people. He has called for better moderation, particularly against 'all the hatemongers,' which, to free speech advocates, is a step down the slippery slope to censorship. On the other hand, Wyden mentioned that when 'Barack Obama said you had to give up 10 percent of your liberty to have security,' he 'wanted to throw a rock at my television set.' In a statement[2] posted on his government website, Wyden said 'tech companies certainly need to continue to be far more vigorous about identifying, fingerprinting and blocking content and individuals who incite hate and violence.' Big Tech, he said, should be doing far more to 'clean up their platforms' on their own. Alexander Hall[3] contributes posts at the NewsBusters site, and he is a staff writer for MRC TechWatch.

Josh Hawley on Monday issued a rare rebuke of the government agency that oversees Facebook, Google and other tech giants, charging that regulators had \"failed\" to protect consumers' personal data from abuse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, the lawmaker from Missouri urged the agency's leaders to take a more aggressive stance toward Silicon Valley, starting with investigations into tech companies for violating their users' privacy repeatedly over the past year.</p><p>Hawley said there is \"substantial evidence\" that Facebook had broken a 2011 agreement with the FTC that settled an earlier probe into its privacy practices - a breach that could trigger steep federal fines. He also faulted Facebook for its earlier efforts to monitor app usage by children and adults through a tool that was loaded onto iPhones in a way that angered Apple.</p><p>With Google, meanwhile, Hawley charged that the search giant had \"consistently misinformed users about its use of geolocation data,\" at times collecting that information from Android smartphones even when device owners thought they had disabled the tracking of their whereabouts.</p><p>In response to these and other high-profile privacy missteps, Hawley said the FTC so far \"has been toothless,\" and he urged the agency to use all the power at its disposal to investigate big tech companies - or tell Congress if it's outmatched and needs help.</p><p>\"For too long our nation has put off accounting for the price we paid in return for the benefits of the online platforms that now dominate American culture and industry,\" Hawley wrote to FTC Chairman Joseph J. Simons, a fellow Republican.</p><p>\"These companies have failed us. Washington has failed us. The FTC has a special role to play, but it too has failed us,\" Hawley said.</p><p>Hawley's missive arrived a day before the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which he is a member, was set to hold a hearing about online privacy and the future of regulation. Google is expected to testify at the Tuesday session, according to two sources familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak on the record. A spokesman for the panel's chairman, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Facebook and Google also did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The FTC has been investigating Facebook over its entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that improperly accessed data on 87 million of the social site's users - but Facebook has denied that breach broke its earlier agreement with the agency. Google has said it provides clear tools to control what happens to users' location data.</p><p>More than a century old, the FTC serves as the U.S. government's de facto privacy cop because of its mandate to police businesses for unfair or deceptive acts and practices. In recent months, the agency has taken some action on tech issues, levying a fine against the social app now known as TikTok for collecting personal data on children, and creating a special task force to oversee competition in the tech industry. A spokesman for the FTC did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Still, the FTC has faced fierce criticism across the political spectrum for failing to penalize wrongdoers in the tech industry. Roughly a dozen consumer-privacy organizations in January called on Congress to create an entirely new \"federal agency focused on privacy protection, compliance with data protection obligations, and emerging privacy challenges.\" Some of those groups, led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, have urged the FTC to complete its investigation into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica before the first anniversary of the probe passes this month.</p><p>Democrats and Republicans in Congress have started to discuss new legislation targeting the data-collection practices of Facebook, Google and other tech giants.

Josh Hawley on Monday issued a rare rebuke of the government agency that oversees Facebook, Google and other tech giants, charging that regulators had \"failed\" to protect consumers' personal data from abuse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, the lawmaker from Missouri urged the agency's leaders to take a more aggressive stance toward Silicon Valley, starting with investigations into tech companies for violating their users' privacy repeatedly over the past year.</p><p>Hawley said there is \"substantial evidence\" that Facebook had broken a 2011 agreement with the FTC that settled an earlier probe into its privacy practices - a breach that could trigger steep federal fines. He also faulted Facebook for its earlier efforts to monitor app usage by children and adults through a tool that was loaded onto iPhones in a way that angered Apple.</p><p>With Google, meanwhile, Hawley charged that the search giant had \"consistently misinformed users about its use of geolocation data,\" at times collecting that information from Android smartphones even when device owners thought they had disabled the tracking of their whereabouts.</p><p>In response to these and other high-profile privacy missteps, Hawley said the FTC so far \"has been toothless,\" and he urged the agency to use all the power at its disposal to investigate big tech companies - or tell Congress if it's outmatched and needs help.</p><p>\"For too long our nation has put off accounting for the price we paid in return for the benefits of the online platforms that now dominate American culture and industry,\" Hawley wrote to FTC Chairman Joseph J. Simons, a fellow Republican.</p><p>\"These companies have failed us. Washington has failed us. The FTC has a special role to play, but it too has failed us,\" Hawley said.</p><p>Hawley's missive arrived a day before the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which he is a member, was set to hold a hearing about online privacy and the future of regulation. Google is expected to testify at the Tuesday session, according to two sources familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak on the record. A spokesman for the panel's chairman, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Facebook and Google also did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The FTC has been investigating Facebook over its entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that improperly accessed data on 87 million of the social site's users - but Facebook has denied that breach broke its earlier agreement with the agency. Google has said it provides clear tools to control what happens to users' location data.</p><p>More than a century old, the FTC serves as the U.S. government's de facto privacy cop because of its mandate to police businesses for unfair or deceptive acts and practices. In recent months, the agency has taken some action on tech issues, levying a fine against the social app now known as TikTok for collecting personal data on children, and creating a special task force to oversee competition in the tech industry. A spokesman for the FTC did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Still, the FTC has faced fierce criticism across the political spectrum for failing to penalize wrongdoers in the tech industry. Roughly a dozen consumer-privacy organizations in January called on Congress to create an entirely new \"federal agency focused on privacy protection, compliance with data protection obligations, and emerging privacy challenges.\" Some of those groups, led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, have urged the FTC to complete its investigation into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica before the first anniversary of the probe passes this month.</p><p>Democrats and Republicans in Congress have started to discuss new legislation targeting the data-collection practices of Facebook, Google and other tech giants. The United States lacks an overarching federal consumer privacy law, even though states, led by California, have adopted their own rules. The European Union leads the world as the toughest regulator of tech companies.</p><p>Democrats generally have called for granting the FTC stronger authority, along with more money and new staff, to police privacy abuses.

Elizabeth Warren[1](D-Mass.) unveiled a plan Friday morning to promote competition in the tech sector by breaking up tech giants including Amazon, Google and Facebook.'Today's big tech companies have too much power \u2015 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. </p><p>They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,' Warren wrote in a post published on Medium[2].'I want a government that makes sure everybody \u2015 even the biggest and most powerful companies in America \u2015 plays by the rules. And I want to make sure that the next generation of great American tech companies can flourish,' she continued. 'To do that, we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.'Warren is proposing 'two major steps,' she said. The first would be passing legislation that designates certain large tech platforms as utilities that 'would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform.' The second would be appointing regulators that would 'unwind anti-competitive mergers,' like Amazon and Whole Foods, and Facebook and Instagram.Warren is visiting New York's Long Island City neighborhood for a campaign event Friday night.This is a developing story.

Senator Warren: So, you know, my reaction last night is Donald Trump[4] demonstrated again why he should not be President of the United States of America. And look, you didn't have to watch the whole thing. All you had to do was just see that little clip, when he was asked to denounce white racism. Right, white supremacy. And what did he say he told the proud boys to stand by. That should do it for every person in this country. That is not the America that we want to be the America we want to be is an America that lifts up all of us that creates opportunity for all of us. Donald Trump just made it clear that's not who he is. And just in case that didn't seal the deal. His closer. That sounded a lot like to me that he was encouraging his supporters to go out and engage in voter intimidation, to keep American citizens from voting and getting their votes counted. That one really should have done it. So, you know, in that sense, to me, really short debate, two clips right there where Donald Trump made it clear that he cannot be trusted. As the leader of our nation. Cramer: Okay, understood. And I think that there's an American way. And I think that we all deal with the American ways so now let me get to something that you are the expert on. I am struggling with your views, because your views actually are very similar to what I regard is Ronald Reagan's views, actually when it comes to the disparity of wealth between CEOs and workers but I need to know do you think that it's possible, like, Marc Benioff from Salesforce says that business can be the greatest force for social change. Senator Warren: I believe that we can make change. But let's be clear about this. We live in a democracy and the whole premise behind that is it's one person, one vote. And that's how we're going to create a set of rules that work for all of us right it's that simple. But notice I could hear you before I came on and what were you talking about you're talking about Donald Trump's taxes. Right. And you were doing this fine lawyerly conversation about. Did he evade or avoid right did he stay on this side of the line, or that side of the line, frankly, Jim, it's the wrong question. The question is, how did we end up with a tax system that lets Donald Trump claim to be earning millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars. And it's a baby. Here are the loopholes that Donald Trump and people just like Donald Trump can slice through. How did we end up in an America where the average nurse pays what 15, 18 $20,000 in taxes the average teacher pays that kind of money in taxes that workers across this nation, literally, they paid 10s of thousands of dollars in taxes. People have quite moderate incomes middle class America, but Donald Trump can pay $750 in taxes. The problem here is that the system itself is broken and you gotta ask why and you want to know why. The reason is because of the Donald Trump's of the world. The people who have used their money and used their influence to get Congress to keep rewriting those laws, you know it's not like a bunch of lawmakers woke up one day and said, Gosh, we can help up nurses and teachers and and and and people who stopped grocery store shelves, or we could help out real estate developers, I know, let's give everything to the real estate developers and take it all away from everyone else. That's what's wrong with the system. It is the capture of government by the rich and powerful to make themselves richer and more powerful. Cramer: Senator Warren you're there. Is there a way to actually break the stranglehold you're you are fabulous professor, and you understood the code. You know how hard the code is what happens if you took a regular approach and just said you know what the code is no good. And what we're going to do is have everybody pay the same tax on everything, real estate stock, it doesn't matter. It's simple we make the code, two pages, America becomes a richer wealthier and absolutely more distributed, a distributed country. And I think you and I would agree that that's the way that should be the American way. Senator Warren: I'm all for rewriting the tax code, are you kidding, I mean, let's go. But the point is, we've got to break the influence of rich folks who make their voices heard, not a little bit, not a medium sized amount, not even a huge amount. They make their voices heard in Washington louder than anything else, you know, what was the one legislative achievement of Donald Trump, and the republicans do remember the one thing they managed to get through Congress, a trillion dollar tax cut[5] that went largely to millionaires and billionaires and giant corporations and remember all those promises they made about what it was going to do for the economy and so you remember what the one thing actually did that you can measure is that it drove down revenues for the government to be able to run everything else. And, and that's the thing. Jim about this. It's not just that Donald Trump doesn't pay taxes, it's somebody else has to pay to keep this country going. Somebody has to pay for the roads and bridges. Somebody has to pay for the military. Somebody has to pay to keep our country working and nurses pay a big share teachers pay a big share grocery store clerks pay a big share and Donald Trump, just pays a tiny little bit. And that's because why money, Cramer: Do you still believe strongly in your idea that there should be a levy on accumulated wealth and your two cents on the dollar 2% on the porch is about 50 million to half a percent about 1 billion is that a way to get at it. Senator Warren: Sure. It's one of the ways we can do. Come on, Jim, people have been paying wealth taxes across this country forever. They're just usually called property taxes. And all I'm saying is for the top one 10th of 1% this tiny little fraction at the top, to say you know what, when you pay your wealth tax, it's not all just real estate for you. Let's include the stock portfolios and the diamonds and the rimbrant and give us just two cents, three cents if you're a billionaire on the dollar. And that will produce enough money because ultimately it's who's gonna pay that would give us enough money to provide child care for every baby in this country age zero to five universal pre K, it would give us enough money to pump billions of dollars into K 12 enough money to cancel student loan debt enough money to put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities and enough money to make four years at a public institution tuition free for every kid who wants to get an education, technical school two year college four year college in other words, what it means to sense and invest in a whole generation of young people, we could build such a future in this country. Cramer: Well let me push back in a realistic way, but you're talking about a Jeff Bezos paying huge amount you're talking about a Steve Ballmer pay huge amount you're talking about very powerful people. Mark Zuckerberg paying huge amount. These are people who are going to fight you tooth and nail they have incredible resources, what do you do, do you just decide, you know what I am going to beat these guys. Senator Warren, they have unlimited firepower. Senator Warren: Wow, did you hear what he just said, This is about power. And you've just said, Be realistic in this democracy in 2020 boy folks in Washington, need to listen to Jeff Bezos because he's rich and not listen to the school teacher or the nurse or the grocery store clerk, because after all, they're not. That is not how democracy is supposed to work. And I'll tell you this, when you know that Cramer: you don't. I mean, you understand that. Look, I, I want the school teachers I want to go back to the senator wittings day when I was doing. He was my professor, where we want to do guaranteed income for all these people with no taxes i mean i think that these people would should even that was Nixon's plan I mean, he'll think about the people I'm talking about, you know, Nixon favored higher taxes for the rich and lower taxes for the poor, or for the working poor Reagan favored higher taxes for the rich and lower taxes for the working poor. What the hell happened in our country that two of the most, I mean you can't you're supposed to mention Nixon but you know both of those presidents favored a better redistribution that we have now, how'd that happen. Senator Warren: Well partly Citizens United. It's corruption in Washington. It's the influence of money and understand it absolutely is it's about money for campaign contributions, but it is so much more. It is about the lobbyists, it's about the bought and paid for think tanks. It's about the experts who are taking money from the rich folks and from the industries. It's about these industry groups. It's about the fact that big businesses and billionaires have figured out, they're gonna make more return on their money by investing in twisting the rules in Washington to help them. And to help them keep more of their money, help them deregulate so that they can externalize their costs. They figured that out and they are just pushing them. The pedal to the metal on this. But I tell you Jim I'm not giving up. Cramer: I know you're not, I know you favorite breaking up tech little lightning round here, what do we do with alphabet, Google. Senator Warren: Got to break it got to break these guys up. And the reason for this understand on every one of them. The very best part of what we can make work in this economy is when you've got markets that are working. And that means you got to have competition. So these guys who engage in these anti-competitive practices, the guys who engage in monopolistic practices, the guys who crush or buy up their competitors and just keep getting bigger, understand this. It's not only what they're doing. It's what they're doing to the rest of the market. It means we'll lose the vibrancy in the market, it means we lose the creativity, you've got a great idea, but you're going to go up against Amazon, you've got a terrific notion but you're going to be up against Google Good luck to you. And that's the whole point. that's the role of government, it's to blow the whistle and say these guys when they get too big when they get too dominant in market. Nope, can't do that. Got to break them apart, and get more competition going Cramer: ok well how about the banks, I mean we're hearing, we'll get there isn't a day that goes by that we don't read about a giant fine, which of course is paid by the shareholders senator, we read about how they may not be able to find the limited pool of black talent at these banks I mean we're, which of course is wrong. I don't understand how the banks, stay this size when they obviously can't Avoid chicanery. Senator Warren: No and what you are exactly right. Part of this lay, again, at the feet of the bank regulators who are far more interested in watching out for the banks and helping them make sure that they get plenty of profits. But part of this is laid truly at the feet of our willingness to let the giants call the shots in Washington. And that's true whether you're talking about banking or you're talking about tech, or you're talking about big AG. It's the power and the money of these giants who are here. Who are saying, 'no, no, no. We like business as usual.' You know, every time someone talks about nothing ever happens in Washington, you know, except that giant tax cut that Trump got through, and they use words like gridlock. Understand, this isn't about gridlock. This is about the system works great for those giants. Because nobody's in there to say we're going to enforce the antitrust laws, or we're going to toughen the antitrust laws, or we're going to stitch up those tax loopholes. And that's what we got to do. Cramer: Okay, so let's think about this for a second. You ran for President. Everything you articulated was right there. I know a huge number of young people, I don't know as many older people - I know a huge number of young people who swear by you. Why did you not win the nomination? Senator Warren: Well, I wish I knew the answer to that one, but I lost. But look, I'm not sorry I ran because the things I argued for are still out there. The problems we have are still every bit as big as they were. Indeed, with this COVID-19[6], it has even gotten bigger. Inequality in this country, I talked about it every day when I was out on the trail. But look what we see now. Communities of color hit disproportionately hard by COVID-19. Just peel back that layer just a little bit and what do people start to understand finally? This has to do with generations of systemic racism, and it has to do with a black white wealth gap, a health gap, an entrepreneurship opportunity gap, an education gap, a housing gap. Racism that has pervaded the system and kept us from being the America that we should be. Cramer: And Senator, you left one out, of which I agree with all those, but you left one out. Gender diversity, okay. How about this statistic that I got from - I'm familiar with because I used to own it. We are number 17 in the world in the percentage of female board members. How pathetic is that given the fact that women run 40% of the household spend -- of their finances, but almost 100% of their buying. How did this number occur? Why is that number occuring? Senator Warren: So look, we know the data on this. And that is folks who've got power, don't give it up easy Jim. If you're part of the club, you keep that power close and that means we have a lot of white men who are holding on to the power they've got and they don't plan to share it. They don't plan to share it with women, they don't plan to share it with African Americans, they don't plan to share it with Native Americans, they don't plan to share it with Latinos. That's the way this works. But here's the thing, Jim, there's more votes - Cramer: But here's what confuses me. I know you and you understand markets. The most highest-rated, meaning the highest PE multiple stock, in the food group is McCormick, which also has the greatest diversity in the boardroom of any company in the food group. Now, is that not cut and dried? That if you want to do well, you become diverse. So what are these people missing? I didn't call them clowns out of respect of last night's debate. Why is it that these people at these boards don't look at McCormick and say, 'hey you know what? They're the most diverse. Most women, most Latino, most African American and they are doing better than everyone else.' Why can't people see that? You and I see it. Senator Warren: You know Jim, I'm just going to underline your point because I think you're so right on this. I think that the evidence showed coming out of the 2008 crash that companies that had more than one woman on their board, companies that had women in well placed positions in the U.S. and around the world, those companies did better. They did better in terms of not crashing so hard and making it out faster on the other side. It is the reminder that you don't pull together a diverse team out of some notion of trying to engage in charity for someone. You pull together a diverse team, because a diverse team is what will make you strong. It is what will make you profitable. It is what will make your country -- your company robust and make your country strong. So, you do it out of - but that's not how these guys look at it. You know, sometimes it takes getting a little bit out of your comfort zone, running the risk of making a mistake. And a lot of folks don't want to do that. Not the guys who already had the power. Cramer: You have proposed something that is so brilliant. Small business equity fund. A fund to close the gap, create 100,000 new minority businesses, your price tag is only 7 billion. Senator Warren why isn't that done right now? Senator Warren: No kidding. Cramer: Let's get it done. Senator Warren: Let me just lay it down so I'm sure everybody's following on this. So, what the data show is a lot of people talk about that Black-owned businesses need access to be able to borrow more money. But when you look at the comparisons with Black-owned businesses and white-owned businesses, what you see is it is no. They need some seed money, they need some equity to get them started and to cushion them in the early parts of getting those businesses launched. And that equity usually comes from accumulated family wealth. And where does that come from? It comes from homeownership. So, watch what happens here, Jim. For decades, decades in America, African Americans were just largely cut out the opportunity to buy homes. It was redlining. And cut out of the federally insured mortgages. And that wasn't just an idea. It was literally the law of the United States into the mid-1960s. So, as white families were building up more wealth through their homes, and building up more intergenerational wealth - that is you know if grandma and grandpa could stay in the home until they died, they pass it on to the grandchildren or when they sold it there be a little more for the next generation -- that becomes the spur to be able to start a successful small business. African Americans just got cut out of that. For $7 billion, we could close that gap and African Americans, people of color who have been cut out for generations, would have the same kind of opportunity not just to start a small business but to start it and help it succeed. Cramer: Who's fighting that, Senator Warren? Who is fighting something that I think, again, is the American way? Which is equal opportunity, it's in the Constitution. You know the Constitution better than anyone who ran for President because you were a tremendous professor of law. I don't get who could be against something that is deeply ingrained within the Constitution. Senator Warren: Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump, every single sitting Republican senator that enables Mitch McConnell[7] and Donald Trump. And I'll tell you exactly how. Every proposal, like that, that I put on the table and others put on the table, cannot get a vote in a Republican controlled Senate. I can't even get it out there for a floor debate to talk about what it would mean, and to be able to bring in Republicans and Democrats to vote for it. Mitch McConnell refuses to bring an idea like that, a bill like that and so many others, to the floor for a vote, and it goes back to what we talked about earlier. Why? Because he is there to serve the interests of the richest and most powerful. And if you put $7 billion of taxpayer money into equalizing entrepreneurial opportunity for people of color and for whites - that's $7 billion - that's going to have to come out of maybe their taxes. And they don't want any part of it. And besides that, they don't want the competition. They like things the way they are. Cramer: I want to leave a constructive note. Once again, what companies do the best? Take a company like Constellation Brands. They own Modelo and they own Corona. What do they do? They set up a fund for Latinos who have good ideas for any beverage. There. Why do they do it? Do they do it just because they are kind? Well, they happen to be kind, but they do it because they make more money for shareholders. How do we in a constructive way - you and me - get this done? How do we tell the tale that if you are more diverse, if you help minorities, if you invest in the community, you are going to have a higher stock price? That is true, Senator Warren. How do we get it out? Senator Warren: So, I love it. You keep talking about it, but understand this, Jim. Our responsibility is to change our government so it isn't just working for the rich and the powerful. We want to build opportunity in this nation. Opportunity for everyone. Not opportunity that is different depending on the color of your skin, or your gender, or who you love. We want to build opportunity. That's what builds the best America. And the way we do that is we build opportunity by making these kinds of investments. By understanding how racism and sexism and anti-Muslim attitudes have kept people from having those chances. It is the job of our government to say we're all going to pitch in a little so every kid gets a chance to build a future in this nation. Cramer: Senator Warren, I want to thank you so much. I think a lot of what you talked about is called again, I use the term American way, because that's how we grew up. That's what we learned. Somehow it got a little off track, but I know that you have strong convictions and a lot of these ideas. I'm sure there's pushback from hedge fund managers, pushback from the people at these big tech companies, but I think these must be discussed and never forget If you want your stock price higher be diverse. Thank you so much, Senator Warren. Always great to talk to you. Senator Warren: Always great talking to you, Jim. Take care.

Thank you for staying with me. I'm Ana Cabrera in New York. And on the U.S. border with Mexico this weekend little boys and girls, many of them without their parents, are behind locked doors on concrete floors sleeping in what amounts to cages.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That is how U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren describes the conditions inside a migrant children and family shelter in south Texas. She visited this center a short time ago and calls what she saw inside disturbing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN's Polo Sandoval is in McAllen, Texas.</p><p>And Polo, this was Senator Warren's first time inside one of these sprawling migrant centers on the border. Why was it important to her to see it firsthand and what did she tell reporters when she came out?</p><p>POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Ana, the senator has certainly added her voice to the chorus of Democratic critics who have been speaking out against President Trump's zero tolerance policy. Many of those lawmakers have been traveling to those facilities that process some of these families that are detained along that southwest border. The facility you see behind me is the one that she got an inside look of.</p><p>This is a facility that we have seen through handout images that were provided by the U.S. government just last week alone, and you see those people being housed behind that chain link fencing. And also covering themselves with that mylar, that aluminum-like-looking material as well.</p><p>This is also happening at the same time as we are learning that a child at a separate facility, one that is privately owned, privately operated and contracted by the U.S. government to care for some of these children, we now know that a 15-year-old child walked off one of those locations in Brownsville, Texas, not far from where we are. Only about 50 miles or so from our location here in McAllen, Texas.</p><p>What we know at this point is that this is a very important distinction to point out here, Ana. This child was not one of those recently separated from their parents so that their parents could be prosecuted but instead this 15-year-old Honduran boy crossed the border illegally unaccompanied and undocumented. It was part of the trend that we've followed for many, many years.</p><p>Of course in recent weeks, though, there is -- this is renewed attention on these locations that care for these children to make sure that these locations are caring for these children properly. Southwest Key, who owns and operates this facility, made -- in a statement points out that they are not a detention center, they are simply a childcare facility. So when one of these children wants to leave the facility, there's not a whole lot they can do except accompany or at least walk with that child to the perimeter and ask them to remain on premises once they cross that line, then authorities have to be called.</p><p>And that's exactly what took place yesterday afternoon. The Brownsville Police Department confirming for me that yes, they searched for this child in and around the center in Brownsville, Texas. But now sources familiar with this investigation and with that transpired now telling us that that child made it to Mexico and is in contact with their parents or at least relatives, rather, in the United States and is in the process of trying to make it back to his native Honduras -- Ana.</p><p>CABRERA: Polo Sandoval in McAllen, Texas. Thank you again.</p><p>Senator Warren there earlier likely responding to President Trump calling for deportations without judges or court cases. The Trump administration today also revealed its plan to reunify immigrant families separated near the U.S.-Mexico border.</p><p>Still there is confusion and lots of questions lingering on about the current status of hundreds of children who had already been separated from their parents. Though the Homeland Security Department insists it knows the location of every single child in question.</p><p>I want to go now to CNN White House correspondent Boris Sanchez.</p><p>Boris, what are we learning today about the president's evolving policies on immigration?</p><p>BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Hey there, Ana. Yes. President Trump today took a step in a direction that he had not before. In a tweet this morning he essentially called for these immigrants to not be afforded due process, to not have a typical legal procedure or a case completed before they're deported.</p><p>Here's what the president tweeted. He writes, quote, \"We cannot allow all of these people to invade our country. When somebody comes in, we must immediately with no judges or court cases bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and law and order. Most children come without parents. Our immigration policy is laughed at all over the world.\"</p><p>The president then went on to make a case for merit-based immigration. Notable that President Trump is calling these people who are fleeing political oppression, violence, economic despair, invaders essentially.</p><p>You did note that DHS in conjunction with the Department of Health and Human Services put out more details on their plan to try to reunify some of these families, acknowledging that there are still some 2,000 children that have been separated from their parents in the custody of Health and Human Services.</p><p>Effectively here's how it's going to work. They will remain under HHS custody until their parents' deportation proceedings are completed. Then at that point if a judge or legal proceedings determine that their family -- their parents should be deported they'll be reunified before deportation.</p><p>[18:05:08] If a judge ultimately grants a stay to their parents, their parent can then apply to become a sponsor of the child, and they can be reunified and remain within the United States. Both agencies are acknowledging that there is some work to do when it comes to collecting information from these families. They want to beef up data bases that contain personal details about them, in part to help facilitate communication between these families.</p><p>Further, there are still some unanswered questions because it's still unclear who logistically will be responsible for the physical reunification of these families. And the one thing that really stands out about these details coming from these agencies is the fact that there is no timetable for reunification. The process of determining someone's standing legally, whether they'll be deported or not, can take a significant amount of time, Ana.</p><p>CABRERA: Sometimes six to nine months is what I've read.</p><p>Thank you, Boris Sanchez, at the White House.</p><p>Let's talk about all this with David Gergen, CNN's senior political analyst and a former White House adviser to four past presidents.</p><p>David, this is now week two. The White House has gotten incredibly bad headlines. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have come out condemning this policy that's leading to the deportation and the separation of parents and children, some saying they're appalled by what they are saying. The president had to cave. He signed that executive order.</p><p>What did Trump gain from all of this?</p><p>DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think had he not signed the executive order and this weekend we were still talking about children being separated out. I think he would have had a very, very heavy blow to -- not only to his presidency but to prospects for the midterm, which he clearly has very much in his mind as he goes through this, what's now becoming an ordeal.</p><p>Having acted, I think he lightened the load some, Ana, but overall the confusion that has surrounded the aftermath of signing that executive order, the sheer incompetence the government has had so far in telling us exactly where these kids are, where the parents are, how they -- you know, they say they have track of all of them. Well, let's prove it. They've only reunited 500. There's a lot more to go. And we know parents are being sent back now without children.</p><p>CABRERA: Yes.</p><p>GERGEN: Sent back to Central America. So the government doesn't yet have this in hand. As long as that's the case, Ana, and it's at the top of news programs, as it should be right now, it is -- it is a continuing negative for the president. And I think it leaves an indelible stain upon his presidency.</p><p>You know, people are not going to forget this quickly. It's one of those kind of searing moments when you see a reality you just can't stand to look at and you realize your government is responsible for this. As we saw with Katrina and we've seen in other instances in recent years, a president pays a heavy price for that.</p><p>CABRERA: And yet this president has been very proud of his hard line immigration stands, and he credits that in part for motivating his base to turn out to the polls.</p><p>GERGEN: Yes, he has.</p><p>CABRERA: Ultimately getting him elected. And now add this to the mix today, David. The president writing this in a tweet. \"We cannot allow all of these people to invade our country. When somebody comes in we must immediately with no judges or court cases bring them back from where they came.\"</p><p>I mean, the ACLU says this is completely unconstitutional. I'm curious what you think about it.</p><p>GERGEN: I don't know why he insists on doing these impulsive things. This is very much like the travel ban. You know, the law here is quite clear that whoever is in the United States, under Article 5 of the Bill of Rights said no person, not no citizen, but no person inside the United States can be deprived of due process of law. And that's what we thought we have, even Republicans have been talking about the rule of law and process and that sort of thing.</p><p>So I think he's prolonged this controversy unnecessarily. I just can't imagine we're going to strip these people of all their rights when they arrive here. I cannot imagine this inhumanity is going to go on much longer. But I must say, he's got to show some executive skill here now. He's got to clean this thing up real fast because the longer it goes on the longer we are making people suffer. That's the most important thing. People who are suffering.</p><p>Secondly, it is not -- we are not the laughingstock of the world. People around the world are crying now, looking for American leadership, feeling somewhat abandoned by the Americans. We have to step up on these issues.</p><p>CABRERA: This immigration issue cannot be done or solved by American -- America alone either. I mean, former Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson told me last week that the U.S. isn't going to stop the flow of migrants coming across the border until their home situation improves.</p><p>[18:10:03] David, has this administration done enough to address the root of the problem in these countries south of the border?</p><p>GERGEN: I'm so glad you brought that up. It is the un-discussed issue here. And this became apparent, you know, when children started arriving here in big waves a couple of years ago. And it looked like we were going to turn people back. And it has become so obvious that if you really want to stop the flow you have to go to the source and we have to help people in Honduras and Guatemala and some of these other countries in Central America establish order and get their countries back on track to, you know, some degree of prosperity or certainly getting rid of the violence, which is prompting so many people to leave.</p><p>We have done this before. We worked very closely with Colombia on the drug issues. And look how much Colombia has turned around now. The Medellin. It's a very, very different country. We have the capacity to do this working with partners to be sure including some South American partners, including Canada. We really ought to go down there and try to help them get back on their feet.</p><p>We have learned, Ana, also from Mexico, you know, the whole -- we used to have tons and tons of Mexicans crossing the border because conditions in Mexico were adverse, there were no jobs, they didn't have opportunity, all sorts of things were setting them back. There was a lot of corruption. The flow from Mexico is significantly reduced now. Why is that? Because it's better to live in Mexico than it used to be. And that's what we have to do in Central America.</p><p>CABRERA: David Gergen, always good to have you with us. Thank you.</p><p>GERGEN: Thank you, Ana. Thank you.</p><p>CABRERA: A 15-year-old walks out of a facility holding migrant children. But how could this happen? It's much easier than you think. We'll take you live to Brownsville, Texas, just ahead in the CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>[18:15:54] CABRERA: If the situation on the southern border was not chaotic enough, we learned something surprising just a short time ago. That a massive children's shelter in south Texas housing undocumented kids as young as 10 years old is not allowed to stop those kids from just walking out the door. It happened this weekend in Brownsville, Texas. A teenage boy left the migrant children's center for several hours, was missing and unaccounted for. And thankfully has now been located.</p><p>With us now is the mayor of Brownsville, Tony Martinez, and the city's chief of police, Orlando Rodriguez.</p><p>So, Mr. Mayor, were you aware that this enormous children's shelter was powerless to stop kids from just walking out the door? Can you guys hear me? MAYOR TONY MARTINEZ, BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS: I can hear you.</p><p>CABRERA: OK, so, Chief, let me ask you that same question. Did you know that essentially kids were allowed to just leave if they chose to do so?</p><p>ORLANDO RODRIGUEZ, BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS CHIEF OF POLICE: Actually no. This is kind of a surprise to me and to my department. That's not the information that we had. But we have it now, which was -- we found it to be a little bit interesting because we just -- we got a call yesterday and that of course started things in motion. But now we do know that that is the policy.</p><p>CABRERA: What can you tell us about this boy who went missing from the shelter?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Well, we do know that he was a 15-year-old boy that was actually placed here pending establishing of relatives here in north Texas which apparently he was being held here in this holding facility. It's more -- we see it now as a placement facility that -- where he was awaiting the outcome of his petition to be placed here. When that didn't work out, we understand that he just left on his own volition yesterday by jumping a fence and going into the Brownsville area yesterday afternoon.</p><p>CABRERA: Chief, what kind of regulation or oversight does your city have when it comes to these private facilities?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Well, actually, we don't have any control, don't have a lot of insight, a lot of information on this. This is something that is a learning experience to us. Not a lot of communication, which is something we want to be working on. And as we were looking at the situation yesterday, basically we were confronted with the situation where a 15-year-old went into the Brownsville area, and we didn't know his status, and of course our concern was for the safety of the individual. And then we now learned that what the policy is and it kind of changes things for us.</p><p>CABRERA: What has been the impact of having this shelter housing hundreds, not thousands of undocumented immigrants?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?</p><p>CABRERA: What has been the impact on your community having this shelter right there in your backyard, housing all these children, some of them separated from their parents there in the shelter in Brownsville?</p><p>You know what? I'm so sorry to all of our viewers and to our guests for the technical difficulties we're having in this segment. We'll see if we can get them back and continue. We'll be right back.</p><p>[18:23:48] CABRERA: Welcome back. Right now government officials say there are a little over 11,000 children under the age of 18 being held in detention facilities across the U.S. We can show you the outside of these immigration facilities. Some nothing more than tent cities in the desert in the middle of the summer. We can even take you above them. This is from footage from our drones. But the government will not let us take you inside of them. It will not allow the media or anyone to film. We can't show you the living conditions of the roughly 2,000 children separated from their parents at the border and taken into federal custody.</p><p>What do we know? The only recording we have from inside these centers is one piece of audio obtained by the investigative journalists at ProPublica. Now this is what it sounds like inside the facility. Children crying. A 6-year-old girl named Alisson already separated from her mother and begging to be able to call her aunt.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where are you from?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: El Salvador.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And you?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Guatemala.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don't cry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I want to go with my aunt.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're going to get there. Look, she will explain it and help you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: At least can I go with my aunt? I want her to come. I want my aunt to come so she can take me to her house.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[18:25:13] CABRERA: It's not just the media that's being kept in the dark. Even lawmakers have had trouble getting access to these government-funded facilities to check on these small children.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, we do. We have permission to do this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congressmen titled to do this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is America. This isn't Moscow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: When lawmakers have gotten inside, many are appalled by what they witnessed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA: I am a career prosecutor. I have visited many prisons and jails. That is a prison. You walk through the halls and the doors clink shut, and there are bars on the windows.</p><p>REP. PETER WELCH (D), VERMONT: Three boys, and I assume they were brothers, and they're on these thin mats that are provided. And like spoon style they're holding on to each other for dear life with no idea where their parents were.</p><p>REP. LOIS FRANKEL (D), FLORIDA: What I saw in these cages was a sea of humanity, little girls, little boys, fathers holding their daughters, mothers holding their daughters who have fled horrible conditions in other countries.</p><p>REP. ELIZABETH ESTY (D), CONNECTICUT: We saw a 15-year-old young woman with her child. We couldn't talk to her because she was too young. And you think of how afraid you must be to risk your life and your 6-month-old child to make a month-long journey to come to this country, and then you find yourself on a concrete floor covered with mylar.</p><p>MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK: There's a young boy, a 9-year-old boy from Honduras named Eddie. He was taken from his mom at Eagle Pass, Texas, put on a bus with a federal escort to go 2,000 miles to New York City. Has no idea when he's going to see his mom again. I mean, think about the trauma. What's happening to these kids.</p><p>REP. EARL BLUMENAUER (D), OREGON: I just kept thinking about my grandkids, under 6, and what would happen to them if their parents' life were at risk to take a journey of hundreds and in some cases thousands of miles and to have them subjected to that. It's incomprehensible to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: These lawmakers' descriptions match pictures the government has released. They show children sleeping on mats locked inside chain link fencing. And again, these are photos the government has released. Photos they're OK with you seeing.</p><p>The question, if this is what they're willing to show, what aren't they willing to show? Why not let us in to film?</p><p>While we wait for access, at least one other lawmaker was allowed into a facility a few hours ago. Here's Senator Elizabeth Warren describing what she witnessed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS: It's a disturbing picture. There are children by themselves. I saw a 6-month-old baby. Little girls, little boys. There are mothers with their babies and with small children. Family units are together if it's a very small child. But little girls who are 12 years old are taken away from the rest of their families and held separately or little boys. And they're all on the concrete floors in cages.</p><p>There's just no other way to describe it. They're big chain link cages on cold concrete floors and metal blankets handed out to people. People who are all just waiting and frightened.</p><p>We are people who believe in the worth of every human being. And we do have a system of laws in this country. And when a woman comes here with her 4-year-old son and says I am asking for amnesty, I have been threatened by gangs in my home country, we should at least give her a hearing. And that is the least that is required of us as a country and as human beings.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: As of today Customs and Border Patrol says it has reunited at least 522 children with their parents. It's unclear how many if any of the more than 2,000 children in HHS custody have been reunited. But we will not stop asking questions and trying to get the answers.</p><p>Just ahead, a simply bizarre moment here on CNN.</p><p>[18:30:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLENN BECK, CEO, THEBLAZE: No, it's been happening. We want to stop it, and you want to play those games? Have a nice day.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN HOST, RELIABLE SOURCES: What game did I just play?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: What caused that contentious exchange? Next, live on CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>CABRERA: News just in to CNN, Stormy Daniels will be interviewed by federal prosecutors in New York tomorrow. This is part of their investigation into President Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, according to a source.</p><p>One focus of the questioning for Daniels is expected to be that $130,000 hush money payment she received from Cohen in 2016. Her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, declined to comment.</p><p>[18:35:07] The \"Washington Post\" first reported this news.</p><p>A stunning moment playing out live on CNN this morning is just the latest example of the sheer divisiveness in our society right now.</p><p>Conservative commentator Glenn Beck walked away in the middle of an interview with our Brian Stelter when he was asked about reporter troubles at his media company. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: I do have to ask you, there's this new headline in \"The Daily Beast\" saying that your company's in trouble, that you were trying to find a buyer. Is this related to the -- BECK: No.</p><p>STELTER: -- point about people not talking to each other? That if you want to create that media company, there's not interest. What's going on with that?</p><p>BECK: Wow. Brian, thanks a lot. I think that's the most ridiculous question I've ever heard.</p><p>I'm sitting here ready to talk to you about the detaining of children and parents and trying to break families apart, something that has been happening with Janet Reno. That's why it went to the Supreme Court in the first place, with Janet Reno.</p><p>It's been happening. We want to stop it, and you want to play those games? Have a nice day.</p><p>STELTER: What game did I just play?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: With us now, CNN media analyst Bill Carter.</p><p>Bill, I had to do a double take. I was like checking my ear because I was listening to that interview when it was happening live.</p><p>BILL CARTER, CNN MEDIA ANALYST: Right.</p><p>CABRERA: What just happened there? What do you make of Glenn Beck walking away during a live interview?</p><p>CABRERA: Well, there's a couple of things. He talked about the game, and Brian said, what game am I playing?</p><p>The game he is playing is called journalism. And he was asking a completely legitimate question, which happens to be in the news, related to this guest.</p><p>We don't set up interviews -- no serious journalist sets up interviews and says, I will ask you about this topic and nothing else no matter what is going on with you. That is never agreed to.</p><p>And, of course, it just underscores, again, the fact that there are people who think they can control things and will only go on media that's favorable to them. You know, so they go in their separate little corners, and they only give answers to the questions they want to give.</p><p>And I think it's -- you know, Ana, I was thinking about comparison. And suppose you were interviewing, let's say, the mayor of New York about the immigrant children brought to New York, and today there was a major subway derailment in New York.</p><p>Of course, you'd ask him about that, too. That's in the news. That's perfectly legitimate. So Glenn Beck's company is imploding, which is what the report said, and you have to ask him about it, too. Brian's doing his job.</p><p>CABRERA: So you think it was a fair question?</p><p>CARTER: Completely fair question. And not in any way posed even hostilely. It was like, saying, you know, this --</p><p>CABRERA: Right.</p><p>CARTER: There was this news report and, you know, what do you have to say about it? It wasn't a hostile question. And, you know, Glenn Beck was so defensive about it and obviously felt -- you know, he couldn't deal with the question. He literally walks off, which is, you know, a statement of sorts that he can't answer the question.</p><p>CABRERA: And leading up to that, I was listening to that interview and, really, Brian was trying to have this discourse to try to see the other side when so often, as you point out, people stay in their own echo chambers.</p><p>And now, we have Glenn Beck walking off that interview. We've had White House staffers being booted from restaurants. Do you think we'll see more moments like these?</p><p>CARTER: Well, I think that, you know, that's a sign that the ugliness that really has started at the top and really was initiated, you know, during the campaign is filtering over into every kind of discourse in the country.</p><p>You know, I think the incident at the restaurant did not sound like it was hostile or, you know, angry. It sounded like someone is saying I don't want to serve you because I feel like what you're doing is offensive to my employees. The employees said they didn't want her there.</p><p>It's really not much different from the Supreme Court decision about the baker saying he had the right to not bake a cake.</p><p>I do think, though, that the general tone is incredibly ugly. I mean, you know, at the same time, you have people complaining about this incident in the restaurant, you have, you know, Sarah Sanders' father tweeting a tweet that looks openly racist. You know, a crazily racist tweet.</p><p>And you have the President going on a rant about, you know, John McCain who is terminally ill, you know, like using his Pocahontas racist taunt again.</p><p>This is ugliness and it is seeping out. And I don't know that you can control it. I mean, people are very angry and very upset, and they're reacting. Their reaction is getting to the point where it's not really, you know, controllable in a usual civil way because those norms have been blown up.</p><p>CABRERA: Yes. I want to play another exchange that happened this weekend. This one on Fox News just today.</p><p>CARTER: Right.</p><p>CABRERA: This is David Bossie, Trump's former senior campaign aide. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[18:39:59] DAVID BOSSIE, FORMER DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER TO THE DONALD TRUMP: Michael Hayden posted a picture of Auschwitz.</p><p>JOEL PAYNE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Yes, that liberal --</p><p>BOSSIE: Donny Deutsch is talking --</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, that liberal Michael Hayden.</p><p>BOSSIE: Look -- look, you're out of --</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, that screaming liberal Michael Hayden.</p><p>BOSSIE: You're out of your cotton-picking mind. Listen --</p><p>PAYNE: Cotton-picking mind?</p><p>BOSSIE: Listen, you guys are --</p><p>PAYNE: Brother, let me tell you something.</p><p>BOSSIE: You guys are --</p><p>PAYNE: Let me tell you something. I've got some --</p><p>BOSSIE: You guys are out of your mind.</p><p>PAYNE: I've got some --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: Well, Bossie did take to Twitter a little later saying -- during a heated segment on \"Fox &amp; Friends\" today, I should have chosen my words more carefully and never used the offensive phrase that I did. I apologize to Joel Payne, Fox News, and its viewers.</p><p>Bill, was that a dog whistle or did Bossie not even realize the racial undertones of what he had said?</p><p>CARTER: Well, you know, I've seen people trying to defend it by saying well, you know, that's a common phrase in the south. David Bossie is from Boston. I don't think he grew up saying that phrase.</p><p>I think it's kind of extraordinary that he couldn't hear that if he was saying it to a Black commentator. It's just so over the top and outrageous. And unfortunately, it's emblematic of what's going on.</p><p>People are saying things in the past 10 years, 20 years, we thought we'd gotten away from. I mean, I think it's kind of extraordinary.</p><p>And, you know, what is Fox going to do about it? Will they have that guy back on? Is an apology enough?</p><p>I mean, we've seen other people apologize. And obviously, MSNBC had an issue with Joy Reid, and that's sort of been acceptable. So I don't know that it's necessarily going to mean the end of this guy's, you know, career as a commentator, but it was clearly a really offensive thing to say.</p><p>CABRERA: Bill Carter, as always, thank you very much for your perspective. We appreciate it.</p><p>CARTER: Sure thing, Ana.</p><p>CABRERA: All right. Let's get a quick check of what you can expect from your stocks this week, especially after the Dow took a hit on Friday over fears of a trade war. Here's CNN's Alison Kosik with this week's \"Before the Bell.\"</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN GENERAL ASSIGNMENT CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Ana. What trade war? Yes, the Dow has been whacked by trade fears, but tech stocks are on fire. The NASDAQ hit a record high on Wednesday. So did Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google parent Alphabet.</p><p>So what's going on? Many investors see big tech as a safe place to park their money, unlike big multinationals that do a lot of business in China. Names like 3M and Caterpillar have been whipsawed by the headlines on trade.</p><p>Looking ahead, this week marks the end of an era for the first time in 110 years. General Electric won't be in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. On Tuesday, it will be replaced by Walgreens.</p><p>G.E. is dealing with a serious cash crisis. Shares lost half their value last year and are down another 25 percent this year. The company is selling off businesses to try to pay down debt.</p><p>In New York, I'm Alison Kosik.</p><p>CABRERA: Our thanks to Alison.</p><p>The death of CNN's Anthony Bourdain is causing people to step back, to have some difficult conversations. Just ahead, we'll show you how his fellow chefs are now taking the opportunity to talk about suicide within their own profession. You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>[18:47:36] CABRERA: More than two weeks after he tragically took his own life in a French hotel room, the death of our CNN colleague Anthony Bourdain is still sending shock waves throughout the culinary world and beyond.</p><p>His loss loomed large as chefs, writers, and food critics gathered at the Food &amp; Wine Classic in Aspen. They and many other groups are now determined to have difficult conversations about suicide.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CABRERA (voice-over): Two weeks after Anthony Bourdain's death, chefs throughout the culinary community are still feeling his loss.</p><p>ANDREW ZIMMERN, TRAVEL CHANNEL HOST: I'm still in shock and surprise. I get very, very sad. I'm still sad thinking of someone who is in so much pain that that was the choice and the solution.</p><p>ASHLEY CHRISTENSEN, OWNER, RALEIGH CHEF: It's warming to hear all these stories about what Anthony Bourdain meant to people and how they're living their lives, I think, to make sure that for every one of those great stories we tell, we remember to bring light to the issue of mental health.</p><p>ANTHONY BOURDAIN, FORMER CNN HOST: Suddenly, I look at the hamburger and I find myself in a spiral of depression.</p><p>CHRISTENSEN: He was fairly on the sleeve about things that he had dealt with that felt like he had overcome them, and I think that should be a great lesson to us.</p><p>CABRERA (voice-over): \"Food &amp; Wine\" contributor Kat Kinsman created the website, Chefs with Issues, to open dialogue about depression and other mental health issues among the culinary community.</p><p>KAT KINSMAN, SENIOR FOOD AND DRINKS EDITOR, EXTRA CRISPY: The thing that most people don't know is the ripple effect that happens from this. Since his death, I have found out about four different suicides in the industry. This is happening. This is going to be an ongoing problem. We have to talk about it.</p><p>RENEE ERICKSON, 2016 JAMES BEARD AWARD FOR BEST CHEF: NORTHWEST: It's all of our jobs to be as good of a friend as we can be and trying to like help people when they can but also just really paying attention.</p><p>CABRERA (voice-over): Kinsman says there's a simple way to honor Bourdain every time you go out to eat.</p><p>KINSMAN: If people really want to pay tribute to Tony and his legacy and everything he taught us about food and life, you have to think about the people who bring you that food and bring you those experiences.</p><p>Go to your local restaurants. Get to know those people. Respect them.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CABRERA: The conversation continues here on CNN with \"FINDING HOPE: BATTLING AMERICA'S SUICIDE CRISIS,\" hosted by Anderson Cooper. That is coming up in just a few moments at 7:00 Eastern.</p><p>[18:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA: In this week's episode of \"UNITED SHADES OF AMERICA,\" W. Kamau Bell take the trip up north to Canada to see if it's the progressive paradise a lot of Americans think it is. And, of course, he asked Canadians what they think of life below their southern border.</p><p>Take a listen to some of the responses he got.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>W. KAMAU BELL, CNN HOST: What would you say is the biggest difference between Canada and the United States of America?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In Canada, no matter where I go, people are really informed about what's going on in Canada and what's going on in the world. And some of the places I saw in the U.S. really don't know a whole lot. And I'm sorry.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I really have been cautious with what I say.</p><p>BELL: Oh, it's OK. I can't act like that's not true.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But it's not like what's happening in the U.S. There's a lot more --</p><p>[18:55:02] BELL: No, let's --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- more understanding.</p><p>BELL: Let's talk about this. What do you mean about this?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well --</p><p>BELL: What does that -- what do you mean by what's happening in the --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, south of the border type situation.</p><p>BELL: I don't think, in my perspective, with maybe, like --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>BELL: -- south of the border?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>BELL: But in this case, I do. From your perspective, what's going on south of the border?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, people are staying in their section, whether they're White, Black, Asian. I think that, in Canada, there is a lot of that understanding.</p><p>You know, there's a lot of Americans, when they come up here, they go, oh, it's really like that up here? You know, I can walk safely, I can do this. And it -- it is always like this? I say, yes, this is Canada.</p><p>BELL: Yes, yes. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: W. Kamau Bell joins us live from Oakland, California.</p><p>Kamau, in those discussions with Canadians, did you get the sense that their perception of Americans has actually changed because of or during the Trump presidency?</p><p>BELL: Yes. I mean, there is a clear idea that when Obama was president, they felt differently about us than they felt when we elected President Trump.</p><p>There is -- you know, the way that we sort of, many of us in America, condescend and criticize Mexico, it's the same exact thing that's happening from Canada to us right now because of the Trump administration.</p><p>CABRERA: There were people, I recall, who threatened to leave the U.S. if Trump got elected, and you actually talked to one guy who did. Why did he leave and how are things working out for him?</p><p>BELL: I mean, the funny thing about this guy is -- his name's Mark Nykanen, he used to be a journalist at NBC News -- he left twice.</p><p>He left during the Bush administration. And then when we elected Obama, he's like, OK, I think it's safe to come back. And then the night that Trump was elected, him and his wife decided to go back.</p><p>And it's going great from up there. He feels like he shouldn't have left to come back during the Obama administration because of the fact of Canada, at its core, has an idea -- and it's not perfect. We also talked to an activist about murdered and missing indigenous women. But there's an idea of inclusion and taking care of your people that we don't have in this country.</p><p>CABRERA: And one way they are taking care of their people is through their health care system, which is often idealized by people on the American left. Are there lessons we can learn from the Canadian way?</p><p>BELL: Yes. Canada has a lot of criticisms of its own health care system, but the minute they hear about our system, they go, oh, yes, this is way better up here. They understand -- they put resources into taking care of their people in ways that we don't put those resources in taking care of the people.</p><p>We take it into -- we put it into other areas that we don't -- that we frankly don't need it and don't help society. So they understand about the importance of the government to provide a healthier lifestyle for its people than we do.</p><p>CABRERA: Is it more expensive?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BELL: I mean, I'll take higher taxes over Affordable Health Care any day. So, yes, obviously, those -- the prices come someplace, but nothing's perfect. Canada's not perfect, but I do think that the direction that they're leaning into is the direction that we should be pursuing.</p><p>CABRERA: Americans often view Canada as maybe a milder, more polite version of the U.S. What did you learn about Canadian culture that makes it distinctive from American culture?</p><p>BELL: I think that they are more conscious of themselves as an international place and the place where more diversity and more -- and new people sort of help strengthen the society in a way that, in America, we pay a lot of lip service to that but it's not actually how -- it's not embedded into our policies.</p><p>I mean, a lot of people who are pursuing refugee status in this country have actually moved up to Canada. And they actually are overwhelming Canada's refugee system because they think Canada is the thing they thought America was.</p><p>So I think that it's certainly -- we think of it as America Junior, but I think of it as hopefully America's future.</p><p>CABRERA: Well, that's interesting. I know you also had some fun, got an up-close look at one of Canada's favorite sports, curling. What was it like to play?</p><p>BELL: I mean, I'm not on the ice often. Ice sports are not most Black Americans' number one thing to do, so --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BELL: But I know some of us do play hockey but, you know, I found out, I actually -- I'm actually pretty good at curling.</p><p>CABRERA: Yes?</p><p>BELL: You'll find out tonight. I do fall a few times, but maybe that's what I should've been doing instead of television. Maybe I should be a curler.</p><p>CABRERA: Do you think you found a new calling?</p><p>BELL: You know, I'm always looking for more jobs. I just had a third child so I'm always looking for new jobs.</p><p>CABRERA: Well, tell us a little bit about the sport. Because a lot of us became just a little bit familiar during the Olympics, but it's still a little foreign to a lot of Americans.</p><p>BELL: Yes. The thing about curling is that it's a sport that anybody can do of any size or health level. I mean, it's really -- like we saw giant, like six-foot-five, athletic-looking men there, and then there was a tiny woman there who was -- a tiny, older woman there who was doing the sport too.</p><p>So it's actually -- it's sort of a very Canadian thing that everybody can play and everybody can be good at it, no matter what their size or health level is. Or ages.</p><p>CABRERA: I look to -- I look forward to seeing you in action tonight.</p><p>W. Kamau Bell, thank you for joining us.</p><p>BELL: Thank you.</p><p>CABRERA: As always, tune in for his all-new episode of \"UNITED SHADES OF AMERICA\" tonight at 10:00 Eastern and Pacific, only on CNN.</p><p>[19:00:00] I'm Ana Cabrera in New York. Thank you for spending part of your Sunday afternoon with me. It's great to have you with me. Have a great night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Thank you for staying with me.  I'm Ana Cabrera in New York.  And on the U.S. border with Mexico this weekend little boys and girls, many of them without their parents, are behind locked doors on concrete floors sleeping in what amounts to cages.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That is how U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren describes the conditions inside a migrant children and family shelter in south Texas.  She visited this center a short time ago and calls what she saw inside disturbing.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN's Polo Sandoval is in McAllen, Texas.  </p><p>And Polo, this was Senator Warren's first time inside one of these sprawling migrant centers on the border.  Why was it important to her to see it firsthand and what did she tell reporters when she came out? </p><p>POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Ana, the senator has certainly added her voice to the chorus of Democratic critics who have been speaking out against President Trump's zero tolerance policy. Many of those lawmakers have been traveling to those facilities that process some of these families that are detained along that southwest border.  The facility you see behind me is the one that she got an inside look of.  </p><p>This is a facility that we have seen through handout images that were provided by the U.S. government just last week alone, and you see those people being housed behind that chain link fencing.  And also covering themselves with that mylar, that aluminum-like-looking material as well.  </p><p>This is also happening at the same time as we are learning that a child at a separate facility, one that is privately owned, privately operated and contracted by the U.S. government to care for some of these children, we now know that a 15-year-old child walked off one of those locations in Brownsville, Texas, not far from where we are. Only about 50 miles or so from our location here in McAllen, Texas.  </p><p>What we know at this point is that this is a very important distinction to point out here, Ana.  This child was not one of those recently separated from their parents so that their parents could be prosecuted but instead this 15-year-old Honduran boy crossed the border illegally unaccompanied and undocumented.  It was part of the trend that we've followed for many, many years.  </p><p>Of course in recent weeks, though, there is -- this is renewed attention on these locations that care for these children to make sure that these locations are caring for these children properly. Southwest Key, who owns and operates this facility, made -- in a statement points out that they are not a detention center, they are simply a childcare facility.  So when one of these children wants to leave the facility, there's not a whole lot they can do except accompany or at least walk with that child to the perimeter and ask them to remain on premises once they cross that line, then authorities have to be called.  </p><p>And that's exactly what took place yesterday afternoon.  The Brownsville Police Department confirming for me that yes, they searched for this child in and around the center in Brownsville, Texas.  But now sources familiar with this investigation and with that transpired now telling us that that child made it to Mexico and is in contact with their parents or at least relatives, rather, in the United States and is in the process of trying to make it back to his native Honduras -- Ana.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Polo Sandoval in McAllen, Texas.  Thank you again.  </p><p>Senator Warren there earlier likely responding to President Trump calling for deportations without judges or court cases.  The Trump administration today also revealed its plan to reunify immigrant families separated near the U.S.-Mexico border.  </p><p>Still there is confusion and lots of questions lingering on about the current status of hundreds of children who had already been separated from their parents.  Though the Homeland Security Department insists it knows the location of every single child in question.  </p><p>I want to go now to CNN White House correspondent Boris Sanchez.  </p><p>Boris, what are we learning today about the president's evolving policies on immigration?  </p><p>BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there, Ana.  Yes. President Trump today took a step in a direction that he had not before.  In a tweet this morning he essentially called for these immigrants to not be afforded due process, to not have a typical legal procedure or a case completed before they're deported.  </p><p>Here's what the president tweeted.  He writes, quote, \"We cannot allow all of these people to invade our country.  When somebody comes in, we must immediately with no judges or court cases bring them back from where they came.  Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and law and order.  Most children come without parents.  Our immigration policy is laughed at all over the world.\"  </p><p>The president then went on to make a case for merit-based immigration. Notable that President Trump is calling these people who are fleeing political oppression, violence, economic despair, invaders essentially.  </p><p>You did note that DHS in conjunction with the Department of Health and Human Services put out more details on their plan to try to reunify some of these families, acknowledging that there are still some 2,000 children that have been separated from their parents in the custody of Health and Human Services.  </p><p>Effectively here's how it's going to work.  They will remain under HHS custody until their parents' deportation proceedings are completed. Then at that point if a judge or legal proceedings determine that their family -- their parents should be deported they'll be reunified before deportation.  </p><p>[18:05:08] If a judge ultimately grants a stay to their parents, their parent can then apply to become a sponsor of the child, and they can be reunified and remain within the United States.  Both agencies are acknowledging that there is some work to do when it comes to collecting information from these families.  They want to beef up data bases that contain personal details about them, in part to help facilitate communication between these families.  </p><p>Further, there are still some unanswered questions because it's still unclear who logistically will be responsible for the physical reunification of these families.  And the one thing that really stands out about these details coming from these agencies is the fact that there is no timetable for reunification.  The process of determining someone's standing legally, whether they'll be deported or not, can take a significant amount of time, Ana.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Sometimes six to nine months is what I've read.  </p><p>Thank you, Boris Sanchez, at the White House.  </p><p>Let's talk about all this with David Gergen, CNN's senior political analyst and a former White House adviser to four past presidents.  </p><p>David, this is now week two.  The White House has gotten incredibly bad headlines.  Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have come out condemning this policy that's leading to the deportation and the separation of parents and children, some saying they're appalled by what they are saying.  The president had to cave.  He signed that executive order.  </p><p>What did Trump gain from all of this?  </p><p>DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think had he not signed the executive order and this weekend we were still talking about children being separated out.  I think he would have had a very, very heavy blow to -- not only to his presidency but to prospects for the midterm, which he clearly has very much in his mind as he goes through this, what's now becoming an ordeal.  </p><p>Having acted, I think he lightened the load some, Ana, but overall the confusion that has surrounded the aftermath of signing that executive order, the sheer incompetence the government has had so far in telling us exactly where these kids are, where the parents are, how they -- you know, they say they have track of all of them.  Well, let's prove it.  They've only reunited 500.  There's a lot more to go.  And we know parents are being sent back now without children.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Yes.  </p><p>GERGEN:  Sent back to Central America.  So the government doesn't yet have this in hand.  As long as that's the case, Ana, and it's at the top of news programs, as it should be right now, it is -- it is a continuing negative for the president.  And I think it leaves an indelible stain upon his presidency.  </p><p>You know, people are not going to forget this quickly.  It's one of those kind of searing moments when you see a reality you just can't stand to look at and you realize your government is responsible for this.  As we saw with Katrina and we've seen in other instances in recent years, a president pays a heavy price for that.  </p><p>CABRERA:  And yet this president has been very proud of his hard line immigration stands, and he credits that in part for motivating his base to turn out to the polls.  </p><p>GERGEN:  Yes, he has.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Ultimately getting him elected.  And now add this to the mix today, David.  The president writing this in a tweet.  \"We cannot allow all of these people to invade our country.  When somebody comes in we must immediately with no judges or court cases bring them back from where they came.\"  </p><p>I mean, the ACLU says this is completely unconstitutional.  I'm curious what you think about it.  </p><p>GERGEN:  I don't know why he insists on doing these impulsive things. This is very much like the travel ban.  You know, the law here is quite clear that whoever is in the United States, under Article 5 of the Bill of Rights said no person, not no citizen, but no person inside the United States can be deprived of due process of law.  And that's what we thought we have, even Republicans have been talking about the rule of law and process and that sort of thing.  </p><p>So I think he's prolonged this controversy unnecessarily.  I just can't imagine we're going to strip these people of all their rights when they arrive here.  I cannot imagine this inhumanity is going to go on much longer.  But I must say, he's got to show some executive skill here now.  He's got to clean this thing up real fast because the longer it goes on the longer we are making people suffer.  That's the most important thing.  People who are suffering.  </p><p>Secondly, it is not -- we are not the laughingstock of the world. People around the world are crying now, looking for American leadership, feeling somewhat abandoned by the Americans.  We have to step up on these issues.  </p><p>CABRERA:  This immigration issue cannot be done or solved by American -- America alone either.  I mean, former Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson told me last week that the U.S. isn't going to stop the flow of migrants coming across the border until their home situation improves.  </p><p>[18:10:03] David, has this administration done enough to address the root of the problem in these countries south of the border?  </p><p>GERGEN:  I'm so glad you brought that up.  It is the un-discussed issue here.  And this became apparent, you know, when children started arriving here in big waves a couple of years ago.  And it looked like we were going to turn people back.  And it has become so obvious that if you really want to stop the flow you have to go to the source and we have to help people in Honduras and Guatemala and some of these other countries in Central America establish order and get their countries back on track to, you know, some degree of prosperity or certainly getting rid of the violence, which is prompting so many people to leave.  </p><p>We have done this before.  We worked very closely with Colombia on the drug issues.  And look how much Colombia has turned around now.  The Medellin.  It's a very, very different country.  We have the capacity to do this working with partners to be sure including some South American partners, including Canada.  We really ought to go down there and try to help them get back on their feet.  </p><p>We have learned, Ana, also from Mexico, you know, the whole -- we used to have tons and tons of Mexicans crossing the border because conditions in Mexico were adverse, there were no jobs, they didn't have opportunity, all sorts of things were setting them back.  There was a lot of corruption.  The flow from Mexico is significantly reduced now.  Why is that?  Because it's better to live in Mexico than it used to be.  And that's what we have to do in Central America.  </p><p>CABRERA:  David Gergen, always good to have you with us.  Thank you.  </p><p>GERGEN:  Thank you, Ana.  Thank you.  </p><p>CABRERA:  A 15-year-old walks out of a facility holding migrant children.  But how could this happen?  It's much easier than you think.  We'll take you live to Brownsville, Texas, just ahead in the CNN NEWSROOM.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:15:54] CABRERA:  If the situation on the southern border was not chaotic enough, we learned something surprising just a short time ago. That a massive children's shelter in south Texas housing undocumented kids as young as 10 years old is not allowed to stop those kids from just walking out the door.  It happened this weekend in Brownsville, Texas.  A teenage boy left the migrant children's center for several hours, was missing and unaccounted for.  And thankfully has now been located.  </p><p>With us now is the mayor of Brownsville, Tony Martinez, and the city's chief of police, Orlando Rodriguez.  </p><p>So, Mr. Mayor, were you aware that this enormous children's shelter was powerless to stop kids from just walking out the door?  Can you guys hear me?   MAYOR TONY MARTINEZ, BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS:  I can hear you.  </p><p>CABRERA:  OK, so, Chief, let me ask you that same question.  Did you know that essentially kids were allowed to just leave if they chose to do so?  </p><p>ORLANDO RODRIGUEZ, BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS CHIEF OF POLICE:  Actually no. This is kind of a surprise to me and to my department.  That's not the information that we had.  But we have it now, which was -- we found it to be a little bit interesting because we just -- we got a call yesterday and that of course started things in motion.  But now we do know that that is the policy.  </p><p>CABRERA:  What can you tell us about this boy who went missing from the shelter?  </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Well, we do know that he was a 15-year-old boy that was actually placed here pending establishing of relatives here in north Texas which apparently he was being held here in this holding facility.  It's more -- we see it now as a placement facility that -- where he was awaiting the outcome of his petition to be placed here. When that didn't work out, we understand that he just left on his own volition yesterday by jumping a fence and going into the Brownsville area yesterday afternoon.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Chief, what kind of regulation or oversight does your city have when it comes to these private facilities?  </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Well, actually, we don't have any control, don't have a lot of insight, a lot of information on this.  This is something that is a learning experience to us.  Not a lot of communication, which is something we want to be working on.  And as we were looking at the situation yesterday, basically we were confronted with the situation where a 15-year-old went into the Brownsville area, and we didn't know his status, and of course our concern was for the safety of the individual.  And then we now learned that what the policy is and it kind of changes things for us.  </p><p>CABRERA:  What has been the impact of having this shelter housing hundreds, not thousands of undocumented immigrants?  </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  I'm sorry.  Can you repeat that?  </p><p>CABRERA:  What has been the impact on your community having this shelter right there in your backyard, housing all these children, some of them separated from their parents there in the shelter in Brownsville?  </p><p>You know what?  I'm so sorry to all of our viewers and to our guests for the technical difficulties we're having in this segment.  We'll see if we can get them back and continue.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:23:48] CABRERA:  Welcome back.  Right now government officials say there are a little over 11,000 children under the age of 18 being held in detention facilities across the U.S.  We can show you the outside of these immigration facilities.  Some nothing more than tent cities in the desert in the middle of the summer.  We can even take you above them.  This is from footage from our drones.  But the government will not let us take you inside of them.  It will not allow the media or anyone to film.  We can't show you the living conditions of the roughly 2,000 children separated from their parents at the border and taken into federal custody.  </p><p>What do we know?  The only recording we have from inside these centers is one piece of audio obtained by the investigative journalists at ProPublica.  Now this is what it sounds like inside the facility. Children crying.  A 6-year-old girl named Alisson already separated from her mother and begging to be able to call her aunt.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Where are you from?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  El Salvador.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Guatemala.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't cry.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I want to go with my aunt.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You're going to get there.  Look, she will explain it and help you.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  At least can I go with my aunt?  I want her to come.  I want my aunt to come so she can take me to her house.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[18:25:13] CABRERA:  It's not just the media that's being kept in the dark.  Even lawmakers have had trouble getting access to these government-funded facilities to check on these small children.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, we do.  We have permission to do this.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Congressmen titled to do this.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is America.  This isn't Moscow.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  When lawmakers have gotten inside, many are appalled by what they witnessed.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  I am a career prosecutor.  I have visited many prisons and jails.  That is a prison.  You walk through the halls and the doors clink shut, and there are bars on the windows. </p><p>REP. PETER WELCH (D), VERMONT:  Three boys, and I assume they were brothers, and they're on these thin mats that are provided.  And like spoon style they're holding on to each other for dear life with no idea where their parents were.  </p><p>REP. LOIS FRANKEL (D), FLORIDA:  What I saw in these cages was a sea of humanity, little girls, little boys, fathers holding their daughters, mothers holding their daughters who have fled horrible conditions in other countries.  </p><p>REP. ELIZABETH ESTY (D), CONNECTICUT:  We saw a 15-year-old young woman with her child.  We couldn't talk to her because she was too young.  And you think of how afraid you must be to risk your life and your 6-month-old child to make a month-long journey to come to this country, and then you find yourself on a concrete floor covered with mylar.  </p><p>MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK:  There's a young boy, a 9-year-old boy from Honduras named Eddie.  He was taken from his mom at Eagle Pass, Texas, put on a bus with a federal escort to go 2,000 miles to New York City.  Has no idea when he's going to see his mom again.  I mean, think about the trauma.  What's happening to these kids.  </p><p>REP. EARL BLUMENAUER (D), OREGON:  I just kept thinking about my grandkids, under 6, and what would happen to them if their parents' life were at risk to take a journey of hundreds and in some cases thousands of miles and to have them subjected to that.  It's incomprehensible to me.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  These lawmakers' descriptions match pictures the government has released.  They show children sleeping on mats locked inside chain link fencing.  And again, these are photos the government has released.  Photos they're OK with you seeing.  </p><p>The question, if this is what they're willing to show, what aren't they willing to show?  Why not let us in to film?  </p><p>While we wait for access, at least one other lawmaker was allowed into a facility a few hours ago.  Here's Senator Elizabeth Warren describing what she witnessed.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  It's a disturbing picture. There are children by themselves.  I saw a 6-month-old baby.  Little girls, little boys.  There are mothers with their babies and with small children.  Family units are together if it's a very small child. But little girls who are 12 years old are taken away from the rest of their families and held separately or little boys.  And they're all on the concrete floors in cages.  </p><p>There's just no other way to describe it.  They're big chain link cages on cold concrete floors and metal blankets handed out to people. People who are all just waiting and frightened.  </p><p>We are people who believe in the worth of every human being.  And we do have a system of laws in this country.  And when a woman comes here with her 4-year-old son and says I am asking for amnesty, I have been threatened by gangs in my home country, we should at least give her a hearing.  And that is the least that is required of us as a country and as human beings.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  As of today Customs and Border Patrol says it has reunited at least 522 children with their parents.  It's unclear how many if any of the more than 2,000 children in HHS custody have been reunited. But we will not stop asking questions and trying to get the answers.  </p><p>Just ahead, a simply bizarre moment here on CNN.  </p><p>[18:30:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLENN BECK, CEO, THEBLAZE:  No, it's been happening.  We want to stop it, and you want to play those games?  Have a nice day.  </p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN HOST, RELIABLE SOURCES:  What game did I just play? </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  What caused that contentious exchange?  Next, live on CNN NEWSROOM.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA:  News just in to CNN, Stormy Daniels will be interviewed by federal prosecutors in New York tomorrow.  This is part of their investigation into President Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, according to a source.  </p><p>One focus of the questioning for Daniels is expected to be that $130,000 hush money payment she received from Cohen in 2016.  Her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, declined to comment.  </p><p>[18:35:07] The \"Washington Post\" first reported this news.  </p><p>A stunning moment playing out live on CNN this morning is just the latest example of the sheer divisiveness in our society right now.  </p><p>Conservative commentator Glenn Beck walked away in the middle of an interview with our Brian Stelter when he was asked about reporter troubles at his media company.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER:  I do have to ask you, there's this new headline in \"The Daily Beast\" saying that your company's in trouble, that you were trying to find a buyer.  Is this related to the -- BECK:  No.  </p><p>STELTER:  -- point about people not talking to each other?  That if you want to create that media company, there's not interest.  What's going on with that?  </p><p>BECK:  Wow.  Brian, thanks a lot.  I think that's the most ridiculous question I've ever heard.  </p><p>I'm sitting here ready to talk to you about the detaining of children and parents and trying to break families apart, something that has been happening with Janet Reno.  That's why it went to the Supreme Court in the first place, with Janet Reno.  </p><p>It's been happening.  We want to stop it, and you want to play those games?  Have a nice day.  </p><p>STELTER:  What game did I just play?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  With us now, CNN media analyst Bill Carter.  </p><p>Bill, I had to do a double take.  I was like checking my ear because I was listening to that interview when it was happening live.  </p><p>BILL CARTER, CNN MEDIA ANALYST:  Right.  </p><p>CABRERA:  What just happened there?  What do you make of Glenn Beck walking away during a live interview?  </p><p>CABRERA:  Well, there's a couple of things.  He talked about the game, and Brian said, what game am I playing?  </p><p>The game he is playing is called journalism.  And he was asking a completely legitimate question, which happens to be in the news, related to this guest.  </p><p>We don't set up interviews -- no serious journalist sets up interviews and says, I will ask you about this topic and nothing else no matter what is going on with you.  That is never agreed to.  </p><p>And, of course, it just underscores, again, the fact that there are people who think they can control things and will only go on media that's favorable to them.  You know, so they go in their separate little corners, and they only give answers to the questions they want to give.  </p><p>And I think it's -- you know, Ana, I was thinking about comparison. And suppose you were interviewing, let's say, the mayor of New York about the immigrant children brought to New York, and today there was a major subway derailment in New York.  </p><p>Of course, you'd ask him about that, too.  That's in the news.  That's perfectly legitimate.  So Glenn Beck's company is imploding, which is what the report said, and you have to ask him about it, too.  Brian's doing his job.  </p><p>CABRERA:  So you think it was a fair question?  </p><p>CARTER:  Completely fair question.  And not in any way posed even hostilely.  It was like, saying, you know, this --</p><p>CABRERA:  Right.  </p><p>CARTER:  There was this news report and, you know, what do you have to say about it?  It wasn't a hostile question.  And, you know, Glenn Beck was so defensive about it and obviously felt -- you know, he couldn't deal with the question.  He literally walks off, which is, you know, a statement of sorts that he can't answer the question.  </p><p>CABRERA:  And leading up to that, I was listening to that interview and, really, Brian was trying to have this discourse to try to see the other side when so often, as you point out, people stay in their own echo chambers.  </p><p>And now, we have Glenn Beck walking off that interview.  We've had White House staffers being booted from restaurants.  Do you think we'll see more moments like these?  </p><p>CARTER:  Well, I think that, you know, that's a sign that the ugliness that really has started at the top and really was initiated, you know, during the campaign is filtering over into every kind of discourse in the country.  </p><p>You know, I think the incident at the restaurant did not sound like it was hostile or, you know, angry.  It sounded like someone is saying I don't want to serve you because I feel like what you're doing is offensive to my employees.  The employees said they didn't want her there.  </p><p>It's really not much different from the Supreme Court decision about the baker saying he had the right to not bake a cake.  </p><p>I do think, though, that the general tone is incredibly ugly.  I mean, you know, at the same time, you have people complaining about this incident in the restaurant, you have, you know, Sarah Sanders' father tweeting a tweet that looks openly racist.  You know, a crazily racist tweet.  </p><p>And you have the President going on a rant about, you know, John McCain who is terminally ill, you know, like using his Pocahontas racist taunt again.  </p><p>This is ugliness and it is seeping out.  And I don't know that you can control it.  I mean, people are very angry and very upset, and they're reacting.  Their reaction is getting to the point where it's not really, you know, controllable in a usual civil way because those norms have been blown up.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Yes.  I want to play another exchange that happened this weekend.  This one on Fox News just today.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  </p><p>CABRERA:  This is David Bossie, Trump's former senior campaign aide. Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[18:39:59] DAVID BOSSIE, FORMER DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER TO THE DONALD TRUMP:  Michael Hayden posted a picture of Auschwitz.  </p><p>JOEL PAYNE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Yes, that liberal --</p><p>BOSSIE:  Donny Deutsch is talking --</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, that liberal Michael Hayden.  </p><p>BOSSIE:  Look -- look, you're out of --</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, that screaming liberal Michael Hayden.  </p><p>BOSSIE:  You're out of your cotton-picking mind.  Listen --</p><p>PAYNE:  Cotton-picking mind?  </p><p>BOSSIE:  Listen, you guys are --</p><p>PAYNE:  Brother, let me tell you something.  </p><p>BOSSIE:  You guys are --</p><p>PAYNE:  Let me tell you something.  I've got some --</p><p>BOSSIE:  You guys are out of your mind.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I've got some -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  Well, Bossie did take to Twitter a little later saying -- during a heated segment on \"Fox &amp; Friends\" today, I should have chosen my words more carefully and never used the offensive phrase that I did.  I apologize to Joel Payne, Fox News, and its viewers.  </p><p>Bill, was that a dog whistle or did Bossie not even realize the racial undertones of what he had said?  </p><p>CARTER:  Well, you know, I've seen people trying to defend it by saying well, you know, that's a common phrase in the south.  David Bossie is from Boston.  I don't think he grew up saying that phrase.  </p><p>I think it's kind of extraordinary that he couldn't hear that if he was saying it to a Black commentator.  It's just so over the top and outrageous.  And unfortunately, it's emblematic of what's going on.  </p><p>People are saying things in the past 10 years, 20 years, we thought we'd gotten away from.  I mean, I think it's kind of extraordinary.  </p><p>And, you know, what is Fox going to do about it?  Will they have that guy back on?  Is an apology enough?  </p><p>I mean, we've seen other people apologize.  And obviously, MSNBC had an issue with Joy Reid, and that's sort of been acceptable.  So I don't know that it's necessarily going to mean the end of this guy's, you know, career as a commentator, but it was clearly a really offensive thing to say.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Bill Carter, as always, thank you very much for your perspective.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>CARTER:  Sure thing, Ana.  </p><p>CABRERA:  All right.  Let's get a quick check of what you can expect from your stocks this week, especially after the Dow took a hit on Friday over fears of a trade war.  Here's CNN's Alison Kosik with this week's \"Before the Bell.\" </p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN GENERAL ASSIGNMENT CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Ana.  What trade war?  Yes, the Dow has been whacked by trade fears, but tech stocks are on fire.  The NASDAQ hit a record high on Wednesday.  So did Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google parent Alphabet.  </p><p>So what's going on?  Many investors see big tech as a safe place to park their money, unlike big multinationals that do a lot of business in China.  Names like 3M and Caterpillar have been whipsawed by the headlines on trade.  </p><p>Looking ahead, this week marks the end of an era for the first time in 110 years.  General Electric won't be in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  On Tuesday, it will be replaced by Walgreens.  </p><p>G.E. is dealing with a serious cash crisis.  Shares lost half their value last year and are down another 25 percent this year.  The company is selling off businesses to try to pay down debt.  </p><p>In New York, I'm Alison Kosik.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Our thanks to Alison.  </p><p>The death of CNN's Anthony Bourdain is causing people to step back, to have some difficult conversations.  Just ahead, we'll show you how his fellow chefs are now taking the opportunity to talk about suicide within their own profession.  You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:47:36] CABRERA:  More than two weeks after he tragically took his own life in a French hotel room, the death of our CNN colleague Anthony Bourdain is still sending shock waves throughout the culinary world and beyond.  </p><p>His loss loomed large as chefs, writers, and food critics gathered at the Food &amp; Wine Classic in Aspen.  They and many other groups are now determined to have difficult conversations about suicide.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CABRERA (voice-over):  Two weeks after Anthony Bourdain's death, chefs throughout the culinary community are still feeling his loss.  </p><p>ANDREW ZIMMERN, TRAVEL CHANNEL HOST:  I'm still in shock and surprise. I get very, very sad.  I'm still sad thinking of someone who is in so much pain that that was the choice and the solution.  </p><p>ASHLEY CHRISTENSEN, OWNER, RALEIGH CHEF:  It's warming to hear all these stories about what Anthony Bourdain meant to people and how they're living their lives, I think, to make sure that for every one of those great stories we tell, we remember to bring light to the issue of mental health.  </p><p>ANTHONY BOURDAIN, FORMER CNN HOST:  Suddenly, I look at the hamburger and I find myself in a spiral of depression.  </p><p>CHRISTENSEN:  He was fairly on the sleeve about things that he had dealt with that felt like he had overcome them, and I think that should be a great lesson to us.  </p><p>CABRERA (voice-over):  \"Food &amp; Wine\" contributor Kat Kinsman created the website, Chefs with Issues, to open dialogue about depression and other mental health issues among the culinary community.  </p><p>KAT KINSMAN, SENIOR FOOD AND DRINKS EDITOR, EXTRA CRISPY:  The thing that most people don't know is the ripple effect that happens from this.  Since his death, I have found out about four different suicides in the industry.  This is happening.  This is going to be an ongoing problem.  We have to talk about it.  </p><p>RENEE ERICKSON, 2016 JAMES BEARD AWARD FOR BEST CHEF: NORTHWEST:  It's all of our jobs to be as good of a friend as we can be and trying to like help people when they can but also just really paying attention.  </p><p>CABRERA (voice-over):  Kinsman says there's a simple way to honor Bourdain every time you go out to eat.  </p><p>KINSMAN:  If people really want to pay tribute to Tony and his legacy and everything he taught us about food and life, you have to think about the people who bring you that food and bring you those experiences.  </p><p>Go to your local restaurants.  Get to know those people.  Respect them.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CABRERA:  The conversation continues here on CNN with \"FINDING HOPE: BATTLING AMERICA'S SUICIDE CRISIS,\" hosted by Anderson Cooper.  That is coming up in just a few moments at 7:00 Eastern.  </p><p>[18:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA:  In this week's episode of \"UNITED SHADES OF AMERICA,\" W. Kamau Bell take the trip up north to Canada to see if it's the progressive paradise a lot of Americans think it is.  And, of course, he asked Canadians what they think of life below their southern border.  </p><p>Take a listen to some of the responses he got.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>W. KAMAU BELL, CNN HOST:  What would you say is the biggest difference between Canada and the United States of America?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In Canada, no matter where I go, people are really informed about what's going on in Canada and what's going on in the world.  And some of the places I saw in the U.S. really don't know a whole lot.  And I'm sorry.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I really have been cautious with what I say.     </p><p>BELL:  Oh, it's OK.  I can't act like that's not true.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But it's not like what's happening in the U.S. There's a lot more --</p><p>[18:55:02] BELL:  No, let's -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- more understanding.  </p><p>BELL:  Let's talk about this.  What do you mean about this?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well --</p><p>BELL:  What does that -- what do you mean by what's happening in the -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, south of the border type situation.  </p><p>BELL:  I don't think, in my perspective, with maybe, like --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.  </p><p>BELL:  -- south of the border?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  </p><p>BELL:  But in this case, I do.  From your perspective, what's going on south of the border?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, people are staying in their section, whether they're White, Black, Asian.  I think that, in Canada, there is a lot of that understanding.  </p><p>You know, there's a lot of Americans, when they come up here, they go, oh, it's really like that up here?  You know, I can walk safely, I can do this.  And it -- it is always like this?  I say, yes, this is Canada.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes, yes.   (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  W. Kamau Bell joins us live from Oakland, California.  </p><p>Kamau, in those discussions with Canadians, did you get the sense that their perception of Americans has actually changed because of or during the Trump presidency?  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  I mean, there is a clear idea that when Obama was president, they felt differently about us than they felt when we elected President Trump.  </p><p>There is -- you know, the way that we sort of, many of us in America, condescend and criticize Mexico, it's the same exact thing that's happening from Canada to us right now because of the Trump administration.  </p><p>CABRERA:  There were people, I recall, who threatened to leave the U.S. if Trump got elected, and you actually talked to one guy who did. Why did he leave and how are things working out for him?  </p><p>BELL:  I mean, the funny thing about this guy is -- his name's Mark Nykanen, he used to be a journalist at NBC News -- he left twice.  </p><p>He left during the Bush administration.  And then when we elected Obama, he's like, OK, I think it's safe to come back.  And then the night that Trump was elected, him and his wife decided to go back.  </p><p>And it's going great from up there.  He feels like he shouldn't have left to come back during the Obama administration because of the fact of Canada, at its core, has an idea -- and it's not perfect.  We also talked to an activist about murdered and missing indigenous women. But there's an idea of inclusion and taking care of your people that we don't have in this country.  </p><p>CABRERA:  And one way they are taking care of their people is through their health care system, which is often idealized by people on the American left.  Are there lessons we can learn from the Canadian way?  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  Canada has a lot of criticisms of its own health care system, but the minute they hear about our system, they go, oh, yes, this is way better up here.  They understand -- they put resources into taking care of their people in ways that we don't put those resources in taking care of the people.  </p><p>We take it into -- we put it into other areas that we don't -- that we frankly don't need it and don't help society.  So they understand about the importance of the government to provide a healthier lifestyle for its people than we do.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Is it more expensive?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BELL:  I mean, I'll take higher taxes over Affordable Health Care any day.  So, yes, obviously, those -- the prices come someplace, but nothing's perfect.  Canada's not perfect, but I do think that the direction that they're leaning into is the direction that we should be pursuing.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Americans often view Canada as maybe a milder, more polite version of the U.S.  What did you learn about Canadian culture that makes it distinctive from American culture?  </p><p>BELL:  I think that they are more conscious of themselves as an international place and the place where more diversity and more -- and new people sort of help strengthen the society in a way that, in America, we pay a lot of lip service to that but it's not actually how -- it's not embedded into our policies.  </p><p>I mean, a lot of people who are pursuing refugee status in this country have actually moved up to Canada.  And they actually are overwhelming Canada's refugee system because they think Canada is the thing they thought America was.  </p><p>So I think that it's certainly -- we think of it as America Junior, but I think of it as hopefully America's future.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Well, that's interesting.  I know you also had some fun, got an up-close look at one of Canada's favorite sports, curling.  What was it like to play?  </p><p>BELL:  I mean, I'm not on the ice often.  Ice sports are not most Black Americans' number one thing to do, so --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BELL:  But I know some of us do play hockey but, you know, I found out, I actually -- I'm actually pretty good at curling.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Yes?  </p><p>BELL:  You'll find out tonight.  I do fall a few times, but maybe that's what I should've been doing instead of television.  Maybe I should be a curler.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Do you think you found a new calling?  </p><p>BELL:  You know, I'm always looking for more jobs.  I just had a third child so I'm always looking for new jobs.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Well, tell us a little bit about the sport.  Because a lot of us became just a little bit familiar during the Olympics, but it's still a little foreign to a lot of Americans.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  The thing about curling is that it's a sport that anybody can do of any size or health level.  I mean, it's really -- like we saw giant, like six-foot-five, athletic-looking men there, and then there was a tiny woman there who was -- a tiny, older woman there who was doing the sport too.  </p><p>So it's actually -- it's sort of a very Canadian thing that everybody can play and everybody can be good at it, no matter what their size or health level is.  Or ages.  </p><p>CABRERA:  I look to -- I look forward to seeing you in action tonight. </p><p>W. Kamau Bell, thank you for joining us.  </p><p>BELL:  Thank you.  </p><p>CABRERA:  As always, tune in for his all-new episode of \"UNITED SHADES OF AMERICA\" tonight at 10:00 Eastern and Pacific, only on CNN.  </p><p>[19:00:00] I'm Ana Cabrera in New York.

Thank you for staying with me.  I'm Ana Cabrera in New York.  And on the U.S. border with Mexico this weekend little boys and girls, many of them without their parents, are behind locked doors on concrete floors sleeping in what amounts to cages.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That is how U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren describes the conditions inside a migrant children and family shelter in south Texas.  She visited this center a short time ago and calls what she saw inside disturbing.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN's Polo Sandoval is in McAllen, Texas.  </p><p>And Polo, this was Senator Warren's first time inside one of these sprawling migrant centers on the border.  Why was it important to her to see it firsthand and what did she tell reporters when she came out? </p><p>POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Ana, the senator has certainly added her voice to the chorus of Democratic critics who have been speaking out against President Trump's zero tolerance policy. Many of those lawmakers have been traveling to those facilities that process some of these families that are detained along that southwest border.  The facility you see behind me is the one that she got an inside look of.  </p><p>This is a facility that we have seen through handout images that were provided by the U.S. government just last week alone, and you see those people being housed behind that chain link fencing.  And also covering themselves with that mylar, that aluminum-like-looking material as well.  </p><p>This is also happening at the same time as we are learning that a child at a separate facility, one that is privately owned, privately operated and contracted by the U.S. government to care for some of these children, we now know that a 15-year-old child walked off one of those locations in Brownsville, Texas, not far from where we are. Only about 50 miles or so from our location here in McAllen, Texas.  </p><p>What we know at this point is that this is a very important distinction to point out here, Ana.  This child was not one of those recently separated from their parents so that their parents could be prosecuted but instead this 15-year-old Honduran boy crossed the border illegally unaccompanied and undocumented.  It was part of the trend that we've followed for many, many years.  </p><p>Of course in recent weeks, though, there is -- this is renewed attention on these locations that care for these children to make sure that these locations are caring for these children properly. Southwest Key, who owns and operates this facility, made -- in a statement points out that they are not a detention center, they are simply a childcare facility.  So when one of these children wants to leave the facility, there's not a whole lot they can do except accompany or at least walk with that child to the perimeter and ask them to remain on premises once they cross that line, then authorities have to be called.  </p><p>And that's exactly what took place yesterday afternoon.  The Brownsville Police Department confirming for me that yes, they searched for this child in and around the center in Brownsville, Texas.  But now sources familiar with this investigation and with that transpired now telling us that that child made it to Mexico and is in contact with their parents or at least relatives, rather, in the United States and is in the process of trying to make it back to his native Honduras -- Ana.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Polo Sandoval in McAllen, Texas.  Thank you again.  </p><p>Senator Warren there earlier likely responding to President Trump calling for deportations without judges or court cases.  The Trump administration today also revealed its plan to reunify immigrant families separated near the U.S.-Mexico border.  </p><p>Still there is confusion and lots of questions lingering on about the current status of hundreds of children who had already been separated from their parents.  Though the Homeland Security Department insists it knows the location of every single child in question.  </p><p>I want to go now to CNN White House correspondent Boris Sanchez.  </p><p>Boris, what are we learning today about the president's evolving policies on immigration?  </p><p>BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there, Ana.  Yes. President Trump today took a step in a direction that he had not before.  In a tweet this morning he essentially called for these immigrants to not be afforded due process, to not have a typical legal procedure or a case completed before they're deported.  </p><p>Here's what the president tweeted.  He writes, quote, \"We cannot allow all of these people to invade our country.  When somebody comes in, we must immediately with no judges or court cases bring them back from where they came.  Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and law and order.  Most children come without parents.  Our immigration policy is laughed at all over the world.\"  </p><p>The president then went on to make a case for merit-based immigration. Notable that President Trump is calling these people who are fleeing political oppression, violence, economic despair, invaders essentially.  </p><p>You did note that DHS in conjunction with the Department of Health and Human Services put out more details on their plan to try to reunify some of these families, acknowledging that there are still some 2,000 children that have been separated from their parents in the custody of Health and Human Services.  </p><p>Effectively here's how it's going to work.  They will remain under HHS custody until their parents' deportation proceedings are completed. Then at that point if a judge or legal proceedings determine that their family -- their parents should be deported they'll be reunified before deportation.  </p><p>[18:05:08] If a judge ultimately grants a stay to their parents, their parent can then apply to become a sponsor of the child, and they can be reunified and remain within the United States.  Both agencies are acknowledging that there is some work to do when it comes to collecting information from these families.  They want to beef up data bases that contain personal details about them, in part to help facilitate communication between these families.  </p><p>Further, there are still some unanswered questions because it's still unclear who logistically will be responsible for the physical reunification of these families.  And the one thing that really stands out about these details coming from these agencies is the fact that there is no timetable for reunification.  The process of determining someone's standing legally, whether they'll be deported or not, can take a significant amount of time, Ana.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Sometimes six to nine months is what I've read.  </p><p>Thank you, Boris Sanchez, at the White House.  </p><p>Let's talk about all this with David Gergen, CNN's senior political analyst and a former White House adviser to four past presidents.  </p><p>David, this is now week two.  The White House has gotten incredibly bad headlines.  Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have come out condemning this policy that's leading to the deportation and the separation of parents and children, some saying they're appalled by what they are saying.  The president had to cave.  He signed that executive order.  </p><p>What did Trump gain from all of this?  </p><p>DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think had he not signed the executive order and this weekend we were still talking about children being separated out.  I think he would have had a very, very heavy blow to -- not only to his presidency but to prospects for the midterm, which he clearly has very much in his mind as he goes through this, what's now becoming an ordeal.  </p><p>Having acted, I think he lightened the load some, Ana, but overall the confusion that has surrounded the aftermath of signing that executive order, the sheer incompetence the government has had so far in telling us exactly where these kids are, where the parents are, how they -- you know, they say they have track of all of them.  Well, let's prove it.  They've only reunited 500.  There's a lot more to go.  And we know parents are being sent back now without children.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Yes.  </p><p>GERGEN:  Sent back to Central America.  So the government doesn't yet have this in hand.  As long as that's the case, Ana, and it's at the top of news programs, as it should be right now, it is -- it is a continuing negative for the president.  And I think it leaves an indelible stain upon his presidency.  </p><p>You know, people are not going to forget this quickly.  It's one of those kind of searing moments when you see a reality you just can't stand to look at and you realize your government is responsible for this.  As we saw with Katrina and we've seen in other instances in recent years, a president pays a heavy price for that.  </p><p>CABRERA:  And yet this president has been very proud of his hard line immigration stands, and he credits that in part for motivating his base to turn out to the polls.  </p><p>GERGEN:  Yes, he has.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Ultimately getting him elected.  And now add this to the mix today, David.  The president writing this in a tweet.  \"We cannot allow all of these people to invade our country.  When somebody comes in we must immediately with no judges or court cases bring them back from where they came.\"  </p><p>I mean, the ACLU says this is completely unconstitutional.  I'm curious what you think about it.  </p><p>GERGEN:  I don't know why he insists on doing these impulsive things. This is very much like the travel ban.  You know, the law here is quite clear that whoever is in the United States, under Article 5 of the Bill of Rights said no person, not no citizen, but no person inside the United States can be deprived of due process of law.  And that's what we thought we have, even Republicans have been talking about the rule of law and process and that sort of thing.  </p><p>So I think he's prolonged this controversy unnecessarily.  I just can't imagine we're going to strip these people of all their rights when they arrive here.  I cannot imagine this inhumanity is going to go on much longer.  But I must say, he's got to show some executive skill here now.  He's got to clean this thing up real fast because the longer it goes on the longer we are making people suffer.  That's the most important thing.  People who are suffering.  </p><p>Secondly, it is not -- we are not the laughingstock of the world. People around the world are crying now, looking for American leadership, feeling somewhat abandoned by the Americans.  We have to step up on these issues.  </p><p>CABRERA:  This immigration issue cannot be done or solved by American -- America alone either.  I mean, former Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson told me last week that the U.S. isn't going to stop the flow of migrants coming across the border until their home situation improves.  </p><p>[18:10:03] David, has this administration done enough to address the root of the problem in these countries south of the border?  </p><p>GERGEN:  I'm so glad you brought that up.  It is the un-discussed issue here.  And this became apparent, you know, when children started arriving here in big waves a couple of years ago.  And it looked like we were going to turn people back.  And it has become so obvious that if you really want to stop the flow you have to go to the source and we have to help people in Honduras and Guatemala and some of these other countries in Central America establish order and get their countries back on track to, you know, some degree of prosperity or certainly getting rid of the violence, which is prompting so many people to leave.  </p><p>We have done this before.  We worked very closely with Colombia on the drug issues.  And look how much Colombia has turned around now.  The Medellin.  It's a very, very different country.  We have the capacity to do this working with partners to be sure including some South American partners, including Canada.  We really ought to go down there and try to help them get back on their feet.  </p><p>We have learned, Ana, also from Mexico, you know, the whole -- we used to have tons and tons of Mexicans crossing the border because conditions in Mexico were adverse, there were no jobs, they didn't have opportunity, all sorts of things were setting them back.  There was a lot of corruption.  The flow from Mexico is significantly reduced now.  Why is that?  Because it's better to live in Mexico than it used to be.  And that's what we have to do in Central America.  </p><p>CABRERA:  David Gergen, always good to have you with us.  Thank you.  </p><p>GERGEN:  Thank you, Ana.  Thank you.  </p><p>CABRERA:  A 15-year-old walks out of a facility holding migrant children.  But how could this happen?  It's much easier than you think.  We'll take you live to Brownsville, Texas, just ahead in the CNN NEWSROOM.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:15:54] CABRERA:  If the situation on the southern border was not chaotic enough, we learned something surprising just a short time ago. That a massive children's shelter in south Texas housing undocumented kids as young as 10 years old is not allowed to stop those kids from just walking out the door.  It happened this weekend in Brownsville, Texas.  A teenage boy left the migrant children's center for several hours, was missing and unaccounted for.  And thankfully has now been located.  </p><p>With us now is the mayor of Brownsville, Tony Martinez, and the city's chief of police, Orlando Rodriguez.  </p><p>So, Mr. Mayor, were you aware that this enormous children's shelter was powerless to stop kids from just walking out the door?  Can you guys hear me?   MAYOR TONY MARTINEZ, BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS:  I can hear you.  </p><p>CABRERA:  OK, so, Chief, let me ask you that same question.  Did you know that essentially kids were allowed to just leave if they chose to do so?  </p><p>ORLANDO RODRIGUEZ, BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS CHIEF OF POLICE:  Actually no. This is kind of a surprise to me and to my department.  That's not the information that we had.  But we have it now, which was -- we found it to be a little bit interesting because we just -- we got a call yesterday and that of course started things in motion.  But now we do know that that is the policy.  </p><p>CABRERA:  What can you tell us about this boy who went missing from the shelter?  </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Well, we do know that he was a 15-year-old boy that was actually placed here pending establishing of relatives here in north Texas which apparently he was being held here in this holding facility.  It's more -- we see it now as a placement facility that -- where he was awaiting the outcome of his petition to be placed here. When that didn't work out, we understand that he just left on his own volition yesterday by jumping a fence and going into the Brownsville area yesterday afternoon.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Chief, what kind of regulation or oversight does your city have when it comes to these private facilities?  </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Well, actually, we don't have any control, don't have a lot of insight, a lot of information on this.  This is something that is a learning experience to us.  Not a lot of communication, which is something we want to be working on.  And as we were looking at the situation yesterday, basically we were confronted with the situation where a 15-year-old went into the Brownsville area, and we didn't know his status, and of course our concern was for the safety of the individual.  And then we now learned that what the policy is and it kind of changes things for us.  </p><p>CABRERA:  What has been the impact of having this shelter housing hundreds, not thousands of undocumented immigrants?  </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  I'm sorry.  Can you repeat that?  </p><p>CABRERA:  What has been the impact on your community having this shelter right there in your backyard, housing all these children, some of them separated from their parents there in the shelter in Brownsville?  </p><p>You know what?  I'm so sorry to all of our viewers and to our guests for the technical difficulties we're having in this segment.  We'll see if we can get them back and continue.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:23:48] CABRERA:  Welcome back.  Right now government officials say there are a little over 11,000 children under the age of 18 being held in detention facilities across the U.S.  We can show you the outside of these immigration facilities.  Some nothing more than tent cities in the desert in the middle of the summer.  We can even take you above them.  This is from footage from our drones.  But the government will not let us take you inside of them.  It will not allow the media or anyone to film.  We can't show you the living conditions of the roughly 2,000 children separated from their parents at the border and taken into federal custody.  </p><p>What do we know?  The only recording we have from inside these centers is one piece of audio obtained by the investigative journalists at ProPublica.  Now this is what it sounds like inside the facility. Children crying.  A 6-year-old girl named Alisson already separated from her mother and begging to be able to call her aunt.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Where are you from?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  El Salvador.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Guatemala.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't cry.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I want to go with my aunt.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You're going to get there.  Look, she will explain it and help you.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  At least can I go with my aunt?  I want her to come.  I want my aunt to come so she can take me to her house.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[18:25:13] CABRERA:  It's not just the media that's being kept in the dark.  Even lawmakers have had trouble getting access to these government-funded facilities to check on these small children.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, we do.  We have permission to do this.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Congressmen titled to do this.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is America.  This isn't Moscow.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  When lawmakers have gotten inside, many are appalled by what they witnessed.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  I am a career prosecutor.  I have visited many prisons and jails.  That is a prison.  You walk through the halls and the doors clink shut, and there are bars on the windows. </p><p>REP. PETER WELCH (D), VERMONT:  Three boys, and I assume they were brothers, and they're on these thin mats that are provided.  And like spoon style they're holding on to each other for dear life with no idea where their parents were.  </p><p>REP. LOIS FRANKEL (D), FLORIDA:  What I saw in these cages was a sea of humanity, little girls, little boys, fathers holding their daughters, mothers holding their daughters who have fled horrible conditions in other countries.  </p><p>REP. ELIZABETH ESTY (D), CONNECTICUT:  We saw a 15-year-old young woman with her child.  We couldn't talk to her because she was too young.  And you think of how afraid you must be to risk your life and your 6-month-old child to make a month-long journey to come to this country, and then you find yourself on a concrete floor covered with mylar.  </p><p>MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK:  There's a young boy, a 9-year-old boy from Honduras named Eddie.  He was taken from his mom at Eagle Pass, Texas, put on a bus with a federal escort to go 2,000 miles to New York City.  Has no idea when he's going to see his mom again.  I mean, think about the trauma.  What's happening to these kids.  </p><p>REP. EARL BLUMENAUER (D), OREGON:  I just kept thinking about my grandkids, under 6, and what would happen to them if their parents' life were at risk to take a journey of hundreds and in some cases thousands of miles and to have them subjected to that.  It's incomprehensible to me.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  These lawmakers' descriptions match pictures the government has released.  They show children sleeping on mats locked inside chain link fencing.  And again, these are photos the government has released.  Photos they're OK with you seeing.  </p><p>The question, if this is what they're willing to show, what aren't they willing to show?  Why not let us in to film?  </p><p>While we wait for access, at least one other lawmaker was allowed into a facility a few hours ago.  Here's Senator Elizabeth Warren describing what she witnessed.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  It's a disturbing picture. There are children by themselves.  I saw a 6-month-old baby.  Little girls, little boys.  There are mothers with their babies and with small children.  Family units are together if it's a very small child. But little girls who are 12 years old are taken away from the rest of their families and held separately or little boys.  And they're all on the concrete floors in cages.  </p><p>There's just no other way to describe it.  They're big chain link cages on cold concrete floors and metal blankets handed out to people. People who are all just waiting and frightened.  </p><p>We are people who believe in the worth of every human being.  And we do have a system of laws in this country.  And when a woman comes here with her 4-year-old son and says I am asking for amnesty, I have been threatened by gangs in my home country, we should at least give her a hearing.  And that is the least that is required of us as a country and as human beings.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  As of today Customs and Border Patrol says it has reunited at least 522 children with their parents.  It's unclear how many if any of the more than 2,000 children in HHS custody have been reunited. But we will not stop asking questions and trying to get the answers.  </p><p>Just ahead, a simply bizarre moment here on CNN.  </p><p>[18:30:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLENN BECK, CEO, THEBLAZE:  No, it's been happening.  We want to stop it, and you want to play those games?  Have a nice day.  </p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN HOST, RELIABLE SOURCES:  What game did I just play? </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  What caused that contentious exchange?  Next, live on CNN NEWSROOM.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA:  News just in to CNN, Stormy Daniels will be interviewed by federal prosecutors in New York tomorrow.  This is part of their investigation into President Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, according to a source.  </p><p>One focus of the questioning for Daniels is expected to be that $130,000 hush money payment she received from Cohen in 2016.  Her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, declined to comment.  </p><p>[18:35:07] The \"Washington Post\" first reported this news.  </p><p>A stunning moment playing out live on CNN this morning is just the latest example of the sheer divisiveness in our society right now.  </p><p>Conservative commentator Glenn Beck walked away in the middle of an interview with our Brian Stelter when he was asked about reporter troubles at his media company.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER:  I do have to ask you, there's this new headline in \"The Daily Beast\" saying that your company's in trouble, that you were trying to find a buyer.  Is this related to the -- BECK:  No.  </p><p>STELTER:  -- point about people not talking to each other?  That if you want to create that media company, there's not interest.  What's going on with that?  </p><p>BECK:  Wow.  Brian, thanks a lot.  I think that's the most ridiculous question I've ever heard.  </p><p>I'm sitting here ready to talk to you about the detaining of children and parents and trying to break families apart, something that has been happening with Janet Reno.  That's why it went to the Supreme Court in the first place, with Janet Reno.  </p><p>It's been happening.  We want to stop it, and you want to play those games?  Have a nice day.  </p><p>STELTER:  What game did I just play?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  With us now, CNN media analyst Bill Carter.  </p><p>Bill, I had to do a double take.  I was like checking my ear because I was listening to that interview when it was happening live.  </p><p>BILL CARTER, CNN MEDIA ANALYST:  Right.  </p><p>CABRERA:  What just happened there?  What do you make of Glenn Beck walking away during a live interview?  </p><p>CABRERA:  Well, there's a couple of things.  He talked about the game, and Brian said, what game am I playing?  </p><p>The game he is playing is called journalism.  And he was asking a completely legitimate question, which happens to be in the news, related to this guest.  </p><p>We don't set up interviews -- no serious journalist sets up interviews and says, I will ask you about this topic and nothing else no matter what is going on with you.  That is never agreed to.  </p><p>And, of course, it just underscores, again, the fact that there are people who think they can control things and will only go on media that's favorable to them.  You know, so they go in their separate little corners, and they only give answers to the questions they want to give.  </p><p>And I think it's -- you know, Ana, I was thinking about comparison. And suppose you were interviewing, let's say, the mayor of New York about the immigrant children brought to New York, and today there was a major subway derailment in New York.  </p><p>Of course, you'd ask him about that, too.  That's in the news.  That's perfectly legitimate.  So Glenn Beck's company is imploding, which is what the report said, and you have to ask him about it, too.  Brian's doing his job.  </p><p>CABRERA:  So you think it was a fair question?  </p><p>CARTER:  Completely fair question.  And not in any way posed even hostilely.  It was like, saying, you know, this --</p><p>CABRERA:  Right.  </p><p>CARTER:  There was this news report and, you know, what do you have to say about it?  It wasn't a hostile question.  And, you know, Glenn Beck was so defensive about it and obviously felt -- you know, he couldn't deal with the question.  He literally walks off, which is, you know, a statement of sorts that he can't answer the question.  </p><p>CABRERA:  And leading up to that, I was listening to that interview and, really, Brian was trying to have this discourse to try to see the other side when so often, as you point out, people stay in their own echo chambers.  </p><p>And now, we have Glenn Beck walking off that interview.  We've had White House staffers being booted from restaurants.  Do you think we'll see more moments like these?  </p><p>CARTER:  Well, I think that, you know, that's a sign that the ugliness that really has started at the top and really was initiated, you know, during the campaign is filtering over into every kind of discourse in the country.  </p><p>You know, I think the incident at the restaurant did not sound like it was hostile or, you know, angry.  It sounded like someone is saying I don't want to serve you because I feel like what you're doing is offensive to my employees.  The employees said they didn't want her there.  </p><p>It's really not much different from the Supreme Court decision about the baker saying he had the right to not bake a cake.  </p><p>I do think, though, that the general tone is incredibly ugly.  I mean, you know, at the same time, you have people complaining about this incident in the restaurant, you have, you know, Sarah Sanders' father tweeting a tweet that looks openly racist.  You know, a crazily racist tweet.  </p><p>And you have the President going on a rant about, you know, John McCain who is terminally ill, you know, like using his Pocahontas racist taunt again.  </p><p>This is ugliness and it is seeping out.  And I don't know that you can control it.  I mean, people are very angry and very upset, and they're reacting.  Their reaction is getting to the point where it's not really, you know, controllable in a usual civil way because those norms have been blown up.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Yes.  I want to play another exchange that happened this weekend.  This one on Fox News just today.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.  </p><p>CABRERA:  This is David Bossie, Trump's former senior campaign aide. Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[18:39:59] DAVID BOSSIE, FORMER DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER TO THE DONALD TRUMP:  Michael Hayden posted a picture of Auschwitz.  </p><p>JOEL PAYNE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Yes, that liberal --</p><p>BOSSIE:  Donny Deutsch is talking --</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, that liberal Michael Hayden.  </p><p>BOSSIE:  Look -- look, you're out of --</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, that screaming liberal Michael Hayden.  </p><p>BOSSIE:  You're out of your cotton-picking mind.  Listen --</p><p>PAYNE:  Cotton-picking mind?  </p><p>BOSSIE:  Listen, you guys are --</p><p>PAYNE:  Brother, let me tell you something.  </p><p>BOSSIE:  You guys are --</p><p>PAYNE:  Let me tell you something.  I've got some --</p><p>BOSSIE:  You guys are out of your mind.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I've got some -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  Well, Bossie did take to Twitter a little later saying -- during a heated segment on \"Fox &amp; Friends\" today, I should have chosen my words more carefully and never used the offensive phrase that I did.  I apologize to Joel Payne, Fox News, and its viewers.  </p><p>Bill, was that a dog whistle or did Bossie not even realize the racial undertones of what he had said?  </p><p>CARTER:  Well, you know, I've seen people trying to defend it by saying well, you know, that's a common phrase in the south.  David Bossie is from Boston.  I don't think he grew up saying that phrase.  </p><p>I think it's kind of extraordinary that he couldn't hear that if he was saying it to a Black commentator.  It's just so over the top and outrageous.  And unfortunately, it's emblematic of what's going on.  </p><p>People are saying things in the past 10 years, 20 years, we thought we'd gotten away from.  I mean, I think it's kind of extraordinary.  </p><p>And, you know, what is Fox going to do about it?  Will they have that guy back on?  Is an apology enough?  </p><p>I mean, we've seen other people apologize.  And obviously, MSNBC had an issue with Joy Reid, and that's sort of been acceptable.  So I don't know that it's necessarily going to mean the end of this guy's, you know, career as a commentator, but it was clearly a really offensive thing to say.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Bill Carter, as always, thank you very much for your perspective.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>CARTER:  Sure thing, Ana.  </p><p>CABRERA:  All right.  Let's get a quick check of what you can expect from your stocks this week, especially after the Dow took a hit on Friday over fears of a trade war.  Here's CNN's Alison Kosik with this week's \"Before the Bell.\" </p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN GENERAL ASSIGNMENT CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Ana.  What trade war?  Yes, the Dow has been whacked by trade fears, but tech stocks are on fire.  The NASDAQ hit a record high on Wednesday.  So did Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google parent Alphabet.  </p><p>So what's going on?  Many investors see big tech as a safe place to park their money, unlike big multinationals that do a lot of business in China.  Names like 3M and Caterpillar have been whipsawed by the headlines on trade.  </p><p>Looking ahead, this week marks the end of an era for the first time in 110 years.  General Electric won't be in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  On Tuesday, it will be replaced by Walgreens.  </p><p>G.E. is dealing with a serious cash crisis.  Shares lost half their value last year and are down another 25 percent this year.  The company is selling off businesses to try to pay down debt.  </p><p>In New York, I'm Alison Kosik.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Our thanks to Alison.  </p><p>The death of CNN's Anthony Bourdain is causing people to step back, to have some difficult conversations.  Just ahead, we'll show you how his fellow chefs are now taking the opportunity to talk about suicide within their own profession.  You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:47:36] CABRERA:  More than two weeks after he tragically took his own life in a French hotel room, the death of our CNN colleague Anthony Bourdain is still sending shock waves throughout the culinary world and beyond.  </p><p>His loss loomed large as chefs, writers, and food critics gathered at the Food &amp; Wine Classic in Aspen.  They and many other groups are now determined to have difficult conversations about suicide.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CABRERA (voice-over):  Two weeks after Anthony Bourdain's death, chefs throughout the culinary community are still feeling his loss.  </p><p>ANDREW ZIMMERN, TRAVEL CHANNEL HOST:  I'm still in shock and surprise. I get very, very sad.  I'm still sad thinking of someone who is in so much pain that that was the choice and the solution.  </p><p>ASHLEY CHRISTENSEN, OWNER, RALEIGH CHEF:  It's warming to hear all these stories about what Anthony Bourdain meant to people and how they're living their lives, I think, to make sure that for every one of those great stories we tell, we remember to bring light to the issue of mental health.  </p><p>ANTHONY BOURDAIN, FORMER CNN HOST:  Suddenly, I look at the hamburger and I find myself in a spiral of depression.  </p><p>CHRISTENSEN:  He was fairly on the sleeve about things that he had dealt with that felt like he had overcome them, and I think that should be a great lesson to us.  </p><p>CABRERA (voice-over):  \"Food &amp; Wine\" contributor Kat Kinsman created the website, Chefs with Issues, to open dialogue about depression and other mental health issues among the culinary community.  </p><p>KAT KINSMAN, SENIOR FOOD AND DRINKS EDITOR, EXTRA CRISPY:  The thing that most people don't know is the ripple effect that happens from this.  Since his death, I have found out about four different suicides in the industry.  This is happening.  This is going to be an ongoing problem.  We have to talk about it.  </p><p>RENEE ERICKSON, 2016 JAMES BEARD AWARD FOR BEST CHEF: NORTHWEST:  It's all of our jobs to be as good of a friend as we can be and trying to like help people when they can but also just really paying attention.  </p><p>CABRERA (voice-over):  Kinsman says there's a simple way to honor Bourdain every time you go out to eat.  </p><p>KINSMAN:  If people really want to pay tribute to Tony and his legacy and everything he taught us about food and life, you have to think about the people who bring you that food and bring you those experiences.  </p><p>Go to your local restaurants.  Get to know those people.  Respect them.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CABRERA:  The conversation continues here on CNN with \"FINDING HOPE: BATTLING AMERICA'S SUICIDE CRISIS,\" hosted by Anderson Cooper.  That is coming up in just a few moments at 7:00 Eastern.  </p><p>[18:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA:  In this week's episode of \"UNITED SHADES OF AMERICA,\" W. Kamau Bell take the trip up north to Canada to see if it's the progressive paradise a lot of Americans think it is.  And, of course, he asked Canadians what they think of life below their southern border.  </p><p>Take a listen to some of the responses he got.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>W. KAMAU BELL, CNN HOST:  What would you say is the biggest difference between Canada and the United States of America?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In Canada, no matter where I go, people are really informed about what's going on in Canada and what's going on in the world.  And some of the places I saw in the U.S. really don't know a whole lot.  And I'm sorry.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I really have been cautious with what I say.     </p><p>BELL:  Oh, it's OK.  I can't act like that's not true.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But it's not like what's happening in the U.S. There's a lot more --</p><p>[18:55:02] BELL:  No, let's -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- more understanding.  </p><p>BELL:  Let's talk about this.  What do you mean about this?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well --</p><p>BELL:  What does that -- what do you mean by what's happening in the -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, south of the border type situation.  </p><p>BELL:  I don't think, in my perspective, with maybe, like --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.  </p><p>BELL:  -- south of the border?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  </p><p>BELL:  But in this case, I do.  From your perspective, what's going on south of the border?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, people are staying in their section, whether they're White, Black, Asian.  I think that, in Canada, there is a lot of that understanding.  </p><p>You know, there's a lot of Americans, when they come up here, they go, oh, it's really like that up here?  You know, I can walk safely, I can do this.  And it -- it is always like this?  I say, yes, this is Canada.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes, yes.   (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  W. Kamau Bell joins us live from Oakland, California.  </p><p>Kamau, in those discussions with Canadians, did you get the sense that their perception of Americans has actually changed because of or during the Trump presidency?  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  I mean, there is a clear idea that when Obama was president, they felt differently about us than they felt when we elected President Trump.  </p><p>There is -- you know, the way that we sort of, many of us in America, condescend and criticize Mexico, it's the same exact thing that's happening from Canada to us right now because of the Trump administration.  </p><p>CABRERA:  There were people, I recall, who threatened to leave the U.S. if Trump got elected, and you actually talked to one guy who did. Why did he leave and how are things working out for him?  </p><p>BELL:  I mean, the funny thing about this guy is -- his name's Mark Nykanen, he used to be a journalist at NBC News -- he left twice.  </p><p>He left during the Bush administration.  And then when we elected Obama, he's like, OK, I think it's safe to come back.  And then the night that Trump was elected, him and his wife decided to go back.  </p><p>And it's going great from up there.  He feels like he shouldn't have left to come back during the Obama administration because of the fact of Canada, at its core, has an idea -- and it's not perfect.  We also talked to an activist about murdered and missing indigenous women. But there's an idea of inclusion and taking care of your people that we don't have in this country.  </p><p>CABRERA:  And one way they are taking care of their people is through their health care system, which is often idealized by people on the American left.  Are there lessons we can learn from the Canadian way?  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  Canada has a lot of criticisms of its own health care system, but the minute they hear about our system, they go, oh, yes, this is way better up here.  They understand -- they put resources into taking care of their people in ways that we don't put those resources in taking care of the people.  </p><p>We take it into -- we put it into other areas that we don't -- that we frankly don't need it and don't help society.  So they understand about the importance of the government to provide a healthier lifestyle for its people than we do.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Is it more expensive?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BELL:  I mean, I'll take higher taxes over Affordable Health Care any day.  So, yes, obviously, those -- the prices come someplace, but nothing's perfect.  Canada's not perfect, but I do think that the direction that they're leaning into is the direction that we should be pursuing.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Americans often view Canada as maybe a milder, more polite version of the U.S.  What did you learn about Canadian culture that makes it distinctive from American culture?  </p><p>BELL:  I think that they are more conscious of themselves as an international place and the place where more diversity and more -- and new people sort of help strengthen the society in a way that, in America, we pay a lot of lip service to that but it's not actually how -- it's not embedded into our policies.  </p><p>I mean, a lot of people who are pursuing refugee status in this country have actually moved up to Canada.  And they actually are overwhelming Canada's refugee system because they think Canada is the thing they thought America was.  </p><p>So I think that it's certainly -- we think of it as America Junior, but I think of it as hopefully America's future.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Well, that's interesting.  I know you also had some fun, got an up-close look at one of Canada's favorite sports, curling.  What was it like to play?  </p><p>BELL:  I mean, I'm not on the ice often.  Ice sports are not most Black Americans' number one thing to do, so --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BELL:  But I know some of us do play hockey but, you know, I found out, I actually -- I'm actually pretty good at curling.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Yes?  </p><p>BELL:  You'll find out tonight.  I do fall a few times, but maybe that's what I should've been doing instead of television.  Maybe I should be a curler.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Do you think you found a new calling?  </p><p>BELL:  You know, I'm always looking for more jobs.  I just had a third child so I'm always looking for new jobs.  </p><p>CABRERA:  Well, tell us a little bit about the sport.  Because a lot of us became just a little bit familiar during the Olympics, but it's still a little foreign to a lot of Americans.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  The thing about curling is that it's a sport that anybody can do of any size or health level.  I mean, it's really -- like we saw giant, like six-foot-five, athletic-looking men there, and then there was a tiny woman there who was -- a tiny, older woman there who was doing the sport too.  </p><p>So it's actually -- it's sort of a very Canadian thing that everybody can play and everybody can be good at it, no matter what their size or health level is.  Or ages.  </p><p>CABRERA:  I look to -- I look forward to seeing you in action tonight. </p><p>W. Kamau Bell, thank you for joining us.  </p><p>BELL:  Thank you.  </p><p>CABRERA:  As always, tune in for his all-new episode of \"UNITED SHADES OF AMERICA\" tonight at 10:00 Eastern and Pacific, only on CNN.  </p><p>[19:00:00] I'm Ana Cabrera in New York.

We've criticized a bunch of Senator Josh Hawley's nonsense[1] over the past few months. After all, he's the elite cosmopolitan \"get big government out of business\" Senator who is railing against elite cosmopolitans, while demanding that government get deeply involved in regulating companies. Well, not all companies. </p><p>Just tech companies. It's almost as if Hawley is deliberately picking on companies that he thinks don't like his insane brand of politics. Anyway, while Hawley has introduced a slew of nonsensical bills targeting internet companies, the most laughable was the one that literally lays out what features certain websites can and cannot use. As we wrote in our post about it, Hawley seems to want to appoint himself the product manager of the internet[2]. Saagar Enjeti, a reporter for The Hill, recently sat down with Hawley, and Enjeti has posted some highlights from the interview[3]. It's kind of scary that this guy is a sitting US Senator, as almost everything he talks about, he demonstrates an astounding, almost comical, level of ignorance or a clearly superficial understanding. But, hilariously, Enjeti actually asks him specifically to respond to my criticism[4] that he's trying to appoint himself the product manager for the internet. Hawley's response is... not good. 5/ A @techdirt[5] columnist accused @HawleyMO[6] of wanting to be the product manager of the internet with his proposals to ban infinite scroll, 30 min restrictions, among other things. His counter: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/XGmKCIGbGc\">https://t.co/XGmKCIGbGc</url>[7] pic.twitter.com/Su8g3X0ayj[8]; \u2014 Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) September 17, 2019[9]Let's write out the transcript here, because it is unbelievable. It's so unbelievable that I don't even think Hawley understands what his own bill says, and I'm almost wondering if he's commenting about a different bill, introduced in the other part of Congress.Enjeti: So I also want to talk about your SMART Act. It's probably the most criticized foray of yours within the Big Tech debate. Among other things, you've proposed banning infinite scroll, autoplay, limiting users to 30 minutes a day. A Techdirt columnist said you want to appoint yourself \"product manager of the internet.\" What would your counter to that be? Hawley: My counter is that parents ought to be in control of raising their children, not big tech. So parents ought to have tools and options and support. So take the thing limiting 30 minutes for apps usage. I mean parents can change that. It's a default setting. But it gives control to parents to say, \"look, these tech companies whose entire business model is focused on getting my kids addicted and then stealing, essentially, their information, and then turning around and selling it, it's time to stop that.\" It's time to give parents control. To say, look, if I'm comfortable with my kids online, fine, that's the parents' choice, and the kids' choice. But it shouldn't be big tech's choice. Big tech shouldn't be raising our children. Infinite scroll and autoplay. These are technologies, quote unquote, that Big Tech has developed, in concert with psychologists, to try to get us -- and, again, especially kids and teenagers -- addicted to their platforms. Why should they be able to do that without scrutiny? Why shouldn't we give parents the ability to say \"no\"? It ought to be a choice, but the choice and the power of the choice ought to be in the hands of the family. Not in the hands of some Google executive.First of all, none of this makes any sense at all. Parents already have that control. Not tech companies. Parents can block their kids from using certain services or apps or can use any number of the fairly long list of third party services to help control how much their kids use these services or their devices. Isn't that the free market at work, Senator Hawley? Second, Hawley's bill[10] doesn't actually do anything that he suggests above. The word \"parent\" doesn't even appear in the bill at all. Regarding the 30 minute limit, the bill says nothing about parents, but does say that any social media platform has to default to a limit of 30 minutes per day for all users, and while it does allow those users to alter the limit, it resets every month, and Hawley's bill requires the services to continue to nag users. It doesn't say that the ability to change the limit should be for parents changing things for their kids. Indeed, how hard would it be for kids to change the settings? The same is true of the ban on autoplay and infinite scroll. Those are listed as \"prohibited practices\" -- not \"tools for parents to help their kids.\" Yes, it does say that services can offer a way for users to \"opt-in\" to both, but says this can be accomplished by \"pushing a button.\" Does Senator Hawley think that kids can't push buttons? Also, we won't even get into how wrong he is to argue these companies are either \"stealing their information\" or \"turning around and selling it\" (though, Senator Hawley, if they're selling it, can you tell us where to buy it? Because it's not actually happening. But, damn, you could really prove your point if you went out and bought that \"stolen\" information that you insist is for sale), but it seems worth pointing out that Hawley exempts autoplay ads from his autoplay ban. If he were really concerned about the privacy implications and the data implications of these services, then, um, wouldn't that include ads? But, nope, Hawley's all happy to let these companies continue autoplay if it's for making money. And, while I'd normally say this goes without saying, it appears to need saying based on Hawley's own confused comments: how the hell is a bill that has the government \"make choices\" for you an example of \"giving more choices\" to parents? Honestly, so much of Hawley's description of his own bill actually sounds like he's talking about an entirely different (but still dumb) bill, the one that was introduced by Rep. Goasar in the House, and which would require companies to offer content moderation tools for end users[11]. That one, you could credibly argue, is about putting more control in the hands of end users (parents or not...). But, really, all we're left with here is a Senator who doesn't seem to understand how technology works, what his own bill says or does, what it means for \"big government\" to meddle in private businesses, or, really, anything. How is this guy in a position of power?Permalink[12] | Comments[13] | Email This Story[14] [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url

Continue reading Senator Josh Hawley is making the conservative case against Facebook</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I think Facebook is an extremely creepy company  I m not a big fan. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After years of escalating scandals, Congress is looking for ways to crack down on the size and power of tech companies like Facebook and Google. On the Democratic side, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has taken the lead by calling for new antitrust regulations that would break up the companies and usher in a new era of anti-monopoly action. Republican concerns have been harder to pin down, often veering off into deplatforming conspiracies or conflicting theories of free speech, but no less aggressive.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, has emerged as a surprising Republican voice on those issues. The youngest working lawmaker in the Senate, Hawley has taken a lead on the ongoing investigations into Facebook, joining with Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) in February for a letter probing the company s teen data collection practices, and penning legislation with Democrats that would extend more rigorous privacy protections for children. He s also been outspoken in calling for changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, often seen as the central legal protection for online platforms.</p><p>On February 28th, The Verge sat down with Sen. Hawley at his temporary office on Capitol Hill. Hawley and his staff currently work in the basement of the Dirksen office building with other junior senators as they await a more permanent place to set up shop. Despite the temporary nature of the office, Hawley was surrounded by reminders of his home state, including a map of Missouri and its state flag.</p><p>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Over the past two years, Congress has worked to build out federal data privacy legislation, particularly after</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook s Cambridge Analytica scandal</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">. What do you think is the right path forward when it comes to privacy?</emphasis></p><p> We re trying to figure out what a property right in data actually looks like </p><p>I think that the whole gamut should be on the table for what it looks like. First of all, what would it look like to toughen up the disclosure requirements? With what these companies currently disclose, what Google in particular currently discloses, consumers don t have any idea what has been collected. There s also consent. Are consumers given the chance to meaningfully consent? And maybe I have consented, but now I want all of my data back and I want it all gone. Or I want all my kids  data back or for it to all be gone. I think those are all things that we ought to look at.</p><p>From a legal perspective, we re trying to figure out what a property right in data actually looks like. These companies are taking that data. It is very valuable. You would think it belongs to the consumer, but that s really the discussion we re having. Who does it belong to? It s time to start assigning the property rights and building up a legal regime around it.</p><p>Over the last decade, a consumer s data has become much more valuable. But consumers don t necessarily realize it. If you think about these familiar applications like Gmail and Facebook, to the user they look about the same as they did 10 years ago. But the cost to the user is much higher now because those companies are collecting and extracting incredible amounts of personal and private data, and the users have absolutely no idea. They haven t been informed about it. They haven t had the option to meaningfully consent.</p><p> Every parent in America is concerned about the privacy of their children s data. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You ve spoken a lot about children s privacy. Just last month, the FTC penalized the app Tik Tok with</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a record-setting $5.7 million fine</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">for violating the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Do you think there are any meaningful changes to COPPA that should be made?</emphasis></p><p>I think it s a great place to begin, because a lot of folks can agree that children are different than consenting adults. So let s start with children. Every parent in America is concerned about the privacy of their children s data. It s so much more urgent than it was when COPPA was first passed. The landscape has changed so dramatically. As the father of a six-year-old and a four-year-old, I am paranoid not just about what my children see online, but what is being taken from them. The profile that is taken and built from them will be used to track them and direct the markets around them for the rest of their lives.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Speaking of the FTC, the Commission recently announced</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a new task force aimed at enforcing anti-monopoly standards</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">. Lawmakers have criticized the FTC for not being as tough as it should be in the past whether that s due to leadership or a lack of resources. Do you think they re capable of following through with this new program?</emphasis></p><p>I m hopeful. I think it s a really good sign. We ve been seeing signs that Facebook could see some sort of FTC enforcement activity soon, and I m hopeful about that, too. I ve been vocal in criticizing the FTC and past actions toward Facebook and Google. I thought they were pretty weak. So I m glad to see some outward signs here of them getting a little more serious and a little tougher. It was interesting to see that they re going to go back and look at previously approved mergers. I think you re seeing a pretty significant shift in tone from the Department of Justice, too.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A lot of people took that to mean Facebook could be forced to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp. Do you think that s a good idea? Or have they done a good enough job integrating the services?</emphasis></p><p>I think Facebook is an extremely creepy company. I don t know if they ve done a good job with anything. I m not a very big fan.</p><p>We need to have a discussion, though, about what antitrust looks like when applied to the tech world. Our antitrust laws and our antitrust doctrine in the courts are not really developed to talk about this. So we ll have that discussion in the courts. It should probably also happen here [in Congress]. You have to think about privacy. You have to think about competition. You have to think about speech bias. I mean, these companies are so huge and their influence is so massive that any action impacts huge parts of society and law.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What drew you to tech policy originally?</emphasis></p><p>As attorney general, I heard from so many parents who were concerned about their children s privacy, or about what their kids see online, or about the profiles these companies build on their children online and keep forever. I m a parent of young children. I have two little boys. So for my wife and I, and for the folks that I talked to as attorney general, that was really such a felt concern.</p><p>I have been concerned about monopoly in the marketplace for a long, long time. One of the things about the big tech issue is that it touches so many different concerns. You ve got the privacy concerns. You ve got the economic, competition concerns. You ve got the bias and speech concerns. You put all of that under one umbrella. These companies are so big, so powerful. It really is, I think, one of the great defining issues of our day.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">At William Barr s confirmation hearing last year, you were one of the only senators who brought up his position on antitrust enforcement, especially as it relates to these big tech companies. But you ve shown a particular interest in this policy area for a while. In 2017, you prompted an antitrust investigation into Google as Missouri attorney general. What drove you to pursue that antitrust suit with Google?</emphasis></p><p> Bias really does have an effect. </p><p>You have to understand, in my first few months as attorney general, there was the Equifax data breach, which we investigated. Then there was another major breach some months later. So many folks around the time said to me,  I didn t realize that this kind of information was even out there.  And of course, for Google and Facebook, there s far more information. So we started taking a very hard look at what these companies are collecting. What are they telling consumers? Are they giving consumers an opportunity to opt in or out meaningfully? Then you get to their anti-competitive conduct, and that s what led me ultimately to launch formal investigations of both Google and then Facebook.</p><p>I m really proud of the fact that we were the first law enforcement agency, certainly the first attorney general s office, to launch a full-scale antitrust, consumer protection, and data privacy investigation into Google. The reaction when we did it was this horrified gasp. A lot of folks on my side of the aisle had concerns.  Whoa, look what is going on here,  they said,  these companies are too big to do this to. They will slap you. They will hurt you.  But now, there are more and more states joining in. Right now, there s a multi-state working group among the attorneys general as it relates to technology companies. Two years ago, that was unthinkable.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You and other members like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) have been concerned about viewpoint discrimination against conservatives on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, but almost no Democrats share those concerns. Do you think this should play a big part in the antitrust push?</emphasis></p><p>Conservatives ought to be concerned about the bias that the dominant online social media platforms are exercising. And increasing numbers of actual, real, normal people who use those platforms today feel that they are experiencing biased viewpoints. That s a real thing and the reason it matters is these companies are so big. These platforms are so powerful and the control over the information flow to consumers of these platforms so significant that bias really does have an effect. Some research suggests that the bias in Google s algorithm and Facebook s algorithm could influence the results of the election. That s a big deal for a democracy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Part of the problem is that companies are allowed a lot of discretion in how they moderate, with existing laws like Section 230 of the CDA protecting them from liability over moderation decisions. In plain terms, the law lets them make their own decisions about what to allow on their own platform. Would you want to limit that protection?</emphasis></p><p> People say,  Well, where would you draw the line?  Well, First Amendment law has drawn this line for a long time. </p><p>Section 230 is significant because it is such a broad exemption from traditional liability. It s a really sweet deal. It s allowed these companies to get really, really big and it was supposed to be pro-competition and pro-innovation. But it s allowed a lot of these mega-companies to get really big, really rich, and really powerful and to avoid competition. And it has allowed these companies to exert editorial influence without being subject to the usual controls on editorial activity.</p><p>So I think we need to look at Section 230. I think we need to consider what reforms need to be made there in order to prevent viewpoint discrimination. We re not talking about stopping speech that advocates crime. American law has long had ways of dealing with that in a First Amendment context. What we re talking about is when these platforms exert editorial control to shut down political speech that they don t like. And there s no recourse, in part because of 230.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The concern is that, once you start tinkering with Section 230, it would lead to even more censorship, directed by the government instead of the platforms.</emphasis></p><p>The problem is that the dominant platforms are engaging in censorship now, there s just no recourse. People say,  Well, where would you draw the line?  Well, First Amendment law has drawn this line for a long time. We ve thought through this for literally more than a century now. So, the line-drawing problems are not as difficult as folks make it sound. The law has developed clearly what s the difference between speech that is illegal, and therefore protected, and then viewpoint speech.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Much of the recent antitrust pressure has come from progressives like</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the Open Markets Institute</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">or Elizabeth Warren. Some conservatives see it as government overreach, using regulatory agencies to interfere with private business. Why don t you see it that way?</emphasis></p><p>I dispute that it hasn t been a part of conservative values. If you believe in the free market then you re not a monopoly. You have to be for free, open, fair competition and that s what we re talking about here. Monopoly control of markets that is anti-competitive, that keeps new competition out, that is not pro-free market. That is not something as a part of conservatism that I ve recognized.</p><p>Tags: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Website:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18271487/josh-hawley-senator-missouri-republican-facebook-google-antitrust-data-privacy\">https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18271487/josh-hawley-senator-missouri-republican-facebook-google-antitrust-data-privacy</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contact Information:</emphasis><br/>Makena Kelly<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tags:</emphasis><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/\">Wire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/artificial-intelligence-newswire/\">Artificial Intelligence Newswire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/\">United States</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpicrowdnewswirecomp1302402</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPB-BGN1-JCTB-F4TT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2193\"/><timeReceived>1:40 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 21, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand[1] has a plan to fix that, and has issued a call to create a domestic privacy regulator that would close the gap between the US and other nations. In a post on Medium, the New Yorker senator said that she would introduce legislation to create a new Data Protection Agency. Gillibrand says that as so much commerce is now conducted online, there's an imbalance between the rights of users and those who control our data. </p><p>\"Lawlessness in the data privacy space,\" she writes, \"can give rise to new, unexpected forms of injustice.\" Like many lawmakers, she says that Google and Facebook, amongst others, have made \"a whole lot of money\" from our private data.\"And she says the risks, when things go wrong, are getting worse as a consequence of how much data these bodies hold about us. Gillibrand cites the Equifax breach[2] as a prime example, saying that the company's failure to properly safeguard the data allowed hackers to make off with so much information. And yet, she says, the company \"has faced few consequences and little accountability for what happened.\"There are a number of voices which are asking for an improved privacy and data protection regime in the US, often looking to Europe's GDPR for inspiration. Apple CEO Tim Cook[3] has called for[4] the US to adopt GDPR-style data privacy rules[5] in the US, as has the House Energy and Commerce Committee[6]. The latter, back in 2019, said that the FTC -- which currently handles such cases -- wasn't sufficiently empowered to act as a proper privacy regulator, and needed support.A group of 51 companies[7], including Amazon, IBM and Qualcomm, have also lobbied Washington in the hope of getting stronger data privacy laws. In October 2019, Senator Ron Wyden sponsored[8] the Mind Your Own Business Act[9], which would give the FTC more powers. Similarly, rival proposals are being pushed around the Senate Commerce Committee, although The Hill[10] says the plan is still being worked out.Gillibrand says that the proposed Data Protection Agency would serve as a \"'referee' to define, arbitrate and enforce rules to defend the protection of our personal data.\" It would be responsible for investigating complaints, pushing for better privacy protections and advise lawmakers on issues like deepfakes.CNBC[11] points out that Gillibrand's proposal mirrors that from California Democrats Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lofgren, who are also calling[12] for a dedicated privacy agency. The outlet claims to have read a draft of the Gillibrand bill, which would give the new agency powers to bring civil actions against bad actors. And if it finds a company has knowingly violated federal privacy law, then fines would be capped at $1 million per day.It remains to be seen how well the bill will survive in an environment with a number of competing privacy bills and seemingly insurmountable partisan gridlock. Especially since Gillibrand's bill leaves some room for states to shape their own rules, and suddenly Republicans are in favor of federal regulations that supercedes states rights. But it is clear that, given the number of people demanding something must be done to reign in big tech, the days of lax data protection laws are numbered.

So it came as little surprise on Monday when he released a draft white paper listing out \"potential police proposals for [the] regulation of social media and technology firms.\"[1] Unlike much of what comes out of Congress, it does appear that whoever put together this paper spent a fair bit of time thinking through a wide variety of ideas, recognizing that every option has potential consequences -- both positive and negative. That is, while there's a lot in the paper I don't agree with, it is (mostly) not in the hysterical moral panic nature found around such debates as FOSTA/SESTA. The paper lays out three major issues that it hopes to deal with: Disinformation that undermines trust in our institutions, democracy, free press, and markets. </p><p>Consumer protection in the digital age Antitrust issues around large platforms and the impact it may have on competition and innovation.All of these are issues worth discussing and thinking about carefully, though I fear that bad policy-making around any of them could actually serve to make other problems even worse. Indeed, it seems that most ideas around solving the first problem might create problems for the other two. Or solving the third problem could create problems for the first one. And so on. That is not to say that we should throw up our hands and automatically say \"do nothing.\" But, we should tread carefully, because there are also an awful lot of special interests (a la FOSTA, and Articles 11 and 13 in the EU) who are looking at any regulation of the internet as an opportunity to remake the internet in a way that brings back gatekeeper power.On a related note, we should also think carefully about how much of a problem each of the three items listed above are. I know that there are good reasons to be concerned about all three, and there are clear examples of how each one is a problem. But just how big a problem they are, and whether or not that will remain the case is important to examine. Mike Godwin has been writing an important series for us over the last few months (part 1[2], part 2[3] and part 3[4]) which makes a compelling case that many of the problems that everyone is focused on may be the result of a bit of moral panic, overreacting to a smaller problem and not realizing how small it is. We'll likely take more time to analyze the various policy proposals in the white paper over time, but let's focus in on the big one that everyone is talking about: the idea of opening up Section 230 again.Make platforms liable for state-law torts (defamation, false light, public disclosure of private facts) for failure to take down deep fake or other manipulated audio/video content -- Due to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, internet intermediaries like social media platforms are immunized from state tort and criminal liability. However, the rise of technology like DeepFakes -- sophisticated image and audio tools that cart generate fake audio or video files falsely depicting someone saying or doing something -- is poised to usher in an unprecedented wave of false and defamatory content, with state law-based torts (dignitary torts) potentially offering the only effective redress to victims. Dignitary torts such as defamation, invasion of privacy, false light, and public disclosure of private facts represent key mechanisms for victims to enjoin and deter sharing of this kind of content. Currently the onus is on victims to exhaustively search for, and report, this content to platforms who frequently take months to respond and who are under no obligation thereafter to proactively prevent the same content from being re-uploaded in the future. Many victims describe a \"whack-a-mole\" situation. Even if a victim has successfully secured a judgment against the user who created the offending content, the content in question in many cases will be re-uploaded by other users. In economic terms, platforms represent \"least-cost avoiders\" of these harms; they are in the best place to identify and prevent this kind of content from being propagated on their platforms. Thus, a revision to Section 230 could provide the ability for users who have successfully proved that sharing of particular content by another user constituted a dignitary tort to give notice of this judgement to a platform; with this notice, platforms would be liable in instances where they did not prevent the content in question from being re-uploaded in the future a process made possible by existing perceptual hashing technology (e.g. the technology they use to identify and automatically take down child pornography). Any effort on this front would need to address the challenge of distinguishing true DeepFakes aimed at spreading disinformation from satire or other legitimate forms of entertainment and parody.So this seems very carefully worded and structured. Specifically, it would appear to require first a judicial ruling on the legality of the content itself, and then would require platforms to avoid having that content re-uploaded, or face liability if it were. The good part of this proposal is the requirement that the content go through a full legal adjudication before a takedown would actually happen. That said, there are some serious concerns about this. First of all, as we've documented many times here on Techdirt, there have been many, many examples of either sketchy lawsuits[5] that were filed solely to get a ruling on the books to try to take down perfectly legitimate content. If you don't remember the details, there were a few different variants on this, but the standard one was to file a John Doe lawsuit, then (almost immediately) claim to have identified the \"John Doe\" who admits to everything and agrees to a \"settlement\" admitting defamation. The \"plaintiff\" then sends this to the platforms as \"proof\" that the content should be taken down. If Warner's proposal goes through as is, you could see how that could become a lot more common, and you could see a series of similar tricks as well. Separately, it could potentially increase the number of sketchy and problematic defamation lawsuits filed in the hopes of getting content deleted. One would hope that if Warner did push down this road, he would only do so in combination with a very strong federal anti-SLAPP law that would help deal with the inevitable flood of questionable defamation lawsuits that would come with it. To his credit, Warner's white paper acknowledges at least some of the concerns that would come with this proposal:Reforms to Section 230 are bound to elicit vigorous opposition, including from digital liberties groups and online technology providers. Opponents of revisions to Section 230 have claimed that the threat of liability will encourage online service providers to err on the side of content takedown, even in non-meritorious instances. Attempting to distinguish between true disinformation and legitimate satire could prove difficult. However, the requirement that plaintiffs successfully obtain court judgements that the content in question constitutes a dignitary tort which provides significantly more process than something like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notice and takedown regime for copyright-infringing works may limit the potential for frivolous or adversarial reporting. Further, courts already must make distinctions between satire and defamation/libel.This is all true, but it does not take into account how these bogus defamation cases may come into play. It also fails to recognize that some of this stuff is extremely context specific. The paper points to hashing technology like those used in spotting child pornography. But such content involves a strict liability -- where there are no circumstances under which it is considered legal. Broader speech is not like that. As the paper acknowledges in determining whether or not a \"deepfake\" is satire, much of this is likely to be context specific. And so, even if certain content may represent a tort in one context, it might not in others. Yet under this hashing proposal, the content would be barred in all contexts. As a separate concern, this might also make it that much harder to study content like deepfakes in ways that might prove useful in recognizing and identifying faked content. Again, this paper is not presented in the hysterical manner found in other attempts to regulate internet platforms, but it also does very little beyond a perfunctory \"digital liberties groups might not like it\" to explore the potential harms, risks and downsides to this kind of approach. One hopes that if Warner and others continue to pursue such a regulatory path, that much more caution would go into the process.Permalink[6] | Comments[7] | Email This Story[8] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4623358-PlatformPolicyPaper.pdf\">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4623358-PlatformPolicyPaper.pdf</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171128/23565738694/everything-thats-wrong-with-social-media-big-internet-companies-part-1.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171128/23565738694/everything-thats-wrong-with-social-media-big-internet-companies-part-1.shtml</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180128/11001839096/everything-thats-wrong-with-social-media-big-internet-companies-part-2.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180128/11001839096/everything-thats-wrong-with-social-media-big-internet-companies-part-2.shtml</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180715/22144840240/everything-thats-wrong-with-social-media-companies-big-tech-platforms-part-3.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180715/22144840240/everything-thats-wrong-with-social-media-companies-big-tech-platforms-part-3.shtml</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170317/13262836941/filing-bogus-lawsuits-as-part-reputation-management-strategy-costs-firm-71000.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170317/13262836941/filing-bogus-lawsuits-as-part-reputation-management-strategy-costs-firm-71000.shtml</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180731/10183940336/senator-mark-warner-lays-out-ideas-regulating-internet-platforms.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180731/10183940336/senator-mark-warner-lays-out-ideas-regulating-internet-platforms.shtml</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180731/10183940336/senator-mark-warner-lays-out-ideas-regulating-internet-platforms.shtml#comments\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180731/10183940336/senator-mark-warner-lays-out-ideas-regulating-internet-platforms.shtml#comments</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180731/10183940336/senator-mark-warner-lays-out-ideas-regulating-internet-platforms.shtml?op=sharethis\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180731/10183940336/senator-mark-warner-lays-out-ideas-regulating-internet-platforms.shtml?op=sharethis</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIRT1023051533060746719251765300182</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIRT-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXN-MSW1-F03R-N4W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1686\"/><timeReceived>6:12 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Techdirt</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 31, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NATURE FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

He's not really showing that. He's been leading the charge to regulate various parts of the internet, which might be fine if he knew what the fuck he was talking about. </p><p>But, as is made clear in his latest interview with Newsweek, he's extremely confused about the legal underpinnings of the internet[1]. Specifically, he is repeating Senator Ted Cruz's myth[2] that Section 230 was designed to only apply to \"neutral\" platforms that don't moderate.Can you explain Section 230?Section 230 was called the Communications Decency Act in the late '90s, and at that moment in time, there was a decision made that social media companies, and their connections, were going to be viewed as kind of just dumb pipes, not unlike a telco. The platform companies would have no obligation for the content that went over their networks. In the late '90s, that might have made sense. But in 2019, when 65 percent of Americans get some\u2014or all\u2014of their news from Facebook and Google, there is clearly some curation going on.This is literally the opposite of truth. It is the opposite of what happened and is the opposite of why Section 230 was put in place. As we've discussed over and over again, Section 230 was a direct response to the ruling in Stratton Oakmont v. Prodigy[3], in which Prodigy (an ISP, not a \"social network\") was deemed liable for content it had not moderated, because it did heavy moderation on its forums in an effort to be \"family friendly.\" The point of Section 230 was to encourage moderation, and to not have internet services be \"dumb pipes.\" Senator Warner might know this if he just read the law. There's a whole section on how the law is designed to encourage more moderation by the platforms, and then it says directly:No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protectedThat's the law encouraging sites to moderate. Senator Warner's description is just repeating the myth that Senator Cruz has been stating for over a year. We weren't surprised that other members of Cruz's party were repeating that nonsense, but Warner's party had mostly been making different stupid comments about Section 230, so it's disappointing to see him revisit this myth. Other parts of the interview are actually good -- and he even brings up that interoperability and the ability to move to a competing service with your data might be a better approach than breaking up the big internet companies. And, on that, he's correct. But if he's premising his decisions regarding 230 on a history that gets the law literally exactly backwards, it's difficult to put much faith in him getting any changes correct.Permalink[4] | Comments[5] | Email This Story[6] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/2019/10/04/mark-warner-big-tech-social-media-legislation-1460848.html?amp=1...witter_impression=true\">https://www.newsweek.com/2019/10/04/mark-warner-big-tech-social-media-legislation-1460848.html?amp=1...witter_impression=true</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180410/13530139604/ted-cruz-gets-section-230-all-wrong-while-zuck-claims-hes-not-familiar-with-it.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180410/13530139604/ted-cruz-gets-section-230-all-wrong-while-zuck-claims-hes-not-familiar-with-it.shtml</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratton_Oakmont,_Inc._v._Prodigy_Services_Co\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratton_Oakmont,_Inc._v._Prodigy_Services_Co</url>.

Warner, a Virginia Democrat, vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Intelligence and a former telecommunications venture capitalist, published a white paper last year proposing a variety of legislative curbs on the tech industry. Those suggestions included putting the onus on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to identify bots and foreign election interference. Warner also has bipartisan co-sponsors for a variety of legislation aimed at curbing tech, including the so-called Honest Ads Act, which would require Facebook, Google and other platforms to be transparent about who is paying for political ads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He is clearly onto something. The end of 2019 is shaping up to be a watershed period for the issue of how much the U.S. should regulate Silicon Valley. Seven states, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, have already announced an antitrust investigation of Facebook; most of the states' attorneys general are probing Google over anti-competitive behavior. Additionally, the House Judiciary Committee just demanded Amazon, Google and Facebook hand over the personal emails of those companies' executives, hunting for evidence of anti-competitive schemes.</p><p>Warner, in a recent wide-ranging interview with Newsweek, explains why the era of unregulated Big Tech may be coming to an end. Here are some edited excerpts:</p><p>Newsweek: You said the 2016 election revealed \"The dark underbelly of an entire system.\" Is there any chance of protective legislation being passed before the election season? Isn't it an emergency? Warner: Our system is not secure in 2020. I would argue there are a variety of solutions that would get 80 votes on the floor of the Senate if we were allowed to vote. These are all bipartisan bills. First, to make sure if a foreign government intervenes, the appropriate response is not to say thank you, but to tell the FBI. Second, to make sure that every polling station in America has backup paper ballots. Third, that the Honest Ads Act, which makes sure that there are the same reporting requirements for political ads on Facebook and Google as there are in Newsweek and on television. Fourth, some rules of the road in terms of how social media platforms operate. The Wild, Wild West for these social media platforms is coming to an end.</p><p>Senator Mitch McConnell is the gatekeeper; he is not allowing these things to come to the floor where there would be bipartisan support. Why? He's had a consistent position against campaign-finance and election-related legislation. One of the things that's incumbent on me and Democrats and others is to keep elevating election security and protection of our democracy as a top issue.</p><p>What is your biggest fear about 2020 and big data? Won't there be exponentially more data points for each American--that are on sale for political strategists--than Cambridge Analytica ever imagined having access to? Yes. Exponentially more. We know that Russia will be back because it worked in 2016. If you add all they spent on Brexit, France and the U.S. election together, it's less than the cost of one new F-35. We're seeing 21st century conflict by cyber means, and mis- and disinformation means, as a cheap and effective tool. My biggest fear: Russians will continue to obtain information that they will then weaponize with a much more massive use of manipulation. That would be through both deepfake technology and the creation of both [fake] individuals and bots at an unprecedented level masquerading as Americans. They'll try to drive our debate in a way that will clearly change what kind of news we read and could change the outcome of the election.</p><p>There is a lot of tension between the U.S. intelligence community and Facebook, Google and Apple about sharing more data with respect to the election. The government is saying, \"You need to give us more to protect,\" and the position on the other side is, \"We're already doing enough to protect the election.\" Are Washington and Silicon Valley at war? I don't believe they're at war, and I do believe the social media companies are getting better. But we don't have the luxury of taking two or three more years to figure this out. We need, in a sense, a fusion center where we have intel and the prominent platforms-- Facebook, Google, Twitter--jointly sharing information.</p><p>What do you think of the House Judiciary Committee calling for big tech executives' emails? I think big tech is making a huge error by not further engaging with the national government. We have been ceding the regulatory lead to Europe on privacy, and to the UK and Australia on content. And what the tech community is going to find out is that when we do get the federal regulation, these previous efforts are going to be the floor and not the ceiling. I think they'll rue the day that they didn't work with us on an earlier basis.</p><p>Writer Andrew Marantz has a new book coming out called Antisocial: Online Extremists, Techno-Utopians, and the Hijacking of the American Conversation in which he blames \"disruptors' naivete\" and their \"reckless techno-utopianism\" for creating gatekeeper-free platforms that enabled proliferation and amplification of the Nazi, alt-right fringe world. Do you agree with the assessment that he's making there? I'm not going to comment directly on the alt-right, but I would say I think these companies have been naive. I think they have talked about the communities they've created, and there have been upsides in all of this innovation. But they were, I think, too willing to ignore this dark underbelly of communities of hate that were created, the ability to have their platforms manipulated, the ability to have foreign governments and their agents use it to try to disrupt not just our democracy.</p><p>Let's talk about the recent $5 billion Federal Trade Commision settlement with Facebook over breaking a 2011 promise about privacy. The deal won't do much to change Facebook's business; they will still be able to self-regulate, collect user data and target ads. How is that a win for the public?While technically the largest settlement ever, it was peanuts in terms of the scope of Facebook's revenue. If they're allowed to build that into the cost of doing business without any further penalty, we're going to be even worse off.</p><p>Seven attorneys general are going after Facebook, almost every state is going after Google. Is a big tech breakup inevitable? I still think there are other tools I'd like to use. For example, data portability. If you get tired of Facebook, can you move easily to a new site, bring your data and still be interoperable? More transparency. Being able to know what kind of data is being collected and how much it's worth. Better privacy protections. Making sure that we have the right to know whether we're being contacted by a human being versus a bot.</p><p>One of the reasons why I'm not yet at full breakup is that I don't want to see these global enterprises simply replaced by the Alibabas, the Chinese tech companies who would come with even worse behavioral tendencies.</p><p>Recently the White House hosted members of the tweeting right who complain about being censored by social media. When Trump was inaugurated, you had Milo Yiannopoulos, Alex Jones and Roger Stone all starring in huge roles on social media and now they are out. So, do you think there's any validity to that complaint? And should 4Chan and 8Chan be shut down, because of what's going on there with respect to violent white nationalists? I've seen no objective evidence that any of the platform companies are censoring or silencing voices on the right. What I have seen is the nature of their businesses: If you lean right, they reinforce your message promoting the more and more outrageous stories, and if you lean left you get more and more outrageous stories on the left. I mean, these companies are about making money, and I think they are about trying to reinforce your preconceived notions, which is a bit the opposite of what you want in an informed democracy. But I have not seen evidence of validity of the accusation that the right has been, is being, silenced. As a matter of fact, if you look at some of the activity in Europe, it feels in many ways that the right still dominates most of social media, much more than the left.</p><p>And in terms of 4Chan, I don't think you can come up with an ad hoc solution to 4Chan and some of the other sites, as vile as they may be. I think you do need to have a debate about Section 230 and the exemptions that were granted all of these platforms.</p><p>Can you explain Section 230? Section 230 was called the Communications Decency Act in the late '90s, and at that moment in time, there was a decision made that social media companies, and their connections, were going to be viewed as kind of just dumb pipes, not unlike a telco. The platform companies would have no obligation for the content that went over their networks. In the late '90s, that might have made sense. But in 2019, when 65 percent of Americans get some--or all--of their news from Facebook and Google, there is clearly some curation going on.</p><p>There are two ways to get at this in terms of some of the hate mongering and other racist outrageous behavior. One is to try to think of these platforms as media companies. The other would be to move toward identity validation. I think a healthy debate ought to take place because, again, the one thing we do know is we see not only hate speech, but then as we see governments like Myanmar use encrypted Facebook posts to encourage mass violence against the Rohingya. The idea that the status quo is okay just doesn't pass the smell test.</p><p>What do you think? Are they media companies? I don't believe they have total immunity against the content that appears on their sites. But, you know, I'm nervous about how you would set it up. Facebook promised they were hiring 10,000 people to help screen content to make sure that it fits into their standards of duty or standards of operation. But do you then open up the possibility that they might favor either content on the right or content on the left? There's also concern about some big government regulator. One idea that's not fully fleshed out but has some potential: go at it the way the film industry has done around content--an industry-driven regulatory rating system.</p><p>A new report published by the think tank Data &amp; Society aims to create a taxonomy of trolling tactics, and they followed some viral false memes started by trolls that were retweeted by President Trump. They call that the Mount Everest of trolling, to get the president to retweet a false meme. Do you think that the president should be tweeting at all? Well, I think it's hard to ignore the President of the United States making statements, whether they're oral, written or tweeted. I think we would have more thoughtful policies if the president tweeted less. I'm not sure I'm willing, though, to say [he should not]... because should the president be restricted? Should members of Congress be restricted on tweeting? But if the president is being manipulated by trolls or particularly trolls that may be driven by foreign adversaries, at what level does his personal freedom of speech interfere with his equally important responsibilities as commander-in-chief?</p><p>Why don't Americans care as much about privacy as Europeans? And are we going to get to a point where people will have to pay for\u00a0their privacy? Some of it has to do with age. My kids are in their 20s and have grown up with this remarkable sharing. Most younger people have not seen the negative consequences of what can come out with that post or photo along the way. I hope we don't ever get to the point where you have to pay for your privacy, but if you knew how much your data was worth, and then you were offering to, in a sense, sell part of that revenue stream to somebody to protect your data better, is that you paying? Or is that simply a smarter monetization or something that's already taking place?</p><p>Recently, the NSA released another warning about how we are not prepared for warfare on the \"internet of things\"... I have had legislation, bipartisan legislation, for three years that has said at least when the U.S. government is spending taxpayer dollars to buy internet of things-connective devices, there ought to be minimum security standards. For example, there ought to not be embedded passcodes. You ought to make sure that the device is patchable. I mean, basic items. It is crazy that we're going from about roughly 5 to 8 billion devices now to 30 billion connected devices over the next four or five years.</p><p>Your refrigerator sends the message to Alexa when your diet Coke runs out. At a recent electronics show, they had hair dryers that were internet of things-connected devices. Why do you need a hair dryer connected to the internet? I don't know. But the challenge is, every time you connect another device to the network, you create another vulnerability point. We spent all this money trying to protect the nuclear plant from cyberattacks. What happens when the bad guys [don't] attack through the front door, but go through the microwave in the staff kitchen because it's connected to the internet?</p><p>So what can the government do? With our government dollars, we ought to be buying only devices that have [at least] minimum security standards. We finally passed legislation out of the committees at the House and the Senate. It needs to get across the finish line on the floor. There is nothing partisan about this, even the folks in the Trump administration, the DOD fully understand. We've been fighting some of the low-end vendors who don't want to spend the extra money, and we're talking about pennies on the dollar, to put in some basic security. So we could wake up a year or two from now and have some important government function interrupted because we didn't put a basic security in our internet of things-connected devices. We will look crazy for not doing it.</p><p> Last question, are we at a tipping point now with Silicon Valley and U.S. regulations? In recent weeks, there have been huge lawsuits and announcements of investigations left and right. You wrote the white paper last year. What's going on now that caused this to move? I think it's an accumulation of transgressions, a failure of the companies. I think the companies will regret the day that they didn't engage earlier. There's interest from everyday Americans on this topic, I've seen it increase exponentially over the last nine months. Some of it around democracy protection, some of it around kids concerned about polling, some of it around the fact that they, the people, realize the level of hate and vile that spread on these platforms. The public is ahead of the policymakers on this. They get that the status quo can't last.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWEEK-NW1460848_2019-10-04.SIG</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8N-79B1-JC85-S18B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">5774</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2487\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newsweek Inc.

I'm your host, Beverly Hallberg and on this episode we talk with Senator Marsha Blackburn on the tough issue of female genital mutilation or what's known as FGM. This is a practice that sadly happens not only around the world, but in the United States as well. She and her colleagues in the Senate have made great strides to protect young girls and women, making it clear that Americans will not tolerate this abuse. She's here to talk about where things are on the issue and what more can be done.</p><p>Hallberg:</p><p>A little bit about Senator Blackburn before we bring her on. Senator Blackburn was elected to the US Senate in 2018 and is currently serving her first term representing the great state of Tennessee. Before her election to the Senate, Senator Blackburn represented Tennessee's seventh congressional district. Her public service is dedicated to promoting opportunities for women and making America a more prosperous place to live. Marsha's leadership philosophy is based on her experiences and the private sector as a small business woman and author, as well as being a mother and grandmother. Well Senator Blackburn, thank you so much for joining us today.</p><p>Sen Blackburn:</p><p>Well, I'm delighted to be with you. IWF does such a tremendous work in educating women on the issues of importance. So it's an honor to join you and to talk to all of your members and your listeners.</p><p>Hallberg:</p><p>Well you've been such a staunch defender of women and in your time, not just in the Senate, but also in the house as well. So I personally thank you. I think the first time I was able to chat with you was probably about 15 years ago. I was new to DC and got to do an interview with you and it's just amazing the work that you have done over the years. And I'm curious, so you're a new Senator. How has that switch been, going from the house to the Senate?</p><p>Sen Blackburn:</p><p>You know, it's so interesting to go from the house to the Senate and I really appreciate that people say, the house is that hot cup of coffee and the Senate is the saucer that it spills over into. I think that, that is a well placed statement. In the house, we're working on so many different issues and then in the Senate what ends up happening is you really come to drill down on your area of interest and I am chairing the technology task force in the Senate. And this is a way for us to do a deep dive if you will, on the issues of privacy and data security, prioritization, censorship, transparency, antitrust and competition, all in the virtual space.</p><p>Sen Blackburn:</p><p>As people are beginning to say, \"Hey, we need some privacy guidelines that are in statute and we need authority for penalties and enforcement.\" This is a timely issue. It is an enormous issue with women because they want to make certain that not only are they and their information safe online, they want to make certain that their children are safe, when they are online. So we are digging down on this issue, working, we've had three meetings of the tech task force and that is going great. And that's kind of the difference that you see between the house and the Senate, is the structure and how things operate.</p><p>Hallberg:</p><p>And I just want to personally say, as a small business owner myself, the technology angle is such an important part because I work from home. So many women at IWF work from home as well. And I think when it comes to technology, and obviously it's opened up amazing doors for female entrepreneurs, which you started with a small business before you went into public service. So I think it's great to have a female voice and the other female voices in the Senate on this issue. Is there anything you could say to female business owners out there and how you're viewing the technology side? Of course, there is the mother's side and wanting to protect your kids and privacy. But as female entrepreneurs, which is a growing sector of this public, how do you approach some of these issues as someone who ran a business yourself?</p><p>Sen Blackburn:</p><p>Yeah, what we have to do is to realize that we've got to hit the right balance when it comes to privacy and data security legislation. We want to make certain that you are the one that owns your virtual you and you have control of your online data. At the same time, we do not want to hamper innovation and we want to be certain that our entrepreneurs are going to be able to use data to build their business, to deliver to you goods and services.</p><p>Sen Blackburn:</p><p>And it is going to be imperative that we get this right. We look at what happened in the EU and they overstepped and now they're having to modify the GDPR, their regulations. We look at the mess that they've made of this issue in California and we know that a federal standard with preemption is going to be necessary in order for us to continue to see a robust virtual space and virtual marketplace.</p><p>Hallberg:</p><p>Well, it's an important issue area, especially as technology is innovating and advancing so quickly and I know that you being a female Senator, you have female colleagues there that work on a wide variety of issues and I want to switch to a harder one, a tougher issue to talk about. And that's one that you have been working on and that is making sure that women in our country, and sadly this happens to young girls, women in our country, but to protect them from female genital mutilation or what's known as FGM. IWF has done a lot of this. I want listeners to know if you want more information you can go to iwf.org. But just wanted to hear personally from you, Senator, tell us about the strides that you've been able to make from a federal standpoint on this issue.</p><p>Sen Blackburn:</p><p>Yes, and what individuals need to know is that these FGM perpetrators need to be punished. Sometimes little girls that are as young as 10 years old are having their genital areas sliced and cut and this mutilation is just awful. Now, the way we have been involved in this is trying to clarify federal law because this is a horrific act. And current law penalizing FGM suffers from a constitutional defect because it lacks commerce clause language. And there are other female senators, all Republicans who are working with me on this. And we need bipartisan support on this. I've got to tell you, this is something that everybody should be against.</p><p>Sen Blackburn:</p><p>And the way the issue really percolated was back in the fall of 2018 the district court ruled that FGM is unconstitutional, the law is unconstitutional. Then, in April, 2019 DOJ refused to defend the law and refused to file an appeal with the sixth circuit. So then DOJ asked the house and the Senate judiciary committees to pass bills to fix the constitutional defects that are in the law. So in May of 2019 we drafted a bill to fix the defect in this law. So did our house GOP partners and it is Scott Perry from Pennsylvania, Louie Gohmert, who is from Texas and Chairman Collins. And then in June of 2019 Feinstein, Dianne Feinstein refused to join our bill because Nancy Pelosi and the house of Democrats wanted to sue in a motion to intervene to sit in the shoes of DOJ and to defend the FGM law.</p><p>Sen Blackburn:</p><p>Now, they claim passing bill would run counter to their lawsuit. So they also said that they would consider joining our bill only after the sixth circuit ruled against the house lawsuit. And we refused to wait and went ahead and introduced the bill and got this on the books. So in mid September, the sixth circuit ruled that the house could not intervene in the lawsuit to defend the constitutionality of the law. And so what we are wanting to do is have them join this bill and help us straighten this out, so that we can protect these women and children and we intend to push this bill forward.</p><p>Hallberg:</p><p>It's actually just so surprising that the politics get in the way of something that could do so much good, especially-</p><p>Sen Blackburn:</p><p>Oh, you're right, yeah.</p><p>Hallberg:</p><p>And that's got to be so frustrating, as somebody who's just trying to do good and serve the public on an issue that should be bipartisan, that shouldn't be hard. Is that a frustrating thing for you?</p><p>Sen Blackburn:</p><p>Well it is somewhat because this should be a clear cut issue. This is something that we should be all in agreement, is unacceptable and we need to insert that language so these perpetrators can be charged. And we know that this has been through the district court. It has been through the circuit court. They have turned this back, DOJ has sent it to us. They have said, \"Get this straightened out and deal with this provision, this language.\" And that is something that we should say together, \"Okay there is a defect here. We are going to fix this.\"</p><p>Hallberg:</p><p>And especially with October being Domestic Violence Awareness Month, it's a month that hopefully we can shine a light on this. And I know that it's not just from the federal side, but you also talk about what this means from the state side. Can't states do more as well?</p><p>Sen Blackburn:</p><p>Well, states could do more and we would like for them to do more. But we also need to have that commerce clause language in here from the federal side, to make certain that we fully cover this issue.</p><p>Hallberg:</p><p>So where do you see this going? You talked about kind of, it's been introduced, you're promoting it. Any kind of framework or timeframe that you can expect on maybe there being bipartisan support in this being passed?</p><p>Sen Blackburn:</p><p>We do see a way forward. We anticipate that we'll be able, in the next few months move this through in judiciary committee. And we are going to continue to work with our house partners and make certain that they are moving it forward in the house. This is something where there should be bipartisan agreement, that this is a horrific crime and that it needs to be appropriately punished.</p><p>Hallberg:</p><p>And final question for you. I just want to talk about other work that you are doing in the Senate. I know you were talking about your work on the tech side. Anything you'd like to say to women out there on you and your colleagues, I know you're with Joni Ernst and Martha McSally and you're working with some wonderful women in the Senate. What type of women's issues do you like to focus on or do you see I'm making ground and pushing it forward in the Senate?</p><p>Sen Blackburn:</p><p>I have to tell you, I refer to women today as security moms and security, whether it is national security, border security, job security, healthcare security, retirement security. They talk about making certain that they've kind of nailed things down and this is, women are very focused on keeping their families secure in their communities. Making certain that there is a pathway for jobs. The economy is the number one issue with women, the economy, jobs, access to health care, fairness in the marketplace. Women business owners want to make certain that they have access to capital. That they are not being cut out of the marketplace and that they're being treated fairly and on a level playing field. So these are issues we hear so much about from women.</p><p>Hallberg:</p><p>Well, I just want to personally thank you for all the work that you have done to stand up for women and especially the issue of FGM for young girls, who tragically face this in their lives. So all of us at IWF thank you for the work that you're doing and thank you for joining us today.</p><p>Sen Blackburn:</p><p>Absolutely, thank you so much. Bye-bye</p><p>Hallberg:</p><p>And thank you all for joining us today. Remember, if you want more information on the topic we discussed, please go to iwf.org. I also wanted to let you know of a great podcast you should subscribe to, in addition to She Thinks. It's called Problematic Women and it's hosted by Kelsey Buller and Lauren Evans. Where they both sort through the news to bring stories and interviews that are of particular interest to conservative leaning or problematic women. That is women whose views and opinions are often excluded or mocked by those on the so called feminist left.</p><p>Hallberg:</p><p>Every Thursday, hear them talk about everything from pop culture to policy and politics by searching for Problematic Women wherever you get your podcasts. Last, if you enjoyed this episode of She Thinks, do leave us a rating or a review, it does help and we would love it if you share this episode and let your friends know where they can find more She Thinks episodes. From all of us here at Independent Women's Forum, thanks for listening.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123260251</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9B-J2C1-JCBF-S121-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2277\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 18, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DN4Z</classCode><className>FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001851</classCode><className>WOMEN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001852</classCode><className>WOMEN'S HEALTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DA1D</classCode><className>US CONGRESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0009TAC</classCode><className>US SENATE ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009RO7</classCode><className>PODCASTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>PE000A24M</classCode><className>MARSHA BLACKBURN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS158</classCode><className>TENNESSEE, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

So much so, concerns about technology addiction and rising political anger against social media companies have led to some legislative proposals that would scale back their power. NPR's Tim Mak has more on one Republican lawmaker's effort to ban what he sees as the addictive elements of social media.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TIM MAK:                 Senator Josh Hawley is a freshman senator from Missouri, but he is quickly making a name for himself as the representative for an increasing number of Americans who are angry with social media companies.             </p><p>JOSH HAWLEY:                 Yeah, well, their business model is increasingly exploitative in nature. And I think that, look; these are companies that have tried to evade accountability.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Hawley proposed a bill that would require social media companies to tell users every 30 minutes how long they've been on the platform each day. It would also ban features that he views as addictive. The legislation would make illegal infinite scroll, which endlessly populates apps with additional content. It would also prohibit the autoplay of video and audio.             </p><p>JOSH HAWLEY:                 The big tech platforms have adopted a business model that takes our private information without telling us, sells it without our consent and then tries to use exploitative and addictive practices in order to get us to spend more time on their platforms so they can take more stuff from us.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Hawley's proposal strikes at the heart of that business model.             </p><p>LINDSAY GORMAN:                 Seventy percent of the time spent on the YouTube platform, for example, is spent watching videos that the algorithm recommends.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 That's Lindsay Gorman, a fellow for emerging technologies at The German Marshall Fund, explaining just how crucial these sorts of features are to these businesses.             </p><p>LINDSAY GORMAN:                 Their business model is based on user engagement and time spent on the platform. Certainly, they're using sophisticated psychological measures, like the autoplay feature, and others to keep people on the platform.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Hawley's legislation isn't likely to pass, but the openness with which this legislation has been greeted illustrates something deeper about the mood in Washington. The lack of regulations on social media companies as compared to their power is nudging conservatives to go against their general principle, a hands-off approach to business. Hawley's bill would have government micromanage what features these tech companies can use. But Republican Senator Ted Cruz, a champion of free markets, seems at least open to it.             </p><p>TED CRUZ:                 Nobody wants to see a federal speech police. But at the same time, allowing a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires to be the censors of all political speech in America is a terrible outcome. And so I think Senator Hawley's bill is a positive step in the right direction.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Democrats have also increasingly turned against big tech but for different reasons. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he sees elements of Hawley's proposal that he could support.             </p><p>MARK WARNER:                 Like in any business, there are already prohibitions about deceptive practices. There's basic consumer protections. We don't have any of that in the social media world. The rub comes in how you define those practices.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 All of this is to say that Hawley's proposal is more than just a longshot bill. His proposal represents the changing nature of the conversation around technology in Washington, D.C., and a converging frustration about big tech that is bringing lawmakers out of their comfort zones to propose unorthodox solutions.             </p><p>                Tim Mak, NPR News, Washington.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-2019081407</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WTM-RNY1-JBJH-3454-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"691\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 14, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Sherrod Brown (D-OH) led off the hearing with a blistering rebuke of the company, putting the new project in the context of a string of scandals ranging from Cambridge Analytica to racial massacres in Myanmar.</p><p>\"Like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the house over and over, and called every arson a learning experience,\" Brown said. \"We would be crazy to give them a chance to experiment with people's bank accounts, and to use powerful tools they don't understand, like monetary policy, to jeopardize hardworking Americans' ability to provide for their families.\"</p><p>Marcus did his best to allay those concerns, laying out a comprehensive plan for how the Libra Association and Calibra wallet would fit into existing financial regulations. He also reassured the committee that, while the Libra Association is headquartered in Switzerland, it will abide by US financial regulations, including registering under FinCEN and abiding by the OFAC sanctions list. \"In the US, there are a number of regulators that we're engaged with,\" Marcus told the committee, \"and we're also engaged with the G7 working group that includes finance ministries and central banks.\"</p><p>Data collection was another sensitive topic. Marcus has generally promised that Facebook will not collect any data from Libra transactions without explicit user permission. At the hearing, he went further, saying that Calibra's business model was based on partnerships rather than data collection. \"I can't think of any reason right now for us to do this,\" he told the committee, referring to permissionned data collection.</p><p>But not everyone believed Facebook would pass up the chance to collect data, given the company's history of voracious optimization fueled by user data. \"I'm not reassured by your statement that you can't see any reason right now that there would be data sharing between these platforms,\" said Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN).</p><p>The hearing drove home the fact that many in the Senate oppose Facebook's cryptocurrency plans, but it's still unclear what they might do to stop Libra. One recently circulated draft bill titled the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act would place an outright ban on large tech platforms becoming financial institutions, requiring Facebook to either cut ties with Libra or shut down the project entirely. But the bill has yet to be introduced, and it's unclear whether such a forceful measure could make it into law.</p><p>Many of the most difficult questions had to do with the mingling of Facebook and Libra data. Pressed by Sen. Bob Menendez , Marcus declined to commit to notifying users within 48 hours if Facebook and Libra data were commingled, a kind of requirement that would be imposed by a number of tech privacy proposals.</p><p>Nonetheless, Marcus insisted Libra was designed to insulate financial data. \"The way we've built this is to separate social and financial data,\" Marcus said, \"because we've heard loud and clear from people that they want those two data streams separate.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123073045</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKM-GSJ1-JCBF-S3PT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"577\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) tweeted.</p><p>Sens. Mark Warner (D., Va.) and Ed Markey (D., Mass.) also pressed for tougher data security laws, and said Congress needs to set limits on how much customer data U.S. companies are allowed to store. Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) went even further: He said senior executives who ignore customer data privacy should face jail time.</p><p>After potentially one of the largest breaches of consumer data in history, lawmakers appear ready to take a page out of Europe\u2019s playbook to ensure it does not happen again: Their calls for aggressive penalties for companies that have poor data security are reminiscent of the General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect in the European Union earlier this year. The GDPR requires companies to adhere to a highly specific set of security requirements -- and contains fines up to 4 percent of a company\u2019s annual revenue for violations. It is unclear, however, how such legislation would fare in a split Congress that appears poised for gridlock.</p><p>Wyden outlined on Twitter specific legislation that would impose \"harsh fines and prison terms\" for companies that misuse consumer data. The bill, which a spokesman said he is preparing to introduce early next year, would set up a new office with the Federal Trade Commission called the Bureau of Technology, give it sweeping powers to punish businesses for lax data security practices, and require it to hire 175 staffers to \"police the largely unregulated market for private data.\"</p><p>The bill would also introduce a new set of data security requirements, set up a \u201cdo not track\u201d list for individual consumers to opt out of data collection online, and outline \u201csteep fines (up to 4 percent of annual revenue), on the first offense for companies and 10-20 year criminal penalties for senior executives,\u201d according to a release from Wyden\u2019s office.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) also said there should be consequences for executives, tweeting, \u201cCEOs won\u2019t take protecting our data seriously unless their own jobs are on the line.\u201d</p><p>To address the current crisis, Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Friday that Marriott should pay for new passports for customers whose passport numbers were stolen.</p><p>Marriott, for its part, seemed to admit a degree of culpability for the breach of its Starwood reservation system containing addresses, travel locations, credit card numbers, phone numbers, and passport numbers. The breach could possibly leave droves of customers vulnerable to espionage or identity theft.</p><p>\"We fell short of what our guests deserve and what we expect of ourselves,\" Marriott president and chief executive Arne Sorenson said in a release. \"We are doing everything we can to support our guests, and using lessons learned to be better moving forward.\"</p><p>But this apology was not sufficient for lawmakers, who insisted that businesses such as Marriott can no longer be trusted to police themselves when it comes to data security.</p><p>\u201cIt seems like every other day we learn about a new mega breach affecting the personal data of millions of Americans,\u201d Warner said in a statement. \u201cRather than accepting this trend as normal, this latest incident should strengthen Congress' resolve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf history is any guide, Marriott\u2019s mega data breach will be treated like all the others: The company will apologize and offer useless credit monitoring to the victims impacted,\u201d Wyden tweeted. \u201cThe status quo isn\u2019t working.\u201d There have been several major breaches in the last several years that put hundreds of millions of customers' personal information at risk: The breaches of Target and Yahoo in 2013; Home Depot in 2014; the health insurer Anthem in 2015; and credit reporting company Equifax last year.</p><p>But as of now, U.S. companies rarely face fines for breaches. The last major U.S. corporate cybersecurity overhaul was the 2014 Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, which led to a voluntary set of standards managed by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). That law doesn't include fines for violations or data breaches.</p><p>Ron Gula, a cybersecurity investor who founded Maryland-based cybersecurity company Tenable Network Security, said Warner and Markey\u2019s idea that setting limits on personal information that companies can store would not be realistic for companies such as Marriott, though he noted that penalties might help improve their attitudes toward security.</p><p>\u201cWhen you book a Marriott hotel room it\u2019s kind of nice that they already have all of your information when you book a room. ... They are always going to have to collect sensitive data on their customers,\u201d Gula said. \u201cSo, the only other option is to increase their cybersecurity. The only other thing you can do is just increase penalties.\u201d</p><p>Others were skeptical that penalties would do anything to address the broader issue. Some experts worried that, as soon as there is a security mandate, companies would focus on meeting the bare minimum that\u2019s required of them to avoid the fine.</p><p>Businesses \u201cmust demonstrate that they are investing in security, not just to meet the minimum threshold of what the law requires -- but that protecting their customers is a pillar of their business,\u201d Ellison Anne Williams, a former NSA technologist who is chief executive of a Maryland-based encryption company called EnVeil, told me in an email.</p><p>___ (c)2018 Philly.com Visit Philly.com at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.philly.com\">www.philly.com</url> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCTBUS-20181203-PHI-SENATORS-CALL-FOR-DATA-BREACH-PENALTIES-TOUGHER-123-20181203PHI</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Philly.com KR</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TWG-57F1-DYNS-3035-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">169235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"988\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 </copyright><bodyText><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText><publicationName>Philly.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 3, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.industry\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Josh Hawley on Tuesday introduced legislation that would give internet users the ability to opt out of allowing their personal data to be tracked and collected, the latest effort in the Missouri Republican\u2019s broader campaign against big tech.</p><p>Hawley\u2019s Do Not Track Act is modeled after the national Do Not Call list, which allows people to opt out of telemarketing calls.</p><p> Hawley\u2019s office says it would allow internet users to opt out of tracking by clicking a setting in their browsers or by downloading an app. Hawley said the measure is in response to big tech companies collecting \u201cincredible amounts of deeply personal, private data from people without giving them the option to meaningfully consent.</p><p> The Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general would have the authority to enforce the legislation, and the bill would give the FTC the power to create related regulations.</p><p> Companies would face a minimum $100,000 fine or up to $1,000 per day per affected person for knowingly violating the rules. Negligent violations could be punished by as much as $50 per day per affected person.</p><p> The bill includes an exception for data collected to help law enforcement.</p><p> Electronic Privacy Information Center President Marc Rotenberg said voluntary opt-outs for internet tracking and data collection have not worked. He said enforcement is crucially important.</p><p> \u201cThe companies can ignore voluntary participation, and oftentimes it\u2019s the biggest offenders who will,\u201d Rotenberg said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think legislation is necessary.\u201d</p><p> Rotenberg, who said the nonprofit center worked on the original Do Not Call legislation, cautioned that an opt-out program for internet tracking will be more challenging. He said while telephone numbers can easily be added to the do-not-call list, an internet program needs to cover email addresses and potential IP addresses.</p><p> The Internet Association, which counts Google, Facebook and Amazon among its members, did not immediately return a request for comment Tuesday. The Association of National Advertisers didn\u2019t immediately comment.</p><p>  As Missouri attorney general, Hawley launched an investigation of Google for potential violations of the state\u2019s consumer-protection and antitrust laws and demanded information from Facebook following allegations that the social media giant mishandled user data.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMO-4425303</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28995BA0E30AF6 NWBKMO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5P-6VJ1-JBCN-43P7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401953</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"393\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Examiner<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

This bill says nothing about encryption,  said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who coauthored the legislation along with Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham.</p><p> Either Facebook is lying and I think they re telling us the truth, when they say that law enforcement is consistent with strong encryption or big tech is using encryption as a subterfuge to oppose this bill,  Blumenthal said. </p><p>But the relationship between encryption and the EARN IT Act isn t as thin as Blumenthal suggests. While an <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6746282/Earn-It.pdf\"> early draft </url> has been toned down significantly stripping quite a bit of power from the attorney general, who s       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"../../../../../s/704781/barr-eyes-section-230-reform-as-backdoor-to-encryption-ban\"> made no secret </url> of his hostility toward tech-industry plans to encrypt user messages, and instead granting Congress the final word the revised legislation still paves the way for a debate on encryption that s unlikely to work out in Silicon Valley s favor.</p><p> This bill is still about encryption,  said Alan Rozenshtein, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and a former Justice Department official.  Whereas the previous bill was about giving the attorney general a sneaky way to get rid of encryption, this bill is about a much more transparent, formal, multilayered way of thinking through the complex policy issue that is encryption at multiple levels, and then having Congress make the ultimate policy determination. </p><p>In its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/OLL20160.pdf\"> current form </url>, the EARN IT Act requires tech platforms to  earn  the legal protections granted to them under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act when faced with lawsuits pertaining to child-sexual-abuse material. Under the bill, companies can secure those protections by agreeing to adhere to a list of best practices designed to stop the spread of that material online. </p><p>That list would be crafted by a specially appointed commission. But unlike in the bill s previous iterations, commissioners would vote on these recommendations and the attorney general would share final approval power with the heads of the Homeland Security Department and the Federal Trade Commission. Congress would also need to approve those recommendations before they go into effect, another departure from the draft bill.</p><p> We want to make sure that we don t delegate it to a nonelected body,  said Graham, when asked to explain the significant changes from prior drafts. </p><p>Rozenshtein, who calls himself an  encryption moderate,  expressed frustration that lawmakers did little to tamp down expectations that the bill s final version would hew closely to the leaked drafts, which sparked widespread anxiety across Silicon Valley.  It poisoned the well,  he said. </p><p>Even after the changes, industry representatives continued to highlight the bill s perceived threat to strong encryption. </p><p> The [bill] also leaves open the possibility that the commission is used as a vehicle to regulate encryption, an issue with a broad set of stakeholders and such significant impacts for the national interest that only Congress, in an open and transparent manner, should set policies,  Elizabeth Banker, deputy general counsel at tech lobbying group the Internet Association, said during her Wednesday testimony.</p><p>Banker s warning upset Blumenthal, who insisted she was  continuing to propagate this myth  despite having read the updated bill. It also angered Sen. Josh Hawley, a cosponsor of the EARN IT Act and a persistent opponent of big tech s Section 230 protections.</p><p> That s not what s in the bill,  Hawley said.  What the tech companies will do is seize any reason, any straw, anything at hand to argue that we just can t possibly revise Section 230. </p><p>In a break with Barr, both Blumenthal and Hawley said they support strong encryption and believe it can coexist with efforts to crack down on sexual-abuse material. Hawley went so far as to pledge he would  not support something that compromises the integrity of encryption. </p><p>But the sentiment isn t shared by all of the bill's sponsors. At the start of Wednesday s hearing, Graham expressed concern over Facebook s willingness to pursue encryption even in the face of rampant child-sexual-abuse material on its platform.</p><p> I m very concerned about the idea of going blind,  Graham later told reporters.  I ve been told you can have encryption and still have reporting systems, [but] I m worried about terrorism, I m worried about all that. </p><p>If members of the commission share Graham s concerns about encryption and given the mandated inclusion of law enforcement officials and victim advocates on the panel, some are almost certain to do so that means Congress may well receive recommendations that include ending encryption as a key measure to limit the spread of sexual-abuse material.</p><p> The commission is clearly going to talk about encryption, and it seems inevitable that it s going to target encryption,  said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University.  The procedural changes to the commission s work doesn t change the narrative about encryption whatsoever. </p><p>Goldman dismissed senators  increasing insistence that the EARN IT Act won t target encryption as  really slick political theater. </p><p> It punts all of the substantive activity onto a future commission whose deck is stacked, but we don t know what they re going to say,  Goldman said.  It allows everyone to think that this bill s going to solve their problem, and they don t have to then confirm or deny any piece of it. Anyone can see what they want to see. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-705329</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YDF-SDM1-JBNW-34G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"997\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The National Journal Group, Inc.

Brown then compared Facebook to \"a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches,\" adding that Facebook has \"burned down the house and called every arson a learning experience.\" \"They moved fast and broke our political discourse, they moved fast and broke journalism, they moved fast and helped incite a genocide, and they moved fast and they're helping to undermine our democracy,\" Brown said. </p><p>\"Now Facebook asked people to trust them with their hard-earned paychecks. It takes a breathtaking amount of arrogance to look at that track record and think, you know what we really ought to do next? Let's run our own bank and our own for-profit version of the Federal Reserve, and let's do it for the whole world.\" Facebook declined to comment on Brown's remarks.Facebook has faced numerous security and privacy scandals[7] in the last few years, including its handling of Russian intervention[8] during the 2016 US presidential election, its role in inciting genocide in Myanmar[9], promoting and spreading misinformation, and the user data exposed to unauthorized parties in the Cambridge Analytica scandal[10]. In January 2018, facing criticism over Russian intervention on Facebook during the 2016 presidential election, Mark Zuckerberg said[11] \"This will be a serious year of self-improvement and I'm looking forward to learning from working to fix our issues together.\" Over the following year after Zuckerberg's statement, Facebook was embroiled in numerous additional scandals and crises, and is about to be hit with a $5 billion penalty from the FTC over its data practices. One question that kept coming up throughout the hearing: Why anyone should trust Facebook with their financial information, given its rocky track record with protecting user data and privacy. \"Libra is about developing a safe, secure, and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world,\" Facebook's David Marcus said in his opening remarks. \"We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure. The journey to get there will be a long one, and we recognize that ours has just begun.\" You can read the rest of Marcus' opening testimony here[12]. Marcus also said multiple times during the hearing that Facebook was not interested in competing with banks and bank accounts.

Here's how the company has held up through data hacks, lawsuits, and massive security threats.[14]See Also: Facebook blockchain boss David Marcus says Libra won't launch until it has 'fully addressed regulatory concerns'[15]Mark Cuban thinks Facebook's cryptocurrency Libra is 'a big mistake'[16]Facebook won't release the code for its AI poker bot that can beat human pros because of 'the potential impact on the poker community'[17] SEE ALSO:Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple are testifying today about antitrust concerns as the battle cry to break up 'big tech' gets louder than ever[18] [ 1]:

In their contributions to this debate, many people have said that free trade should be fair trade. To my point of view, this is not free trade. It is not free trade when big corporations are given more power than governments or Australian investors or workers-because that is what these bills, particularly through the ISDS provisions, do. You can't claim it's free trade when workers' rights are at risk. You can't call it free trade when big corporations can take governments to task. You can't justify it by saying, 'Well, Australian companies may be able to take the governments of other countries to task.' We don't support that either. And we don't support empowering Australian companies to try to ride roughshod over other countries' workers' rights and other countries' environmental rights-like Australian companies have done under other free trade agreements and the ISDS provisions. We don't think that's right either, and we call that out as well.</p><p>When we're looking at entering trade agreements, we should be ensuring we are protecting human rights, workers' rights and our environment. These need to be at the heart of how we engage, both in this region and in the rest of the world. We shouldn't be enabling multinational corporations to call the shots. No matter which way you cut it, that's what ISDS provisions do. I'll come to this in more detail later, but we don't buy the government's-or, for that matter, the ALP's-assurance that they've somehow improved the ISDS processes and they've carved some stuff out. You could drive a truck through the so-called carve-outs! The very nature of ISDS provisions means that they give others the power to try and attack, for example, our environmental protections or our workers' rights protections. It opens up the ability of corporations to take action if, for example, the government wants to improve our environmental protections-heaven forbid the government should want to!-and a company or a multinational thinks that this may stop them from making a motza.</p><p>We should be using our trade opportunities with other countries to promote values such as human rights, protecting our environment and workers' rights, But instead we see the government, now with the assistance of the ALP, sign up to what we think are dodgy trade deals which give more powers to big corporations and which could undermine Australian workers and undermine our provisions to protect the health of Australians and to protect the environment-powers for big corporations to sue our government to protect their profits. Here in Australia, these kinds of deals have already led to the collapse of Australian industries and the destruction of some of our precious places, have driven down wages and have threatened to stop our governments regulating against what we consider to be reckless corporate behaviour. We all know that big corporations wield their power for their own interests. We need to place human rights, workers' rights and environmental protection at the centre of how we trade with other countries and ensure that the community is able to scrutinise these agreements-because, once again, we still haven't had proper scrutiny of these agreements.</p><p>I've stood in this place before and raised this issue repeatedly, as has Senator Whish-Wilson when he held this portfolio, and as has Senator Steele-John. We have raised the fact that these agreements don't get proper scrutiny. They have significant potential for significant impact. The Greens care about people and the planet. We don't take corporate donations. And we do not sell out on these issues. These issues undermine Australia's sovereignty. These bills put in place the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement and the Australia-Hong Kong Free Trade Agreement-this at a time when the whole world can see the disruption that's going on in Hong Kong, the way that protesters are being treated and the disruptive nature of decision-making. And yet we think it's okay to go ahead and make an agreement with Hong Kong at this time. I understand that the protesters over there and the people fighting for democracy in Hong Kong haven't said, 'Don't ever sign it', and they haven't said, 'Don't rip it up.' They haven't said, 'Sign it.' They've said, 'Just don't do anything at the moment, because of the unrest that's going on.' How can we contemplate signing such an agreement when there is such unrest in Hong Kong at this time?</p><p>The schedules of the bill amend the Customs Act to provide rules for determining whether goods are Peruvian or Indonesian or Hong Kong originating goods and therefore entitled to be imported into Australia at preferential rates of customs duty. The amendments also enable regulations to prescribe record-keeping obligations on exporters and producers of goods exported to Peru, Indonesia and Hong Kong, for which a preferential rate of customs duty is claimed. The customs tariff amendment bill will make complementary amendments to the Customs Tariff Act to give effect to the preferential rates of customs duty in accordance with the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement and the Australia-Hong Kong free trade agreement.</p><p>While the Greens are supportive of trade agreements, they need to be ones that promote and protect environmental sustainability, human rights, labour rights and the broader principles of fair trade. We believe very strongly that the provisions in these bills do not count as free trade. They undermine the very concept of free trade, because of the ISDS provisions. It is our view that support for these trade agreements is limited to the interests of specific sectors of the economy that stand to benefit directly. Civil society, unions and human rights groups have been strongly vocal in their opposition to these agreements.</p><p>We have serious concerns about the provisions within both the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement and the Hong Kong free trade agreement relating to the ISDS, or investor-state dispute settlement, provisions. We have concerns about ecommerce, the temporary work visa programs and limiting the regulatory capacity of our government. We wrote a comprehensive dissenting report to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties to this effect. We have serious concerns about provisions within PAFTA which relate to ISDS, temporary worker visas and the lack of clarity around which agreement Australia and Peru will follow. Will it be TPP-11 or PAFTA? We are deeply concerned about the lack of provisions which ensure compliance with human rights, labour rights and environmental protections, and we are broadly concerned with the lack of transparency and risk analysis occurring in the making of these trade agreements.</p><p>On ISDS provisions: all three of these trade agreements contain provisions for ISDS. We strongly disagree with the inclusion and use of ISDS clauses in trade agreements, which we have fought in this place on a number of occasions. ISDS clauses expand the legal rights of multinational corporations and offer advantages not afforded to domestic investors. They also create a chilling effect, where governments either delay or reconsider regulation to avoid the risk of arbitration. This is unconscionable. Particular policy areas such as labour protections, environmental protections and health and safety protections can be affected by this chilling effect.</p><p>Many of us have fought for many years to get adequate protections-and I use 'adequate' advisedly, because we know that environmental protections in this country are not adequate and need strengthening-but the ones we've got have been very hard fought for, and we should not be putting them at risk in this manner. What we have seen occur over the last few years is a so-called modernisation of the ISDS provisions, which include so-called enhanced safeguards, which are really broad, undefined and generalised protections for governments seeking to regulate for legitimate public welfare initiatives-for example, public health, safety and environmental protections. We do not think that these are an adequate modernisation of ISDS provisions, and they do not provide enhanced safeguards.</p><p>There have been controversial cases dealing with fair and equitable treatment, where tribunals have found in favour of corporations on the basis that government action has interfered with the company's own expectations of the treatment they should receive. This is an extremely worrying trend. The Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement excludes ISDS cases against public health measures, specifically mentioning cases related to the PBS, Medicare, the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator. There is no specific mention of tobacco regulation, and it remains to be seen whether the general exclusion for public health measures will deter tobacco companies from taking cases if a future government should decide on changes to regulation.</p><p>The Australia-Hong Kong Free Trade Agreement also has provisions that we are nervous about. Whilst we welcome the inclusion of explicit limitations in the scope of ISDS provisions through the exclusion of the PBS, Medicare, the TGA and the Gene Technology Regulator, and in this case tobacco within the Hong Kong agreement, we do not believe there are sufficient protections for future government measures which seek to address health, the environment, essential services, industrial relations and other public interest issues.</p><p>In terms of the Indonesia-Australia CEPA, we reject the contention of the national interest analysis, the NIA, that ISDS provisions are a necessary inclusion within the IA-CEPA. We agree with the extensive analysis of ISDS provided by AFTINET in their submission to the JSCOT inquiry, and we contend that the demonstrated risks associated with these ISDS clauses-that they are costly, incompatible with human rights, procedurally opaque and lacking in impartiality-provided a strong case for their exclusion from this agreement.</p><p>As outlined by the ACTU in their submission to the JSCOT inquiry, the inclusion of ISDS provisions is a restriction on national sovereignty and the ability of governments to regulate in the public interest. The Greens agree with this position and do not believe that the proposed provisions sufficiently protect the public interest. Whilst DFAT's NIA promotes a modernised ISDS mechanism through the inclusion of carve-outs for the PBS, Medicare, the TGA and the Gene Technology Regulator, it does not prevent other ISDS claims being made where broader areas of public interest are implemented, such as environmental and, also importantly, industrial laws.</p><p>There are also inconsistencies between the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the Australia-Hong Kong Free Trade Agreement and the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement around ISDS provisions. PAFTA and the Indonesia-Australia agreement do not include a specific exclusion for tobacco regulation, which contrasts with the Australia-Hong Kong Free Trade Agreement, which contains detailed exclusions for tobacco products.</p><p>Given the Philip Morris ISDS case brought against Australia, Indonesia's involvement in the WTO dispute against Australia's plain-packaging laws and Indonesia's very prominent tobacco industry, we are concerned that this places Australia at risk of arbitration should any regulations be made to tobacco products-for example, e-cigarettes in the future. We do not accept the assertion of the NIA, which makes the assumption that general public health exemptions to ISDS sufficiently cover this. We cannot take this risk. Australia has fought so hard and made such progress in this area, and yet this potentially opens it all up again.</p><p>We're also concerned about the effects to reduce the regulatory capacity of governments in the electronic commerce trade. It has been made very clear by the ACCC in their recent digital platforms inquiry, and indeed through an extensive and growing body of evidence, that big tech companies and multinational corporations can engage in anticompetitive practices, breach privacy, avoid tax and exploit workers.</p><p>Both the Indonesia-Australia agreement and the Australia-Hong Kong agreement contain chapters outlining frameworks for e-commerce which permit the free flow of data, including financial data, across borders. We are firmly committed to ensuring that digital rights and data privacy are strongly protected, and we do not believe that either of these agreements provide tangible or sufficient provisions to achieve this. The intention of the e-commerce chapters in these agreements is to reduce regulation of data flows. This is at odds with the responsibility that the government has to be able to adapt to meet future needs with privacy protection provisions.</p><p>We are also deeply concerned about the temporary work visa programs. I bet every single member of this chamber has heard of workers who have come into this country, have not had the protections of our industrial relation laws, have been underpaid or have been abused in their workplace. They do not have job security. What is the point of making sure? In fact, the next bill that comes into this place is about further undermining our industrial relations laws. We do not want to have workers put into a position where they have unsafe work conditions, poor pay conditions and are offered substandard accommodation when they come into this country. I have heard of many occasions when this has occurred.</p><p>There's also been a lack of independent evaluation and transparency. We continue to have deep concerns about the lack of transparency and public scrutiny involved with the current procedure for making trade agreements. Again, we have outlined these concerns many times in this chamber and the opaque process continues to happen. It is essential that any proposed agreement be tabled in parliament and be open for wide public consultation prior to signing, in order to ensure consistency with domestic, democratic policy-making principles and practice which do not enable big corporations to undermine and override laws and regulations that are made in Australia to protect our health, protect our workers' rights, protect our human rights and protect our environment. These provisions are opaque. It is all very well for the ALP to now cosy up to the government to try and ram these agreements through this parliament when they still have ISDS arrangements that are opposed by trade unions. You've heard what the ACTU said. You've heard what non-government organisations have said about these agreements. They do not meet the purpose; they are not fair trade. It should not be free trade at the cost of fair trade. We do not support these agreements and we specifically do not support ISDS-the process which overrides For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSGOV-N-AUSPR-3221189</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSGOV2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM1-W5F1-F12F-F09N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">377656</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2566\"/><timeReceived>3:59 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 HT Media Limited.

Warner has issued the following news release:</p><p>Today, U.S Sens. Mark R. Warner (D-VA), Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) will introduce the Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act, bipartisan legislation that will encourage market-based competition to dominant social media platforms by requiring the largest companies to make user data portable \u2013 and their services interoperable \u2013 with other platforms, and to allow users to designate a trusted third-party service to manage their privacy and account settings, if they so choose.</p><p>\u201cSocial media has enormous benefits. But, as we've seen, the tremendous dominance of a handful of large platforms also has major downsides \u2013 including few options for consumers who want to use social media to connect with friends, store their photos or just watch cat videos, but who face a marketplace with just a few major players and little in the way of real competition,\u201d said Sen. Warner, a former technology entrepreneur and venture capitalist. \u201cAs a former cell phone guy, I saw what a game-changer number portability was for that industry. By making it easier for social media users to easily move their data or to continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms, startups will be able to compete on equal terms with the biggest social media companies. And empowering trusted custodial companies to step in on behalf of users to better manage their accounts across different platforms will help balance the playing field between consumers and companies. In other words \u2013 by enabling portability, interoperability, and delegatability, this bill will help put consumers in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to how and where they use social media.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour data is your property. Period. Consumers should have the flexibility to choose new online platforms without artificial barriers to entry. This bill creates long-overdue requirements that will boost competition and give consumers the power to move their data from one service to another,\u201d said Sen. Hawley.</p><p>\u201cThe exclusive dominance of Facebook and Google have crowded out the meaningful competition that is needed to protect online privacy and promote technological innovation. As we learned in the Microsoft antitrust case, interoperability and portability are powerful tools to restrain anti-competitive behaviors and promote innovative new companies. The bipartisan ACCESS Act would empower consumers to finally stand up to Big Tech and move their data to services that respect their rights,\u201d said Sen. Blumenthal.</p><p>Online communications platforms have become vital to the economic and social fabric of the nation, but network effects and consumer lock-in have entrenched a select number of companies\u2019 dominance in the digital market and enhanced their control over consumer data. The Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act would increase market competition, encourage innovation, and increase consumer choice by requiring large communications platforms (products or services with over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S ) to:</p><p>Make their services interoperable with competing communications platforms. Permit users to easily port their personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. Allow users to delegate trusted custodial services, which are required to act in a user\u2019s best interests through a strong duty of care, with the task of managing their account settings, content, and online interactions.</p><p>\u201cOne very real nightmare scenario for the future of the internet is users facing a meaningless choice among a few fully-integrated silos of technology, and the end of independent innovation and creativity. We all need to prevent that from happening. This legislation could help us take a huge step forward towards a better internet future,\u201d said Chris Riley, Director of Public Policy at the Mozilla Corporation.</p><p>\u201cMarkets work when consumers have a choice and know what's going on. The ACCESS Act is an important step toward reestablishing this dynamic in the market for tech services. We must get back to the conditions that make markets work: when consumers know what they give a firm and what they get in return; and if they don't like the deal, they can take their business elsewhere. By giving consumers the ability to delegate decisions to organizations working on their behalf, the ACCESS Act gives consumers some hope that they can understand what they are giving up and getting in the opaque world that the tech firms have created. By mandating portability, it also gives them a realistic option of switching to another provider,\u201d said Paul Romer, New York University Professor of Economics and Nobel Prize winner in Economics.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to see a concrete legislative proposal to provide interoperability for consumers. Built on a solid foundation of privacy and security protections, interoperability enables users to communicate across networks promoting competition among social media platforms. Interoperability ensures that users benefit from increased competition, and it helps new competitors grow by reaching users that are locked-in to their current provider. Senator Warner\u2019s interoperability bill lays out an excellent, practical framework for making interoperability a reality while preserving a role for states to go even further,\u201d said Charlotte Slaiman, Senior Policy Counsel at Public Knowledge.</p><p>\u201cAll of us at USV believe in decentralized, emergent, market driven innovation. The shared communications infrastructure of the open Internet and a vibrant competitive market triggered the Cambrian explosion of new Web services we all now enjoy. But today, a small number of companies capitalize on their exclusive control over our data - the data we contribute as we interact with their services - to dominate markets, stifling competition and limiting consumer choice. While this is widely understood, most policy makers propose prescriptive regulation that would only further entrench the dominant platforms. The ACCESS Act targets the specific market failure - exclusive control over consumer data - that has led to the consolidation of market power on the Web.

Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today U.S. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) Mark R. Warner (D-VA), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) will introduce the Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act, bipartisan legislation that will encourage market-based competition to dominant social media platforms by requiring the largest companies to make user data portable - and their services interoperable - with other platforms, and to allow users to designate a trusted third-party service to manage their privacy and account settings, if they so choose.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Your data is your property. Period. Consumers should have the flexibility to choose new online platforms without artificial barriers to entry. This bill creates long-overdue requirements that will boost competition and give consumers the power to move their data from one service to another,\" said Sen. Hawley.</p><p>\"Social media has enormous benefits. But, as we've seen, the tremendous dominance of a handful of large platforms also has major downsides - including few options for consumers who want to use social media to connect with friends, store their photos or just watch cat videos, but who face a marketplace with just a few major players and little in the way of real competition,\" said Sen. Warner, a former technology entrepreneur and venture capitalist. \"As a former cell phone guy, I saw what a game-changer number portability was for that industry. By making it easier for social media users to easily move their data or to continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms, startups will be able to compete on equal terms with the biggest social media companies. And empowering trusted custodial companies to step in on behalf of users to better manage their accounts across different platforms will help balance the playing field between consumers and companies. In other words - by enabling portability, interoperability, and delegatability, this bill will help put consumers in the driver's seat when it comes to how and where they use social media.\"</p><p>\"The exclusive dominance of Facebook and Google have crowded out the meaningful competition that is needed to protect online privacy and promote technological innovation. As we learned in the Microsoft antitrust case, interoperability and portability are powerful tools to restrain anti-competitive behaviors and promote innovative new companies. The bipartisan ACCESS Act would empower consumers to finally stand up to Big Tech and move their data to services that respect their rights,\" said Sen. Blumenthal.</p><p>Online communications platforms have become vital to the economic and social fabric of the nation, but network effects and consumer lock-in have entrenched a select number of companies' dominance in the digital market and enhanced their control over consumer data. The ACCESS Act would increase market competition, encourage innovation, and increase consumer choice by requiring large communications platforms (products or services with over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S.) to:</p><p>* Make their services interoperable with competing communications platforms.</p><p>* Permit users to easily port their personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.</p><p>* Allow users to delegate trusted custodial services, which are required to act in a user's best interests through a strong duty of care, with the task of managing their account settings, content, and online interactions.</p><p>Previously, Sens. Hawley and Warner have partnered on the DASHBOARD Act, legislation to require data harvesting companies such as social media platforms to disclose how they are monetizing consumer data, as well as the Do Not Track Act, which would allow users to opt out of non-essential data collection, modeled after the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) \"Do Not Call\" list.</p><p>\"One very real nightmare scenario for the future of the internet is users facing a meaningless choice among a few fully-integrated silos of technology, and the end of independent innovation and creativity. We all need to prevent that from happening. This legislation could help us take a huge step forward towards a better internet future,\" said Chris Riley, Director of Public Policy at the Mozilla Corporation.</p><p>\"Markets work when consumers have a choice and know what's going on. The ACCESS Act is an important step toward reestablishing this dynamic in the market for tech services. We must get back to the conditions that make markets work: when consumers know what they give a firm and what they get in return; and if they don't like the deal, they can take their business elsewhere. By giving consumers the ability to delegate decisions to organizations working on their behalf, the ACCESS Act gives consumers some hope that they can understand what they are giving up and getting in the opaque world that the tech firms have created. By mandating portability, it also gives them a realistic option of switching to another provider,\" said Paul Romer, New York University Professor of Economics and Nobel Prize winner in Economics.</p><p>\"We're thrilled to see a concrete legislative proposal to provide interoperability for consumers. Built on a solid foundation of privacy and security protections, interoperability enables users to communicate across networks promoting competition among social media platforms. Interoperability ensures that users benefit from increased competition, and it helps new competitors grow by reaching users that are locked-in to their current provider. Senator Warner's interoperability bill lays out an excellent, practical framework for making interoperability a reality while preserving a role for states to go even further,\" said Charlotte Slaiman, Senior Policy Counsel at Public Knowledge.</p><p>\"All of us at USV believe in decentralized, emergent, market driven innovation. The shared communications infrastructure of the open Internet and a vibrant competitive market triggered the Cambrian explosion of new Web services we all now enjoy. But today, a small number of companies capitalize on their exclusive control over our data - the data we contribute as we interact with their services - to dominate markets, stifling competition and limiting consumer choice. While this is widely understood, most policy makers propose prescriptive regulation that would only further entrench the dominant platforms. The ACCESS Act targets the specific market failure - exclusive control over consumer data - that has led to the consolidation of market power on the Web. Ensuring that consumers have access to their data is an elegant way to restore competition without burdensome regulation,\" said Brad Burnham, Partner and Co-Founder at Union Square Ventures.</p><p>A section-by-section summary of the bill is available here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2019-10/ACCESS-Act-Section-by-Section.pdf\">https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2019-10/ACCESS-Act-Section-by-Section.pdf</url>).</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6900021 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6900021</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBD-D111-JC11-10DH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1160\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 22, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Warner (D-VA), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) will introduce the Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act, bipartisan legislation that will encourage market- based competition to dominant social media platforms by requiring the largest companies to make user data portable - and their services interoperable - with other platforms, and to allow users to designate a trusted third-party service to manage their privacy and account settings, if they so choose.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Your data is your property.

Hawley.</p><p>\"Social media has enormous benefits. But, as we've seen, the tremendous dominance of a handful of large platforms also has major downsides - including few options for consumers who want to use social media to connect with friends, store their photos or just watch cat videos, but who face a marketplace with just a few major players and little in the way of real competition,\" said Sen. Warner, a former technology entrepreneur and venture capitalist. \"As a former cell phone guy, I saw what a game-changer number portability was for that industry. By making it easier for social media users to easily move their data or to continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms, startups will be able to compete on equal terms with the biggest social media companies. And empowering trusted custodial companies to step in on behalf of users to better manage their accounts across different platforms will help balance the playing field between consumers and companies. In other words - by enabling portability, interoperability, and delegatability, this bill will help put consumers in the driver's seat when it comes to how and where they use social media.\"</p><p>\"The exclusive dominance of Facebook and Google have crowded out the meaningful competition that is needed to protect online privacy and promote technological innovation.

Blumenthal.</p><p>Online communications platforms have become vital to the economic and social fabric of the nation, but network effects and consumer lock-in have entrenched a select number of companies' dominance in the digital market and enhanced their control over consumer data. The ACCESS Act would increase market competition, encourage innovation, and increase consumer choice by requiring large communications platforms (products or services with over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S.) to:</p><p>* Make their services interoperable with competing communications platforms.</p><p>* Permit users to easily port their personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.</p><p>* Allow users to delegate trusted custodial services, which are required to act in a user's best interests through a strong duty of care, with the task of managing their account settings, content, and online interactions.</p><p>Previously, Sens. Hawley and Warner have partnered on the DASHBOARD Act, legislation to require data harvesting companies such as social media platforms to disclose how they are monetizing consumer data, as well as the Do Not Track Act, which would allow users to opt out of non-essential data collection, modeled after the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) \"Do Not Call\" list.</p><p>\"One very real nightmare scenario for the future of the internet is users facing a meaningless choice among a few fully-integrated silos of technology, and the end of independent innovation and creativity. We all need to prevent that from happening. This legislation could help us take a huge step forward towards a better internet future,\" said Chris Riley, Director of Public Policy at the Mozilla Corporation.</p><p>\"Markets work when consumers have a choice and know what's going on. The ACCESS Act is an important step toward reestablishing this dynamic in the market for tech services. We must get back to the conditions that make markets work: when consumers know what they give a firm and what they get in return; and if they don't like the deal, they can take their business elsewhere. By giving consumers the ability to delegate decisions to organizations working on their behalf, the ACCESS Act gives consumers some hope that they can understand what they are giving up and getting in the opaque world that the tech firms have created. By mandating portability, it also gives them a realistic option of switching to another provider,\" said Paul Romer, New York University Professor of Economics and Nobel Prize winner in Economics.</p><p>\"We're thrilled to see a concrete legislative proposal to provide interoperability for consumers.

Warner and Hawley have partnered on the DASHBOARD Act, legislation to require data harvesting companies such as social media platforms to disclose how they are monetizing consumer data, as well as the Do Not Track Act, which would allow users to opt out of non-essential data collection, modeled after the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) \"Do Not Call\" list.</p><p>A section-by-section summary of the bill is available here <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/431507476/ACCESS-Act-Section-by-Section-FINAL\">https://www.scribd.com/document/431507476/ACCESS-Act-Section-by-Section-FINAL</url>.

Unlike measures to, for instance, ban infinite scrolling, I think this new stuff would actually do something. I'm talking about the<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/431507473/GOE19968\"> Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act </url>, which was introduced by Senators Mark Warner, Richard Blumenthal, and Josh Hawley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Currently, most large platforms allow users to export their data. They can download a big (and often terrifyingly detailed) zip file full of images and messages and status updates that they've thrown onto platforms over the years. This is largely a result of the E.U.'s GDPR regulations that give users more control over their data.</p><p>Exportability is really the bare minimum. The ACCESS Act would require large tech platforms (defined as those with more than 100 million monthly users, which would include every major tech platform and any operating at a scale capable of monetizing user data) that monetize user data to make it easy and painless for a user to not only export their data, but import it to a competing platform (e.g., moving photo uploads from Instagram to ... uh, some other photo service).</p><p>From the very top of the bill:</p><p>A large communications platform provider shall, for each large communications platform it operates, maintain a set of transparent, third-party-accessible interfaces (including application programming interfaces) to initiate the secure transfer of user data to a user, or to a competing communications provider acting at the direction of a user, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.</p><p>The other term that sticks out here is \"machine-readable format.\" This is what lets you take data from one platform and drop it easily onto another. Many of the data-export tools offered currently are not machine-readable. If I export my Facebook data, it'll give me a big text list of my friends. I can't just paste that list onto another social network and instantly have a full friends list; I'd have to search for them one by one and add them. Requiring data to be machine-readable makes moving from one service to another much less arduous, and requires a lot less manual labor.</p><p>These measures would significantly reduce lock-in. The best example of lock-in is Facebook, a social network with a dubious public image that people begrudgingly continue to use because not only are all of their friends already there, but their personal history is there, too - they've spent years essentially inputting a trove of data too difficult to reconstruct from scratch.</p><p>There is some precedent for this, in regulations that allow phone customers to port their number from one service to another. With landlines, moving to a new location required a new phone number, but as mobile phones became popular, it became more important for consumers to be able to keep the same number as they moved around. In 1996, the U.S. government mandated number portability, which let users switch between competing providers easily, and without having to inform everyone they know that their number was changing yet again.</p><p>\"As a former cell phone guy, I saw what a game changer number portability was for that industry,\" Senator Warner said in a statement. \"By making it easier for social media users to easily move their data or to continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms, startups will be able to compete on equal terms with the biggest social media companies\"</p><p>There are known unknowns regarding this legislation. For one thing, mandating data portability requires standards. Standards are what allow tech to be interoperable. There's the phone-number standard, which allows my Verizon phone to call an AT&amp;T; number. There's the USB standard, which is why you can move flash drives between computers. There's the HTML standard, which is why you can load a site in Firefox or Chrome or Safari. There are all sorts of standards. But there is currently no standard for how social media data should be formatted so that it can move between platforms.</p><p>There are also clear privacy concerns with moving data between platforms. Facebook's API is what started the Cambridge Analytica scandal in the first place. The dilemma is that data can't be ported from one platform to another if these APIs don't exist. Really, what we need in addition to data-portability regulations are stronger European-style privacy regulations, too.</p><p>I'm getting ahead of myself though. This isn't even law and it may never be, assuming that incumbent tech companies lobby heavily against it. To my mind though, short of actively breaking up larger tech companies through adversarial regulatory action, this is the best way to reduce the stranglehold of Big Tech: making it easier to go literally anywhere else.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYMAG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYMAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBH-MSY1-JCDG-X17X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">296337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"815\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 New York Magazine Holdings LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New York Magazine</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 23, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Edward J. Markey issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), members of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, today introduced the Kids Internet Design and Safety (KIDS) Act. As children and teens increasingly spend their time on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat, Congress has yet to implement key safeguards that protect young people's wellbeing in the current digital media environment. New research shows that by the age of 12 more than two-thirds of kids have their own smartphone, and more than twice as many young people watch videos every day than did in 2015. While kids are increasingly living their lives online, new reports have revealed the prevalence of violent and harmful content on popular platforms, the popularity of influencer marketing, and the adoption of design features, like auto-play, that effectively encourage young users to prolong their time spent on apps. Like the Children's Television Act did in 1990, the KIDS Act includes important advertising rules and protects children's interests as the ways that they consume media and entertain themselves evolves.</p><p>\"Today, kids' faces are increasingly covered in the glow of their screens, and it's time to face the chilling reality that some websites and apps are built in ways that harm children,\" said Senator Markey, co-author of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). \"Powerful companies push kids to buy products at every turn online, and top platforms are saturated with disturbing content that no kid should ever be exposed to. As a society, we're playing catch up to the serious risks to kids online, and Congress has a responsibility to say loud and clear that Big Tech needs to get serious about the wellbeing of children and teens.\"</p><p>\"Big Tech has designed their platforms to ensnare and exploit children for more likes, more views, and more purchases,\" said Senator Blumenthal. \"Generations of kids are growing up in online spaces besieged by the crass commercialization of social media influencers, tobacco companies, fast food, and alcohol brands. The KIDS Act puts guardrails in place to reign in recklessness of marketers and Big Tech - protecting children and giving parents some peace of mind.\"</p><p>A copy of the legislation can be found HERE (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.markey.senate.gov/download/kids-act-2020\">https://www.markey.senate.gov/download/kids-act-2020</url>).</p><p>The KIDS Act addresses these trends and creates new protections for online users under 16 by:</p><p>Damaging Design Features:</p><p>* Banning \"auto-play\" settings lead to prolonged and unhealthy viewing sessions on websites and apps for kids and young teens.</p><p>* Banning push alerts that encourage kids and young teens to pull out their devices and increase screen-time.</p><p>* Banning badges that reward kids and young teens for increasing their time spent on an app or website.</p><p>Amplification of Harmful Content:</p><p>* Prohibiting kids and young teen websites from amplifying violent, inappropriate, and dangerous content.</p><p>* Requiring websites to implement mechanisms for users to report instances in which the website recommends harmful content to kids and young teens.</p><p>Manipulative Marketing:</p><p>* Prohibiting websites from recommending content that includes host-selling, or influencer marketing, such as \"unboxing videos\" to children and young teens.</p><p>* Prohibiting websites from recommending content that involves nicotine, tobacco, or alcohol to children and young teens.</p><p>* Prohibiting websites from exposing children and young teens to marketing with imbedded interactive elements.</p><p>\"Senator Markey has been in this fight for thirty years, and Common Sense thanks him for his steadfast commitment to prioritizing the well-being of kids,\" said James P. Steyer, CEO and founder of Common Sense Media. \"We urge Congress to pass the KIDS Act, legislation that would provide much-needed protections for kids online by regulating addictive and manipulative design and the commercial and inappropriate content that is currently served up to kids, containing violence, self-harm, and obscenity.\"</p><p>\"This groundbreaking bill will provide children with the 21st Century safeguards they urgently need today,\" said Jeffrey Chester, Executive Director, Center for Digital Democracy.\"Children and teens are being subjected to an unprecedented array of harmful digital marketing practices that undermine their health, security and development. Children in the U.S. have been turned into digital \"guinea pigs\" as marketers and online platforms bombard them with commercial interactive applications designed to unfairly influence their emotions and behaviors. The \"Kids Act\" will ensure that young people will be able to grow up in a world where they are no longer exposed to these unaccountable outside forces.\"</p><p>\"It's long been recognized that children are developmentally vulnerable to advertising and deserve special protections, which is why there are rules that prohibit certain kinds of ads on children's television. But for far too long, the internet has been a wild west where anything goes when it comes to marketing to kids,\" said Josh Golin, Executive Director, Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood. \"The KIDS Act will provide critical safeguards so that children using online and mobile platforms to learn and connect won't be exposed to unfair, manipulative marketing that undermines their wellbeing. We applaud Senator Markey for his leadership in standing up for kids and families.\"</p><p>\"Much of the modern digital environment is designed by adults, for adults, to market and sell things. Despite the fact that children are avid users of browsers, games, social media, or easily-accessible general audience platforms, children are usually an afterthought in technology design or regulation,\" said Dr. Jenny Radesky, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, University of Michigan Medical School. \"As a result, the onus is on parents to help their child navigate a digital playground in which the platforms themselves are designed to promote arousing and commercial content. Senator Markey's KIDS Act seeks to change this status quo and push platforms and regulations to consider the interests and the health of kids in the context of online media platforms.\"</p><p>\"The 'free' internet comes at a huge cost for kids, who are manipulated into watching a barrage of ads, and marketing disguised as content. For far too long the internet has been a wild west where anything goes, but the KIDS Act will provide critical safeguards so that children using online and mobile platforms to learn and connect won't be exposed to unfair, manipulative marketing that undermines their wellbeing. We applaud Senators Markey and Blumenthal for their leadership in standing up for kids and families,\" said Josh Golin, executive director, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood.

Markey:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), members of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, today introduced the Kids Internet Design and Safety (KIDS) Act. As children and teens increasingly spend their time on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat, Congress has yet to implement key safeguards that protect young people's wellbeing in the current digital media environment. New research shows that by the age of 12 more than two-thirds of kids have their own smartphone, and more than twice as many young people watch videos every day than did in 2015. While kids are increasingly living their lives online, new reports have revealed the prevalence of violent and harmful content on popular platforms, the popularity of influencer marketing, and the adoption of design features, like auto-play, that effectively encourage young users to prolong their time spent on apps. Like the Children's Television Act did in 1990, the KIDS Act includes important advertising rules and protects children's interests as the ways that they consume media and entertain themselves evolves.</p><p>\"Today, kids' faces are increasingly covered in the glow of their screens, and it's time to face the chilling reality that some websites and apps are built in ways that harm children,\" said Senator Markey, co-author of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). \"Powerful companies push kids to buy products at every turn online, and top platforms are saturated with disturbing content that no kid should ever be exposed to. As a society, we're playing catch up to the serious risks to kids online, and Congress has a responsibility to say loud and clear that Big Tech needs to get serious about the wellbeing of children and teens.\"</p><p>\"Big Tech has designed their platforms to ensnare and exploit children for more likes, more views, and more purchases,\" said Senator Blumenthal. \"Generations of kids are growing up in online spaces besieged by the crass commercialization of social media influencers, tobacco companies, fast food, and alcohol brands. The KIDS Act puts guardrails in place to reign in recklessness of marketers and Big Tech protecting children and giving parents some peace of mind.\"</p><p>A copy of the legislation can be found HERE.</p><p>The KIDS Act addresses these trends and creates new protections for online users under 16 by:</p><p>Damaging Design Features:</p><p>Banning \"auto-play\" settings lead to prolonged and unhealthy viewing sessions on websites and apps for kids and young teens.</p><p>Banning push alerts that encourage kids and young teens to pull out their devices and increase screen-time.</p><p>Banning badges that reward kids and young teens for increasing their time spent on an app or website.</p><p>Amplification of Harmful Content:</p><p>Prohibiting kids and young teen websites from amplifying violent, inappropriate, and dangerous content.</p><p>Requiring websites to implement mechanisms for users to report instances in which the website recommends harmful content to kids and young teens.</p><p>Manipulative Marketing:</p><p>Prohibiting websites from recommending content that includes host-selling, or influencer marketing, such as \"unboxing videos\" to children and young teens.</p><p>Prohibiting websites from recommending content that involves nicotine, tobacco, or alcohol to children and young teens.</p><p>Prohibiting websites from exposing children and young teens to marketing with imbedded interactive elements.</p><p>\"Senator Markey has been in this fight for thirty years, and Common Sense thanks him for his steadfast commitment to prioritizing the well-being of kids,\" said James P.

But for far too long, the internet has been a wild west where anything goes when it comes to marketing to kids,\" said Josh Golin, Executive Director, Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood. \"The KIDS Act will provide critical safeguards so that children using online and mobile platforms to learn and connect won't be exposed to unfair, manipulative marketing that undermines their wellbeing.

Senator Markey's KIDS Act seeks to change this status quo and push platforms and regulations to consider the interests and the health of kids in the context of online media platforms.\"</p><p>\"The 'free' internet comes at a huge cost for kids, who are manipulated into watching a barrage of ads, and marketing disguised as content.

Senator Markey's KIDS Act seeks to change this status quo and push platforms and regulations to consider the interests and the health of kids in the context of online media platforms.\"</p><p>\"The 'free' internet comes at a huge cost for kids, who are manipulated into watching a barrage of ads, and marketing disguised as content. For far too long the internet has been a wild west where anything goes, but the KIDS Act will provide critical safeguards so that children using online and mobile platforms to learn and connect won't be exposed to unfair, manipulative marketing that undermines their wellbeing. We applaud Senators Markey and Blumenthal for their leadership in standing up for kids and families,\" said Josh Golin, executive director, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-blumenthal-introduce-first-of-its-kind-legislation-to-protect-children-online-from-harmful-content-design-features_\">https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-blumenthal-introduce-first-of-its-kind-legislation-to-protect-children-online-from-harmful-content-design-features_</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSSM3050ANX9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC5-FJ61-DYVR-P099-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1165\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 5, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0007HDX</classCode><className>CHILDREN'S TELEVISION WORKSHOP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC2731 BOOKS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

Markey (D-Mass.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) today introduced legislation to update children\u2019s online privacy rules for the 21st century. The legislation updates the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by prohibiting internet companies from collecting personal and location information from anyone under 13 without parental consent and from anyone 13- to 15-years old without the user\u2019s consent. The legislation also creates an \u201cEraser Button,\u201d so parents and kids can delete personal information and a \u201cDigital Marketing Bill of Rights for Minors\u201d that limits the collection of personal information. The bill also establishes a first-of-its-kind Youth Privacy and Marketing Division at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which will be responsible for addressing the privacy of children and minors and marketing directed at children and minors.</p><p>\u201cThe Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act remains the constitution for kids\u2019 privacy online, but today we introduce an accompanying bill of rights,\u201d said Senator Markey, original House author of COPPA. \u201cIn 2019, children and adolescents\u2019 every move is monitored online, and even the youngest are bombarded with advertising when they go online to do their homework, talk to friends, and play games. In the 21st century, we need to pass bipartisan and bicameral COPPA 2.0 legislation that puts children\u2019s well-being at the top of Congress\u2019s priority list. If we can agree on anything, it should be that children deserve strong and effective protections online.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig tech companies know too much about our kids, and even as parents, we know too little about what they are doing with our kids\u2019 personal data. It\u2019s time to hold them accountable,\u201d said Senator Hawley. \u201cCongress needs to get serious about keeping our children\u2019s information safe, and it begins with safeguarding their digital footprint online.\u201d</p><p>A copy of the legislation can be found HERE.</p><p>The legislation strengthens privacy protections specifically for children and minors by:</p><p>Prohibiting internet companies from collecting personal and location information from anyone under 13 without parental consent, and from anyone 13 to 15 years old without the user\u2019s consent Banning targeted advertising directed at children Revising COPPA\u2019s \u201cActual knowledge\u201d standard to a \u201cconstructive knowledge\u201d standard for the definition of covered operators Requiring online companies to explain the types of personal information collected, how that information is used and disclosed, and the policies for collection of personal information Prohibiting the sale of internet connected devices targeted towards children and minors unless they meet robust cyber security standards Requiring manufacturers of connected devices targeted to children and minors to prominently display on their packaging a privacy dashboard detailing how sensitive information is collected, transmitted, retained, used, and protected.</p><p>\u201cThe Markey-Hawley bill rightly recognizes that the internet's prevailing business model is harmful to young people,\u201d said Josh Golin, Executive Director, Campaign for Commercial-Free Children. \u201cThe bill's strict limits on how kids' data and can be collected, stored, and used \u2013 and its all-out ban on targeted ads for children under 13 \u2013 would give kids a chance to develop a healthy relationship with media without being ensnared by Big Tech\u2019s surveillance and marketing apparatuses. We commend Senators Markey and Hawley for introducing this landmark legislation and urge Congress to act quickly to put children\u2019s needs ahead of commercial interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s kids are the most tracked generation. Without strong protections, lines drawn on what companies can and cannot do, and focused efforts by federal regulators, these businesses will continue to collect and monetize kids\u2019 data,\u201d said Jim Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media. \u201cWhile companies point to their lengthy and vague consent forms, children and teens are no match for the strategic, targeted marketing efforts designed by powerful companies to play on kids' need to belong or their fear of missing out. Common Sense strongly supports the bi-partisan effort to strengthen the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act. It will play an important part in helping families better protect children and equally vulnerable teens from potential abuses online.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren and teens are at the epicenter of a pervasive driven-digital marketing system that is woven into the very fabric of their lives,\u201d said Kathryn C. Montgomery, Ph.D, research director for the Center for Digital Democracy and Professor Emerita in the School of Communication at American University. \u201cMany of today\u2019s state-of-the-art practices used to target young people are manipulative and unfair, intruding into their personal relationships and tapping into their developmental vulnerabilities. While the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) has provided limited safeguards for the youngest children, this groundbreaking legislation will go much further. In addition to expanding COPPA\u2019s coverage to include young adolescents, it will address a broad range of problematic marketing practices that companies have been able to use up to now without any oversight or accountability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe change to the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act is a big step forward in curbing the unethical practices of tech giants who are eager put profit over the safety of our children,\u201d said Color Of Change, Senior Campaign Director Brandi Collins-Dexter. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to see these changes include prohibiting ad targeting based on race and socioeconomic factors (or its proxies), psychological profile and geo-location on children up to the age of 15. Such anti-discrimination measures are an important intervention for children from vulnerable communities, who \u2013 from the age of four- are at greater risk for discriminatory advertising, employment, and marketing practices that have expanded into the digital space. We commend the leadership of Senators Markey and Hawley and Representative Rush in expanding privacy legislation to protect our civil rights online.\u201d</p><p>Other organization supporting the legislation include Common Sense Media, Center for Digital Democracy, Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, Consumer Action, American Principles Project, Children Now, Color of Change, Focus on the Family, Prevention Institute, Berkeley Media Studies Group, and the Public Health Institute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1653903I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMK-C161-F0YC-N34B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1108\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Markey (D-Mass.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) today introduced legislation to update children\u2019s online privacy rules for the 21st century. The legislation updates the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by prohibiting internet companies from collecting personal and location information from anyone under 13 without parental consent and from anyone 13- to 15-years old without the user\u2019s consent. The legislation also creates an \u201cEraser Button,\u201d so parents and kids can delete personal information and a \u201cDigital Marketing Bill of Rights for Minors\u201d that limits the collection of personal information. The bill also establishes a first-of-its-kind Youth Privacy and Marketing Division at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which will be responsible for addressing the privacy of children and minors and marketing directed at children and minors.</p><p>\u201cThe Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act remains the constitution for kids\u2019 privacy online, but today we introduce an accompanying bill of rights,\u201d said Senator Markey, original House author of COPPA. \u201cIn 2019, children and adolescents\u2019 every move is monitored online, and even the youngest are bombarded with advertising when they go online to do their homework, talk to friends, and play games. In the 21st century, we need to pass bipartisan and bicameral COPPA 2.0 legislation that puts children\u2019s well-being at the top of Congress\u2019s priority list. If we can agree on anything, it should be that children deserve strong and effective protections online.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig tech companies know too much about our kids, and even as parents, we know too little about what they are doing with our kids\u2019 personal data. It\u2019s time to hold them accountable,\u201d said Senator Hawley. \u201cCongress needs to get serious about keeping our children\u2019s information safe, and it begins with safeguarding their digital footprint online.\u201d</p><p>A copy of the legislation can be found HERE.</p><p>The legislation strengthens privacy protections specifically for children and minors by:</p><p>Prohibiting internet companies from collecting personal and location information from anyone under 13 without parental consent, and from anyone 13 to 15 years old without the user\u2019s consent Banning targeted advertising directed at children Revising COPPA\u2019s \u201cActual knowledge\u201d standard to a \u201cconstructive knowledge\u201d standard for the definition of covered operators Requiring online companies to explain the types of personal information collected, how that information is used and disclosed, and the policies for collection of personal information Prohibiting the sale of internet connected devices targeted towards children and minors unless they meet robust cyber security standards Requiring manufacturers of connected devices targeted to children and minors to prominently display on their packaging a privacy dashboard detailing how sensitive information is collected, transmitted, retained, used, and protected.</p><p>\u201cThe Markey-Hawley bill rightly recognizes that the internet's prevailing business model is harmful to young people,\u201d said Josh Golin, Executive Director, Campaign for Commercial-Free Children. \u201cThe bill's strict limits on how kids' data and can be collected, stored, and used \u2013 and its all-out ban on targeted ads for children under 13 \u2013 would give kids a chance to develop a healthy relationship with media without being ensnared by Big Tech\u2019s surveillance and marketing apparatuses. We commend Senators Markey and Hawley for introducing this landmark legislation and urge Congress to act quickly to put children\u2019s needs ahead of commercial interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s kids are the most tracked generation. Without strong protections, lines drawn on what companies can and cannot do, and focused efforts by federal regulators, these businesses will continue to collect and monetize kids\u2019 data,\u201d said Jim Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media. \u201cWhile companies point to their lengthy and vague consent forms, children and teens are no match for the strategic, targeted marketing efforts designed by powerful companies to play on kids' need to belong or their fear of missing out. Common Sense strongly supports the bi-partisan effort to strengthen the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act. It will play an important part in helping families better protect children and equally vulnerable teens from potential abuses online.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren and teens are at the epicenter of a pervasive driven-digital marketing system that is woven into the very fabric of their lives,\u201d said Kathryn C. Montgomery, Ph.D, research director for the Center for Digital Democracy and Professor Emerita in the School of Communication at American University. \u201cMany of today\u2019s state-of-the-art practices used to target young people are manipulative and unfair, intruding into their personal relationships and tapping into their developmental vulnerabilities. While the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) has provided limited safeguards for the youngest children, this groundbreaking legislation will go much further. In addition to expanding COPPA\u2019s coverage to include young adolescents, it will address a broad range of problematic marketing practices that companies have been able to use up to now without any oversight or accountability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe change to the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act is a big step forward in curbing the unethical practices of tech giants who are eager put profit over the safety of our children,\u201d said Color Of Change, Senior Campaign Director Brandi Collins-Dexter. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to see these changes include prohibiting ad targeting based on race and socioeconomic factors (or its proxies), psychological profile and geo-location on children up to the age of 15. Such anti-discrimination measures are an important intervention for children from vulnerable communities, who \u2013 from the age of four- are at greater risk for discriminatory advertising, employment, and marketing practices that have expanded into the digital space. We commend the leadership of Senators Markey and Hawley and Representative Rush in expanding privacy legislation to protect our civil rights online.\u201d</p><p>Other organization supporting the legislation include Common Sense Media, Center for Digital Democracy, Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, Consumer Action, American Principles Project, Children Now, Color of Change, Focus on the Family, Prevention Institute, Berkeley Media Studies Group, and the Public Health Institute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1653903I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMK-C171-F0YC-N2HK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1108\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Markey (D-Mass.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) today introduced legislation to update children's online privacy rules for the 21st century. The legislation updates the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by prohibiting internet companies from collecting personal and location information from anyone under 13 without parental consent and from anyone 13- to 15-years old without the user's consent. The legislation also creates an \"Eraser Button,\" so parents and kids can delete personal information and a \"Digital Marketing Bill of Rights for Minors\" that limits the collection of personal information. The bill also establishes a first-of-its-kind Youth Privacy and Marketing Division at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which will be responsible for addressing the privacy of children and minors and marketing directed at children and minors.</p><p>\"The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act remains the constitution for kids' privacy online, but today we introduce an accompanying bill of rights,\" said Senator Markey, original House author of COPPA. \"In 2019, children and adolescents' every move is monitored online, and even the youngest are bombarded with advertising when they go online to do their homework, talk to friends, and play games. In the 21st century, we need to pass bipartisan and bicameral COPPA 2.0 legislation that puts children's well-being at the top of Congress's priority list. If we can agree on anything, it should be that children deserve strong and effective protections online.\"</p><p>\"Big tech companies know too much about our kids, and even as parents, we know too little about what they are doing with our kids' personal data. It's time to hold them accountable,\" said Senator Hawley. \"Congress needs to get serious about keeping our children's information safe, and it begins with safeguarding their digital footprint online.\"</p><p>A copy of the legislation can be found HERE.</p><p>The legislation strengthens privacy protections specifically for children and minors by:</p><p>* Prohibiting internet companies from collecting personal and location information from anyone under 13 without parental consent, and from anyone 13 to 15 years old without the user's consent</p><p>* Banning targeted advertising directed at children</p><p>* Revising COPPA's \"Actual knowledge\" standard to a \"constructive knowledge\" standard for the definition of covered operators</p><p>* Requiring online companies to explain the types of personal information collected, how that information is used and disclosed, and the policies for collection of personal information</p><p>* Prohibiting the sale of internet connected devices targeted towards children and minors unless they meet robust cyber security standards</p><p>* Requiring manufacturers of connected devices targeted to children and minors to prominently display on their packaging a privacy dashboard detailing how sensitive information is collected, transmitted, retained, used, and protected.</p><p>\"The Markey-Hawley bill rightly recognizes that the internet's prevailing business model is harmful to young people,\" said Josh Golin, Executive Director, Campaign for Commercial-Free Children. \"The bill's strict limits on how kids' data and can be collected, stored, and used - and its all-out ban on targeted ads for children under 13 - would give kids a chance to develop a healthy relationship with media without being ensnared by Big Tech's surveillance and marketing apparatuses. We commend Senators Markey and Hawley for introducing this landmark legislation and urge Congress to act quickly to put children's needs ahead of commercial interests.\"</p><p>\"Today's kids are the most tracked generation. Without strong protections, lines drawn on what companies can and cannot do, and focused efforts by federal regulators, these businesses will continue to collect and monetize kids' data,\" said Jim Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media. \"While companies point to their lengthy and vague consent forms, children and teens are no match for the strategic, targeted marketing efforts designed by powerful companies to play on kids' need to belong or their fear of missing out. Common Sense strongly supports the bi-partisan effort to strengthen the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. It will play an important part in helping families better protect children and equally vulnerable teens from potential abuses online.\"</p><p>\"Children and teens are at the epicenter of a pervasive driven-digital marketing system that is woven into the very fabric of their lives,\" said Kathryn C. Montgomery, Ph.D, research director for the Center for Digital Democracy and Professor Emerita in the School of Communication at American University. \"Many of today's state-of-the-art practices used to target young people are manipulative and unfair, intruding into their personal relationships and tapping into their developmental vulnerabilities. While the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) has provided limited safeguards for the youngest children, this groundbreaking legislation will go much further. In addition to expanding COPPA's coverage to include young adolescents, it will address a broad range of problematic marketing practices that companies have been able to use up to now without any oversight or accountability.\"</p><p>\"The change to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act is a big step forward in curbing the unethical practices of tech giants who are eager put profit over the safety of our children,\" said Color Of Change, Senior Campaign Director Brandi Collins-Dexter. \"We're pleased to see these changes include prohibiting ad targeting based on race and socioeconomic factors (or its proxies), psychological profile and geo-location on children up to the age of 15. Such anti-discrimination measures are an important intervention for children from vulnerable communities, who - from the age of four- are at greater risk for discriminatory advertising, employment, and marketing practices that have expanded into the digital space. We commend the leadership of Senators Markey and Hawley and Representative Rush in expanding privacy legislation to protect our civil rights online.\"</p><p>Other organization supporting the legislation include Center for Digital Democracy, Consumer Action, American Principles Project, Children Now, Berkeley Media Studies Group, and the Public Health Institute.</p><p>About Common Sense</p><p>Common Sense is the nation's leading nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the lives of kids and families by providing the trustworthy information, education, and independent voice they need to thrive in the 21st century.
