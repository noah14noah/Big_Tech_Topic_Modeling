The Dow has been bouncing around.  A range of about 200  points down and up and now, we are currently lower, but a rally is under  way.  Put it together, what's happening in the market.  This is what has  been driving the day.  The markets in Washington have been marching each  other, everybody is watching the Fed.  Rates on hold after the midterms and  now the Dow's winning streak must be questioned, again.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pot stocks are going haywire after Jeff Sessions got fired, Jordan Belfort,  the real wolf of Wall Street will give his views on pot stocks.  And from  Silicon Valley to the concrete jungle, Google follows Amazon to New York  City.  It's Thursday, November the 8th.  I'm Richard Quest, tonight, live  in London where, of course, I still mean business.  </p><p>Good evening.  Let us begin with the markets in this final hour and the Dow  is steady.  That was the Dow, well, the Dow was steady before the rate  decision.  And then after the rate decision, which came just about an hour  ago, the market has fallen off.  Now, the issue here will be, of course,  how it manages to hold its own over the course of what it did.  The Fed did  what investors expected and held rates steady.  </p><p>So, the Feds - Federal Funds overnight rate remains at 2% to 2.25%.  With  the labor market remaining strong, the Fed said business investment was  slowing.  But, it did pretty much, the way the rates and the way the  statement goes, pretty much price is in that rate rise in December, which  everybody is talking about.  </p><p>Now, Washington is driving Wall Street.  So, have a look and come and see  exactly.  These are the issues that relate Wall Street to Washington.   First of all, the rate rises themselves.  Now, the rate rise is under  pressure from some.  The Fed is at least to slow things down.  But as I  alluded, that seems unlikely December rate rise, which I think will be the  fault this year is now pretty much priced into the market.  </p><p>In fact, if the Fed didn't move in December, that would be a surprise.  And  now you've got the Democrats in control of the committees.  Now, that means  because they are now in charge of the House, they will have control of the  spending because the House has the power of the purse, which is tax and  banking legislation and, of course, attendant upon that any investigations  into Donald Trump's finance would also get swept up, as well.  </p><p>And the other investigation, of course, the Mueller investigation preparing  a report to the future and the actual, the report is being prepared at the  moment.  The issue is the future of the Mueller investigation.  Will the  new acting Attorney General work to stifle it and stymie it or not?   Joining me now Vincent Reinhart is the Chief Economist at Standish Mellon  Asset Management.  These three factors very much show the relationship now  that Washington has with Wall Street and in many ways, Vincent, the way in  which Washington can damage the bull market now.  </p><p>VINCENT REINHART, CHIEF ECONOMIST, STANDISH MELLON ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Yes,  but you have to ask yourself how much of it was priced in.  Essentially  American voters decided on a divided government.  A divided government is  one in gridlock.  The House might pass legislation, might pass a draft, but  the Senate won't, a Republican-led Senate won't validate them and besides  President Trump would use the powers to veto.  </p><p>So, we're basically just got told that nothing legislatively will happen  for the next two years.  There is going to be a drag on activity associated  with elevated uncertainty.  But we're starting from a pretty strong  economy.  The FOMC statement emphasized the vigor to the expansion.  We  worked out - all resources were grown above trend.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, factoring in that.  The idea that a gridlock, it sounds  somewhat perverse, but a gridlock government will actually be good for the  market.  If you look historically, that has been the case.  Do you buy that  for the future?  </p><p>REINHART:  So, it is better than a bad alternative.  </p><p>[15:05:04]  </p><p>REINHART:  Imagine what would have happened in the either extreme of a red  wave or Republican House and Senate or a blue wave all Democratic House and  Senate.  We would be most likely getting legislation that encouraged  spending permanent, the household tax cuts permanent and tended to further  worsen a bad budget deficit.  That would also mean the Federal Reserve  would have to be further in play tightening even faster than market  participants currently expect.  That would be tough on markets.  </p><p>QUEST:  With an employment - excuse me - at 3.7% or thereabout, there isn't  much more room.  I mean, yes, for that particular headline number to go  down, you can tinker around maybe with number of hours worked, with the  amount to pay and you can try and increase those who are working part-time  into full time.  But the US does have now a shortage of labor.  </p><p>REINHART:  We have a state of access demand.  The unemployment rate is  probably three quarters of a percentage point below what FOMC participants  thinks is this natural rate and we're still growing above our trend rate so  the unemployment rate is going to go down some further.  That's why we're  seeing cost pressures.  That's why the Fed is in motion.  </p><p>QUEST:  And do you think - do you think that none of the economic rules, if  you like, have been repealed.  And that eventually inflation does rear its  head, again.  I'm not saying rates go up to slow down to the point of  recession or a soft landing, but that we will soon be seeing a more  traditional performing economy.  </p><p>REINHART:  So we will be working in the direction that tradition dictates.   It's tough to repeal economic laws.  But it's also true that the US is a  more global economy.  Our trading partners are bigger.  We're a smaller  share of global GDP and, so, price dynamics aren't influenced by the fact,  we're not the price setter that we used to be.  So, inflation is going to  rise.  Cost pressures will rise.  It's probably going to rise a little bit  more slowly than you would have expected 20 or 30 years ago if the  unemployment rate were this low.  </p><p>QUEST:  Vincent, good to see you, sir.  Thank you.  Much appreciated.  </p><p>REINHART:  Same here.  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Elon Musk is to have a new boss.  It's Robyn Denholm who has been  appointed as the Chair of Tesla.  Now, Musk had to vacate the role as part  of the settlement with the SEC following his infamous tweet claiming he had  secured funding to take Tesla private.  Now, you'll recall, this is history  you're being familiar with.  The SEC filed a lawsuit and it alleged that  Musk inflated the stock price with his tweet without any funding in place,  in effect, he ramped up the price.  </p><p>Denholm's responsibilities as the chairwoman will be to represent  shareholders and oversee Musk who remains as the CEO.  So, he continues to  be the face of the company and determines its strategy.  Clare Sebastian is  in New York.  </p><p>How on earth did they manage to choose this as the chair?  I mean, an  existing director, but what was the things in favor?  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, Richard, she has a lot of  relevant experience.  She's worked for many years in corporate finance  roles which actually is a complement to Elon Musk's more technical and  designed background.  She's worked across software.  Telecom is where she  currently is.  She has even worked for Toyota in Australia as the Finance  Manager, so she has experience in the auto sector.  </p><p>But I think, there are real questions here.  She is an insider.  She has  been on the board for four years and there are real questions here about  just how much of a check this will be on Musk's power.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  For a man intoxicated with power, the kind that fuels electric  cars and help solve rolling Australian blackouts, coping with a reduction  in his own power is new for Elon Musk.  Steve Westley is a former Tesla  board member and early investor.  </p><p>Do you think there is a part of this that will irk him a little bit?  </p><p>STEVE WESTLEY, FORMER TESLA BOARD MEMBER:  Look, I think Elon loves being  spurred on.  As you know, he has just posted historic results and I think  he is using the SEC and the government as a foil.  I think he's trying to  be the champion innovator in Silicon Valley.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Musk isn't just giving up the chairmanship of Tesla after 14  years.  The SEC settlement also seeks to rein in his favorite form of self- expression, Twitter.  A prospect he addressed in a recent Recode podcast.  </p><p>KARA SWISHER, PODCASTER:  Will you have to change your Twitter behavior?  </p><p>[15:10:00]  </p><p>ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA:  Not really.  I think it's mostly just if there's  something might cause a substantial movement in the stock during trading  hours.  </p><p>WESTLEY:  if he's smart, he will do what the SEC tells him.  He can  continue to be on the cutting edge.  He can continue to be on the cutting  edge.  He can continue to be a visionary but at the end of the day, you  don't want to mess with the SEC or the Department of Justice and I think he  understands that.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Others are less convinced.  </p><p>SCOTT STRINGER, NEW YORK CITY COMPTROLLER:  Elon Musk has been erratic and  the governance structure of Tesla needs to be reformed.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  New York City Comptroller, Scott Stringer manages the public  pension fund of which $75 million is invested in Tesla.  </p><p>STRINGER:  I think it would be prudent to permanently separate the chair  position and the CEO position.  By the way, I think it would serve the  interest of an Elon Musk because when you have two positions, no one's  watching him.  And, so, when you make a bad decision, you really pay for  it.  </p><p>MUSK:  I sleep on the couch over there.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Musk has been open about the personal toll of his job showing  CBS earlier this year where he spent nights sleeping on the factory floor  and revealing to the \"New York Times\" he uses Ambien.  </p><p>WESTLEY:  It could well be that the SEC has done him a favor to bring in a  stronger chairman.  I think the Board, and I know them well, it's a solid  board and I think they will bring in strong senior management and end and I  think it will end up propelling the company forward.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>QUEST:  So, Clare, now obviously, the SEC signed off on this.  It was all  part of the agreement.  The thought had been, as you rightly point out,  that they would not accept an insider and certainly not the insider that  was originally going to be put forward who they rejected.  What was it do  you think, about Robyn Denholm that allowed them to go forward with her?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Well, Richard, I think perhaps, being - having been on the  Board for four years helps with her relationship with Musk, plus if you  look at the Board, Richard, has people like Elon Musk's own brother and the  former CFO of Solar City.  She is among the most independent members of  this Board.  But there's more work for Tesla to do to keep up its end of  the bargain with the SEC.  They still have to install two independent  directors, two new ones.  They still need a special committee to oversee  Musk's tweets, his communications with investors.  </p><p>So, there is more work to be done and there are many people who feel that  it's not just about the Board that they need to install some kind of COO,  some kind of second in command to help Musk with the day-to-day running of  the company to try and ease the burdens and stop him from burning out,  again.  </p><p>QUEST:  Clare Sebastian who is in New York.  Clare, thank you.  As we  continue tonight, the wolf of Wall Street weighs in on the question of pot  and pot stocks.  Live for us tonight from Los Angeles, we have Jordan  Belfort about the media and the up and downs of marijuana stocks and, also,  just about - does the bull market still have life in it?  </p><p>[15:15:00]  </p><p>QUEST:  So, when they fired Jeff Sessions or rather when President Trump  fired Jeff Sessions, there was one market impact that was immediate, it was  the rise in the price of marijuana stocks.  And that followed on with  volatility.  Because Jeff Sessions, as Attorney General and senator before  that was a marijuana hardliner.  By that I mean, he was adamantly against  it and was going to use the full weight of the Federal government to ensure  the enforcement of existing laws against it.  </p><p>Tilray which is a pot co, the Tilray shares surged after the sacking.  It  went - they roared up and what happened before followed on today.  A big  selloff in the sector today.  Look at that.  Very sharply.  Tilray actually  is the worst.  It was down 15%.  Canopy also, Cronos, you see them all.  So  this was the case, not so much of buy on the rumor, sell on the news - it  was buy on the news, and sell afterwards.  </p><p>If there is one man who knows about volatile investments and legal troubles  and narcotics, Jordan Belfort joins me.  Last year, he was talking on this  program about Bitcoin and with Bitcoin, he worried bubbles can come and go  rather quickly once main stream investors get involved.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>JORDAN BELFORT, AMERICAN AUTHOR:  If you were the most disciplined person,  you could really have this with - get in and get out of this probably a  window, a short window to make some money.  But that's not human nature.   It's not psychology.  People, they will get in and they make some money and  they want to make more money and people have a tendency -- tulip bubble,  right?  Remember, in the tulip bubble, the beginning of the end was when  they started trading futures on tulips.  That's how it started to - and  that was another move up and then all of a sudden, boom, it collapses and  it's all over.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Jordan Belfort joins me now from Los Angeles.  Perfect analogy.   Tulip mania.  Something right out of the ground and now we have pot o'  mania, marijuana mania.  Whatever you want to call it.  Do you believe  that, well, explain what you think is going on with pot stocks.  </p><p>BELFORT:  Sure, well you know I was a huge bear on crypto and I had a great  call and it was at $20,000.00.  I thought it was going to crash and burn  and it did and I think it still goes.  But the pot, the marijuana is very,  very different.  I mean, you know, it's a real business.  So, what you're  going to see here is that you're going to have some very big winners and a  lot of losers.  </p><p>So, you know, you've got to be very, very careful not to get caught up in  these huge high bubbles and pump and dumps, as well.  But there is going to  be some companies that really do have long-term sustained growth and there  will be fortunes made because it is a legitimate business.  There is a huge  demand for it.  There is really, you know, large margins right now.  Those  will collapse as the bigger plays get in, but there is definitely  opportunities to make money because it is legit and also, it seems the  regulatory headwinds are diminishing every day and then eventually, it will  Federally legal and I then I think, will really take off.  </p><p>Right now the action more on the Canadian exchanges although the legal  here, the stocks really are traded there.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  And the talking of those because the other avenue into is  ETFs and the ETFs on marijuana stocks were extremely volatile over the next  few days.  Is this an area of investing for widows and orphans?  </p><p>BELFORT:  Only if you invest what you can afford to lose - all of your  money.  I mean, look, again, I'm actually bullish on it, but you have to be  very careful.  It's going to be like anything else, there is going to be  unscrupulous players that get in there and try to make the quick in and  out, right, but here's the thing.  I would really focus - if you look in -  I'm not going to record any particular kind, but just be careful about  companies where you don't really know, the management has no track record  or there is not a big player behind it that has a banking connection.  You  have to be really careful with that stuff.  </p><p>But if you get involved with solid players and that have real IP, I think  you could really make money here, but you have got to be careful and don't  risk more than you can afford to lose because there's be a lot of zeros  along the way, but some big winners.  It's legit.  </p><p>QUEST:  Look, I'm fascinated on this idea of whether the bull market is  resting, exhausted about to have another run or dead.  </p><p>BELFORT:  Well, big question, right?  If I really knew that for sure, I  could make a lot of money.  But here's the deal, I think that - right, but  given the outcome of the midterms, it really is going to locked in with the  pen on is it going to be investigation after investigator or legislation.  </p><p>[15:20:06]  </p><p>BELFORT:  I think that when legislation happens, you'll have a really long,  sustained rally here.  But if it turns into a fight between Democrats and  Republicans, it could get really ugly really quick because a lot of the  rally is based on - and the economic rally is based on consumer confidence.  </p><p>And if it starts to become massive gridlock and in-fine - more in-fine than  gridlock.  Gridlock is not terrible, but in-fine where everyone is  subpoenaing and that could be a real disaster at the moment.  I hope it  doesn't happen.  </p><p>QUEST:  Hang on.  We were talking to our earlier guest about this.  He was  an economist about this issue of gridlock and the market likes gridlock.   You represent the market.  Do you like?  Do you like gridlock?  Did your  eyes light up and your heart flutter at the thought of the US government  becoming a gridlock for the foreseeable?  </p><p>BELFORT:  Gridlock is not good for the long term.  But remember, what  gridlock means is nothing is really happening which means there is  certainty, right, and the market likes certainty.  So if people think  things are going to stay the same that represents certainty, which means  stocks will probably tend to rise.  </p><p>Unfortunately, there are looming issues like a massive deficit that has to  be addressed.  So, you can't ignore this forever.  Kick the can down the  road until my kids are having kids, right.  But gridlock for the short term  would probably, again, no guarantees, probably lead to higher prices.  My  guess.  </p><p>QUEST:  I notice what you say your kids having kids.  Does that mean you're  getting soft in your investment strategies?  Does that mean -hang on, has  the wolf been tamed?  Are you now starting to think about defensive stock  rather than high alpha stock that was going to run off to the races?  </p><p>QUEST:  Never, never.  I'm like a risk taker at heart.  I love the action.   But I record this in all seriousness.  I recommend people as they - I'm  getting older, by the way, I am 56 years old now and I feel 56 sometimes  when I wake up in the morning, but I think that listen, again with  investing, you know, especially in the sector that you talked about with  marijuana.  There's a lot of money to be made.  But you have got to be  really careful because a lot of people, you know, you can't - just like you  saw yesterday, the stocks rise up and they crash back down.  You have to  take a longer term outlook on that for like one to two years and look for -  a lot of these companies have huge market caps, right?  </p><p>But that's not necessarily that terrible for this industry because what  these companies do is they use their stock to make acquisitions.  So, while  the market cap might be very high and is overvalued right now, if they're  smart and they have good management, they'll use it to snap up these  smaller companies and sort of back fill the value.  So, don't look just at  market cap.  You want to look at the management, it's the most important  thing and also the - do they have any intellectual property that really is  sustainable and separates them from the pack?  </p><p>So I think that there's some opportunities, but be very, very careful.  </p><p>QUEST:  And less of the worries about being 56.  It's a wonderful age.   Some of us are - it could not be better.  And, finally, you know, when I  look at the market and I hear about pot stocks, I hear about this idea of  rotate out of tech, where tech has been beaten up.  You see Amazon, which  we all still use on a daily basis.  </p><p>I see Amazon down 25% to 30%.  Nothing justified the overvaluations, but  nothing really justified the sharp falls either other than that the wind  changed.  </p><p>BELFORT:  Yes, well, listen, I saw a commercial on YouTube about something  with Google Assistant.  This radical breakthrough where the computer now  sounds like it's human.  I'm like, it's like \"The Terminator.\"  I mean, I  don't think you could say the tech rally or anything with tech is - I think  it's just beginning.  I mean, the advances are so extreme right now that I  wouldn't look at any tech company and say that the end is nigh.  I think  it's probably the beginning, honestly.  We're going to go to a place I  think we could hardly imagine.  That is my opinion.  </p><p>QUEST:  And it's an opinion we want to hear more often.  Jordan, good to  see you, sir.  I appreciate it.  </p><p>BELFORT:  My pleasure.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you for taking the time.  We've got to get you and me in the  same studio probably in New York or out in Los Angeles.  How about that?  </p><p>BELFORT:  I'll be there in a couple weeks for Thanksgiving to see my  family.  </p><p>QUEST:  Excellent.  Thank you very much, indeed.  Jordan Belfort joining  us.  </p><p>BELFORT:  Thank you, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Now, we are learning more about Jeff Sessions interim replacement  as US Attorney General, his name is Matthew Whitaker and he served on the  advisory board and received campaign contributions from a company that was  shut down and fined by the US government.  World Patent Marketing promised  to help investors get patents.  The FTC - the Federal Trade Commission of  the United States said (inaudible) paid thousands of dollars and got  nothing in return.  Documents show the company of Whitaker even threatened  legal action against customers who complained.  Whitaker declined to  comment to CNN.  </p><p>Lawmakers are focused on how Matt Whitaker will handle the Mueller probe.   He is now also responsible for the Justice Department's portfolio of  business-related investigations.  So, for instance, you've got the net  neutrality fight with California, you have the anti-trust case against our  own parent company, AT&amp;T ...  </p><p>[15:25:10]  </p><p>QUEST:   ... when they bought Time Warner and the possible probe of social  media giants.  For instance, Facebook and the like and Google, which  President Trump has said there could be anti-trust activities and they may  be need to be looked at to be broken up.  And then lawsuits from the  financial crisis.  UBS expecting a lawsuit over mortgage bonds.  Put this  together and joining me now, Elie Honig who served as US Federal State  Prosecutor and now CNN legal analyst.  Well, I gave a rough taste of the  issues and does Whitaker pass muster or is he conflicted?  </p><p>ELI HONIG, LEGAL ANALYST, CNN:  Whitaker could have conflicts on a couple  of different levels.  First and foremost, the one that jumps out to me is -  look, the most important case he is going to be overseeing is the Mueller  probe of Russia interference with the 2016 election and Whitaker has been  out there publicly on CNN and elsewhere writing opinion pieces and speaking  on shows like this about how he believes that the Mueller investigation had  gone too far, had crossed over lines, should be starved of budget and  resources.  How he thinks that certain facts that the Trump Tower meeting  in June 2016 was not at all criminal.  </p><p>So, he's already on record with where he stands on a lot of this.  I think  there's a real conflict issue there.  That said, I don't think there is any  way he recuses himself.  That's the number one original sin that Jeff  Sessions committed that probably ultimately got him fired or pushed out the  door.  </p><p>QUEST:  So what does he do?  </p><p>HONIG:  What does Whitaker do?  </p><p>QUEST:  What does he do?  I mean, yes, I mean, he may not do it the first  day on the job while he's still - I mean, he is already being deputy, so he  knows where the photo copier and the men's room is.  He knows his way  around the building.  At what point do you think, he makes his first move  that gives us an indication of how he's going to treat the Mueller  investigation.  </p><p>HONIG:  It's a good question because a lot of the important decisions could  be happening at least initially behind closed doors.  Usually the public is  not privy to the kind of decisions that prosecutors will make.  So, for  example, if Mueller sits down with Whitaker later this week, tomorrow, next  week and says, \"Okay, look, here's a couple people I'm about to indict,\"  and Whitaker says, \"No, I'm not approving those indictments.\"  We wouldn't  necessarily know that unless somebody leaked and we know Mueller has runs a  tight shop or unless eventually, the now Democratic-controlled Congress  starts subpoenaing people and digging into why certain decisions were made  and who authorized them.  </p><p>So these decisions, these are prosecutorial strategic decisions that won't  necessarily be happening wide out in the open.  </p><p>QUEST:  But we're sure you'll get wind of them and when you do, you'll come  and talk to us about them here on \"Quest Means Business.\"  </p><p>HONIG:  Yes, you know, things have a way of coming out and the reporters  have been very good on this story.  So, I have a feeling, I agree with you,  I have a feeling, a lot of what happens behind closed doors will come out  in the public eye.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you.  As we continue tonight from  London.  New York City could get a big vote of confidence from two of the  world's biggest tech companies.  Amazon and Google are expected to beef up  their presence in the Big Apple but are doing so in very different ways.  </p><p>[15:30:00]  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:30:00]  RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Hello, I'm Richard  Quest, there is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, quite a lot more in fact as we  continue when Britain's former Finance Minister George Osborne tells me a  hard Brexit would be catastrophic for the U.K.</p><p>And Google's chief executive says he'll make big HR changes, that's after  the companywide walkout.  As you and I continue tonight, you are watching  Cnn and here the facts always come first. </p><p>A police officer named Ron Helus was one of the 12 people killed in a  brutal gun attack at a California bar late on Wednesday.  Helus was on the  scene within minutes and was hit by the gunman's bullet when he entered the  building, later dying at hospital.  He was a veteran officer with three  decades of experience. </p><p>Democrats are demanding that the new U.S. Attorney General recuse himself  from the Russia investigation.  However, sources tell Cnn, White House  officials see no need.  Matt Whitaker has called special counsel Robert  Mueller's appointment ridiculous and suggested his investigation be  curtailed.  Now Whitaker, who was being appointed by Donald Trump after the  president forced out Jeff Sessions. </p><p>France says it will not pay tribute to a Nazi collaborator after President  Emmanuel Macron came under fire for saying it was legitimate to honor  Marshal Philippe Petain.  The town was considered a hero for his role in  the first World War, when told to be jailed for treason after working with  the Nazis during World War II. </p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in hospital suffering  three fractured ribs.  A court statement says the 85-year-old justice fell  in her office on Wednesday night.  Miss Ginsburg went home but was  uncomfortable during the night and was admitted to Washington hospital this  morning. </p><p>It seems Amazon is not the only tech giant planning to grow its presence in  New York City.  Google could also be planning to add as many as 12,000  jobs.  Now that would effectively double the head count in the city.  It's  almost on the par with Amazon who is expected to announce 25,000 new jobs  in a new facility in Queens. </p><p>The two announcements, Google and Amazon could cement New York's position  as a tech hub to rival Silicon Valley.  Scott Galloway is the author of  \"The Fall\".  He joins me now from Los Angeles.  And you are not surprised,  are you? You're not vested with the Amazon.  You said on this program that  they were going to go for Washington.  So, you're not surprised.  </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, AUTHOR:  No, I don't think this was a contest.  I think it  was a con, I think it was over before it started.  The one thing these two  headquarters have in common that, if you can call them headquarters that  Amazon has selected is they're both within six miles of the Bezos homes in  D.C. and New York. </p><p>So the only criteria that ever mattered was where a 54-year-old worth $165  billion wants to live.  This was, in my views, Richard, this was an abuse  of the commonwealth.  </p><p>QUEST:  Except why did everybody else go along with it.  I mean, there must  have been savvy advisors to governors and mayors around the country that  must have said to them what you've said to me.  </p><p>[15:35:00]  GALLOWAY:  I think they took them at their word, and the  temptation to detonate a prosperity bomb in town square is irresistible for  238 cities.  And when you have a ruse that's well played out including  officials from Amazon visiting new cities in a thoughtful RFP, you, it's  easy to talk yourself into believing, yes, we have a shot -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p>GALLOWAY:  At this and then you have cities taking out billboards and  sending them Cacti.  You literally have tens of thousands of hours on  behalf of municipal employees who probably should have been allocating  those scanned resources elsewhere.  This was -- like I said, this was over  before it started.  </p><p>QUEST:  Let's now look at New York, New York City gets Amazon and it gets  more from Google in very different ways.  Google is just going to quietly  expand Amazon doing it with trumpets.  But what does it mean to have these  two giants increasing their footprint?  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, it means a lot of things on a very macro level, you could  say it's a disturbing trend, but not only do we see the 1 percent in our  population pulling away from the other 99 percent, we see certain key  metros pulling away from others. </p><p>There are 450 metros in the United States and five of them account for  about a quarter of all the economic growth over the last ten years.  And by  the way, two of those five are the D.C. and New York metros.  So, from a  broader kind of U.S. standpoint, the haves and the haves not continue to  run. </p><p>So -- but, in terms of the city, there's no arguing, this would be good on  most dimensions for New York and you have to credit Mayor Bloomberg's  vision to go through there and make requisite investments to get a third  university.  The one thing or one of the things that is common among any  company that's been able to add tens of billions of dollars in shareholder  value in a matter of years, not decades is that they're all headquartered  within a bike ride of a world class engineering university. </p><p>And now you have three of them within a bike ride of these new headquarters  in New York, Columbia, NYU and Cornell.  So the mother's milk of growth is  young, engineering, savvy talent -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p>GALLOWAY:  And we have a lot of it in New York.  </p><p>QUEST:  And let's talk, that point was raised by a tech investor who is  based in New York.  He tweeted, this investor said, crazy to think about  the long-term impact of the NYC start-up echo system of 12,000 new Google,  25 New Amazon workers. </p><p>Almost bottomless pools of talent for New York's start-ups.  And does it  since -- I'm not suggesting -- maybe I am suggesting that New York starts  to rival Silicon Valley if only because we've got or you've got -- when I'm  back in New York, we've got the financing.  The financing structures. </p><p>Wall Street is there, the multi-media industry is there, it has -- it's  more than just the tech and that will be appealing to tech.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  There's a lot of stuff.  The proximity to Europe, as you said  access to other industries.  Young people want to live in cities.  If you  think about every 18 or 20-year-old stem outstanding college grad or even  valedictorians, there's very few people that don't dream of at some point  living in New York at some point in their life.</p><p>And when you look at the impact that San Francisco, how impacted it is, New  York City becomes increasingly attractive.  There's -- you know, this --  the technology world continues to eat the economy, 12 years ago, only one  of the five most valuable companies in the world was tech, now it's five of  the five. </p><p>So it just makes sense that every large city, if it wants to maintain its  viscosity, its growth, its attractiveness to young, successful people  whether it's London or Hong Kong, they've got to figure out a way to  attract these -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Technology companies and they are.  </p><p>QUEST:  Scott, thank you, you and I need to go on a walk about or at least  to drive about and eat about or something about that shows the  attractiveness of New York for these companies.  Here's the deal, you agree  to go along and I'll agree to pick up the bill.  </p><p>GALLOWAY:  All right, you do London, I'll do New York, Richard, it's a  date.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right, excellent. thank you.  As we continue -- </p><p>GALLOWAY:  Thank you -- </p><p>QUEST:  Now, there's another story developing at Google at the moment.  The  company says it's making a number of internal changes in response to  protests from its employees over the company's handling of sexual  harassment.  Heather Kelly is with me, joins us from San Francisco to put  this -- good to see you. </p><p>Heather, the -- how much of the changes come from the fact that Google was  somewhat shocked that they went out on strike or at least walked out for a  few hours?  </p><p>HEATHER KELLY, CNN TECHNOLOGY REPORTER:  I mean, it's unclear exactly  what's going behind the scenes at Google.  An interesting thing about  today's letter that Sundar Pichai sent out to employees is that it didn't  actually mention the walkout by name.</p><p>[15:40:00]  It didn't mention that employees had officially organized, it  said, you know, something kind of generic about, you know, things to recent  feedback from our employees.  So I think it maybe rattled them a little bit  definitely, and it was exactly one week ago.  So I think it's directly  responsible for these changes.  </p><p>QUEST:  I mean, I suppose we'll never know whether they would have done it  anyway.  But this -- the CEO's statement specifically refers to what  they've done, and I think it's important.  He also basically says we got it  wrong.  We have been wrong.  I only wonder what difference it makes these  changes.  </p><p>KELLY:  I mean, the changes are -- they're a lot of what the protesters  were asking for, it's not everything and they've said before today that  they're going to -- now that they've organized, they're going to continue  pushing for changes at Google and you know, Google is not unionized. </p><p>But it could even go in that direction.  And I wonder how much, you know,  management is trying to kind of hold off any more organization among its  employees by making these big changes -- </p><p>QUEST:  Any -- </p><p>KELLY:  Right now.  </p><p>QUEST:  From our -- from our new bureau on the West Coast, any signs, any  grumblings, anything you hear that suggest other companies might be facing  -- we know they're facing similar problems, but might face the same  reaction from staff and have to do the same sort of things.  </p><p>KELLY:  Oh, I think absolutely.  I mean, it's kind of been like the Summer  and now Fall of tech-lash which is a lot of employees at these big tech  companies are just waking up to the fact that they have a lot of power if  they disagree with the projects their companies are taking on like Amazon  and Microsoft and Google.</p><p>They're going to speak up about it, and they're going to hold walkouts, and  it's led to some contracts being canceled at big companies.  And I think  other employees might see what's happened in the past week with Google and  absolutely be inspired to take the same routes for their own workers'  rights.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, now you're there, we expect to see more of you on  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS -- </p><p>KELLY:  You see me any time you want --   </p><p>QUEST:  As we -- anytime we want as we increase our coverage of course on  tech in the West Coast.  Coming up in a moment after the break, I'll be  speaking to Kenya's Treasury Minister, it's about a controversial tax.   Now, it's interesting, Kenya's most innovative industry really relates to  mobile phones and the like, the mobile banking sector. </p><p>But Kenya sees this as a cash machine for government spending.  After the  break.          </p><p>[15:45:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Kenya's economy is on track for a banner year, 6 percent growth  according to the IMF.  Now, part of the economic success clearly can be  attributed to its innovative banking sector, we talked about it last week.   In some ways, it's years ahead of everywhere else. </p><p>The mobile banking system has to be seen to be believed in that country  which is why a new government plan to hike taxes on mobile transactions.   It makes perfect sense if you are the government, but it's highly  controversial otherwise.  On my recent visit to Nairobi, I asked Kenya's  Treasury Minister about why he is taxing one of the most innovative parts  of the Kenyan economy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HENY ROTICH, TREASURY SECRETARY, KENYA:  Kenya has been a leader in our  city, particularly in the mobile technology and also sending money through  the cellular phones.  And this is where majority of Kenyans now are really  transacting, you know. </p><p>So our person in charge of treasury yields want to make sure always you  wait and you attack space as much as possible, and this is where a lot of  transactions are happening.  But, of course, we are very sensitive to  ensure that we practice it in a manner that we don't discourage the  innovation that we have achieved and the financial inclusion that we have  actually achieved as a country.  So it's a very --  </p><p>QUEST:  So come on, come on, come on, minister -- </p><p>ROTICH:  Balancing -- </p><p>QUEST:  You found, you found a new gravy train, and it's nice to get  onboard.  </p><p>ROTICH:  Well, and yes, and also to finance one of the big agenda of the  president which you just mentioned, universal healthcare, very important  initiative, and, of course, we need to fund that.  </p><p>QUEST:  But what about the suggestion -- </p><p>ROTICH:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  The valid suggestion, I think, that the mobile money tax, transfer  tax is a regressive tax.  Now, to some extent, all consumptive taxes are  aggressive because they hit the poorer people as a percentage of their  income harder.  There were other ways when you don't even have a capital  gains tax, but you could have raised sizable revenues without hitting the  poor.  </p><p>ROTICH:  Yes, we've also introduced capital gains, that's in some areas  which is but still very low.  These cap for that.  We currently -- we're  actually finalizing a new income tax law which will deal with the issues of  capital gain and also make the tax more progressive -- income tax more  progressive. </p><p>So we're doing a sort of -- lots of reforms in our taxation system to  ensure that we achieve progressivity and of course equity and fairness and,  of course, taking care of the poor.  </p><p>QUEST:  Parliament decided it was a good idea to have an interest rate cap.   Nobody else thinks it was a good idea.  The governor is not in favor, the  investment community is not in favor, is the minister in favor?  </p><p>ROTICH:  Well, look, I have been the first to really engage parliament when  this issue came, and we tried as much as possible to explain the  consequences that it will bring, which is really what we are really  beginning to see.  The unintended consequences was parliament had reports  they were helping the poor. </p><p>But what we are beginning to see is that the credit to that sector they  were trying to project is not happening.  So we are engaging in parliament  now that we have detail.  We have -- we have seen its consequence.  I  believe now the debate will be more enriched and the people will believe us  more than before because there was a thinking that, look, this thing will  work and all that.</p><p>So now, we're in a better place to --   </p><p>QUEST:  It's a terrible idea, then it's not working at all, correct?  </p><p>ROTICH:  Well, to some extent, we've seen, you know, people -- you know,  getting credit at a low price.  But the problem is a lot of other people  are cut off from the credit market.  So that is a -- fortunately though,  the M-Pesa and the -- you know, the innovation and the financial system has  also helped because we have -- we have not controlled -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>ROTICH:  We have not controlled into stress, that is just in the banks.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  When we return, Britain's economy slips down the growth league  tables as it prepares to leave the EU, I speak to the former Finance  Minister George Osborne about getting it back on track.         </p><p>[15:50:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Britain's economy slipping behind its European neighbors, falling  at the bottom of the growth league as it prepares to leave the EU.   European Commissions -- Britain's economic growth was slowed to just 1.2  percent next year and that's amongst the lowest of European nations. </p><p>It puts it by Italy.  Now, by 2020, Britain is expected to underperform  every EU member state when Italy phases out with a 1.3 percent.  Much of  Britain's economic future depends on the kind of Brexit deal that will  agree with Brussels.  I was joined by the former Finance Osborne George  Osborne; the man charged with overseeing the British economy in the lead up  to the Brexit referendum.</p><p>He left this job shortly after the election.  I asked him how he sees  Brexit playing out.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GEORGE OSBORNE, FORMER FINANCE MINISTER, UNITED KINGDOM:  I think what's  actually going to happen is that we are going to be in a transition period,  a so-called transition period where we will mirror these arrangements, but  they will never be permanently settled. </p><p>So in practice, we'll be in the single market, in the Customs Union for  potentially a very long period to come without anyone being sure that  that's the lasting arrangement.  And crucially without formal mechanisms to  interact with the EU and help determine the rules that will then be on us - -   </p><p>QUEST:  Which is the -- which is the worst possible arrangement.  </p><p>OSBORNE:  Well, I'm not sure it's as bad as crashing out with no  arrangement.  </p><p>QUEST:  Why?  </p><p>OSBORNE:  I mean, well, because I think the consequences for the British  economy in the short-term would be very severe, that is the general view,  by the way, of investors around the world and indeed the government's own  forecasters.  And there are sort of basic issues which arise about whether  airplanes can fly and pharmaceutical products are legal and what's going to  happen at the port. </p><p>And you know, though I think leaving with no arrangement and I suspect this  is a view held very strongly by the senior members of the British  government, although they're careful not to say it in public, it would be  pretty catastrophic for Britain.  </p><p>QUEST:  Did you ever discuss that with officials when you were at the  Treasury? Did you ever sort of say, hey, what's your best guess if we have  a fallout of the EU without an agreement?  </p><p>OSBORNE:  If we had -- you know, we produced some forecasts of what would  happen if we left the EU, and one of them was a shock scenario.  </p><p>QUEST:  Yes, well, that's -- that was one of the ones who came up in the  referendum that was widely discredited, well, as being fear tactics.  That  was thought.  </p><p>OSBORNE:  I think it was a -- you know, the opponents in that referendum  were not great fans of those forecasts, but actually, if you look over the  last couple of years, and we haven't of course left the EU, those forecasts  were predicated on near immediate departure. </p><p>[15:55:00]  You do see the British economy, even on the official governor  estimates now being 2.5 percent of served GDP smaller and with otherwise  have been -- you've seen the currency here devalued by over 10 percent.   You've seen inflation rise as import costs have gone up and that's squeezed  real incomes.</p><p>So the idea that there's been no economic effect is in a way -- you know,  the government I was part of, was delivering the fastest growing economy of  the G7, we're now among the slowest growing economies, not just the G7 but  the EU.  </p><p>QUEST:  You know, every time you say that, I keep coming back to -- and  this wouldn't have happened if it hadn't been for you and your team.  </p><p>OSBORNE:  Well, it wouldn't have happened if in my view, the country hadn't  voted to leave the EU.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  And you can hear more from George Osborne on that side of our  discussion next week including how he made the switch from finance minister  to newspaper editor.  Before we finish on a profitable moment, the market  is -- the Dow is clawing back, but it's not really telling you the full  story.</p><p>If you look at the Dow 30, you'll start to see a much more different events  taking place.  Amongst the 30 you have, you have the -- you have technology  stocks being very badly hit.  So the Nasdaq is down and the FANG stocks are  down.  And if you look at oil stocks, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, they are off  because oil is now in a bear market. </p><p>The price of oil has fallen sharply, as you can see down 2 percent for West  Texas.  All of this means you've got a broad-based rally but a very much --  when it comes to technology stocks they are very much being hit.   Profitable moment after the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, drawn to the point the midterms might  be over and the Fed still has to decide on rate in December, so make no  bones about it, the volatility we have seen of late is most certainly  likely to continue into the future. </p><p>There is no reason to assume the bull market is over, but there's certainly  plenty of call for indigestion that investors that you and me and everybody  else need to watch carefully.  And so that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for  tonight, I am Richard Quest in London.  Whatever you're up to in the hours  ahead, I hope it's profitable.  </p><p>(BELL RINGING) </p><p>The Dow is barely down, the bell is ringing, the day is done.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

The Dow has been bouncing around. A range of about 200 points down and up and now, we are currently lower, but a rally is under way. Put it together, what's happening in the market. This is what has been driving the day. The markets in Washington have been marching each other, everybody is watching the Fed. Rates on hold after the midterms and now the Dow's winning streak must be questioned, again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pot stocks are going haywire after Jeff Sessions got fired, Jordan Belfort, the real wolf of Wall Street will give his views on pot stocks. And from Silicon Valley to the concrete jungle, Google follows Amazon to New York City. It's Thursday, November the 8th. I'm Richard Quest, tonight, live in London where, of course, I still mean business.</p><p>Good evening. Let us begin with the markets in this final hour and the Dow is steady. That was the Dow, well, the Dow was steady before the rate decision. And then after the rate decision, which came just about an hour ago, the market has fallen off. Now, the issue here will be, of course, how it manages to hold its own over the course of what it did. The Fed did what investors expected and held rates steady.</p><p>So, the Feds - Federal Funds overnight rate remains at 2% to 2.25%. With the labor market remaining strong, the Fed said business investment was slowing. But, it did pretty much, the way the rates and the way the statement goes, pretty much price is in that rate rise in December, which everybody is talking about.</p><p>Now, Washington is driving Wall Street. So, have a look and come and see exactly. These are the issues that relate Wall Street to Washington. First of all, the rate rises themselves. Now, the rate rise is under pressure from some. The Fed is at least to slow things down. But as I alluded, that seems unlikely December rate rise, which I think will be the fault this year is now pretty much priced into the market.</p><p>In fact, if the Fed didn't move in December, that would be a surprise. And now you've got the Democrats in control of the committees. Now, that means because they are now in charge of the House, they will have control of the spending because the House has the power of the purse, which is tax and banking legislation and, of course, attendant upon that any investigations into Donald Trump's finance would also get swept up, as well.</p><p>And the other investigation, of course, the Mueller investigation preparing a report to the future and the actual, the report is being prepared at the moment. The issue is the future of the Mueller investigation. Will the new acting Attorney General work to stifle it and stymie it or not? Joining me now Vincent Reinhart is the Chief Economist at Standish Mellon Asset Management. These three factors very much show the relationship now that Washington has with Wall Street and in many ways, Vincent, the way in which Washington can damage the bull market now.</p><p>VINCENT REINHART, CHIEF ECONOMIST, STANDISH MELLON ASSET MANAGEMENT: Yes, but you have to ask yourself how much of it was priced in. Essentially American voters decided on a divided government. A divided government is one in gridlock. The House might pass legislation, might pass a draft, but the Senate won't, a Republican-led Senate won't validate them and besides President Trump would use the powers to veto.</p><p>So, we're basically just got told that nothing legislatively will happen for the next two years. There is going to be a drag on activity associated with elevated uncertainty. But we're starting from a pretty strong economy. The FOMC statement emphasized the vigor to the expansion. We worked out - all resources were grown above trend.</p><p>QUEST: So, factoring in that. The idea that a gridlock, it sounds somewhat perverse, but a gridlock government will actually be good for the market. If you look historically, that has been the case. Do you buy that for the future?</p><p>REINHART: So, it is better than a bad alternative.</p><p>[15:05:04]</p><p>REINHART: Imagine what would have happened in the either extreme of a red wave or Republican House and Senate or a blue wave all Democratic House and Senate. We would be most likely getting legislation that encouraged spending permanent, the household tax cuts permanent and tended to further worsen a bad budget deficit. That would also mean the Federal Reserve would have to be further in play tightening even faster than market participants currently expect. That would be tough on markets.</p><p>QUEST: With an employment - excuse me - at 3.7% or thereabout, there isn't much more room. I mean, yes, for that particular headline number to go down, you can tinker around maybe with number of hours worked, with the amount to pay and you can try and increase those who are working part-time into full time. But the US does have now a shortage of labor.</p><p>REINHART: We have a state of access demand. The unemployment rate is probably three quarters of a percentage point below what FOMC participants thinks is this natural rate and we're still growing above our trend rate so the unemployment rate is going to go down some further. That's why we're seeing cost pressures. That's why the Fed is in motion.</p><p>QUEST: And do you think - do you think that none of the economic rules, if you like, have been repealed. And that eventually inflation does rear its head, again. I'm not saying rates go up to slow down to the point of recession or a soft landing, but that we will soon be seeing a more traditional performing economy.</p><p>REINHART: So we will be working in the direction that tradition dictates. It's tough to repeal economic laws. But it's also true that the US is a more global economy. Our trading partners are bigger. We're a smaller share of global GDP and, so, price dynamics aren't influenced by the fact, we're not the price setter that we used to be. So, inflation is going to rise. Cost pressures will rise. It's probably going to rise a little bit more slowly than you would have expected 20 or 30 years ago if the unemployment rate were this low.</p><p>QUEST: Vincent, good to see you, sir. Thank you. Much appreciated.</p><p>REINHART: Same here. Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Elon Musk is to have a new boss. It's Robyn Denholm who has been appointed as the Chair of Tesla. Now, Musk had to vacate the role as part of the settlement with the SEC following his infamous tweet claiming he had secured funding to take Tesla private. Now, you'll recall, this is history you're being familiar with. The SEC filed a lawsuit and it alleged that Musk inflated the stock price with his tweet without any funding in place, in effect, he ramped up the price.</p><p>Denholm's responsibilities as the chairwoman will be to represent shareholders and oversee Musk who remains as the CEO. So, he continues to be the face of the company and determines its strategy. Clare Sebastian is in New York.</p><p>How on earth did they manage to choose this as the chair? I mean, an existing director, but what was the things in favor?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, Richard, she has a lot of relevant experience. She's worked for many years in corporate finance roles which actually is a complement to Elon Musk's more technical and designed background. She's worked across software. Telecom is where she currently is. She has even worked for Toyota in Australia as the Finance Manager, so she has experience in the auto sector.</p><p>But I think, there are real questions here. She is an insider. She has been on the board for four years and there are real questions here about just how much of a check this will be on Musk's power.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: For a man intoxicated with power, the kind that fuels electric cars and help solve rolling Australian blackouts, coping with a reduction in his own power is new for Elon Musk. Steve Westley is a former Tesla board member and early investor.</p><p>Do you think there is a part of this that will irk him a little bit?</p><p>STEVE WESTLEY, FORMER TESLA BOARD MEMBER: Look, I think Elon loves being spurred on. As you know, he has just posted historic results and I think he is using the SEC and the government as a foil. I think he's trying to be the champion innovator in Silicon Valley.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Musk isn't just giving up the chairmanship of Tesla after 14 years. The SEC settlement also seeks to rein in his favorite form of self- expression, Twitter. A prospect he addressed in a recent Recode podcast.</p><p>KARA SWISHER, PODCASTER: Will you have to change your Twitter behavior?</p><p>[15:10:00]</p><p>ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA: Not really. I think it's mostly just if there's something might cause a substantial movement in the stock during trading hours.</p><p>WESTLEY: if he's smart, he will do what the SEC tells him. He can continue to be on the cutting edge. He can continue to be on the cutting edge. He can continue to be a visionary but at the end of the day, you don't want to mess with the SEC or the Department of Justice and I think he understands that.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Others are less convinced.</p><p>SCOTT STRINGER, NEW YORK CITY COMPTROLLER: Elon Musk has been erratic and the governance structure of Tesla needs to be reformed.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: New York City Comptroller, Scott Stringer manages the public pension fund of which $75 million is invested in Tesla.</p><p>STRINGER: I think it would be prudent to permanently separate the chair position and the CEO position. By the way, I think it would serve the interest of an Elon Musk because when you have two positions, no one's watching him. And, so, when you make a bad decision, you really pay for it.</p><p>MUSK: I sleep on the couch over there.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Musk has been open about the personal toll of his job showing CBS earlier this year where he spent nights sleeping on the factory floor and revealing to the \"New York Times\" he uses Ambien.</p><p>WESTLEY: It could well be that the SEC has done him a favor to bring in a stronger chairman. I think the Board, and I know them well, it's a solid board and I think they will bring in strong senior management and end and I think it will end up propelling the company forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST: So, Clare, now obviously, the SEC signed off on this. It was all part of the agreement. The thought had been, as you rightly point out, that they would not accept an insider and certainly not the insider that was originally going to be put forward who they rejected. What was it do you think, about Robyn Denholm that allowed them to go forward with her?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, Richard, I think perhaps, being - having been on the Board for four years helps with her relationship with Musk, plus if you look at the Board, Richard, has people like Elon Musk's own brother and the former CFO of Solar City. She is among the most independent members of this Board. But there's more work for Tesla to do to keep up its end of the bargain with the SEC. They still have to install two independent directors, two new ones. They still need a special committee to oversee Musk's tweets, his communications with investors.</p><p>So, there is more work to be done and there are many people who feel that it's not just about the Board that they need to install some kind of COO, some kind of second in command to help Musk with the day-to-day running of the company to try and ease the burdens and stop him from burning out, again.</p><p>QUEST: Clare Sebastian who is in New York. Clare, thank you. As we continue tonight, the wolf of Wall Street weighs in on the question of pot and pot stocks. Live for us tonight from Los Angeles, we have Jordan Belfort about the media and the up and downs of marijuana stocks and, also, just about - does the bull market still have life in it?</p><p>[15:15:00]</p><p>QUEST: So, when they fired Jeff Sessions or rather when President Trump fired Jeff Sessions, there was one market impact that was immediate, it was the rise in the price of marijuana stocks. And that followed on with volatility. Because Jeff Sessions, as Attorney General and senator before that was a marijuana hardliner. By that I mean, he was adamantly against it and was going to use the full weight of the Federal government to ensure the enforcement of existing laws against it.</p><p>Tilray which is a pot co, the Tilray shares surged after the sacking. It went - they roared up and what happened before followed on today. A big selloff in the sector today. Look at that. Very sharply. Tilray actually is the worst. It was down 15%. Canopy also, Cronos, you see them all. So this was the case, not so much of buy on the rumor, sell on the news - it was buy on the news, and sell afterwards.</p><p>If there is one man who knows about volatile investments and legal troubles and narcotics, Jordan Belfort joins me. Last year, he was talking on this program about Bitcoin and with Bitcoin, he worried bubbles can come and go rather quickly once main stream investors get involved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JORDAN BELFORT, AMERICAN AUTHOR: If you were the most disciplined person, you could really have this with - get in and get out of this probably a window, a short window to make some money. But that's not human nature. It's not psychology. People, they will get in and they make some money and they want to make more money and people have a tendency -- tulip bubble, right? Remember, in the tulip bubble, the beginning of the end was when they started trading futures on tulips. That's how it started to - and that was another move up and then all of a sudden, boom, it collapses and it's all over.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Jordan Belfort joins me now from Los Angeles. Perfect analogy. Tulip mania. Something right out of the ground and now we have pot o' mania, marijuana mania. Whatever you want to call it. Do you believe that, well, explain what you think is going on with pot stocks.</p><p>BELFORT: Sure, well you know I was a huge bear on crypto and I had a great call and it was at $20,000.00. I thought it was going to crash and burn and it did and I think it still goes. But the pot, the marijuana is very, very different. I mean, you know, it's a real business. So, what you're going to see here is that you're going to have some very big winners and a lot of losers.</p><p>So, you know, you've got to be very, very careful not to get caught up in these huge high bubbles and pump and dumps, as well. But there is going to be some companies that really do have long-term sustained growth and there will be fortunes made because it is a legitimate business. There is a huge demand for it. There is really, you know, large margins right now. Those will collapse as the bigger plays get in, but there is definitely opportunities to make money because it is legit and also, it seems the regulatory headwinds are diminishing every day and then eventually, it will Federally legal and I then I think, will really take off.</p><p>Right now the action more on the Canadian exchanges although the legal here, the stocks really are traded there.</p><p>QUEST: Right. And the talking of those because the other avenue into is ETFs and the ETFs on marijuana stocks were extremely volatile over the next few days. Is this an area of investing for widows and orphans?</p><p>BELFORT: Only if you invest what you can afford to lose - all of your money. I mean, look, again, I'm actually bullish on it, but you have to be very careful. It's going to be like anything else, there is going to be unscrupulous players that get in there and try to make the quick in and out, right, but here's the thing. I would really focus - if you look in - I'm not going to record any particular kind, but just be careful about companies where you don't really know, the management has no track record or there is not a big player behind it that has a banking connection. You have to be really careful with that stuff.</p><p>But if you get involved with solid players and that have real IP, I think you could really make money here, but you have got to be careful and don't risk more than you can afford to lose because there's be a lot of zeros along the way, but some big winners. It's legit.</p><p>QUEST: Look, I'm fascinated on this idea of whether the bull market is resting, exhausted about to have another run or dead.</p><p>BELFORT: Well, big question, right? If I really knew that for sure, I could make a lot of money. But here's the deal, I think that - right, but given the outcome of the midterms, it really is going to locked in with the pen on is it going to be investigation after investigator or legislation.</p><p>[15:20:06]</p><p>BELFORT: I think that when legislation happens, you'll have a really long, sustained rally here. But if it turns into a fight between Democrats and Republicans, it could get really ugly really quick because a lot of the rally is based on - and the economic rally is based on consumer confidence.</p><p>And if it starts to become massive gridlock and in-fine - more in-fine than gridlock. Gridlock is not terrible, but in-fine where everyone is subpoenaing and that could be a real disaster at the moment. I hope it doesn't happen.</p><p>QUEST: Hang on. We were talking to our earlier guest about this. He was an economist about this issue of gridlock and the market likes gridlock. You represent the market. Do you like? Do you like gridlock? Did your eyes light up and your heart flutter at the thought of the US government becoming a gridlock for the foreseeable?</p><p>BELFORT: Gridlock is not good for the long term. But remember, what gridlock means is nothing is really happening which means there is certainty, right, and the market likes certainty. So if people think things are going to stay the same that represents certainty, which means stocks will probably tend to rise.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are looming issues like a massive deficit that has to be addressed. So, you can't ignore this forever. Kick the can down the road until my kids are having kids, right. But gridlock for the short term would probably, again, no guarantees, probably lead to higher prices. My guess.</p><p>QUEST: I notice what you say your kids having kids. Does that mean you're getting soft in your investment strategies? Does that mean -hang on, has the wolf been tamed? Are you now starting to think about defensive stock rather than high alpha stock that was going to run off to the races?</p><p>QUEST: Never, never. I'm like a risk taker at heart. I love the action. But I record this in all seriousness. I recommend people as they - I'm getting older, by the way, I am 56 years old now and I feel 56 sometimes when I wake up in the morning, but I think that listen, again with investing, you know, especially in the sector that you talked about with marijuana. There's a lot of money to be made. But you have got to be really careful because a lot of people, you know, you can't - just like you saw yesterday, the stocks rise up and they crash back down. You have to take a longer term outlook on that for like one to two years and look for - a lot of these companies have huge market caps, right?</p><p>But that's not necessarily that terrible for this industry because what these companies do is they use their stock to make acquisitions. So, while the market cap might be very high and is overvalued right now, if they're smart and they have good management, they'll use it to snap up these smaller companies and sort of back fill the value. So, don't look just at market cap. You want to look at the management, it's the most important thing and also the - do they have any intellectual property that really is sustainable and separates them from the pack?</p><p>So I think that there's some opportunities, but be very, very careful.</p><p>QUEST: And less of the worries about being 56. It's a wonderful age. Some of us are - it could not be better. And, finally, you know, when I look at the market and I hear about pot stocks, I hear about this idea of rotate out of tech, where tech has been beaten up. You see Amazon, which we all still use on a daily basis.</p><p>I see Amazon down 25% to 30%. Nothing justified the overvaluations, but nothing really justified the sharp falls either other than that the wind changed.</p><p>BELFORT: Yes, well, listen, I saw a commercial on YouTube about something with Google Assistant. This radical breakthrough where the computer now sounds like it's human. I'm like, it's like \"The Terminator.\" I mean, I don't think you could say the tech rally or anything with tech is - I think it's just beginning. I mean, the advances are so extreme right now that I wouldn't look at any tech company and say that the end is nigh. I think it's probably the beginning, honestly. We're going to go to a place I think we could hardly imagine. That is my opinion.</p><p>QUEST: And it's an opinion we want to hear more often. Jordan, good to see you, sir. I appreciate it.</p><p>BELFORT: My pleasure.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you for taking the time. We've got to get you and me in the same studio probably in New York or out in Los Angeles. How about that?</p><p>BELFORT: I'll be there in a couple weeks for Thanksgiving to see my family.</p><p>QUEST: Excellent. Thank you very much, indeed. Jordan Belfort joining us.</p><p>BELFORT: Thank you, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Now, we are learning more about Jeff Sessions interim replacement as US Attorney General, his name is Matthew Whitaker and he served on the advisory board and received campaign contributions from a company that was shut down and fined by the US government. World Patent Marketing promised to help investors get patents. The FTC - the Federal Trade Commission of the United States said (inaudible) paid thousands of dollars and got nothing in return. Documents show the company of Whitaker even threatened legal action against customers who complained. Whitaker declined to comment to CNN.</p><p>Lawmakers are focused on how Matt Whitaker will handle the Mueller probe. He is now also responsible for the Justice Department's portfolio of business-related investigations. So, for instance, you've got the net neutrality fight with California, you have the anti-trust case against our own parent company, AT&amp;T ...</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>QUEST: ... when they bought Time Warner and the possible probe of social media giants. For instance, Facebook and the like and Google, which President Trump has said there could be anti-trust activities and they may be need to be looked at to be broken up. And then lawsuits from the financial crisis. UBS expecting a lawsuit over mortgage bonds. Put this together and joining me now, Elie Honig who served as US Federal State Prosecutor and now CNN legal analyst. Well, I gave a rough taste of the issues and does Whitaker pass muster or is he conflicted?</p><p>ELI HONIG, LEGAL ANALYST, CNN: Whitaker could have conflicts on a couple of different levels. First and foremost, the one that jumps out to me is - look, the most important case he is going to be overseeing is the Mueller probe of Russia interference with the 2016 election and Whitaker has been out there publicly on CNN and elsewhere writing opinion pieces and speaking on shows like this about how he believes that the Mueller investigation had gone too far, had crossed over lines, should be starved of budget and resources. How he thinks that certain facts that the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 was not at all criminal.</p><p>So, he's already on record with where he stands on a lot of this. I think there's a real conflict issue there. That said, I don't think there is any way he recuses himself. That's the number one original sin that Jeff Sessions committed that probably ultimately got him fired or pushed out the door.</p><p>QUEST: So what does he do?</p><p>HONIG: What does Whitaker do?</p><p>QUEST: What does he do? I mean, yes, I mean, he may not do it the first day on the job while he's still - I mean, he is already being deputy, so he knows where the photo copier and the men's room is. He knows his way around the building. At what point do you think, he makes his first move that gives us an indication of how he's going to treat the Mueller investigation.</p><p>HONIG: It's a good question because a lot of the important decisions could be happening at least initially behind closed doors. Usually the public is not privy to the kind of decisions that prosecutors will make. So, for example, if Mueller sits down with Whitaker later this week, tomorrow, next week and says, \"Okay, look, here's a couple people I'm about to indict,\" and Whitaker says, \"No, I'm not approving those indictments.\" We wouldn't necessarily know that unless somebody leaked and we know Mueller has runs a tight shop or unless eventually, the now Democratic-controlled Congress starts subpoenaing people and digging into why certain decisions were made and who authorized them.</p><p>So these decisions, these are prosecutorial strategic decisions that won't necessarily be happening wide out in the open.</p><p>QUEST: But we're sure you'll get wind of them and when you do, you'll come and talk to us about them here on \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p>HONIG: Yes, you know, things have a way of coming out and the reporters have been very good on this story. So, I have a feeling, I agree with you, I have a feeling, a lot of what happens behind closed doors will come out in the public eye.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir. Thank you. As we continue tonight from London. New York City could get a big vote of confidence from two of the world's biggest tech companies. Amazon and Google are expected to beef up their presence in the Big Apple but are doing so in very different ways.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>[15:30:00] RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Hello, I'm Richard Quest, there is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, quite a lot more in fact as we continue when Britain's former Finance Minister George Osborne tells me a hard Brexit would be catastrophic for the U.K.</p><p>And Google's chief executive says he'll make big HR changes, that's after the companywide walkout. As you and I continue tonight, you are watching Cnn and here the facts always come first.</p><p>A police officer named Ron Helus was one of the 12 people killed in a brutal gun attack at a California bar late on Wednesday. Helus was on the scene within minutes and was hit by the gunman's bullet when he entered the building, later dying at hospital. He was a veteran officer with three decades of experience.</p><p>Democrats are demanding that the new U.S. Attorney General recuse himself from the Russia investigation. However, sources tell Cnn, White House officials see no need. Matt Whitaker has called special counsel Robert Mueller's appointment ridiculous and suggested his investigation be curtailed. Now Whitaker, who was being appointed by Donald Trump after the president forced out Jeff Sessions.</p><p>France says it will not pay tribute to a Nazi collaborator after President Emmanuel Macron came under fire for saying it was legitimate to honor Marshal Philippe Petain. The town was considered a hero for his role in the first World War, when told to be jailed for treason after working with the Nazis during World War II.</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in hospital suffering three fractured ribs. A court statement says the 85-year-old justice fell in her office on Wednesday night. Miss Ginsburg went home but was uncomfortable during the night and was admitted to Washington hospital this morning.</p><p>It seems Amazon is not the only tech giant planning to grow its presence in New York City. Google could also be planning to add as many as 12,000 jobs. Now that would effectively double the head count in the city. It's almost on the par with Amazon who is expected to announce 25,000 new jobs in a new facility in Queens.</p><p>The two announcements, Google and Amazon could cement New York's position as a tech hub to rival Silicon Valley. Scott Galloway is the author of \"The Fall\". He joins me now from Los Angeles. And you are not surprised, are you? You're not vested with the Amazon. You said on this program that they were going to go for Washington. So, you're not surprised.</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, AUTHOR: No, I don't think this was a contest. I think it was a con, I think it was over before it started. The one thing these two headquarters have in common that, if you can call them headquarters that Amazon has selected is they're both within six miles of the Bezos homes in D.C. and New York.</p><p>So the only criteria that ever mattered was where a 54-year-old worth $165 billion wants to live. This was, in my views, Richard, this was an abuse of the commonwealth.</p><p>QUEST: Except why did everybody else go along with it. I mean, there must have been savvy advisors to governors and mayors around the country that must have said to them what you've said to me.</p><p>[15:35:00] GALLOWAY: I think they took them at their word, and the temptation to detonate a prosperity bomb in town square is irresistible for 238 cities. And when you have a ruse that's well played out including officials from Amazon visiting new cities in a thoughtful RFP, you, it's easy to talk yourself into believing, yes, we have a shot --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>GALLOWAY: At this and then you have cities taking out billboards and sending them Cacti. You literally have tens of thousands of hours on behalf of municipal employees who probably should have been allocating those scanned resources elsewhere. This was -- like I said, this was over before it started.</p><p>QUEST: Let's now look at New York, New York City gets Amazon and it gets more from Google in very different ways. Google is just going to quietly expand Amazon doing it with trumpets. But what does it mean to have these two giants increasing their footprint?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, it means a lot of things on a very macro level, you could say it's a disturbing trend, but not only do we see the 1 percent in our population pulling away from the other 99 percent, we see certain key metros pulling away from others.</p><p>There are 450 metros in the United States and five of them account for about a quarter of all the economic growth over the last ten years. And by the way, two of those five are the D.C. and New York metros. So, from a broader kind of U.S. standpoint, the haves and the haves not continue to run.</p><p>So -- but, in terms of the city, there's no arguing, this would be good on most dimensions for New York and you have to credit Mayor Bloomberg's vision to go through there and make requisite investments to get a third university. The one thing or one of the things that is common among any company that's been able to add tens of billions of dollars in shareholder value in a matter of years, not decades is that they're all headquartered within a bike ride of a world class engineering university.</p><p>And now you have three of them within a bike ride of these new headquarters in New York, Columbia, NYU and Cornell. So the mother's milk of growth is young, engineering, savvy talent --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>GALLOWAY: And we have a lot of it in New York.</p><p>QUEST: And let's talk, that point was raised by a tech investor who is based in New York. He tweeted, this investor said, crazy to think about the long-term impact of the NYC start-up echo system of 12,000 new Google, 25 New Amazon workers.</p><p>Almost bottomless pools of talent for New York's start-ups. And does it since -- I'm not suggesting -- maybe I am suggesting that New York starts to rival Silicon Valley if only because we've got or you've got -- when I'm back in New York, we've got the financing. The financing structures.</p><p>Wall Street is there, the multi-media industry is there, it has -- it's more than just the tech and that will be appealing to tech.</p><p>GALLOWAY: There's a lot of stuff. The proximity to Europe, as you said access to other industries. Young people want to live in cities. If you think about every 18 or 20-year-old stem outstanding college grad or even valedictorians, there's very few people that don't dream of at some point living in New York at some point in their life.</p><p>And when you look at the impact that San Francisco, how impacted it is, New York City becomes increasingly attractive. There's -- you know, this -- the technology world continues to eat the economy, 12 years ago, only one of the five most valuable companies in the world was tech, now it's five of the five.</p><p>So it just makes sense that every large city, if it wants to maintain its viscosity, its growth, its attractiveness to young, successful people whether it's London or Hong Kong, they've got to figure out a way to attract these --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Technology companies and they are.</p><p>QUEST: Scott, thank you, you and I need to go on a walk about or at least to drive about and eat about or something about that shows the attractiveness of New York for these companies. Here's the deal, you agree to go along and I'll agree to pick up the bill.</p><p>GALLOWAY: All right, you do London, I'll do New York, Richard, it's a date.</p><p>QUEST: All right, excellent. thank you. As we continue --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Thank you --</p><p>QUEST: Now, there's another story developing at Google at the moment. The company says it's making a number of internal changes in response to protests from its employees over the company's handling of sexual harassment. Heather Kelly is with me, joins us from San Francisco to put this -- good to see you.</p><p>Heather, the -- how much of the changes come from the fact that Google was somewhat shocked that they went out on strike or at least walked out for a few hours?</p><p>HEATHER KELLY, CNN TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: I mean, it's unclear exactly what's going behind the scenes at Google. An interesting thing about today's letter that Sundar Pichai sent out to employees is that it didn't actually mention the walkout by name.</p><p>[15:40:00] It didn't mention that employees had officially organized, it said, you know, something kind of generic about, you know, things to recent feedback from our employees. So I think it maybe rattled them a little bit definitely, and it was exactly one week ago. So I think it's directly responsible for these changes.</p><p>QUEST: I mean, I suppose we'll never know whether they would have done it anyway. But this -- the CEO's statement specifically refers to what they've done, and I think it's important. He also basically says we got it wrong. We have been wrong. I only wonder what difference it makes these changes.</p><p>KELLY: I mean, the changes are -- they're a lot of what the protesters were asking for, it's not everything and they've said before today that they're going to -- now that they've organized, they're going to continue pushing for changes at Google and you know, Google is not unionized.</p><p>But it could even go in that direction. And I wonder how much, you know, management is trying to kind of hold off any more organization among its employees by making these big changes --</p><p>QUEST: Any --</p><p>KELLY: Right now.</p><p>QUEST: From our -- from our new bureau on the West Coast, any signs, any grumblings, anything you hear that suggest other companies might be facing -- we know they're facing similar problems, but might face the same reaction from staff and have to do the same sort of things.</p><p>KELLY: Oh, I think absolutely. I mean, it's kind of been like the Summer and now Fall of tech-lash which is a lot of employees at these big tech companies are just waking up to the fact that they have a lot of power if they disagree with the projects their companies are taking on like Amazon and Microsoft and Google.</p><p>They're going to speak up about it, and they're going to hold walkouts, and it's led to some contracts being canceled at big companies. And I think other employees might see what's happened in the past week with Google and absolutely be inspired to take the same routes for their own workers' rights.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, now you're there, we expect to see more of you on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS --</p><p>KELLY: You see me any time you want --</p><p>QUEST: As we -- anytime we want as we increase our coverage of course on tech in the West Coast. Coming up in a moment after the break, I'll be speaking to Kenya's Treasury Minister, it's about a controversial tax. Now, it's interesting, Kenya's most innovative industry really relates to mobile phones and the like, the mobile banking sector.</p><p>But Kenya sees this as a cash machine for government spending. After the break.</p><p>[15:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Kenya's economy is on track for a banner year, 6 percent growth according to the IMF. Now, part of the economic success clearly can be attributed to its innovative banking sector, we talked about it last week. In some ways, it's years ahead of everywhere else.</p><p>The mobile banking system has to be seen to be believed in that country which is why a new government plan to hike taxes on mobile transactions. It makes perfect sense if you are the government, but it's highly controversial otherwise. On my recent visit to Nairobi, I asked Kenya's Treasury Minister about why he is taxing one of the most innovative parts of the Kenyan economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENY ROTICH, TREASURY SECRETARY, KENYA: Kenya has been a leader in our city, particularly in the mobile technology and also sending money through the cellular phones. And this is where majority of Kenyans now are really transacting, you know.</p><p>So our person in charge of treasury yields want to make sure always you wait and you attack space as much as possible, and this is where a lot of transactions are happening. But, of course, we are very sensitive to ensure that we practice it in a manner that we don't discourage the innovation that we have achieved and the financial inclusion that we have actually achieved as a country. So it's a very --</p><p>QUEST: So come on, come on, come on, minister --</p><p>ROTICH: Balancing --</p><p>QUEST: You found, you found a new gravy train, and it's nice to get onboard.</p><p>ROTICH: Well, and yes, and also to finance one of the big agenda of the president which you just mentioned, universal healthcare, very important initiative, and, of course, we need to fund that.</p><p>QUEST: But what about the suggestion --</p><p>ROTICH: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: The valid suggestion, I think, that the mobile money tax, transfer tax is a regressive tax. Now, to some extent, all consumptive taxes are aggressive because they hit the poorer people as a percentage of their income harder. There were other ways when you don't even have a capital gains tax, but you could have raised sizable revenues without hitting the poor.</p><p>ROTICH: Yes, we've also introduced capital gains, that's in some areas which is but still very low. These cap for that. We currently -- we're actually finalizing a new income tax law which will deal with the issues of capital gain and also make the tax more progressive -- income tax more progressive.</p><p>So we're doing a sort of -- lots of reforms in our taxation system to ensure that we achieve progressivity and of course equity and fairness and, of course, taking care of the poor.</p><p>QUEST: Parliament decided it was a good idea to have an interest rate cap. Nobody else thinks it was a good idea. The governor is not in favor, the investment community is not in favor, is the minister in favor?</p><p>ROTICH: Well, look, I have been the first to really engage parliament when this issue came, and we tried as much as possible to explain the consequences that it will bring, which is really what we are really beginning to see. The unintended consequences was parliament had reports they were helping the poor.</p><p>But what we are beginning to see is that the credit to that sector they were trying to project is not happening. So we are engaging in parliament now that we have detail. We have -- we have seen its consequence. I believe now the debate will be more enriched and the people will believe us more than before because there was a thinking that, look, this thing will work and all that.</p><p>So now, we're in a better place to --</p><p>QUEST: It's a terrible idea, then it's not working at all, correct?</p><p>ROTICH: Well, to some extent, we've seen, you know, people -- you know, getting credit at a low price. But the problem is a lot of other people are cut off from the credit market. So that is a -- fortunately though, the M-Pesa and the -- you know, the innovation and the financial system has also helped because we have -- we have not controlled --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ROTICH: We have not controlled into stress, that is just in the banks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: When we return, Britain's economy slips down the growth league tables as it prepares to leave the EU, I speak to the former Finance Minister George Osborne about getting it back on track.</p><p>[15:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Britain's economy slipping behind its European neighbors, falling at the bottom of the growth league as it prepares to leave the EU. European Commissions -- Britain's economic growth was slowed to just 1.2 percent next year and that's amongst the lowest of European nations.</p><p>It puts it by Italy. Now, by 2020, Britain is expected to underperform every EU member state when Italy phases out with a 1.3 percent. Much of Britain's economic future depends on the kind of Brexit deal that will agree with Brussels. I was joined by the former Finance Osborne George Osborne; the man charged with overseeing the British economy in the lead up to the Brexit referendum.</p><p>He left this job shortly after the election. I asked him how he sees Brexit playing out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE OSBORNE, FORMER FINANCE MINISTER, UNITED KINGDOM: I think what's actually going to happen is that we are going to be in a transition period, a so-called transition period where we will mirror these arrangements, but they will never be permanently settled.</p><p>So in practice, we'll be in the single market, in the Customs Union for potentially a very long period to come without anyone being sure that that's the lasting arrangement. And crucially without formal mechanisms to interact with the EU and help determine the rules that will then be on us - -</p><p>QUEST: Which is the -- which is the worst possible arrangement.</p><p>OSBORNE: Well, I'm not sure it's as bad as crashing out with no arrangement.</p><p>QUEST: Why?</p><p>OSBORNE: I mean, well, because I think the consequences for the British economy in the short-term would be very severe, that is the general view, by the way, of investors around the world and indeed the government's own forecasters. And there are sort of basic issues which arise about whether airplanes can fly and pharmaceutical products are legal and what's going to happen at the port.</p><p>And you know, though I think leaving with no arrangement and I suspect this is a view held very strongly by the senior members of the British government, although they're careful not to say it in public, it would be pretty catastrophic for Britain.</p><p>QUEST: Did you ever discuss that with officials when you were at the Treasury? Did you ever sort of say, hey, what's your best guess if we have a fallout of the EU without an agreement?</p><p>OSBORNE: If we had -- you know, we produced some forecasts of what would happen if we left the EU, and one of them was a shock scenario.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, well, that's -- that was one of the ones who came up in the referendum that was widely discredited, well, as being fear tactics. That was thought.</p><p>OSBORNE: I think it was a -- you know, the opponents in that referendum were not great fans of those forecasts, but actually, if you look over the last couple of years, and we haven't of course left the EU, those forecasts were predicated on near immediate departure.</p><p>[15:55:00] You do see the British economy, even on the official governor estimates now being 2.5 percent of served GDP smaller and with otherwise have been -- you've seen the currency here devalued by over 10 percent. You've seen inflation rise as import costs have gone up and that's squeezed real incomes.</p><p>So the idea that there's been no economic effect is in a way -- you know, the government I was part of, was delivering the fastest growing economy of the G7, we're now among the slowest growing economies, not just the G7 but the EU.</p><p>QUEST: You know, every time you say that, I keep coming back to -- and this wouldn't have happened if it hadn't been for you and your team.</p><p>OSBORNE: Well, it wouldn't have happened if in my view, the country hadn't voted to leave the EU.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: And you can hear more from George Osborne on that side of our discussion next week including how he made the switch from finance minister to newspaper editor. Before we finish on a profitable moment, the market is -- the Dow is clawing back, but it's not really telling you the full story.</p><p>If you look at the Dow 30, you'll start to see a much more different events taking place. Amongst the 30 you have, you have the -- you have technology stocks being very badly hit. So the Nasdaq is down and the FANG stocks are down. And if you look at oil stocks, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, they are off because oil is now in a bear market.</p><p>The price of oil has fallen sharply, as you can see down 2 percent for West Texas. All of this means you've got a broad-based rally but a very much -- when it comes to technology stocks they are very much being hit.

Apple may be in the mix.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Northern Virginia is one of 20 finalists for Amazon's second headquarters, and the region has invited Apple to consider it for a 20,000-person campus the iPhone maker is planning for somewhere in the U.S</p><p>Apple is seeking 4 million square feet of office space, economic development officials and real estate executives told The Washington Post. That's about half as large as the campus Amazon is planning. Apple is also said to be exploring North Carolina's Research Triangle region, another possible location for Amazon.</p><p>These twin tech 'trophy' deals, the two largest in U.S history, would be a boon for Northern Virginia, according to Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a Washington D.C -based nonprofit that promotes economic accountability in development deals.</p><p>'These are enormous standalone growth projects,' he said.</p><p>Apple announced in January that it would spend $30 billion on new facilities and hire 20,000 employees in the U.S over the next five years, setting off feverish speculation about where it would land. Unlike Amazon, Apple has not made its search public. CEO Tim Cook said in a recent interview that Apple was not engaged in a 'beauty contest kind of thing.' Apple declined to comment on the report in The Washington Post.</p><p>The gravitational pull for West Coast technology companies to the D.C region: a young, highly educated and tech savvy workforce, nearby colleges, universities and research institutions and easy access to mass transit, not to mention greater proximity to a Republican-controlled Congress and the Trump administration, an added benefit given growing calls for regulation of the industry.</p><p>'It is akin to what the defense industry did in the 1990s and early 2000s when it moved headquarters and facilities to be closer in touch with the people who use its products,' said Tom Stringer, a corporate location specialist and managing director at BDO International. 'Big tech companies, as big and diversified as they have gotten and as many regulatory areas they now fall under, are starting to take the same approach.'</p><p>But could Northern Virginia, a region already straining from overcrowding and traffic congestion, accommodate both tech giants?</p><p>'If both were to come to Northern Virginia, that would be a very stressful event,' LeRoy said. 'You'd have to rebuild the economic geography of Northern Virginia.'</p><p>Word leaked Wednesday that Apple was considering a Northern Virginia campus that would be two-thirds the size of the Pentagon.</p><p>Some of the locations said to be under consideration \u2014 office buildings and development sites in Crystal City close to the Pentagon, privately owned Loudoun County land near the Center for Innovative Technology, northwest of the nation's capitol, and the Scotts Run development in Tysons, between Dulles International Airport and Washington \u2014 have also been proposed for Amazon.</p><p>Another area catching Apple's eye: North Carolina's Research Triangle, close to Duke University, where Cook and other Apple executives went to school, the Triangle Business Journal reported.</p><p>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and state Commerce Secretary Tony Copeland met with Cook on May 11, according to the report. Cook was in town to give a commencement speech at Duke University on May 13.</p><p>The North Carolina's governor's office declined comment.</p><p>Political angling</p><p>For both companies, a decision is likely to involve talent, incentives \u2014 and the threat of increased regulation. Since the 2016 election, major tech companies have increased lobbying and policy operations, and those efforts have grown in size and urgency since the practices of Facebook, Google and other companies have come under heavy scrutiny from consumers, lawmakers and regulators.</p><p>Tech companies are also trying to find common ground with the Trump administration, whose policies sometimes run counter to the industry's stances on immigration, trade and other key issues.</p><p>Northern Virginia is home to an established 'technology corridor' near Dulles International Airport that was dubbed the 'Silicon Valley of the East' four years ago by The Atlantic magazine. The region\u2019s proximity to the federal government makes it attractive to defense, tech, telecom and Internet companies.</p><p>'It makes perfect sense that Apple would consider Northern Virginia for its second headquarters,' given its schools and highly educated workforce, said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, D-Va., who represents Virginia\u2019s 11th District in the House of Representatives, which includes counties in Northern Virginia.</p><p>Fairfax County, which makes up a large chunk of Northern Virginia, is home to eight Fortune 500 company headquarters, and it already has the second-largest concentration of technology jobs of any major U.S market, it says. Companies in the county, which include General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman, collectively accounted for $22.8 billion in U.S government contracts in fiscal year 2015, equal to 5% of all awarded and more than 46 states and Washington, D.C .</p><p>'The quality of our technology workforce cannot be surpassed by anyone. It's a package that will be very very appealing,' Northern Virginia Technology Council President and CEO Bobbie Kilberg says.</p><p>Still, Kilberg wonders if both Amazon and Apple would locate in Northern Virginia.</p><p>Amazon is nearing the end of a search for its second headquarters. Dubbed HQ2, it will be the 'full equal' to its original Seattle home.</p><p>Twenty cities are fighting to land the 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in investment Amazon is offering. Those new Amazon employees will, in turn, produce as many as 250,000 indirect jobs, according to calculations from Enrico Moretti, an economics professor at the University of California-Berkeley.</p><p>So far three Washington D.C -area spots \u2014 the District itself, Northern Virginia and Montgomery Co., Md. \u2014 along with Austin, Boston and Atlanta, rank high among analysts speculating on the winners.</p><p>Amazon is whittling away at the finalist list. The Texas Tribune says Amazon eliminated Arlington, Texas, as a contender two weeks ago.</p><p>One advantage for D.C and Maryland: Each has laws protecting gay rights, Virginia does not. Amazon and Apple are supporters of the lesbian and gay community. And gay rights advocates have been running a No Gay? No Way! campaign to discourage Amazon from choosing an area without protections for employees and their families.</p><p>'My guess is if Amazon keeps to its time timetable of deciding (its HQ2) this summer, if I was Apple I\u2019d wait and see and think about going forward from there,' Kilberg said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1590157I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SCF-GXW1-F0YC-N0GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1119\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 19, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Apple may be in the mix.  </p><p><br/>Northern Virginia is one of 20 finalists for Amazon's second headquarters, and the region has invited Apple to consider it for a 20,000-person campus the iPhone maker is planning for somewhere in the U.S.<br/>Apple is seeking 4 million square feet of office space, economic development officials and real estate executives told The Washington Post. That's about half as large as the campus Amazon is planning. Apple is also said to be exploring North Carolina's Research Triangle region, another possible location for Amazon.  <br/>These twin tech \"trophy\" deals, the two largest in U.S. history, would be a boon for Northern Virginia, according to Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit that promotes economic accountability in development deals.  <br/>\"These are enormous standalone growth projects,\" he said.  <br/>Apple announced in January that it would spend $30 billion on new facilities and hire 20,000 employees in the U.S. over the next five years, setting off feverish speculation about where it would land. Unlike Amazon, Apple has not made its search public. CEO Tim Cook said in a recent interview that Apple was not engaged in a \"beauty contest kind of thing.\" Apple declined to comment on the report in The Washington Post.  <br/>The gravitational pull for West Coast technology companies to the D.C. region: a young, highly educated and tech savvy workforce, nearby colleges, universities and research institutions and easy access to mass transit, not to mention greater proximity to a Republican-controlled Congress and the Trump administration, an added benefit given growing calls for regulation of the industry.  <br/>\"It is akin to what the defense industry did in the 1990s and early 2000s when it moved headquarters and facilities to be closer in touch with the people who use its products,\" said Tom Stringer, a corporate location specialist and managing director at BDO International. \"Big tech companies, as big and diversified as they have gotten and as many regulatory areas they now fall under, are starting to take the same approach.\"  <br/>But could Northern Virginia, a region already straining from overcrowding and traffic congestion, accommodate both tech giants?  <br/>\"If both were to come to Northern Virginia, that would be a very stressful event,\" LeRoy said. \"You'd have to rebuild the economic geography of Northern Virginia.\"  <br/>Word leaked Wednesday that Apple was considering a Northern Virginia campus that would be two-thirds the size of the Pentagon.  <br/>Some of the locations said to be under consideration \u2014 office buildings and development sites in Crystal City close to the Pentagon, privately owned Loudoun County land near the Center for Innovative Technology, northwest of the nation's capitol, and the Scotts Run development in Tysons, between Dulles International Airport and Washington \u2014 have also been proposed for Amazon.  <br/>Another area catching Apple's eye: North Carolina's Research Triangle, close to Duke University, where Cook and other Apple executives went to school, the Triangle Business Journal reported.  <br/>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and state Commerce Secretary Tony Copeland met with Cook on May 11, according to the report. Cook was in town to give a commencement speech at Duke University on May 13.  <br/>The North Carolina's governor's office declined comment.  <br/>Political angling  <br/>For both companies, a decision is likely to involve talent, incentives \u2014 and the threat of increased regulation. Since the 2016 election, major tech companies have increased lobbying and policy operations, and those efforts have grown in size and urgency since the practices of Facebook, Google and other companies have come under heavy scrutiny from consumers, lawmakers and regulators.  <br/>Tech companies are also trying to find common ground with the Trump administration, whose policies sometimes run counter to the industry's stances on immigration, trade and other key issues.  <br/>Northern Virginia is home to an established \"technology corridor\" near Dulles International Airport that was dubbed the \"Silicon Valley of the East\" four years ago by The Atlantic magazine. The region\u2019s proximity to the federal government makes it attractive to defense, tech, telecom and Internet companies.  <br/>\"It makes perfect sense that Apple would consider Northern Virginia for its second headquarters,\" given its schools and highly educated workforce, said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, D-Va., who represents Virginia\u2019s 11th District in the House of Representatives, which includes counties in Northern Virginia.  <br/>Fairfax County, which makes up a large chunk of Northern Virginia, is home to eight Fortune 500 company headquarters, and it already has the second-largest concentration of technology jobs of any major U.S. market, it says. Companies in the county, which include General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman, collectively accounted for $22.8 billion in U.S. government contracts in fiscal year 2015, equal to 5% of all awarded and more than 46 states and Washington, D.C..  <br/>\"The quality of our technology workforce cannot be surpassed by anyone. It's a package that will be very very appealing,\" Northern Virginia Technology Council President and CEO Bobbie Kilberg says.  <br/>Still, Kilberg wonders if both Amazon and Apple would locate in Northern Virginia.  <br/>Amazon is nearing the end of a search for its second headquarters. Dubbed HQ2, it will be the \"full equal\" to its original Seattle home.  <br/>Twenty cities are fighting to land the 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in investment Amazon is offering. Those new Amazon employees will, in turn, produce as many as 250,000 indirect jobs, according to calculations from Enrico Moretti, an economics professor at the University of California-Berkeley.  <br/>So far three Washington D.C.-area spots \u2014 the District itself, Northern Virginia and Montgomery Co., Md. \u2014 along with Austin, Boston and Atlanta, rank high among analysts speculating on the winners.  <br/>Amazon is whittling away at the finalist list. The Texas Tribune says Amazon eliminated Arlington, Texas, as a contender two weeks ago.  <br/>One advantage for D.C. and Maryland: Each has laws protecting gay rights, Virginia does not. Amazon and Apple are supporters of the lesbian and gay community. And gay rights advocates have been running a No Gay? No Way! campaign to discourage Amazon from choosing an area without protections for employees and their families.  <br/>\"My guess is if Amazon keeps to its time timetable of deciding (its HQ2) this summer, if I was Apple I\u2019d wait and see and think about going forward from there,\" Kilberg said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN828813020180519</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SC8-8XX1-DXCW-D0FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1129\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 19, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009S60</classCode><className>BDO GLOBAL COORDINATION BV</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST00097LT</classCode><className>LABOR FORCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0008XKQ</classCode><className>COMPANY RELOCATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000549</classCode><className>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001220</classCode><className>NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00097YK</classCode><className>RECRUITMENT &amp;

But the Facebook chief executive may be the most high-profile.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week he appeared before the Senate commerce and judiciary committees to explain the inner workings of Facebook following accusations of users' data being harvested without consent and undermining democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Say one thing for the guy, he was contrite. \"I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here,\" he said. \"It's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm. That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.\"</p><p>And contrition pays. Facebook's share price went up 4.5pc on Tuesday alone. That means Zuckerberg, pictured, increased his personal wealth by $3 billion on one day alone. Good money for a five-hour shift.</p><p>But some legislators did make him squirm for his money. He was asked how Cambridge Analytica was able to access private information from 87 million Facebook users without their consent. He was asked how Facebook differed from the FBI under surveillance nut J Edgar Hoover. He said he would follow up on particularly thorny questions at least 15 times. \"While Facebook has certainly grown, I worry that it may not have matured,\" remarked the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.</p><p>But most legislators gave Zuckerberg an easy ride. One senator asked whether Facebook could see emails sent on WhatsApp, despite the fact that WhatsApp doesn't send emails and is encrypted. Others asked for a basic overview of how Facebook facilitates targeted advertising, if it had a liberal bias, or was a monopoly.</p><p>There was a general sense that Facebook has grown to big to police itself, but no overview of how this could be addressed.</p><p>But some form of regulation seems to be inevitable. For Facebook and other technology companies the only questions are how stringent and in which areas. One area of concern is around users privacy. Europe's upcoming General Data Protection is making waves on the other side of the Atlantic. Zuckerberg was asked whether GDPR style privacy protections should be applied in the US, which would force Facebook to forgo some of its mountainous profits to protect user's privacy. Zuckerberg said he was committed to rolling out the controls around consent that are required in GDPR. However, he also added that there are different sensibilities around privacy protection in different jurisdictions.</p><p>Another hot topic is whether Facebook and other platforms are media companies and should be subject to similar laws and regulations. For example, Facebook is a potential goldmine for defamation lawyers, but to date has protected itself by claiming it's not a media company. Silicon Valley's finest have regularly disavowed responsibility for misinformation and harassment by saying: \"It's not us, it's our users.\" Zuckerberg stuck to this line in his senate hearing. But he did make one break with the past, by accepting responsibility for the content on his platform. This new-found willingness to accept accountability seems to be founded on the belief that artificial intelligence will make it possible to spot and police hate speech, harassment or misinformation.</p><p>\"In the future, we're going to have tools that are going to be able to identify more types of bad content,\" he said. \"I think that there are moral and legal obligation questions that we'll have to wrestle with as a society about when we want to require companies to take action proactively on those things.\"</p><p>Facebook is doing everything it can to avoid onerous regulation. It is rolling out a series of new tools to help users understand the validity of the news that appears in their news feed. News stories will be accompanied by related articles on the same topic and a link to the publishers Wikipedia page. It has banned companies like Cambridge Analytica and AgregateIQ that violate its policies. It is even considering suing the former. Facebook is also playing the \"more regulation means less innovation\" card, which resonates with politicians.</p><p>The most likely outcome is that big tech will become big finance's little brother. It will become regulated. But profits will still be high, and he who lobbies hardest will win. The tech sector is already playing this game.

Not only has the US government and its various agencies been much less vigorous in scrutinising tech giants' power, but at times have actively fought Brussels.</p><p>The two major US tech antitrust probes of the last two decades, in comparison, have achieved little. Microsoft's battle against the American government was dramatic, but ultimately resulted in limited sanctions. An investigation into Google's search dominance that ended six years ago had even fewer consequences.</p><p>Proponents of more action against big tech often say that American regulators are illequipped to take on the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon because while European law looks at whether a market is competitive, US antitrust law is more concerned with higher prices paid by consumers. Since Google and Facebook are free to the consumer, and Amazon's prices are typically lower than the competition, they are supposedly shielded.</p><p>This is only partially true. American law deals with \"consumer welfare\", a concept that often materialises in higher prices, but is not restricted to it. A lack of choice, or a market starved of innovation, can qualify.</p><p>Consumers actually enjoyed lower prices during Standard Oil's monopolistic peak, partly due to economies of scale, but this did not save it from being broken up into 34 pieces. Anti-competitive behaviour, not high prices, is what did John Rockefeller's company in. Not only do US regulators have the power to take on Silicon Valley, but they appear increasingly willing to do so.</p><p>Joe Simons, who was appointed head of the Federal Trade Commission last year, is a former antitrust lawyer who has wasted little time demanding more powers from the government.</p><p>The Department of Justice, America's other competition regulator, has also indicated it is increasingly worried about the market power of tech giants. Mayan Delrahim, the head of the department's antitrust division, sent a chill through Silicon Valley with a speech at a recent conference that sounded like a laundry list of concerns.</p><p>Amazon and Google were called out in name, and Facebook in everything but. Their control of search engines, operating systems, social media and ebook sales were all listed as areas of interest.</p><p>Delrahim espoused a broad range of potential downsides of tech monopolies, including declining innovation, lower privacy protections and even restrictions on free speech, and said competition law's job was to protect all of them.</p><p>The last matter in particular has the attention of the US president, who has insisted that Google, Facebook and others are politically biased against him and shutting down conservative voices. His cause has been taken up by several US senators and congressmen. This month, Congress's antitrust committee announced an investigation into tech monopolies, sending shares in Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google falling.</p><p>Such investigations are often about theatre as much as policy, but they will put further pressure on competition regulators to do something.</p><p>It is still unclear that these developments will necessarily translate into action. Unlike in Europe, where Brussels can levy unilateral penalties, US competition authorities must seek settlements or take their grievances to court. The Department of Justice knows this only too well, having recently been thwarted in its attempts to block AT&amp;T's $85bn (\u00a366.8bn) merger with Time Warner.</p><p>Concerns about China are also coming at a convenient time for much of Silicon Valley. Companies have quietly begun to appeal to nationalistic tendencies, saying if their dominance is crimped, Chinese giants will step into the void. As Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg recently pointed out, Beijing is in no rush to break up Tencent, Alibaba or Baidu.</p><p>But the internet titans are clearly shaken by a sudden American willingness to investigate. The growing numbers of former antitrust officials and lobbyists on their payrolls should be evidence enough of that.</p><p>American competition chiefs may not go after big tech as enthusiastically as their European counterparts, but Silicon Valley and Washington are certainly no longer on the same team.</p><p>'America innovates, Europe regulates is a popular Silicon Valley line'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-150445770</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDH-FVG1-JCBW-N23P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"854\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 24, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As part of our expanding coverage of technology, Jay will examine how the Pacific Northwest has emerged as a major hub for cloud computing, automation and other innovations. He'll focus primarily on Amazon, as it presses into almost every arena of commerce, and Microsoft, which has made a remarkable comeback from years of legal and regulatory challenges to emerge as a leader in cloud computing. </p><p>And he'll cover the consequences of the prosperity bombs big tech companies have set off in the region. Jay has worked as a journalist in Seattle for 21 years, the last three at The Wall Street Journal, where he covered Microsoft and the cloud-computing businesses at Amazon and Google. He spent 10 years as the Seattle bureau chief for BusinessWeek magazine and has covered Amazon and Microsoft for The Seattle Times. He also worked as an investigative reporter for the tech news site CNET. Jay has chronicled Amazon's growth strategy that often pits it against partner[1]s. He has covered the legal and cultural challenges[2] it faced as it expanded in Europe. And he has reported on the new generation of Microsoft executives who have revitalized the company by chasing emerging markets rather than feeding off its legacy businesses. Jay was awarded a McGraw Fellowship for Business Journalism from City University of New York, Graduate School of Journalism. And he wrote Design Is How It Works[3], a book on design and innovation. Jay has a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University and a bachelor's degree in English from Macalester College. An avid skier and cyclist, Jay takes advantage as often as he can of the natural bounty the Pacific Northwest offers. He and his wife have two sons. Jay will start May 13 and be in the newsroom for a week, so please stop by and welcome him then [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.wsj.com_articles_how-2Damazon-2Dwins-2D1527845402...wMFAw...AhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg...QY3mFDQlkYzHgepGOEMTpZ6cmjKjwqfL6cY8ay7Dsw...nMME5gDxzRFCy3vzI7RGGBl2kdsnx5q9RZENBeUwVE...pom4fyBdKX43u_gnyCxv_fCjEZGXAgvgCUc9N-Eh1s#38;e=\">https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.wsj.com_articles_how-2Damazon-2Dwins-2D1527845402...wMFAw...AhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg...QY3mFDQlkYzHgepGOEMTpZ6cmjKjwqfL6cY8ay7Dsw...nMME5gDxzRFCy3vzI7RGGBl2kdsnx5q9RZENBeUwVE...pom4fyBdKX43u_gnyCxv_fCjEZGXAgvgCUc9N-Eh1s#38;e=</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__old.seattletimes.com_html_specialreportspages_2024318110-5Famazonfrancexml.html...wMFAw...AhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg...QY3mFDQlkYzHgepGOEMTpZ6cmjKjwqfL6cY8ay7Dsw...nMME5gDxzRFCy3vzI7RGGBl2kdsnx5q9RZENBeUwVE...CowF8x8q9d5Qza2kZRq1pnMlN1RpGJIYeLjyOG9zY8#38;e=\">https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__old.seattletimes.com_html_specialreportspages_2024318110-5Famazonfrancexml.html...wMFAw...AhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg...QY3mFDQlkYzHgepGOEMTpZ6cmjKjwqfL6cY8ay7Dsw...nMME5gDxzRFCy3vzI7RGGBl2kdsnx5q9RZENBeUwVE...CowF8x8q9d5Qza2kZRq1pnMlN1RpGJIYeLjyOG9zY8#38;e=</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.jaygreene.com_book.html...wMFAw...AhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg...QY3mFDQlkYzHgepGOEMTpZ6cmjKjwqfL6cY8ay7Dsw...nMME5gDxzRFCy3vzI7RGGBl2kdsnx5q9RZENBeUwVE...aOIi6xrCXVgkvzQdirXZyGlR_EVuR6Mx7mWFdSLxcg#38;e=\">https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.jaygreene.com_book.html...wMFAw...AhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg...QY3mFDQlkYzHgepGOEMTpZ6cmjKjwqfL6cY8ay7Dsw...nMME5gDxzRFCy3vzI7RGGBl2kdsnx5q9RZENBeUwVE...aOIi6xrCXVgkvzQdirXZyGlR_EVuR6Mx7mWFdSLxcg#38;e=</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TKBZ108982155611489255825176900221</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TKBZ-7393</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYR-5YW1-F03R-N38M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><timeReceived>2:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Talking Biz News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

EARNEST: I do not have anything at the top, so if you guys just want to start by firing away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>going to Normandy. Any chances that the President would meet with him there? Does the President have any apprehensions about Putin going?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MR. EARNEST: At this point, we do not anticipate that the President will do any bilateral meetings with any world leaders. This is primarily an opportunity for the President and leaders from around the globe to pay tribute to the heroism of Allied forces that led to victory in World War II. That will be the focal point of the President\u2019s activities. When he\u2019s there, he\u2019ll deliver some remarks, and that will be what he\u2019s focused on. I don\u2019t anticipate at this point that there\u2019s a meeting between the President and <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>at this point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q <person><nameText>Chancellor Merkel </nameText></person>said today she welcomes Putin\u2019s presence there. Does <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>feel the same way?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, again, look, we\u2019re focused on remembering the sacrifices and heroism of troops who were part of the Greatest Generation, who liberated a continent and confronted the evil that the President talked about pretty eloquently last night.</p><p>That will be the focus of the President\u2019s trip to Normandy, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. And that\u2019s about it.</p><p>Q Is he actively going to avoid Putin? I mean, would he even see him? And is this likely to change, that you might decide to have a meeting?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Again, this is still a month away here. I can tell you what we\u2019re focused on, and that\u2019s -- the President is looking forward to this trip very much. And again, he talked last night about why this will be a memorable, moving, important trip for him, and it has nothing to do with <person><nameText>President Putin. </nameText></person>It has everything to do with a generation of Americans and allies who liberated a continent and did so at great risk to themselves. And that\u2019s what the President will be doing when he\u2019s traveling to Normandy. It will be an opportunity for him to pay tribute to that brave generation.</p><p>Q Josh, had the White House expected Putin to go all along, or was this a surprise?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I mean, if you consider that Russian soldiers were fighting on the same side as American soldiers in that battle, it shouldn\u2019t be a remarkable surprise that the President of Russia would attend and commemorate these events. But I don\u2019t know that there was any advance notice of <person><nameText>President Putin</nameText></person>\u2019s plans.</p><p>Q Josh, every day we see more of an outpouring of concern from Americans, and including on Capitol Hill, about kidnappings in Nigeria. Are you going to change any plans to increase the American presence there and put actual people on the ground, in the bush, looking for these children?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that military assistance that we\u2019ve talked about providing over the last couple of days will primarily be in an advisory role. So I would not contemplate a deployment of troops to begin an active military operation. But there are military resources that can be brought to bear; there\u2019s some law enforcement expertise and resources that can be brought to bear to assist the Nigerian government in their efforts to find these girls.</p><p>The President has made clear that he thinks that\u2019s a priority and that there are resources the United States can provide. There are also resources that other countries who are similarly outraged by what has taken place there, who have also committed to providing some assistance to the Nigerian government. </p><p>So we\u2019re going to continue to work closely with the Nigerian government to support their efforts. We\u2019re going to coordinate those efforts with the international community. The Department of Defense may be able to provide you some additional details about the resources that will be provided and the timeframe in which those resources will arrive in Nigeria. But there is a core interagency group in the American embassy in Nigeria that\u2019s already hard at work on this.</p><p>Q There wouldn\u2019t be special operations units or anything like that that would be actually involved in the searches?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Right, again, we\u2019re not contemplating at this point an active military operation. We\u2019re contemplating military assistance that could be provided that would advise the Nigerian government as they work to find these girls.</p><p>Q Josh, on that, Boko Haram wasn\u2019t designated a terrorist organization until November of last fall. The President this week used stronger language saying that we\u2019ve already identified them as one of the worst terrorist organizations out there. So is there a disconnect with why it took longer, a couple years to actually label them that? And did that hinder our ability to fight them harder earlier before this happened?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I\u2019d point out that a number of Boko Haram leaders were designated nearly two years ago for sanctions because of their actions in that country. There\u2019s also been a wide range of military assistance that we\u2019ve been providing for some time to the Nigerians. We\u2019ve provided a great deal of assistance to help the Nigerians professionalize their military, improve their counter-IED capacity, and carry out responsible counterterrorism operations. Many of those operations were targeted against Boko Haram.</p><p>So there is an enduring military-to-military relationship between the United States and Nigeria to assist the Nigerian government in fighting the brutal actions of Boko Haram. And that is a reflection of this President\u2019s commitment to rooting out those kind of terroristic groups. </p><p>Q In a new publication, Josh, the North Korean government uses very insulting terms to refer to <person><nameText>President Obama. </nameText></person>Are you all familiar with this? And do you have a response to it?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I have to be honest, I have not seen that this morning. If you want to check with my colleagues at the NSC back in Washington they may be able to get you a response.</p><p>Q A House panel this morning issued subpoenas for VA correspondence related to the Phoenix VA hospital. Josh [sic] said the other day that the President has full confidence in the VA Secretary. Has anything changed on that, given the developments of the past couple days?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: The President continues to have complete confidence in Secretary Shinseki. I\u2019d point out the Secretary himself is somebody who has bravely served this country and he\u2019s a West Point graduate and somebody who is obviously also a veteran. Secretary Shinseki is hard at work and shares the President\u2019s passion and commitment for making sure that we live up to the commitments that have been made by this country to our veterans. And that is something that is a top priority of the President\u2019s, and he has full confidence in Secretary Shinseki as he takes on the daunting task of making good on so many of those commitments.</p><p>I would say -- point out a couple of other things. The VA did announce in the last couple of days that there were some personnel actions that were taken at the Phoenix VA facility while there\u2019s an ongoing investigation into what\u2019s actually happed there. I\u2019d refer you to the VA for the details of those actions. </p><p>I know that there\u2019s also been tremendous progress that\u2019s been made by the VA in reducing the claims backlog -- that that backlog has fallen tremendously. But there\u2019s a lot more work to be done. We\u2019re not going to be satisfied until that backlog has been eliminated, and we\u2019ve got quite a bit of work to do before that\u2019s happened. But we have turned that tide. It\u2019s moving in the right direction. And that\u2019s a testament to the efforts of a lot of people across the administration, including Secretary Shinseki.</p><p>Q Josh, talk on the Hill by Democrats of boycotting the select committee on Benghazi. Does the White House support or encourage a boycott like that?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I think we\u2019ve said for the past couple of days, Jim, that we defer to Leader Pelosi and the Democrats in the House of Representatives to make a decision about the best way to participate or not participate in that endeavor.</p><p>Q Quick question on sequestration. There's a new report that basically says despite doomsday warnings from the White House and lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats saying how many cuts there were going to be, that there was only one job cut among 23 federal agencies. Senator Coburn is trying to find out more from Burwell just why the predictions were so off. Any White House input on that? I mean, I think the administration had said there were going to be hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I would point out that if you look at the -- I think it\u2019s a CBO report concluded that if the sequester for 2014 had not been implemented, an additional 800,000 jobs in the private sector -- or in the American economy would have been created, and that would have added six-tenths of a point to GDP.</p><p>So there is some independent data out there to indicate that there was a terrible toll, or at least -- maybe a \u201cterrible toll\u201d might be a slight overstatement, but a tangible negative impact on our economy sustained as a result of the sequester. And again, you don\u2019t have to take my word for it; I think these are CBO numbers.</p><p>I believe the CBO also found that there were 750,000 federal workers who had to take a pay cut as a result of the sequester. And as you pointed out in your question, that there were both Democrats and Republicans who were warning about the negative consequences of the sequester and the impact it could have on our economy. </p><p>So the President, for all those reasons and more, put forward his own plan for dealing with the sequester, repealing the sequester, and doing actually even more to reduce our deficit in a balanced way. </p><p>Q I mean, it does appear, though, that it wasn\u2019t at least for federal agencies, wasn\u2019t as bad as people were predicting. So any reaction to that?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that\u2019s according to one report. I\u2019m not sure that everybody agrees with those conclusions. And I would point out that even that report did indicate that there was a tangible impact on customer service. The ability of the federal government to serve the taxpayers, to serve the citizens of this country was negatively affected by the sequester.</p><p>So if there\u2019s somebody who wants to go out there and make the case that the sequester was not that bad and is good policy, they\u2019re welcome to do that, but I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re going to convince many people of it.</p><p>Q I have two questions about the President\u2019s campaign remarks last night. He referred to Congresswoman, or Representative Leader Pelosi as the future Speaker of the House. Does he actually believe that Democrats are going to win the House this year? I know, obviously, always in campaigns he\u2019d say that. Does he actually believe there\u2019s more than a marginal chance Democrats win the House?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Absolutely. He believes that --</p><p>Q What gives him that belief? Because all the models and polling shows it's very, very unlikely.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Let me answer that question two ways. The first is that if you look at those polls and evaluate where the American public is on a whole range of issues that are priorities to the American people, and on issue after issue either a plurality or a majority of Americans side with Democrats. The issues are on the side of Democrats in this election.</p><p>The challenge that we face is, as the President has talked about in sometimes colorful terms, is motivating those voters to show up at the polls in the midterm elections. We've had great success in convincing those voters to participate in elections when the President\u2019s name is at the top of the ballot. And the President is engaged in an effort in making sure that the American people understand that even though the President\u2019s name is not at the top of the ballot, that the stakes of this election are very high, that there are consequences, as the President said last night, for the President\u2019s agenda in Congress if Republicans remain in the majority in the House and take over a majority in the Senate.</p><p>So the stakes are high, and we're going -- the President is very committed to doing what he can to support Democrats and to make the case to the American public that they should get involved in the election and that they should vote based on the priorities that the President has identified and are shared by a majority of voters all across the country.</p><p>Q Just one more question about them. He seemed to suggest last night that the consequences of losing an election are not beyond just policies not being enacted, but sort of a growing cynicism about government and people believing that Congress can't do anything and split government and so forth. Can you talk a little bit about that? It was sort of near the end of his remarks.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I think that he was -- that that cycle that he was talking about had less to do with elections and more about the governing process. I wouldn't want to parse his remarks too much, but I do think that there is a sense that the gridlock and dysfunction that you all have covered extensively in Washington has led to some pessimism in some corners of the country about the law-making process in Washington. And if you are pessimistic about that process and pessimistic that decisions are being made for the right reasons in your nation\u2019s capital, it might make you less likely to participate in the process.</p><p>The President believes strongly that regardless of who you're going to vote for, that the country is stronger when people show up and cast a ballot and people get engaged in the governing of their country. The President gave a very persuasive speech about citizenship during commencement exercises at the University of Michigan early in his first term where he talked about this -- about how if we're going to be good citizens of this country it's going to require us to sort of get outside of our comfort zone, to consider alternate points of view, to be engaged in the debates that are so important to the future of our country. And some of that engagement also includes following and participating in elections.</p><p>So I'm confident the President will have more to say about this as Election Day gets closer, as he continues to travel across the country in support of Democratic candidates, something that he will do. I guess I'm also confident that he'll be somewhat more eloquent in describing these thoughts than I just was.</p><p>Q He also raised the concerns about 2016, the focus being too early on that. How big a concern is that, that people are already looking toward the next presidential election?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Yes, I think the President has described this phenomenon in our party that voters who tend to support Democrats often consider presidential elections to be more \u201csexy,\u201d I think the President -- is how I think the President described their view of presidential elections. And part of the challenge that Democrats will face -- and the President is going to be supportive of Democrats in making this argument -- midterm elections have a significant impact on the future of our country, and the outcome of this midterm election could have a very important impact on the ability of this President and Democrats in Congress moving on an agenda that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p>As the President laid out last night, there\u2019s a very clear difference between the priorities that Democrats have identified and the priorities that Republicans have identified. And I think the easiest way to describe that is to point out that Democrats, whether it's equal pay legislation, expanding access to quality retirement programs, raising the minimum wage, are committed to an economic portfolio that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p>And if you look at the Republican offerings, to the extent that they talk about them -- they don't talk about them very often -- but when they do talk about them, it's mostly about expanding opportunity for those at the top, often at the expense of everybody else. </p><p>There is a very clear difference in the approach that both sides take. I mean, what Republicans say is that those benefits, if they\u2019re targeted to folks at the top, will eventually spread to everybody else. The President believes that that\u2019s not the right way to grow our economy, that the right way to grow our economy is from the middle out. This was the focus of a lot of debate during the reelection campaign in 2012. That debate is ongoing and will be an important part of the choice that voters have to make in the midterm elections, too.</p><p>Q In the last speech, what point was he trying to make when he was talking about his powers seem to be limited in some way?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: A couple of people who saw the speech interpreted it quite a bit differently than I did. And so I actually want to pull up here what I thought was the key part of what the President had to say, if you\u2019ll bear with me just one second. <br/>Near the end of his remarks, the President said, \u201cNone of the tragedies that we see today may rise to the full horror of the Holocaust. The individuals who are victims of such unspeakable cruelty, they make a claim on our conscience. They demand our attention, that we not turn away, that we choose empathy over indifference and that our empathy leads to action. And that\u2019s not always easy. And one of the powerful things about Schindler\u2019s story was recognizing that we have to act, even when there is sometimes ambiguity; even when the path is not always clearly lit, we have to try.\u201d</p><p>And I think that was a powerful expression of the President\u2019s determination to use the resources of the United States as a force for good in the world. And that is a President who in a variety of ways has taken a leadership role in the international community, to not just mobilize the resources of the United States, but to mobilize the resources of the international community, of other freedom-loving nations, to make the world a better place -- to combat evil, to confront forces that seek to prey on vulnerable populations. </p><p>And so whether that is leading an international effort to stand up for the right of the people in Ukraine to determine the future of their country or to be part of an international coalition to track down a couple hundred girls in Nigeria who have been abducted, the President is committed to using his time in office to stand up for the values that we in this country hold so dear -- to use our resources to do that in places all around the world; to use our resources to do that in communities here in this country where sometimes those outcomes aren\u2019t clear; but also, to take advantage of the opportunity that the United States is the preeminent leader in the world, and to mobilize international opinion in other like-minded countries in pursuit of these laudable goals and in defense of these values.</p><p>Q But he also seemed to suggest that some successes are incremental. I mean, the part you didn\u2019t read was, \u201cI have this remarkable title right now -- President of the United States -- and yet every day when I wake up and I think about young girls in Nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in Syria -- when there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids -- and having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment, I think, \u2018drop by drop [by drop],\u2019 that we can erode and wear down these forces that are so destructive.\u201d<br/>So it seems that he was acknowledging a certain limitation to what it is that he or anybody in his position can do. Is that right?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the point that he\u2019s trying to make. I think the point that he is trying to make is that at times it can seem like there\u2019s a lot of evil in the world, that there are a lot of bad things happening, and that every morning you\u2019re waking up and there\u2019s a new thing that\u2019s coming across the television screen that seems shocking in a modern 21st century world. And I think what you saw in those remarks is a resolute determination to act, and that even when the answers aren\u2019t easy and even when they aren\u2019t clear, that the President believes that in a very -- that the United States has a special responsibility as the preeminent leader in the world to stand up for the rights and wellbeing of 200 little girls who have been kidnapped in Nigeria.</p><p>Now, it doesn\u2019t mean that we can or should take over the search, deploy military resources and track them down. This is an autonomous government. But what we can do is look for the ways that we can leverage the resources and expertise and experience that we have in this country to benefit the Nigerian government to track those girls down. And just because he didn\u2019t wake up the next morning and read in the newspapers that those girls have been found, it doesn\u2019t mean that we should stop or give up. It means that the President remains determined every single morning when he wakes up to continue to advance the goal of a freer, a fairer world that better reflects the kinds of values that this country was founded upon.</p><p>Q Josh, the President is fundraising in Silicon Valley later today, two big fundraisers there. This is an industry that has taken issue with -- on cybersecurity policies. I believe 100 big tech firms have written to the FCC complaining about the net neutrality regulations that might be forthcoming. They\u2019ve been active on the immigration front. With the amount of money that\u2019s concentrated in Silicon Valley and in raising money by Democrats, why shouldn\u2019t the public think that perhaps they have some leverage on these issues that others might not?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I mean, your suggestion is that maybe the tech committee -- or the tech community has inordinate amount of influence in Washington, D.C. because they can make large campaign contributions?</p><p>Q Yes, and because they have an interest in prominent issues.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I think my answer to this would be the same, regardless of which industry you would ask me about, which is that I think the reason that the President enjoys quite a bit of success in raising money on behalf of Democrats is because there are a lot of people in a variety of industries all across the country who are very supportive of what the President is trying to do in Washington, D.C. They\u2019re supportive of his efforts to -- whether it\u2019s an issue like immigration reform to try to find a commonsense path forward in a bipartisan fashion. We\u2019ve talked extensively about what kinds of economic benefits that would bring to the country. So it\u2019s not a big surprise that the tech community in particular would be strongly supportive of that.</p><p>I think that, to go back to somebody\u2019s earlier question, I think the thing that breeds a lot of cynicism about the political process are those outside groups that don\u2019t disclose their donors, that have a very narrow agenda that\u2019s focused on something other than the broad interests of the country. </p><p>So, again, it\u2019s hard for me to sort of assess the position taken by individual participants in today\u2019s fundraising events, but I think speaking generally that they are supportive of what the President is trying to do to expand economic opportunity for everybody.</p><p>Q Can I ask a sort of version of Jim\u2019s question, which is, isn\u2019t it a little bit of a conflict of interest for the President to go to these tech CEOs and so forth, and solicit money from them -- which he is doing for his party -- at the same time his administration is engaged in very high-profile, very controversial, very sensitive negotiations over data, over privacy? It seems like it\u2019s a bit of a mix. I mean, can he go there and solicit money when he\u2019s also in a very big policymaking process around their industry?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Yes, he can. And there\u2019s no reason to think that that policymaking process is affected by the political activities of those who are involved. There\u2019s no question that there are a wide range of issues that the tech community is interested in; they can speak to them better than I can. But there are a couple of issues related to the FCC that the tech community is very interested in right now. The FCC is a completely independent body, and they\u2019ll be making those regulatory decisions based solely on the merits without any political influence. </p><p>Other than that, I think that the reason that many of these tech leaders are supportive of the President and Democrats in Congress is because they approve of the President\u2019s ongoing efforts to put in place policies that will expand opportunity for everybody. There\u2019s a role for technology to play in expanding opportunity for everybody, giving more people all across the country access to information and knowledge that\u2019s good for the economy. Immigration reform is a great example of this, even fairer tax policies. So there\u2019s a wide range of reasons. </p><p>And I guess what I\u2019d encourage you to do is to talk to some of these tech leaders about why it is they\u2019re participating in the fundraisers, why it is they\u2019re in support of the President and Democrats in Congress. And I think what you\u2019ll find is they\u2019re broadly supportive of the President\u2019s agenda and of the agenda that Democrats are trying to move through the Congress. </p><p>Q Real quick, on the IRS situation and Lois Lerner, everything going on on Capitol Hill -- the President denounced the IRS actions obviously when everything came to light about it. How does the White House feel? Is this too much what\u2019s happening on Capitol Hill? Is it enough that has been done? Should she have talked more? Just all the process going on up there, any reaction to that now?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Not really. Ms. Lerner is no longer an employee of the federal government, so I don\u2019t really have a reaction to the latest congressional votes or activities up there as it relates to her case.</p><p>For more information please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov\">http://www.whitehouse.gov</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-UON285191</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5C5T-MJ51-DXCW-D24D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4300\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>May 10, 2014 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 230, I call up the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 34) providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission relating to ``Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services'', and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. </p><p>The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 230, the joint resolution is considered read. The text of the joint resolution is as follows: S.J. Res. 34 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission relating to ``Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services'' (81 Fed. Reg. 87274 (December 2, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force or effect. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The joint resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. The gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle) each will control 30 minutes. General Leave Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on S.J. Res. 34. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in support of S.J. Res. 34, which disapproves of the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission relating to protecting the privacy of customers of broadband and other telecommunication services. I applaud Senator Flake's work on this issue, as S.J. Res. 34 was passed by the Senate last week. I also filed a companion resolution in the House. The FCC finalized its broadband privacy rules on October 27, 2016. At that time, they assured us that the rules would provide broadband customers meaningful choice, greater transparency, and stronger security protections for their personal information collected by internet service providers, but the reality is much different. There are three specific problems with which the FCC has gone about these rules. First, the FCC unilaterally swiped jurisdiction from the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC has served as our Nation's sole online privacy regulator for over 20 years. Second, having two privacy cops on the beat will create confusion within the internet ecosystem and will end up harming consumers. Third, the FCC already has authority to enforce privacy obligations of broadband service providers on a case-by-case basis. These broadband privacy rules are unnecessary and are just another example of Big Government overreach. The Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that Federal regulations cost our economy $1.9 trillion in 2015. Since President Trump took office, Republicans have been working diligently to loosen the regulatory environment that is suffocating hardworking taxpayers. Here is what multiple House Democrats said in a letter to the FCC last May regarding the FCC's privacy rules: The rulemaking intends to go well beyond the traditional framework that has guarded consumers from data practices of internet service providers and ill-served consumers who seek and expect consistency in how their personal data is protected. Further, FTC Commissioner Joshua Wright testified before Congress that the FTC has unique experience in enforcing broadband service providers' obligations to protect the privacy and security of consumer data. He added that the rules will actually do less to protect consumers by depriving the FTC of its longstanding jurisdiction in the area. Once again, these rules hurt consumers. Incredibly, former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler referred to the internet as the most powerful and pervasive network in the history of the planet before these rules were even created. I found this really odd because it implied that the FTC regulation had indeed been successful and ought to continue, ultimately undermining his own rationale for additional FCC privacy regulation. Now, there are a couple of myths that are going around that I want to take the time to dispel. Our friends claim there will be a gap for ISPs in the FCC privacy rules when they are overturned. This simply is false, and let me tell you why. The FCC already has the authority to enforce the privacy obligations of broadband service providers on a case-by-case basis. Pursuant to section 201 of the Communications Act, they can police practices of the ISPs that are unjust or unreasonable. Sections 202 and 222 also protect consumers. It is already in statute. So I encourage my friends to read title II of the Communications Act. Also, the State attorneys general have the ability to go after companies for unfair and deceptive practices. Third, litigation is another avenue consumers can pursue against ISPs for mishandling personal data. Service providers have privacy policies. If they violate the policy, guess what? They can be sued. I know Democrats will certainly understand that, as they have many trial lawyer friends, and I urge them to speak to the trial bar. Fourth, the free market is another great equalizer. Can you imagine the embarrassment for an ISP that is caught unlawfully selling data? We have all seen the economic fallout from something such as a data breach. Companies have a financial incentive to handle your personal data properly because to do otherwise would significantly impair their financial standing. [[Page H2490]] To my Democrat friends across the aisle, the bottom line is this: the only gap that exists is in these arguments that you have made. Consumer privacy is something we all want to protect, and consumer privacy will continue to be protected and will actually be enhanced by removing the uncertainty and confusion these rules will create, as the Democrats Rush, Schrader, and Green indicated in a letter to the FCC last May. I also want to speak, for just a moment, on the edge providers because there has been some question about who has visibility into your data. Clinton administration veteran privacy expert Peter Swire offered a report in February 2016 titled ``Online Privacy in ISPs.'' ISP's access to consumer data is limited and often less than access to others. Swire found that ISPs have less visibility into consumer behavior online than search, social media, advertising, and big tech companies. Swire's study found that, as a result of advancing technologies, the rise of encryption, and the various ways and locations individuals access the internet, ISPs now have increasingly limited insight into our activities and information online. By contrast, however, so-called edge providers, like search engines, social media, advertising, shopping, and other services online, often have greater visibility into personal consumer data. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to S.J. Res. 34. Today, colleagues, we are waist deep in the swamp. The American people did not ask for this resolution. In fact, no company will even put its name behind this effort. Instead, this resolution is the result of an explicit written request from Washington lobbyists. These lobbyists make the bogus claim that having actual protections will confuse consumers and the only way to help clear up this information is to have no rules at all. No consumer has come forward to support this position. No consumer has said this argument even makes sense. I challenge every Member of this body at your next townhall meeting to have a show of hands of how many people think it is a good idea to allow your internet service provider to sell their personal information without their permission. {time} 1600 Then after you get that show of hands, ask them how many of them would vote for you if you support allowing corporations to do that. This resolution is of the swamp and for the swamp and no one else. The rules of this resolution would overturn rules that are simple and make common sense. They don't require much, only three things: One, internet service providers should ask permission before selling your private internet browsing history, app usage, or other sensitive information; Two, once they have your information, internet service providers should take reasonable measures to protect it; and Finally, if the information gets stolen, the company should quickly let you know. That is it. That is all that is being asked of them. These modest rules don't stop internet service providers from using data for advertising and profiling or whatever else so long as they ask first. ISPs have an obligation under these rules not to dive into the personal lives of Americans unless that is what those Americans want. They just need to ask first. This is particularly true because broadband providers see literally everything you do online, every website you visit, every app, every device, every time. By analyzing your internet usage and browsing history, these companies will know more about you than members of your own family, more than you tell your doctor, more than you know about yourself. Without these rules, these companies don't have to ask before selling all of that information, and they don't have to take reasonable measures to protect that information when they collect it. Make no mistake about this, colleagues: Anyone who votes for this bill is telling your constituents that they no longer have the freedom to decide how to control their own information. You have given that freedom away to big corporations. More importantly, there aren't rules to fall back on if Congress scraps these. Critics of the rules argue that the Federal Trade Commission should oversee the privacy protection for broadband providers, but, under current law, they have no authority to do so, and the CRA won't do a thing to fix that. Under a Federal court of appeals case, the FTC has no authority over mobile broadband providers at all. And to those that say the FCC can evaluate complaints on a case-by- case basis using its statutory authority, the current Chairman--your current Chairman--stated that section 222 cannot be used to protect personal information and that rules are necessary to enforce this statute. Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a statement by the FCC Commissioner. Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Ajit Pai Re TerraCom, Inc. and YourTel America, Inc., Apparent Liability for Forfeiture, File No. EB-TCD-13-00009175. A core principle of the American legal system is due process. The government cannot sanction you for violating the law unless it has told you what the law is. In the regulatory context, due process is protected, in part, through the fair warning rule. Specifically, the D.C. Circuit has stated that ``[i]n the absence of notice--for example, where the regulation is not sufficiently clear to warn a party about what is expected of it--an agency may not deprive a party of property.'' Thus, an agency cannot at once invent and enforce a legal obligation. Yet this is precisely what has happened here. In this case, there is no pre-existing legal obligation to protect personally identifiable information (also known as PII) or notify customers of a PII data breach to enforce. The Commission has never interpreted the Communications Act to impose an enforceable duty on carriers to ``employ reasonable data security practices to protect'' PII. The Commission has never expounded a duty that carriers notify all consumers of a data breach of PII. The Commission has never adopted rules regarding the misappropriation, breach, or unlawful disclosure of PII. The Commission never identifies in the entire Notice of Apparent Liability a single rule that has been violated. Nevertheless, the Commission asserts that these companies violated novel legal interpretations and never-adopted rules. And it seeks to impose a substantial financial penalty. In so doing, the Commission runs afoul of the fair warning rule. I cannot support such ``sentence first, verdict afterward'' decision-making. To the extent that the circumstances giving rise to today's item merited the Commission's attention, there was a better (and lawful) path forward. We could have opened a notice-and- comment rulemaking. This process would have given the public an opportunity to speak. And in turn, the agency would have had a chance to formulate clear, well-considered rules--rules we then could have enforced against anyone who violated them. Instead, the Commission proposes a forfeiture today that, if actually imposed, has little chance of surviving judicial review. One more thing. The Commission asserts that the base forfeiture for these violations is nine billion dollars-- that's $9,000,000,000--which is by far the biggest in our history. It strains credulity to think that Congress intended such massive potential liability for ``telecommunications carriers'' but not retailers or banks or insurance companies or tech companies or cable operators or any of the myriad other businesses that possess consumers' PII. Nor can I understand how such liability can be squared with the Enforcement Bureau's recent consent decrees with these companies. Under those consent decrees, the companies paid the Treasury $440,000 and $160,000 for flouting our actual rules and draining the Universal Service Fund by seeking Lifeline support multiple times for the same customer. Consumer protection is a critical component of the agency's charge to promote the public interest. But any enforcement action we take in that regard must comport with the law. For the reasons stated above, I dissent. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Without these protections, there will be no clear rules of the road. At a time when foreign actors like the Russians, the Chinese, and everyone else under the sun are constantly trying to steal our data and compromise our security, it would be irresponsible to roll back the only Federal safeguards we have. I want my colleagues to think long and hard before you give corporations the ability to sell your information without their permission. Mr. Speaker, I include several articles in the Record by Free Press and the Open Technology Institute opposing the CRA, an op-ed from a current [[Page H2491]] FTC Commissioner opposing this CRA, and a memorandum from engineers at EFF opposing this CRA. [From Free Press, May 10, 2016] Pay-for-Privacy Schemes Put the Most Vulnerable Americans at Risk (By Sandra Fulton) The FCC has opened a proceeding on the rules and policies surrounding privacy rights for broadband service. One industry practice called into question in that proceeding could have a devastating impact on our most vulnerable populations. Internet service providers charge broadband customers a ton for Internet access. ISPs are increasingly finding new revenue streams too, by taking part in the multibillion- dollar market that's evolved out of selling users' personal information to online marketers. As the debate around privacy has heated up, ISPs have tried to placate the public's growing interest in privacy protections while maintaining revenues they can get when they auction off their customers' valuable personal information. One proposed solution that AT&amp;T has largely ``pioneered''? Have customers pay to preserve their privacy. The potential harms and discriminatory implications of this practice are obvious. It could mean that only people with the necessary financial means could protect their privacy and prevent their ISPs from sharing their personal information with predatory online marketers. The FCC rulemaking proceeding seeks comments on whether to allow such ``financial inducements'' for the surrender of private information. If the agency decides not to ban such practices outright, it wants to know how it should regulate them. As our lives have moved online, ISPs have gained access to our most sensitive personal information. Advanced technologies allow companies to track us invisibly, collecting and selling data on nearly every detail of what we do online. But ISPs don't just stop at knowing what we're doing. The location tracking that's needed to provide mobile service to our phones lets the ISPs know when and where we do it too. And they can figure out the people and organizations we associate with by looking at who we talk to and which websites we visit. As ISPs track their customers, they create comprehensive dossiers containing sensitive information on each person's finances, health, age, race, religion and ethnicity. Their reach is so pervasive that information like a visit to a website discussing mental health, a search on how to collect unemployment benefits, or a visit to a church or Planned Parenthood office could be swept up into their databases. How do you feel about your ISP selling such a personal glimpse into your life to online advertisers? Under a pay- for-privacy scheme, you wouldn't need to worry about it so long as you could afford to shell out the hush money. But those who aren't so fortunate would have to relinquish any control over how their personal data is spread across the Web. The FCC raised concerns about this dynamic when it launched its rulemaking proceeding, noting that such pay-for-privacy practices might disadvantage low-income people and members of other vulnerable communities. But it didn't make any specific recommendations or issue any proposals on how to regulate in this space. Long before the FCC launched this inquiry at the end of March 2016, and even before the agency had clarified its authority to protect broadband users in the February 2015 Open Internet Order, AT&amp;T's GigaPower broadband service had become one of the first pay-for-privacy plans on the market. The AT&amp;T deal allows customers to opt out of some information sharing if they pay an extra $29 a month or more. For a struggling family, that could mean choosing between paying for privacy and paying for groceries or the public transportation needed to get to work. And while AT&amp;T might be the first to launch this kind of service, an article in Fortune notes that other companies are eager to roll out similar plans. Under pay-for-privacy models, consumers who are unable to pay the higher broadband cost will likely see their ISPs share their data with shadowy online data brokers who use this information to tailor marketing messages. While unregulated and unaccountable data brokers are a threat to everyone's privacy, they're notorious for targeting low- income communities, people of color and other vulnerable demographics. One particularly damning report from the Senate Commerce Committee offered this glimpse into how these brokers categorize and label these target audiences: The Senate committee's report notes, for example, that the ``Hard Times'' category includes people who are ``Older, down-scale and ethnically diverse singles typically concentrated in inner-city apartments.'' It continues: ``This is the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder, the poorest lifestyle segment in the nation. Hard Times are older singles in poor city neighborhoods. Nearly three-quarters of the adults are between the ages of 50 and 75; this is an underclass of the working poor and destitute seniors without family support . . .'' These classifications can influence not just what kinds of ads people see, but the interest rates they're offered or the insurance premiums they pay. These targeted communities are precisely the ones who can't pay extra to shield their personal information from these dangerous companies. There may be some argument that if big companies are going to profit from our data anyway, it's actually good if their customers get a share of that. The FCC's rulemaking proposal notes that brickand-mortar stores and websites alike offer all sorts of ``free'' services, discounts and perks in exchange for the data they mine from their customers and users. But the nature of the broadband market--where users have no real options when it comes to choosing their providers, and no way to opt out short of staying offline--makes the tradeoffs here especially worthy of attention. If users could get fair value for their data, and if they got a real discount on broadband and not just a privacy penalty, and if they were providing truly informed consent with full knowledge of all the pernicious uses data brokers have for their information, then maybe we could have a conversation about the fairness of such schemes. But those are some very big ifs. We need better transparency rules for marketers and easy- to-use disclosures and opt-in mechanisms before we get there. We also need strong baseline privacy protections guaranteed for all, including rules that prohibit ISPs from using discriminatory schemes that jeopardize the rights of their most vulnerable customers. We applaud the FCC for taking this crucial first step to protect privacy from broadband ISPs' overreach and abuse. As gatekeepers to the Internet, ISPs hold a wealth of information about their customers, and the Communications Act commands the FCC to establish strong safeguards for that private info. But the FCC also must also remember that our rights are not for sale--and that privacy is not a luxury for the wealthy. ____ ISPs Know All you deserve more privacy from your broadband provider (By Eric Null) As you read this post, your internet service provider is collecting information about you: what you're reading right now on Slate, what URL you go to next, what time of day it is, and whether you're on your home computer or your mobile device, among many other data points. Your ISP has similar data about apps you've used, how much data you consume at any given time of day, and your other daily internet habits and rhythms. Of course, your ISP has other up-to-date personal information as well--things like your name, address, telephone number, credit card number, and likely your Social Security number. In this way, ISPs have access to a uniquely detailed, comprehensive, and accurate view of you and every other subscriber. All of this at a time when consumer concern over privacy is increasing and has actually caused people to refrain from engaging in e-commerce and other activities online. To make matters worse, you are essentially powerless to limit the data your ISP collects about you. While you may, in some instances, defend yourself against tracking by websites and apps by disallowing cookies or turning on ``Do Not Track'' in your browser settings, in many cases there is no way to protect against ISP tracking except by avoiding the internet altogether. While there are some tools that can help consumers protect themselves, they are not prevalent. For example, ISPs cannot see full website addresses when that site uses encryption-- denoted by a small lock icon in your browser bar. However, the website--not you--decides whether it will use encryption. And while Netflix traffic is encrypted (so your ISP only knows you're watching videos, not specifically which ones you're watching), WebMD traffic is not (so your ISP likely knows every page you've visited on WebMD), even though medical symptoms are clearly much more personal than your favorite TV program. Another example of ways consumers can purportedly protect themselves is through virtual private networks, or VPNs, which route web traffic through another network and therefore effectively ``hide'' the traffic from the person's ISP. But VPNs are difficult to use and configure. They often cost extra money, slow down your browsing, and simply send your data through some other access provider that may be collecting data about you, too. These options are not practical defenses for most consumers. Currently, there are no rules to prevent your ISP from using these data for almost any purpose, including categorizing you and serving you advertisements based on those categories. Targeted ads may even be based on whether you have (or the ISP has inferred you have) a certain disease or what your income level is. Recently, Cable One was found to be using predictive analytics to determine which of its customers were ``hollow'' (that is, had low credit scores) and then offering them low-quality customer service. Cable One technicians, the company's CEO stated, aren't going to ``spend 15 minutes setting up an iPhone app'' for someone with a low credit score. Of course, making decisions based on credit scores is going to disproportionately affect communities of color and other vulnerable populations. Additionally, the data ISPs collect, often compiled into a ``profile,'' might be sold to third parties (like advertisers or data brokers) and used and reused for purposes for which they were not initially collected--in ways that often annoy people, such as when personal information is used to send a ``barrage of unwanted [[Page H2492]] emails.'' And as the number of entities who hold your data increases, so too does the chance those data will be compromised by a leak or hack. So you may find yourself between a rock and a hard place: Use the internet and give up your privacy, or forego internet access entirely--something that's not exactly reasonable. But there is good news. The Federal Communications Commission is trying to make sure that you and all other ISP customers don't have to confront this choice. In 2015, as part of decision to uphold net neutrality, the FCC ruled that ISPs are ``common carriers.'' (The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit recently upheld that ruling.) Since then, the FCC has had a statutory obligation to protect the data ISPs collect about their customers. To accomplish that, the FCC recently proposed a new rule that would require ISPs, in most cases, to seek opt-in consent from customers before using data collected for purposes other than to provide service, such as to deliver certain kinds of ads or to sell to data brokers. That means that if the rule passes, your ISP would have to notify you of any new intended use of the data and give you the opportunity to say ``yes, that is OK with me'' or ``no, that is not OK with me.'' Of key importance in this rule is that if you said ``no,'' your ISP couldn't just refuse to serve you--it would have to respect your wishes and still provide you with service. The FCC's proposal should be enacted, because you should not have to trade your privacy to access the internet. (New America's Open Technology Institute, where I work, has been actively engaged on this issue and has submitted comments in the record. New America is a partner with Slate and Arizona State University in Future Tense.) It should go without saying, but it's important enough that I will say it anyway: Internet access is imperative for personal and professional success in today's digital world. Yet to gain access to the most important tool of the 21st century, you have to allow your ISP access to incredibly rich and private information about what you do online. You should get to control what it does with that data. Consumers deserve real choice when it comes to protecting their data, and the opt-in regime proposed by the FCC is a huge step in the right direction. Yet--perhaps unsurprisingly--ISPs and several House committees have responded to the FCC's proposal as if the sky is falling. They have mounted an all-out assault on the idea that you should have the right to choose how ISPs use your data. Their arguments range from the highly dubious (the proposal exceeds the FCC's authority) to the downright silly (consumers will be confused by having different privacy rules for ISPs as compared with other companies, like search engines and social networks). Chances are your ISP is telling the FCC that you don't need protections against exploitation of your data. (If you're interested, you can see exactly what your ISP is saying--here are the responses from AT&amp;T, Comcast, CenturyLink, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Sprint; unnamed ISPs may be represented by various trade associations like the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and CTIA for wireless.) However, as with the net neutrality debate that led to this proposal, consumers may feel differently. The FCC has proposed a very strong rule that will help protect ISP customers from exploitative uses of their data. This battle for consumer choice will be ongoing for many months, but soon, you may finally be able to choose both having internet access and protecting your privacy. ____ Electronic Frontier Foundation, San Francisco, CA. Five Ways Americans' Cybersecurity Will Suffer If Congress Repeals the FCC Privacy Rules If the House votes to repeal the FCC's recent privacy rules, Americans' cybersecurity will be put at risk. That's because privacy and security are two sides of the same coin: privacy is about controlling who has access to information about you, and security is how you maintain that control. You usually can't break one without breaking the other, and that's especially true in this context. To show how, here are five ways repealing the FCC's privacy rules will weaken Americans' cybersecurity. 1. Internet providers will record our browsing history, and the systems they use to record that information (not to mention the information itself) will become very tempting targets for hackers. (Just imagine what would happen if a foreign hacker thought she could blackmail a politician or a celebrity based on their browsing history.) 2. In order to record encrypted browsing history (i.e. https websites), Internet providers will start deploying systems that remove the encryption so they can inspect the data. Although US-CERT (part of DHS) just put out an alert saying that this is extremely dangerous for Americans' cybersecurity, FCC Chairman Pai just decided not to enforce rules that keep Internet providers from doing this. 3. Internet providers will insert ads into our browsing, but that could break the existing code on webpages. That means security features might be broken, which could expose Americans to a greater risk of attack. 4. Internet providers will insert tracking tags into our browsing--and that means every website will be able to track you, not just your Internet provider, and there's nothing you can do to stop them. 5. Internet providers will pre-install software to record information directly from our mobile phones (after all, it's just one more source of information they can monetize). But if the software that does that recording has bugs or vulnerabilities, hackers could break into that software, and then access everything the Internet provider could see. Do you trust your Internet provider, which can't even keep an appointment to fix your cable, to write completely bug-free software? The net result is simple: repealing the FCC's privacy rules won't just be a disaster for Americans' privacy. It will be a disaster for America's cybersecurity, too. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rogers of Kentucky). The gentleman is reminded to address his remarks to the Chair. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I will remind my colleagues across the aisle that, again, section 222 of the Communications Act covers the authority that the FCC needs. Traditionally, online privacy has been handled by the FTC. That is an authority that we have designated to them. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their good work on this legislation. As we increasingly rely on technology in nearly every area of our lives, one of Congress' most important responsibilities is to strike the right balance between protecting consumers' privacy while also allowing for private sector innovation and the new jobs and economic growth that accompany it. The resolution before us today reverses overreaching, shortsighted, and misguided rules adopted by unelected bureaucrats at the Federal Communications Commission. These rules do little to enhance privacy, but clearly add a new layer of Federal red tape on innovators and job creators. This is exactly the type of government overreach that the Congressional Review Act was meant to stop. The Federal Communications Commission, frankly, overstepped its bounds on many issues during the Obama administration, including privacy regulations. After stripping the Federal Trade Commission of its authority over the privacy practices of internet service providers, ISPs, the FCC adopted shortsighted rules that only apply to one part of the internet. Despite the FTC's proven case-by-case approach to privacy enforcement that, frankly, has protected consumers, while simultaneously allowing ISPs to innovate, the FCC opted to abandon this model in favor of an approach that assumes the Federal Government knows best what consumers want. Simply put, the rules that the FCC applied to ISPs are illogical. The regulations would require companies to apply the same privacy protections to consumer data, regardless of its importance or sensitivity. It hardly makes sense to treat a local weather update and personal financial information the same way. In addition, the FCC's approach only protects consumer data as far as the internet service provider is involved. An entirely separate set of rules applies to providers of edge services. That means the giant search corporations, one of which controls up to 65 percent of your searches on the internet, don't live by the same set of privacy rules as your small town ISP. What America needs is one standard, across-the-internet ecosystem, and the Federal Trade Commission is the best place for that standard. The impact of these rigid regulations has the potential to stifle one of the most innovative sectors of our Nation's economy, and it is consumers who will suffer. These rules, which Congress will repeal, only lead to higher costs, less competition, and fewer service offerings. This approach is particularly burdensome for small businesses, which do not have hallways full of lawyers to navigate these tedious and unnecessary rules. The benefits of the FCC's privacy regulations are questionable, but the harms are certain, which is why I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. And once these rules are reversed, the FCC can turn back to working together with the FTC to ensure that our privacy framework allows the internet [[Page H2493]] to flourish while truly protecting consumers. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would remind my friends that, under current law, the FTC has no authority to regulate ISPs and that it was your Commissioner, your current FCC Commissioner, that said that they can't do it under section 222 also, which I have submitted for the record. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo). Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Doyle, for both his leadership and for yielding time to me. America, listen up today. There may not be that many people on the floor of the House, but this is a big one. This is really a big one. Congress is poised today to betray the American people on one of the issues they care the most about: their privacy--their privacy. Every single one of us cares about it, and so do the American people. I often say that every American has it in their DNA: Keep your mitts off my privacy, what I consider to be private. Now, the consequences of passing this resolution are clear. Broadband providers like AT&amp;T, Comcast, and others will be able to sell your personal information to the highest bidder without your permission, and no one will be able to protect you, not even the Federal Trade Commission that our friends on the other side of the aisle keep talking about. It is like open the door and there is no one there. That is what this thing creates. The Republicans are blowing a gaping hole in Federal privacy protections by barring the FCC from ever adopting similar protections in the future. So, if it is gone today, it is gone, period. The FCC rules are simple. They require broadband providers to get the permission of their customers--including all of us--before they can sell their web browsing history, their location information, and other sensitive data to third parties. The majority claims that we need to repeal these protections because they treat broadband providers differently than other online service providers, edge providers. Broadband providers are in the unique position of seeing everything we do on the internet. This is the reason, and it is reason enough, to put privacy protections in place; but it is also important to keep in mind that consumers, all of us, pay a high monthly fee to broadband providers, and they face serious barriers if they want to switch. If I want to switch, if you want to switch, you have to, many times, pay early termination fees. This is completely different from other online services that collect consumer data. Consumers don't pay to use search engines or social media applications like Google and Facebook. If they don't like Google's privacy policy, they can switch over to Bing without paying any fees. But consumers can't do this with broadband providers, and therein lies the difference. Last week, we heard the Republicans bemoan the lack of choice in the healthcare market. They should take a closer look at the state of the broadband market, particularly in rural America, where only 13 percent of consumers have access to more than one high-speed broadband provider. So the majority is telling Americans today, particularly those in rural areas, that they need to choose between their privacy and their access to the internet. If this resolution passes, people across the country will certainly not have both. This resolution is--excuse the phrase--repeal without replace. The Republicans have not put forward any privacy proposal at all to replace the FCC's rules, despite knowing that repealing these rules will leave a gap in the Federal protections. So the message to the American people is clear: Your privacy doesn't matter, and your web browsing history should be available to anyone who will pay the highest price for it. For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to stand up for privacy rights and oppose this joint resolution. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores), and I ask unanimous consent that he may control that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentlewoman for yielding the balance of her time to me. Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of the House companion to S.J.<br/><br/> Res. 34, I rise to strongly urge my colleagues to support the resolution before us today. Like all of my colleagues in the House, I care deeply about protecting the privacy of our constituents, but I cannot support the Federal Communications Commission's counterproductive rules that will actually harm consumers and stifle innovation. For 20 years, the Federal Trade Commission--or the FTC, as we call it, frequently--oversaw consumer privacy for the entire internet ecosystem: content providers, advertisers, and internet service providers, or ISPs. The FTC's privacy program focused on preserving sensitive consumer data and took the context of a consumer's relationship with businesses into consideration. The FTC's experience in implementing a wide range of rules and regulations has resulted in over 500 cases protecting consumer information, ensuring their privacy online. In a flawed political move, absent any finding, complaints, or investigations to determine whether broadband providers have violated consumers' privacy or that the FTC had failed at doing its job, the FCC proceeded with a partisan vote to target ISPs and to expand its regulatory footprint. After stripping the FTC of its authority over the privacy practices of internet service providers, the FCC subsequently adopted rules that would harm consumers and split the internet, creating an uneven playing field between service providers and content providers. Congress must fix this overreach so the new administration can create a comprehensive, consistent set of privacy protections. {time} 1615 Consumers expect their privacy to be protected the same way no matter what type of entity holds their data. Having two sets of requirements creates confusion for consumers and may jeopardize their confidence in the internet. Our internet economy has thrived under the privacy regime created by the FTC. Yet the FCC, under its previous Chairman, Tom Wheeler, wanted to undermine that success by bifurcating privacy protections to serve outside political interests, not the American consumer. By contrast, the FCC's approach did not base its requirements on consumers' preferences about sensitive information and to set opt-in and opt-out defaults. Accordingly, its overall approach was top-down, heavyhanded regulation in stark contrast to the FTC's greater reliance on markets and consumer preferences. The FCC's rule has a number of problematic issues: The first is that the opt-in/opt-out regime reduces consumer choice and would be detrimental to the survival of many businesses in this country. The second is that the FCC would have prohibited unforeseeable future uses of collected data regardless of what consumers actually preferred and businesses may need. Third, the FCC would also have unjustly applied its heavyhanded approach to broadband providers, treating them more harshly than other players in the internet ecosystem. In sum, the FCC's broadband privacy protection approach would have rejected free markets and ignored sound economics. Alternatively, the FTC private enforcement is market oriented and flexible and adaptable to changes in consumer preferences and markets. It also treats companies and players neutrally, fostering an environment of competition and innovation. This resolution rescinds the FCC's rule, but it does provide the FCC the opportunity to provide oversight more in line with the FTC, which has been successfully regulating online privacy for nearly two decades. This joint resolution does not lessen or impede privacy and data security standards that have already been established. We are simply restoring a more stable regulatory playing field to ensure that consistent, uniform privacy security standards are maintained to protect consumers and future innovation. Once Congress rejects these rules, the FCC can turn back to cooperating with [[Page H2494]] the FTC to ensure that both consumer privacy across all aspects of the internet is provided through vigorous enforcement and also that innovation is allowed to flourish. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would just remind my colleague, once again, that the FTC has no authority to regulate ISPs once this bill is implemented; and consumers will not be protected, and their current FCC Commissioner has stated that. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette). Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this resolution because it would remove consumers' right to control their online privacy and put it in the hands of corporations. Every time people go online, they create trails of data that have tremendous commercial value. This creates incentive for the ISPs to sell web history to a third party, be it an advocacy group, a for- profit company, or even a foreign government. Late last year, the FCC put Americans in charge of how ISPs use and share their consumer data. The FCC's rule also required that the ISPs engage in reasonable data security practices. Even if people believe that the FCC's rule went too far and should be modified, it is unclear how the FCC could move forward with such a plan given the constraints of the Congressional Review Act. Furthermore, as several people have mentioned, the FCC, which is charged with protecting consumers' privacy, does not even have the authority to oversee ISP practices. Given the number of data breaches in recent years at companies such as Yahoo, we should, frankly, be strengthening data retention requirements, not weakening them. At its core, S.J. Res. 34 weakens consumer protections today and makes them harder to implement in the future, which is why I urge my colleagues to oppose it. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson). Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, when the FCC reclassified the internet as a common carrier, utility-style service and adopted their rules regulating the use of consumer data by internet service providers, it represented a monumental shift in the way we view privacy. Instead of a uniform, technology-neutral standard that balanced data protection with consumer choice, internet users were stuck with a two- sided approach that causes confusion and dampens competition. There is one set of rules for service providers, and one set for the rest of the internet ecosystem. But how often do consumers really recognize the difference between where their data is accessed and where it is stored? Ultimately, consumers are actually harmed by the artificial sense of protection created by these rules. It is essential that we take steps to restore the time-tested framework embraced by the Federal Trade Commission. We have talked a lot about protecting consumer privacy and data, but I haven't heard a lot about allowing the consumer to decide how their information is used. Consumers deserve to have the autonomy to control their information and their internet experience. As Acting Chairman of the FTC Maureen Ohlhausen pointed out: The FTC approach reflects the fact that consumer privacy preferences differ greatly depending on the type of data and its use. There is widespread agreement that sensitive data, like financial or health information, should be strongly protected and opt-in appropriate. But what about other types of nonsensitive data? Let's not forget the ways that consumers benefit from allowing ISPs access to that kind of information. Consumers should retain the ability to make the decisions that make sense for them when it comes to how their nonsensitive data is used and obtain the discounts or lower prices that can result. This vote isn't about reducing the level of privacy protection for consumers; it is about an FCC decision that ignored the preferences of consumers in favor of a regulatory power grab. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. The FCC's privacy rules are an overreaching regulatory mess that create confusion and inconsistency for consumers, harm competition, and upend internet privacy as we know it. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, might I inquire as to how much time remains on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 19 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 11\\3/4\\ minutes remaining. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would remind my colleagues that, whether it is nonsensitive information or sensitive information, the ISP should ask for your permission to use it. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, nearly every day now, we hear about new ways our enemies are trying to steal Americans' information. Just a couple weeks ago, two Russian hackers were indicted for stealing personal information from millions of us. American consumers visit billions of internet destinations through a multitude of devices. Broadband providers potentially have access to every bit of data that flows from a consumer. The American people are rightfully concerned about companies selling their personal information, including sensitive information like their location, financial and health information, Social Security numbers, and information about their children. Late last year, the FCC took steps to protect every American citizen's data and privacy, and the rules were simple: first, broadband providers had to ask their customers before selling any data; second, the companies had to take reasonable measures to protect that data; and third, the companies had to let people know if their data was stolen. That was a good first step, Mr. Speaker. But Congress also has a role in protecting our data, and we should be working in a bipartisan fashion to discuss ways we can better protect the American people's data. Instead, the Republicans have decided to spend this time wiping out the few privacy safeguards that we already have. The FCC's cybersecurity rules are, in my opinion, not burdensome. They simply tell the network providers to be reasonable when protecting the data. That is all. The FCC left it to the companies, themselves, to use their best judgment about how to get the job done. They just needed to be reasonable. It seems being reasonable is still too much for the Republicans-- first in the Senate, and now here in the House. This resolution tells the companies charged with running the country's broadband networks that they no longer have to be reasonable when it comes to their customers' data. So I say, Mr. Speaker, make no mistake: This resolution is a gift to countries like Russia who want to take our citizens' personal information. And if the House passes this resolution, it will go straight to the President's desk, a President who will be more than happy to sign his name to this gift to the Russians. This resolution also gives large corporations free rein to take customers' data without anyone's permission. This debate is about whether Americans have the freedom to decide on our privacy. We hear all kinds of complicated arguments about jurisdiction, implementation dates, and who knows what else, but these arguments just muddy the water. Republicans will say that the FCC's rules are confusing to consumers, people won't know what to do if they are asked first before broadband companies sell their sensitive information. If that were the case, we would have heard from people who oppose the rules, but we simply have not heard any of those concerns. The facts speak for themselves. Consumers want more privacy protection, not less. Seventy-four percent of Americans say it is very important that they be in control of information, and 91 percent of people feel they have lost control [[Page H2495]] over their own information. There are real consequences to these feelings. Nearly half of Americans say they limit their online activity because they are worried about their privacy and security. That is why they overwhelmingly support stronger protections. The FCC listened to the American people and adopted reasonable rules. Despite Republican claims to the contrary, the rules were not hard to follow. The rules still allow broadband companies to offer services based on their customers' data, and they can still customize ads or send reminders. The FCC's rules simply required companies to ask people first before selling their sensitive information. That is it. In fact, I had hoped the FCC would have gone even further, but the agency chose this more moderate approach. So as this debate proceeds, we should be asking one simple question: Should the American people have the freedom to choose how their information is used or should the government give that freedom away? I think the answer is clear. I stand with the American people, and, therefore, I strongly oppose this legislation. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta). Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution and want to address an issue created by the Federal Communication Commission's misguided privacy rule in a recent Ninth Circuit case. For decades, the Federal Trade Commission has been the privacy cop on the beat for most industries, including the technology sector, protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The Federal Trade Commission has brought over 500 privacy and data security cases to protect consumers. These include cases against internet service providers and some of the largest edge providers. The Federal Communications Commission is a regulatory body focused on regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The Federal Trade Commission's work in privacy and data security has long been held up as a model by both parties, praising the agency for strong enforcement without overly burdensome regulations. During negotiations with the European Union to finalize the U.S.-European privacy shield, the Obama administration held up the Federal Trade Commission as the premier privacy enforcement agency. Unfortunately, in a midnight action, the Federal Communications Commission jammed through its own privacy rule that is very different from the framework that the Federal Trade Commission has been enforcing for decades. While we can reverse the poorly constructed FCC rule today, we must still address a recent court ruling. The Ninth Circuit recently ruled that the common carrier exemption in the Federal Trade Commission Act exempts an entity in its entirety from the Federal Trade Commission's jurisdiction if it engages in any common carrier activities, even if the company also engages in non-common carrier activity. I have introduced legislation to address the court's ruling with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson). It is my hope that our colleagues will join us. S.J. Res. 34 makes clear that the Federal Trade Commission has authority over common carriers when they are acting outside the scope of the common carrier. The repeal of the Federal Communications Commission's misguided privacy rule in the Ninth Circuit's opinion creates a gap and an irrational approach to privacy for consumers and would leave portions of the internet ecosystem completely outside the Federal Trade Commission's jurisdiction. This bill makes clear that the common carrier exemption is important to ensure that no duplication regulation occurs. At the same time, there are no loopholes left for certain companies to be outside the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission. {time} 1630 We need to be consistent in our approach to privacy and focus on consumer-oriented enforcement. This approach has been the foundation not just of Silicon Valley, but innovators across the country; and the S.J. Res. 34 sets right the decades of innovation that has spurred job growth in the United States and greater online services for consumers. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I remind my friend, since he acknowledges the court decision does not allow FTC jurisdiction and that he wants to introduce a bill, perhaps the Republicans should have done that first, before scrapping the rules that leave ISPs with no rules. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui). Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to S.J. Res. 34. This is just the latest attempt from our Republican colleagues to use the Congressional Review Act to gut critical protections for American consumers. The internet is increasingly intertwined with our daily lives, and nearly every American family uses the internet to access and share personal and sensitive information. The business we conduct online includes financial information, details about our medical history, and even information on our kids. If this resolution of disapproval passes today, there will be no rules on the books to stop internet service providers from selling that browsing history without your permission. Because our Republican colleagues are using the Congressional Review Act to overturn these critical consumer protections, the FCC can't go back and write new rules in the future. Despite what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said, the Federal Trade Commission cannot bring cases against broadband providers. That is why the FTC supported these rules when the FCC adopted them last year. Even if you think the FCC did not get these rules right, this resolution effectively eliminates the FCC from ever acting to protect consumer privacy in the future. We should be working together to address any real shortcomings if these rules need to be fixed. That is not what the resolution before us will do. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this damaging resolution. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance). Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support S.J. Res. 34, which seeks to halt agency overreach of the Federal Communications Commission concerning the way broadband internet service providers handle their customers' personal information. The FCC's broadband privacy rule, a midnight regulation adopted by executive order in the waning days of the Obama administration, unnecessarily targets internet service providers and does very little to protect consumer privacy. The rule adds costly and unnecessary innovation-stifling regulations to the internet and is another example of the Federal Government's picking winners and losers. When passed, the FCC claimed that the rule would provide broadband customers meaningful choice, greater transparency, and strong security protections for their personal information collected by internet service providers. In reality, the FCC's rules arbitrarily treat ISPs differently from the rest of the internet, creating a false sense of privacy. Consumer data privacy is of significant concern to every American. The proper parties should address the issue. In this area, the Federal Trade Commission has historically held authority on the establishment and enforcement of general online privacy rules. Repealing the FCC's privacy action is a critical step toward restoring a single, uniform set of privacy rules for the internet. This legislation puts all segments of the internet on equal footing and provides American consumers with a consistent set of privacy rules to permit the FCC and the FTC to continue to work to ensure consumer privacy through enforcement. The FTC, the premier agency in this regard, has the experience to protect the privacy of the American people regarding the internet--at least 20 years of experience. Bifurcation between the FTC and the FCC is not productive. A good question to ask the FTC: Why did it wait until the last minute of the [[Page H2496]] Obama administration to promulgate its regulation? Mr. Speaker, I believe it is important that we pass S.J. Res. 34, and I rise to ask all of my colleagues to support it. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I have heard about this last-minute dropping and late at night. Just for the other side's information, after a 7-month rulemaking process, this rule was adopted midday on October 26. So let's get the record straight. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney). Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, first, I thank Mr. Doyle for his opposition to S.J. Res. 34. I rise in opposition as well. The FCC's broadband privacy rules are commonsense rules. These rules give consumers the ability to choose how their information is used and shared by their internet service providers. According to the Pew Research Center, a large majority of Americans say it is very important that they control who has access to their information. Despite a loud cry from the American people that they want to be able to choose how their information is used, S.J. Res. 34 strips consumers of the power to choose how their ISPs use and share their information. This resolution also leaves consumers more vulnerable to attacks because their ISP will no longer be required to make reasonable steps to secure their personal information. In recent years, we have seen numerous data breach incidents that have jeopardized consumers' personal information. Some examples are Yahoo, Target, Home Depot, LinkedIn, and Anthem. The list goes on. Given the growing cyber threats that our Nation faces, it is critical that we do more, not less, to secure consumers' data. Strong data security practices are critical for protecting our consumers' confidentiality. This resolution would make consumers' data more susceptible to being stolen and used for identity theft and other harmful unauthorized purposes. Consumers want to be heard. They want more privacy. They want their information to be secure. We have an obligation to respond to their requests. I am appalled that one of the Republicans' first acts in this Congress after trying to take health coverage away from 24 million people is to attack consumer protections and weaken data security. Americans are just now hearing about this legislation, and my phones are ringing off the hook in opposition. I have to rhetorically ask the other side: Why are you pushing this? Americans don't want it. Your voters are beginning to pay attention. This is just after your humiliating defeat with the ACA repeal. I ask that you withdraw this bill and start listening to your constituents. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject S.J. Res. 34. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the GOP whip. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for bringing forward this legislation. The FTC's light touch in case-by-case enforcement had fostered an internet economy that has become the envy of the world, much to the benefit of all American families and consumers across this country. But rather than following the FTC's proven framework of privacy protection, the FCC came in and overreached and missed the mark with these rules, injecting more regulation into the internet ecosystem. With all due respect, the internet was not broken and did not need the Federal Government to come in and try to fix it. The bottom line is that families expect and deserve to be protected online with a set of robust and uniform privacy protections. These rules simply do not live up to that standard. Rather than regulating based on the sensitivity of our data, these rules are applied unevenly, based on what type of company you are or what kind of technology you use. Consumers should feel assured online that there is a cop on the beat with a track record of success, not an agency with a history of regulatory overreach. These midnight rules are harmful, inconsistent, and should be repealed. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this important resolution. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 10\\3/4\\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 5 minutes remaining. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I remind the gentleman that these heavy-handed regulations that he speaks of are simply: ask permission, protect people's data, and tell them if it gets stolen. That doesn't sound too heavy-handed to me. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko). Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to S.J. Res. 34, a bill that would strike most of the internet privacy guarantees protecting the American people today. I have grave concerns with this effort. Our agenda here should be working on behalf of our constituents to protect their privacy and give them, not their service providers, data security. Instead, this effort would eviscerate any real online privacy protections and would limit data security. Some of my colleagues have claimed that this commonsense rule has created challenges for consumers. I have found just the opposite. My office has been inundated with calls demanding that Congress protect their privacy and data security by opposing S.J. Res. 34. To everyone who has called, I hear you and I stand with you in opposing this harmful and misguided effort. Back at home in New York's capital region, I have been hearing from many people who are frightened by the thought that S.J. Res. 34 will become law and the last shred of their online privacy will be lost forever. They know how much information their internet service provider has mined from their search and browsing history, including financial, medical, and other very personal and sensitive details. They rightly believe that they should have a say in when that information can be bought and when it can be sold. They understand that gutting these privacy protections would mean that internet service providers could sell their private information without their permission. It means their private internet browsing and search history, the text of their emails, and their mobile app usage can all be sold without their permission. They have a right to control what they search for, their financial information, their health insurance, and information about their children. They have a right to protect their Social Security numbers and the contents of their emails. These rights are enshrined in our Constitution. Privacy rules also require providers to use reasonable measures to protect consumers' personal information, a clear and commonsense standard that all who do business online should be required to uphold. Finally, internet service providers must notify customers if hackers breach the system and may have access to their private data. With hackers from Russia and elsewhere running rampant across the net, this is a critical provision for our American families. This is not too much to ask. The American people deserve to know that their data will be protected and that they will be notified if their data is compromised. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson). Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 34, which will protect consumers and the future of internet innovation. The internet is changing the way we communicate, shop, learn, and entertain. It is changing how we control our homes, our cars, and many other parts of our lives, including my two teenage kids. These changes give us certain expectations of privacy on the internet. Until last year, the Federal Trade Commission provided a robust, consistent privacy framework for all companies in the internet services market. Their holistic and consistent approach struck the right balance. Consumers' use of internet services continues to increase and their privacy has been protected. The resolution we are voting on today puts all segments of the internet on equal footing. It provides consumers with a consistent set of privacy rules. [[Page H2497]] Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for S.J. Res. 34. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I remind my friends once again that this does not put us on equal footing. The FTC has no power to regulate ISPs under current law. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano). {time} 1645 Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, we all know that our cell phones are tracking every move we make and keeping a record of it. Many people don't know, but your automobile is also doing the same thing. They keep a record of where you go. They keep a record of whether you wore your seatbelt. They keep a record of whether you applied the brakes or turned the turn signal on. Okay. That is your automobile. You don't have to drive. Just recently, in the last couple months, we have learned that our televisions and children's dolls are doing the same thing. Last month, it was revealed that Vizio had spied on 11 million consumers by listening to them while their TV was off because they can do it. Also, last month, a child's doll called My Friend Cayla for little girls or boys was banned in Germany--banned in Germany--because that doll listens and responds. It goes into the internet, and the doll's owner keeps and sells that information. This month--this month--a teddy bear manufactured by a company called CloudPets was exposed for collecting more than 2 million voice recordings of children talking to their teddy bear. Now, maybe we accept that. I know that those are not the items that this resolution would address, but the problem is you are taking an item for ISPs and reducing it down to this level. You say your privacy is protected. I just gave you three examples in the last 2 months where your privacy is not protected. Neither is your children's. Neither is your family's. In 2012, a giant international company--international ISP company, by the way--filed for a U.S. patent for a cable box that would sit in your house. It would watch you. It would record you. It contained an infrared sensor and even take your body temperature with a thermographic--and that is a quote--thermographic camera. It would do all this without telling you and would work whether the cable box was on or not. If you don't believe me, if you still have the courage to go on the internet, go find patent application number--now, write this one down--2012/0304206. That is the patent application number. It is still online. I want to read you one small segment from that 25-page patent application. This is a direct quote. I am not making up a single word. The device ``may detect . . . that two users are cuddling on a couch during the presentation of the television program and prior to an advertisement break. Based on the detected . . . action . . . the device would select a commercial associated with cuddling.'' The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. CAPUANO. For example: ``a commercial for a romantic getaway vacation, a commercial for a contraceptive, a commercial for flowers . . . et cetera.'' I didn't make up a single word of what I just read, and every one of you is sitting there with your mouth open that this might happen in your world. That is what this resolution will allow, and you can't turn it off. You can't say: Don't watch my children. Don't watch my wife. This is a terrible resolution. As I asked earlier today, what are you thinking? Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, we are thinking that the gentleman's comments do not pertain to this resolution, that this resolution in no way is going to allow any of the activities that were described, whether it is cuddling or anything that is going to get in the way of any of that or allowed to be sold. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Collins). Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the people who worked to make this legislation a reality. As we become increasingly concerned with cyber threats, online privacy is a critical concern for every American. Unfortunately, in October of last year, the FCC issued regulations titled, ``Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services,'' also known as broadband privacy rules. These titles do not actually accurately reflect the impact these regulations are having on constituents' electronic privacy. These broadband privacy rules took internet service providers, ISPs, which you subscribe to for TV and internet access, and edge providers that deliver online applications, services, and website content, and separated them into two different groups. This has caused confusion among businesses trying to adhere to this change. While writing this regulation, the FCC had the opportunity to employ FTC precedent in drafting the broadband privacy rules, but instead chose to ignore existing precedent and create additional and onerous regulations. The FCC believed that these new rules would give consumers more choice and heightened transparency; however, this has not been the case. This legislation does not remove privacy protections for consumers, and it does not expose consumer information. Both the FCC and the FTC will retain authority over consumer privacy on a case-by-case basis. ISPs will continue to be subject to the Communications Act of 1934, which protects all consumer proprietary network information. This is in addition to the many other existing Federal and State privacy rules that ISPs must continue to follow. This proposed system, separating edge providers from ISPs, creates confusion for both consumers and business operations. This legislation works to reduce the confusion that has been created from this unnecessary regulation that has stifled competition and impeded innovation. I am happy to support this legislation which will provide much-needed clarity to the ongoing debate. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 5\\1/4\\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I just remind my friend, you can say it as many times as you want, but the fact of the matter is that, under current law, the FTC has no authority to regulate the FCC, and the FCC Commissioner has said that you cannot do this without a rule in section 222. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our House Democratic leader, the magic minute. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my five children and my nine grandchildren and everyone I know, as a matter of fact, I thank the gentleman for being a champion for privacy for the American people. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle) for his leadership. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) for his leadership. The gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo) has been a champion on this issue as well. Mr. Speaker, Americans turn to the internet for so many things these days: buying books, filing taxes, learning about why they are feeling sick. The Republicans want this information to be sold without your permission: the websites you visit, the apps you use, your search history, the content of your emails, your health and financial data. Overwhelmingly, the American people do not agree with the Republicans that this information should be sold, and it certainly should not be sold without your permission. Our broadband providers know deeply personal information about us and our families: where we are, what we want, what we are looking for, what information we want to know, every site we visit, and more. Our broadband providers can even track us when we are surfing in private, browsing in a private browsing mode. [[Page H2498]] Americans' private browser history should not be up for sale. Yet Republicans are bringing S.J. Res. 34 to the floor to allow internet service providers to profit--to profit; this is about profit--from America's most intimate personal information without our knowledge or our consent. Republicans' use of the Congressional Review Act will do permanent damage to the FCC's ability to keep Americans' personal information safe. As FCC Commissioner Clyburn and FTC Commissioner McSweeny warned: ``This legislation will frustrate the FCC's''--the Federal Communications Commission's--``future efforts to protect the privacy of voice and broadband customers.'' It is important for our constituents to know that, if the Republicans had a problem with this particular policy, they might tweak it and say we don't like it this way or that in regular legislation so that we could have a debate on it. It could go back to the Federal Communications Commission. They could revise it and send it back if it were a legitimate presentation of concerns. But it is not about a legitimate presentation of concerns. It is about increasing profits at the expense of the privacy of the American people. So, as I say, the Republicans' use of the Congressional Review Act does permanent damage and also damages the FCC's ability to keep America's personal information safe. With this measure, Republicans would destroy Americans' right to privacy on the internet--we made that clear--and forbid any effort to keep your personal information safe. Republicans are bending over backwards. Think of it. Think of the context of all of this. Since Gerald Ford was President, every candidate for President, every nominee of a major party, every candidate for President of the United States, Democrat and Republican, has released their income tax returns out of respect for the American people--out of respect for the American people. Week in and week out--in fact, sometimes day in and day out--in committee as well as on the floor, the Republicans have kept the President's income tax returns private when the public has a right to know that, that the public has always known that about every President since Gerald Ford--in fact, since Richard Nixon; although, in his case, it wasn't voluntary. So while they are hiding President Trump's tax returns, some discrete piece of information that the public has a right to know, they are selling your most personal, selling your most personal and sensitive information--again, your browsing history, your children's location, everything--to anyone with the money to buy it. Incognito tabs or private browsing modes will not protect you from the internet service providers watching and selling, as Mr. Capuano pointed out, watching and selling. Republicans have picked the week after Russian spies were caught hacking into half a billion American email accounts to open the floodgates, overturning the requirement that internet service providers keep their sensitive data secured from cybercriminals. The American people deserve to be able to insist that intimate details and information about their browser history be kept private and secure. So how is this? We have this magnificent technology that science has made available to people to facilitate commerce, to learn about different subjects, to privately pursue, in a way that they may not even want their families to know, what symptoms they have and what illness that might tell them about. Most Americans have no or limited choices for broadband providers and no recourse against these invasions of their privacy because, with this measure, Republicans turn their back on the overwhelming number of Americans who want more control over their internet privacy. Americans can choose who represents them in Congress. Americans are paying close attention. They want to know who is taking a stand with them in opposing efforts to sell the private information of the American people. This is staggering. This is almost a surrender. If the Republicans are allowed to do this, we have surrendered all thoughts of privacy for the American people. Privacy is a value that the American people treasure. It is about their dignity. It is about their dignity. We cannot allow the Republicans to sell the dignity of the American people. I hope that everyone will vote ``no'' on this most unfortunate assault on the dignity of the American people. {time} 1700 Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky). Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Last week, Republicans tried to take away your health care; and, today, they are trying to take away your privacy. Republicans have said broadband providers and other internet companies should be under the same privacy rules. But oddly enough, when the committee considered an amendment to give the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, rulemaking authority like the FCC, a change that would allow the agencies to adopt the same privacy protection, every single Republican voted no. In fact, Republicans proposed making it harder for the FTC to pursue privacy and data security cases. The protections that the FCC adopted last year were very simple: consumers should know what data is being collected, opt in to sharing of sensitive data, have their data reasonably protected, and receive notice when their data is compromised. But this dangerous resolution puts America's privacy and data security at risk. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to stand up for consumers and vote ``no.'' Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin). Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution of disapproval, which would repeal broadband privacy rules being implemented by the FCC. As co-chair of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, I hope I can offer some additional perspective on this debate. Studying the many threats our country faces in cyberspace, I have become deeply aware of how ingrained the internet is in every aspect of our lives and our economy. And that has also helped me understand the unique role of broadband service providers to grant access to the great potential of the Information Age. By necessity, ISPs see every bit of traffic that leaves your network for the broader internet. Even when you use encryption, ISPs can still capture data about whom you are talking to or what sites you are visiting. These data are sensitive, and consumers have a right to decide whether or not they can be shared or monetized. Unfortunately, the resolution of disapproval under consideration would strip consumers of that right and presumptively allow sharing and selling without your permission. Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us today that the Republicans have proposed is downright creepy. It is going to allow potentially unprecedented abuse of personal or private information be shared without your permission. This cannot stand. I urge my colleagues to oppose it. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings). Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, please stop me if you have heard this one before and know how it ends. My colleagues on the other side are once again trying to sell the American people a broken alternative to something that is working pretty much as it was intended to. The FCC privacy rule just says that customers must opt in before internet [[Page H2499]] companies can sell their web browsing history, and that those companies must make reasonable efforts to protect customers' sensitive information. These are not unreasonable requirements. The internet is our gateway to the world. Whether we connect through our mobile phone or our home computer, we pay companies for access. If those companies want to sell information about what we do on the internet, they should have to get our permission first. It is the right thing to do. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side to simply do the right thing. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from a coalition of small ISPs, a coalition of civil rights organizations, the Consumers Union, and an article by Terrell McSweeny all opposing this CRA. Electronic Frontier Foundation, San Francisco, CA. Re Oppose S.J. Res 34--Repeal of FCC Privacy Rules. Dear U.S. Representatives: We, the undersigned founders, executives, and employees of ISPs and networking companies, spend our working lives ensuring that Americans have high- quality, fast, reliable, and locally provided choices available when they need to connect to the Internet. One of the cornerstones of our businesses is respecting the privacy of our customers, and it is for that primary reason that we are writing to you today. We urge Congress to preserve the FCC's Broadband Privacy Rules and vote down plans to abolish them. If the rules are repealed, large ISPs across America would resume spying on their customers, selling their data, and denying them a practical and informed choice in the matter. Perhaps if there were a healthy, free, transparent, and competitive market for Internet services in this country, consumers could choose not to use those companies' products. But small ISPs like ours face many structural obstacles, and many Americans have very limited choices: a monopoly or duopoly on the wireline side, and a highly consolidated cellular market dominated by the same wireline firms. Under those circumstances, the FCC's Broadband Privacy Rules are the only way that most Americans will retain the free market choice to browse the Web without being surveilled by the company they pay for an Internet connection.

Hon. Paul D. Ryan, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Charles Schumer, Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Speaker Ryan, Senator McConnell, Representative Pelosi, and Senator Schumer: The undersigned media justice, consumer protection, civil liberties, and privacy groups strongly urge you to oppose the use of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to adopt a Resolution of Disapproval overturning the FCC's broadband privacy order. That order implements the mandates in Section 222 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which an overwhelming, bipartisan majority of Congress enacted to protect telecommunications users' privacy. The cable, telecom, wireless, and advertising lobbies request for CRA intervention is just another industry attempt to overturn rules that empower users and give them a say in how their private information may be used. Not satisfied with trying to appeal the rules of the agency, industry lobbyists have asked Congress to punish internet users by way of restraining the FCC, when all the agency did was implement Congress' own directive in the 1996 Act. This irresponsible, scorched-earth tactic is as harmful as it is hypocritical. If Congress were to take the industry up on its request, a Resolution of Disapproval could exempt intemet service providers (ISPs) from any and all privacy rules at the FCC. As you know, a successful CRA on the privacy rules could preclude the FCC from promulgating any ``substantially similar'' regulations in the future--in direct conflict with Congress' clear intention in Section 222 that telecommunications carriers protect their customers' privacy. It could also preclude the FCC from addressing any of the other issues in the privacy order like requiring data breach notification and from revisiting these issues as technology continues to evolve in the future. The true consequences of this revoked authority are apparent when considering the ISPs' other efforts to undermine the rules. Without these rules, ISPs could use and disclose customer information at will. The result could be extensive harm caused by breaches or misuse of data. Broadband ISPs, by virtue of their position as gatekeepers to everything on the intemet, have a largely unencumbered view into their customers' online communications. That includes the websites they visit, the videos they watch, and the messages they send. Even when that traffic is encrypted, ISPs can gather vast troves of valuable information on their users' habits; but researchers have shown that much of the most sensitive information remains unencrypted. The FCC's order simply restores people's control over their personal information and lets them choose the terms on which ISPs can use it, share it, or sell it. Americans are increasingly concerned about their privacy, and in some cases have begun to censor their online activity for fear their personal information may be compromised. Consumers have repeatedly expressed their desire for more privacy protections and their belief that the government helps ensure those protections are met. The FCC's rules give broadband customers confidence that their privacy and choices will be honored, but it does not in any way ban ISPs' ability to market to users who opt-in to receive any such targeted offers. The ISPs' overreaction to the FCC's broadband privacy rules has been remarkable. Their supposed concerns about the rule are significantly overblown. Some broadband providers and trade associations inaccurately suggest that this rule is a full ban on data use and disclosure by ISPs, and from there complain that it will hamstring ISPs' ability to compete with other large advertising companies and platforms like Google and Facebook. To the contrary, ISPs can and likely will continue to be able to benefit from use and sharing of their customers' data, so long as those customers consent to such uses. The rules merely require the ISPs to obtain that informed consent. The ISPs and their trade associations already have several petitions for reconsideration of the privacy rules before the FCC. Their petitions argue that the FCC should either adopt a ``Federal Trade Commission style'' approach to broadband privacy, or that it should retreat from the field and its statutory duty in favor of the Federal Trade Commission itself All of these suggestions are fatally flawed. Not only is the FCC well positioned to continue in its statutorily mandated role as the privacy watchdog for broadband telecom customers, it is the only agency able to do so. As the 9th Circuit recently decided in a case brought by AT&amp;T, common carriers are entirely exempt from FTC jurisdiction, meaning that presently there is no privacy replacement for broadband customers waiting at the FTC if Congress disapproves the FCC's rules here. This lays bare the true intent of these industry groups, who also went to the FCC asking for fine-tuning and reconsideration of the rules before they sent their CRA request. These groups now ask Congress to create a vacuum and to give ISPs carte blanche, with no privacy rules or enforcement in place. Without clear rules of the road under Section 222, broadband users will have no certainty about how their private information can be used and no protection against its abuse. ISPs could and would use and disclose consumer information at will, leading to extensive harm caused by breaches and by misuse of data properly belonging to consumers. Congress told the FCC in 1996 to ensure that telecommunications carriers protect the information they collect about their customers. Industry groups now ask Congress to ignore the mandates in the Communications Act, enacted with strong bipartisan support, and overturn the FCC's attempts to implement Congress's word. The CRA is a blunt instrument and it is inappropriate in this instance, where rules clearly benefit internet users notwithstanding ISPs' disagreement with them. We strongly urge you to oppose any resolution of disapproval that would overturn the FCC's broadband privacy rule.

House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Representative: Consumers Union, the policy and mobilization arm of Consumer [[Page H2500]] Reports, writes regarding House consideration of S.J. Res.<br/><br/>      34, approved by a 50-48 party line vote in the Senate last week. This resolution, if passed by the House and signed into law by President, would use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to nullify the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) newly- enacted broadband privacy rules that give consumers better control over their data. Many Senators cited ``consumer confusion'' as a reason to do away with the FCC's privacy rules, but we have seen no evidence proving this assertion and fail to understand how taking away increased privacy protections eliminates confusion. Therefore, we strongly oppose passage of this resolution--it would strip consumers of their privacy rights and, as we explain below, leave them with no protections at all. We urge you to vote no on S.J.<br/><br/>      Res. 34. The FCC made history last October when it adopted consumer- friendly privacy rules that give consumers more control over how their information is collected by internet service providers (ISPs). Said another way, these rules permit consumers to decide when an ISP can collect a treasure trove of consumer information, whether it is a web browsing history or the apps a consumer may have on a smartphone. We believe the rules are simple, reasonable, and straightforward. ISPs, by virtue of their position as gatekeepers to everything on the internet, enjoy a unique window into consumers' online activities. Data including websites consumers visit, videos viewed, and messages sent is very valuable. Small wonder, then, that ISPs are working so hard to have the FCC's new privacy rules thrown out through use of the Congressional Review Act. But we should make no mistake: abandoning the FCC's new privacy rules is about what benefits big cable companies and not about what is best for consumers. Many argue the FCC should have the same privacy rules as those of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). FCC Chairman Ajit Pai went so far as to say ``jurisdiction over broadband providers' privacy and data security practices should be returned to the FTC, the nation's expert agency with respect to these important subjects,'' even though the FTC currently possesses no jurisdiction over the vast majority of ISPs thanks to the common carrier exemption--an exemption made stricter by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in last year's AT&amp;T Mobility case. We have heard this flawed logic time and time again as one of the principal arguments for getting rid of the FCC's strong privacy rules. Unfortunately, this is such a poor solution that it amounts to no solution at all. For the FTC to regain jurisdiction over the privacy practices of ISPs, the FCC would first have to scrap Title II reclassification--not an easy task which would be both time- consuming and subject to judicial review, and jeopardize the legal grounding of the 2015 Open Internet Order. Congress, in turn, would have to pass legislation to remove the common carrier exemption, thus granting the FTC jurisdiction over those ISPs who are common carriers. We are skeptical Congress would take such an action. Finally, the FTC does not enjoy the same robust rulemaking authority that the FCC does. As a result, consumers would have to wait for something bad to happen before the FTC would step in to remedy a violation of privacy rights. Any fondness for the FTC's approach to privacy is merely support for dramatically weaker privacy protections favored by most corporations. There is no question that consumers favor the FCC's current broadband privacy rules. Consumers Union launched an online petition drive last month in support of the Commission's strong rules. To date, close to 50,000 consumers have signed the petition and the number is growing. Last week, more than 24,000 consumers contacted their Senators urging them to oppose the CRA resolution in the 24 hours leading up to the vote. Consumers care about privacy and want the strong privacy protections afforded to the them by the FCC. Any removal or watering down of those rules would represent the destruction of simple privacy protections for consumers. Even worse, if this resolution is passed, using the Congressional Review Act here will prevent the FCC from adopting privacy rules--even weaker ones--to protect consumers in the future. Under the CRA, once a ride is erased, an agency cannot move forward with any ``substantially similar'' rule unless Congress enacts new legislation specifically authorizing it. Among other impacts, this means a bare majority in the Senate can void a rule, but then restoration of that rule is subject to full legislative process, including a filibuster. The CRA is a blunt instrument--and if used in this context, blatantly anti- consumer. We are more than willing to work with you and your fellow Representatives to craft privacy legislation that affords consumer effective and easy-to-understand protections. The FCC made a step in that direction when it adopted the broadband privacy rules last year, and getting rid of them via the Congressional Review Act is a step back, not forward. Therefore, we encourage you to vote no on S.J. Res. 34. Respectfully, Laura MacCleery, Vice President, Consumer Policy &amp; Mobilization, Consumer Reports. Katie McInnis, Policy Counsel, Consumers Union. Jonathan Schwantes, Senior Policy Counsel, Consumers Union. ____ [From wired.com , Mar. 22, 2017] Congress Is About To Give Away Your Online Privacy (By Terrell McSweeney and Chris Hoofnagle) The resolution that could come to a Congressional vote this week aims to tackle differences in how the FCC rule treats ISPs compared with other internet companies. Your broadband provider has to offer you a choice about what information it shares about you, but ecommerce sites and search engines do not. Advocates for repealing the current protections--the resolution is sponsored by Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ)--argue that Congress should void the FCC's rule using the Congressional Review Act. They contend that in order to properly govern privacy and avoid confusing consumers, the FCC should maintain consistent rules across the internet ecosystem. But inconsistent standards pervade privacy and consumer law. Furthermore, consistent standards militate in favor of increasing protections for privacy, rather than unraveling them as the current proposal would do. An alphabet soup of state and federal laws set the privacy requirements for everything from our financial information to data about our children. That's largely because privacy is both essential to and sometimes in conflict with our most deeply held value, liberty. So, legislators have never been able to craft omnibus privacy protections. Instead, they've developed frameworks informed by prevailing norms, incentives, political economy, and ways the information might be used. As we connect more devices in our home and on our bodies, the array of technologies that raise data privacy and security concerns is expanding. The privacy landscape will likely continue to be shaped as technologies evolve. Different consumer technologies may justify different approaches. For example, the safety issues inherent in cars and medical devices may warrant particularly strong privacy and security protections. In the future, privacy rules could come from the FCC as well as the Department of Commerce, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Food and Drug Administration, and other agencies. Consider that your bank can--and probably does--sell your contact and financial information unless you opt out. Yet if you rent a movie, online or off, the rental service can't sell information about your media consumption without your consent, and it must delete your rental history after it's no longer needed. Congress enacted those protections to shield intellectual freedom, so that one can enjoy controversial movies without fear of one's curiosity resulting in extortion or embarrassment. This brings us to our second point: If consistency and reducing consumer confusion is the goal, consumers should demand stronger internet privacy norms. Given the animating purpose of protecting movie rental information, why not require consumers to consent to the sharing any information about their online behavior? After all, our web activity is the ultimate manifestation of our intellectual curiosity, representing second-by-second decisions about consuming news and entertainment. In addition to existing federal laws, legislators could, as professor Helen Nissenbaum has suggested, look to offline contexts, such as the strong privacy norms governing searching for a book in a library, to guide the privacy rules we ought to enjoy when using a search engine. The government also could take a page from the confidentiality standards patients enjoy when conversing with physicians and apply those same norms to medical information websites. Policymakers could look to the last two centuries of privacy in the postal mail to guide rules for commercial scanning of email. Yet in all these contexts, web business models drive design decisions that have turned social and personal behaviors into marketplace transactions. Left standing, the FCC rule offers an opportunity for a meaningful debate about how to better translate our analog privacy norms into the digital world. Broadband ISPs are essentially utilities, like postal mail and the telephone. Subscribers have little or no competitive choice as to which provider to use. ISPs know our identities, and their position gives them the technical capacity to surveil users in ways that others cannot. It makes sense to ensure consumers can choose whether to share data related to their Internet usage. The majority of consumers--91 percent in a recent survey-- feel they've lost control of their personal information. Yet, paradoxically, the late, great privacy researcher and historian Alan Westin consistently found that Americans expect companies to handle personal data in a ``confidential'' way. In reality, the modern internet is like a one-way mirror, where users are often unaware that they are being silently watched by third parties. The FCC rule exposes this one-way mirror and allows people to decide whether to draw a curtain on it. Maintaining the current rules would make ISP practices more consistent with consumers' expectations of confidentiality. Congress should spend time examining the [[Page H2501]] strengths and weaknesses of our current approach, instead of using consistency arguments to eviscerate the FCC's rule. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), my colleague from the class of '94. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, a ``yes'' vote exempts all broadband service providers from all rules on user privacy and all limitations on how they use your data. They are in a unique position to see every place you go, every website you visit, they can do deep packet inspection and see what is in your emails. What protects your privacy? This rule that is about to be repealed. If you have problems with the privacy policies of your email provider or social network, you have got competition to go to. But most Americans have just one or, at most, just two choices for their broadband provider. And, interestingly enough, all of those providers are supporting the repeal of this privacy rule. Why? They are going to make money selling your information. The idea that we could have an FTC solution is an interesting one, but there is no way to do it. In the Ninth Circuit's 2016 ruling of AT&amp;T v. FTC, they ruled that the FTC is barred from imposing data breach rules. So vote ``no'' and protect your constituents' privacy. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote against this horrible resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. We have heard a lot of interesting claims today in the discussion about this fairly simple resolution to roll back overreaching regulation from the FCC that were passed late in the Obama administration's time. I would remind everybody, Mr. Speaker, that this CRA has nothing to do with the President's tax return, it has nothing to do with Russian hacking, and there have been some gross mischaracterizations of what this resolution does. Why do we need this resolution? The three reasons are, as Chairwoman Blackburn opened up at the beginning: First of all, the FCC swiped jurisdiction from the FTC. Second, two cops on the beat create confusion among consumers and among the ISP providers. Third, the FTC already has jurisdiction over this space. Let me close with this: this resolution of disapproval only rescinds the FCC's rule, but it still provides the FCC the opportunity to provide more oversight more in line with the Federal Trade Commission, which has successfully been regulating online privacy for nearly 2 decades. This resolution does not lessen or impede the privacy and data security standards that we already have established. We are simply restoring a more stable regulatory playing field to ensure that consistent uniform privacy standards are maintained to protect consumers and future innovation. Once Congress rejects these rules, the FCC can turn back to cooperating with the FTC to ensure both the consumer privacy across all aspects of the internet is protected through vigorous enforcement and that innovation is allowed to flourish. I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense resolution. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the joint resolution. The question is on the third reading of the joint resolution. The joint resolution was ordered to be read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

Franken's remarks, as prepared for delivery, here or below.  <br/>Floor Statement on Guarding Net Neutrality, Fighting Back Against Media Consolidation, Protection Americans' Right to Privacy<br/> Senator Al Franken<br/> (As prepared for delivery)  <br/><br/> M. President, I rise today to deliver the second in a series of floor speeches that I offer as I close out my time in the Senate.  <br/>This evening, I want to talk about Americans' relationship with telecommunications and technology companies, and what that means for their access to essential services and for their privacy.  <br/>When I entered the Senate in July 2009, then Majority Leader Reid asked me to serve on the Judiciary Committee. I pointed out that there are a lot of lawyers in the Senate, and that I wasn't one of them, but he said that he needed members with my perspective on the Committee. I wondered how my background could possibly serve me on Judiciary, but it did - almost immediately - when in December of that year, Comcast announced its intention to acquire NBCUniversal.  <br/>I happened to know a lot about the effects of media consolidation because I used to work in media. When powerful corporations are permitted to acquire other powerful corporations, it's the American consumers who are left facing higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service from their telecommunications providers. I questioned why an already powerful company should be allowed to get even bigger and thus extract more leverage over consumers and the businesses reliant on its platform.  <br/>And it was through my work on Comcast-NBCUniversal that I learned about the rising costs of internet, phone, and TV services, as well as the importance of preserving net neutrality. I also became interested in how giant telecommunications companies, as well as ever-evolving tech companies, were treating the massive troves of user data that they were collecting on a perpetual basis.  <br/>I believe that consumers have a fundamental right to know what information is being collected about them. I believe that they have a right to decide whether they want to share that information, and with whom they want to share it and when. And I believe that consumers have a right to expect that companies that store their personal information will store it securely.  <br/>I also believe that all Americans deserve affordable access to high-quality telecommunications services - services they depend on to communicate with the world, get an education, and find a job. And I believe that the internet should remain the open platform for innovation, economic growth, and freedom of expression that it has always been.  <br/>Perhaps it was the complex nature of these issues or even the financial incentive to turn a blind eye, but when I came to the Senate, very few members of Congress were talking about corporate consolidation or commercial privacy or net neutrality - issues that have gained much-deserved attention in more recent years. Whatever the reason for other members' hesitance, I felt that it was incumbent on me to get in the weeds on these issues, so that I could be a leader on them in the Senate and ultimately address the concerns of ordinary Minnesotans.  <br/>That's why when the interests of the American consumer have clashed with the desires of powerful telecommunications and technology companies, I've always tried to put the public first and to fight on their behalf - by shedding light on corporate abuses and using all the tools at my disposal to curb them.  <br/>Again, it is through my work on the Judiciary Committee - and more specifically my work on media and technology policy - that I believe my perspective from my previous career has been of most value.  <br/>Comcast's proposal to acquire NBCU immediately made me uncomfortable because I'd seen their motives for this deal before.  <br/>In 1993, during my thirteenth season at Saturday Night Live, the Big Three networks - NBC, CBS, and ABC - pressured Congress to change the rules that had previously prevented them from owning any of the shows that they aired in prime time. The purpose of the rules had been to prevent the networks from prioritizing their own shows over others or otherwise harming competing programming.  <br/>Unsurprisingly, after the rules were repealed, the networks began giving the shows they owned preferential treatment. At the time, Seinfeld, which aired on NBC, was the number one show on TV, which made the Thursday night time slot following Seinfeld the most valuable real estate on television. And I watched as the shows that eventually wound up in that premium location were all owned, at least in part, by NBC.  <br/>So, when I became a senator, one of the first major deals that I opposed was Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal. As in the case of AT&amp;T's current bid to buy Time Warner, this deal was about giving one company the ability to control both the programming and the pipes that carry it. I knew from my time in media that a combined Comcast-NBCU would have strong incentives to favor its own programming over that of others and restrict competing distributors from accessing that programming. I knew that these incentives would hurt competing content creators, inhibit the free flow of information, and ultimately harm consumers.  <br/>Unfortunately, I was not wrong. In the years after its acquisition of NBCUniversal, Comcast repeatedly violated the terms of its agreements with the FCC and DOJ, favoring its own news programming over its competitors in Comcast's channel lineup and failing to live up to its promises regarding affordable standalone broadband, racial diversity in programming, and online video distribution. And because merger conditions are extremely difficult and costly to enforce, competition and consumers were harmed in the process.  <br/>Comcast's behavior in the wake of acquiring NBCUniversal was one of the major reasons I then opposed its proposal to turn around and buy Time Warner Cable a couple years later. It's also one of the major reasons I believe that that later deal was ultimately dropped after objections from the FCC and DOJ.  <br/>For a long time in the Senate, it was a lonely battle. For over a year, I was the only senator to oppose Comcast's proposal to buy Time Warner Cable - a deal that would have given the combined company 57 percent of the broadband market. But advocates and ordinary citizens raised their voices, and together we were able to stop the deal.  <br/>Most recently, I've led my Senate colleagues in scrutinizing AT&amp;T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, and I've once again called on regulators to move to block the deal for the inevitable harm it will cause to competition and consumers.  <br/>I've been proud to lead these efforts. And I leave here in a much different environment than when I arrived. I know that there are strong voices in the Senate that will carry on the fight when I'm gone.  <br/>These efforts to slow down and halt media consolidation are part of a very important, larger development we've seen in our country. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the American public's - and, in turn, Congress' - interest in combatting corporate consolidation.  <br/>When I first entered the Senate, I wasn't sure that most Americans understood what was at stake when these powerful companies wanted to combine. Vertical integration and antitrust law sounded like obscure, almost boring, topics. But more and more Americans are getting educated about these issues, and more and more members of Congress are working to get Washington focused on how they affect the real lives of real people.  <br/>Just look at the fight for net neutrality.  <br/>For many of the same reasons that I opposed Comcast's acquisition of NBCU, I have long supported strong net neutrality rules to ensure that the internet remains a level playing field where everyone can participate on equal footing, free from discrimination by large internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T.  <br/>Net neutrality preserves the internet as the engine for innovation that it has always been and allows businesses of all sizes to thrive - even when they're up against the largest, most profitable corporations. Here's just one example that I've always found useful.  <br/>In 2005, three guys set up shop above a pizzeria in a strip mall in San Mateo, California, where they launched the now-ubiquitous YouTube. Video sharing websites were in their infancy, but these guys already faced competition from something called \"Google Video.\" But Google Video wasn't very good.  <br/>Because of net neutrality, YouTube was able to compete with Google on a level playing field. The giant internet service providers treated YouTube's videos the same as they did Google's, and Google couldn't pay them to gain an unfair advantage, like a fast lane into consumers' homes. Unsurprisingly, people liked YouTube a lot more than Google Video, and YouTube thrived. In fact, in 2006, Google bought it for stock valued at $1.65 billion - nice chunk for three guys over a pizzeria in San Mateo.  <br/>But it's not just tech companies and small businesses that rely on an open internet. In a submission to the FCC in 2014, a coalition that includes Visa, Bank of America, UPS, and Ford explained that QUOTE \"Every retailer with an online catalogue, every manufacturer with online product specifications, every insurance company with online claims processing, every bank offering online account management, every company with a website-every business in America interacting with its customers online is dependent upon an open Internet.\"  <br/>I've repeated this quote on the floor and at rallies time and time again over the years because I think it perfectly exemplifies the importance of this issue. Preserving net neutrality is only controversial for the few deep-pocketed entities that stand to financially gain without it.  <br/>If FCC Chairman Pai ultimately has his way, we'll be entering a digital world where the powerful outrank the majority; a world where a handful of multibillion-dollar companies have the power to control how users get their information; and a world where the deepest pockets can pay for a fast lane while their competitors stall in the slow lane.  <br/>For nearly nine years, I have been calling net neutrality the free speech issue of our time because it embraces our most basic constitutional freedoms. And ironically, the kind of civic participation that has inspired so many of us in recent months - and has effected real change, like in the fight for net neutrality and the successful efforts to save the Affordable Care Act-have depended, in no small part, on a free and open internet.  <br/>Now, in 2015, the FCC's vote to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act didn't just mean good things for net neutrality-it also had important implications for consumer privacy. It gave the agency the authority - and the responsibility - to implement rules to protect Americans' privacy by giving consumers greater control of their personal data that is collected and used by their broadband providers. That was a big win.  <br/>Republicans didn't see it that way. One of the first things they did this Congress was to repeal those rules, which was a huge blow to Americans' right to privacy.  <br/>For my part, I have long believed that Americans have a fundamental right to privacy. I believe that they deserve both transparency and accountability from the companies that have the capacity to trade on the details of their lives. And should they choose to leave personal information in the hands of those companies, they certainly deserve to know that their information is being safeguarded to the greatest degree possible.  <br/>This transparency and accountability should come from all the companies that have access to Americans' sensitive information. This includes internet service providers like Comcast and AT&amp;T, but also edge providers like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.  <br/>In 2011, I served as Chair for the inaugural hearing of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law - a subcommittee that I founded after it became abundantly clear that our nation's privacy laws had failed to keep pace with rapidly-evolving technologies.  <br/>When people talked about protecting their privacy when I was growing up, they were talking about protecting it from the government. They talked about unreasonable searches and seizures, about keeping the government out of their bedrooms. They talked about whether the government was trying to keep tabs on the books they read or the rallies they attended. Over the last 40 or 50 years, we've seen a fundamental shift in who has our information and what they're doing with it. That's not to say that we still shouldn't be worried about protecting ourselves from government abuses. But now, we also have relationships with large corporations that are obtaining, storing, sharing - and in many cases, selling - enormous amounts of our personal information.  <br/>When the Constitution was written, the founders had no way of anticipating the new technologies that would evolve in the coming centuries. They had no way of anticipating the telephone, for example, and so the Supreme Court ruled over 40 years ago that a wiretap constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. The founders had no idea that one day the police would be able to remotely track your movements through a GPS device, and so the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that this was also a search that required court approval.  <br/>All of this is a good thing: Our laws need to reflect the evolution of technology and the changing expectations of American society. This is why the Constitution is often called a \"living\" document. But we have a long way to go to get our modern laws in line with modern technology.  <br/>My goal for the Subcommittee was to help members understand both the benefits and privacy implications of emerging technologies; to educate the public and raise awareness about how their data are being collected, used, and shared; and, if necessary, to legislate to fill gaps in the law. And when politics prevented legislation, I repeatedly pressed companies - many of them more than once - to be more transparent about how they were treating their customers' private information, including users' location data, web-browsing histories, and even their finger and face prints.  <br/>As consumer awareness has evolved, these companies have taken important steps to improve transparency of their use of Americans' personal information, but unfortunately, accumulating massive troves of information isn't just a side project that they can choose to halt at any given time; for many of them, it's their whole business model. We are not their customers; we are their product.  <br/>Recently, we've seen just how scary this business model can be. In October of this year, the Judiciary Committee examined Russia's manipulation of social media during the 2016 election, and both the public and members of Congress were shocked to learn the outsized role that the major tech companies play in so many aspects of our lives, based primarily on the mass collection of our personal information and complex algorithms that are shrouded in secrecy.  <br/>Not only do these companies guide what we see, read, and buy on a regular basis, but their dominance - specifically in the market of information - now requires that we consider their role in the integrity of our democracy. And unfortunately, this fall's hearings demonstrated that they may not be up to the challenge that they've created for themselves.  <br/>The size of these companies is not - in isolation - the problem. But I am extremely concerned about these platforms' use of Americans' personal information to further solidify their market power and consequently extract unfair conditions from the content creators and innovators that rely on their platforms to reach consumers. And as has become alarmingly clear in recent months, companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have unprecedented power to guide Americans' access to information and potentially shape the future of journalism. It should go without saying that such power comes with great responsibility.  <br/>Everyone is currently - and rightfully - focused on Russian manipulation of social media, but as lawmakers, it is incumbent upon us to ask the broader questions. How did big tech come to control so many aspects of our lives? How is it using our personal information to strengthen its reach and its bottom line? Are these companies engaging in anticompetitive behavior that restricts the free flow of information and commerce? Are they failing to take simple precautions to respect our privacy and protect our democracy? And finally, what role should these companies play in our lives, and how do we ensure transparency and accountability from them going forward?  <br/>Modern technology has fundamentally altered the way we live our lives. And it's given us extraordinary benefits. But as these companies continue to grow and evolve, challenges like those we've recently confronted on the Judiciary Committee will only grow and evolve with them. So we must now muster the will to meaningfully address the tough questions related to competition, privacy, and ultimately the integrity of our democracy.  <br/>Now, I won't be here to ask those questions. I will do what I can to find the answers from the outside, but it's my colleagues in the Senate who must prioritize them going forward. There's simply too much at stake. And I know that they will do so with the help of a tireless advocacy community and the brilliant minds who have long contemplated these incredibly complex issues and ensured that lawmakers pay attention. And more importantly, they will do so with the support and encouragement of the American people.  <br/>I've witnessed significant highs and significant lows in the fight to protect consumers' rights, but the most important lesson that I've learned along the way is that ordinary Americans can wield extraordinary power when they raise their voices. For this reason, and despite significant setbacks in recent months, I know that it is the public's interests that can ultimately prevail.  <br/>Thank you, M. President.  <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN463504720171229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R96-01R1-J9XT-P46H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3233\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 29, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

President, I rise today to deliver the second in a series of floor speeches that I offer as I close out my time in the Senate.</p><p>This evening, I want to talk about Americans' relationship with telecommunications and technology companies, and what that means for their access to essential services and for their privacy.</p><p>When I entered the Senate in July 2009, then Majority Leader Reid asked me to serve on the Judiciary Committee. I pointed out that there are a lot of lawyers in the Senate, and that I wasn't one of them, but he said that he needed members with my perspective on the Committee. I wondered how my background could possibly serve me on Judiciary, but it did - almost immediately - when in December of that year, Comcast announced its intention to acquire NBCUniversal.</p><p>I happened to know a lot about the effects of media consolidation because I used to work in media. When powerful corporations are permitted to acquire other powerful corporations, it's the American consumers who are left facing higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service from their telecommunications providers. I questioned why an already powerful company should be allowed to get even bigger and thus extract more leverage over consumers and the businesses reliant on its platform.</p><p>And it was through my work on Comcast-NBCUniversal that I learned about the rising costs of internet, phone, and TV services, as well as the importance of preserving net neutrality. I also became interested in how giant telecommunications companies, as well as ever-evolving tech companies, were treating the massive troves of user data that they were collecting on a perpetual basis.</p><p>I believe that consumers have a fundamental right to know what information is being collected about them. I believe that they have a right to decide whether they want to share that information, and with whom they want to share it and when. And I believe that consumers have a right to expect that companies that store their personal information will store it securely.</p><p>I also believe that all Americans deserve affordable access to high-quality telecommunications services - services they depend on to communicate with the world, get an education, and find a job. And I believe that the internet should remain the open platform for innovation, economic growth, and freedom of expression that it has always been.</p><p>Perhaps it was the complex nature of these issues or even the financial incentive to turn a blind eye, but when I came to the Senate, very few members of Congress were talking about corporate consolidation or commercial privacy or net neutrality - issues that have gained much-deserved attention in more recent years. Whatever the reason for other members' hesitance, I felt that it was incumbent on me to get in the weeds on these issues, so that I could be a leader on them in the Senate and ultimately address the concerns of ordinary Minnesotans.</p><p>That's why when the interests of the American consumer have clashed with the desires of powerful telecommunications and technology companies, I've always tried to put the public first and to fight on their behalf - by shedding light on corporate abuses and using all the tools at my disposal to curb them.</p><p>Again, it is through my work on the Judiciary Committee - and more specifically my work on media and technology policy - that I believe my perspective from my previous career has been of most value.</p><p>Comcast's proposal to acquire NBCU immediately made me uncomfortable because I'd seen their motives for this deal before.</p><p>In 1993, during my thirteenth season at Saturday Night Live, the Big Three networks - NBC, CBS, and ABC - pressured Congress to change the rules that had previously prevented them from owning any of the shows that they aired in prime time. The purpose of the rules had been to prevent the networks from prioritizing their own shows over others or otherwise harming competing programming.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, after the rules were repealed, the networks began giving the shows they owned preferential treatment. At the time, Seinfeld, which aired on NBC, was the number one show on TV, which made the Thursday night time slot following Seinfeld the most valuable real estate on television. And I watched as the shows that eventually wound up in that premium location were all owned, at least in part, by NBC.</p><p>So, when I became a senator, one of the first major deals that I opposed was Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal. As in the case of AT&amp;T's current bid to buy Time Warner, this deal was about giving one company the ability to control both the programming and the pipes that carry it. I knew from my time in media that a combined Comcast-NBCU would have strong incentives to favor its own programming over that of others and restrict competing distributors from accessing that programming. I knew that these incentives would hurt competing content creators, inhibit the free flow of information, and ultimately harm consumers.</p><p>Unfortunately, I was not wrong. In the years after its acquisition of NBCUniversal, Comcast repeatedly violated the terms of its agreements with the FCC and DOJ, favoring its own news programming over its competitors in Comcast's channel lineup and failing to live up to its promises regarding affordable standalone broadband, racial diversity in programming, and online video distribution. And because merger conditions are extremely difficult and costly to enforce, competition and consumers were harmed in the process.</p><p>Comcast's behavior in the wake of acquiring NBCUniversal was one of the major reasons I then opposed its proposal to turn around and buy Time Warner Cable a couple years later. It's also one of the major reasons I believe that that later deal was ultimately dropped after objections from the FCC and DOJ.</p><p>For a long time in the Senate, it was a lonely battle. For over a year, I was the only senator to oppose Comcast's proposal to buy Time Warner Cable - a deal that would have given the combined company 57 percent of the broadband market. But advocates and ordinary citizens raised their voices, and together we were able to stop the deal.</p><p>Most recently, I've led my Senate colleagues in scrutinizing AT&amp;T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, and I've once again called on regulators to move to block the deal for the inevitable harm it will cause to competition and consumers.</p><p>I've been proud to lead these efforts. And I leave here in a much different environment than when I arrived. I know that there are strong voices in the Senate that will carry on the fight when I'm gone.</p><p>These efforts to slow down and halt media consolidation are part of a very important, larger development we've seen in our country. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the American public's - and, in turn, Congress' - interest in combatting corporate consolidation.</p><p>When I first entered the Senate, I wasn't sure that most Americans understood what was at stake when these powerful companies wanted to combine. Vertical integration and antitrust law sounded like obscure, almost boring, topics. But more and more Americans are getting educated about these issues, and more and more members of Congress are working to get Washington focused on how they affect the real lives of real people.</p><p>Just look at the fight for net neutrality.</p><p>For many of the same reasons that I opposed Comcast's acquisition of NBCU, I have long supported strong net neutrality rules to ensure that the internet remains a level playing field where everyone can participate on equal footing, free from discrimination by large internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T.</p><p>Net neutrality preserves the internet as the engine for innovation that it has always been and allows businesses of all sizes to thrive - even when they're up against the largest, most profitable corporations. Here's just one example that I've always found useful.</p><p>In 2005, three guys set up shop above a pizzeria in a strip mall in San Mateo, California, where they launched the now-ubiquitous YouTube. Video sharing websites were in their infancy, but these guys already faced competition from something called 'Google Video.' But Google Video wasn't very good.</p><p>Because of net neutrality, YouTube was able to compete with Google on a level playing field. The giant internet service providers treated YouTube's videos the same as they did Google's, and Google couldn't pay them to gain an unfair advantage, like a fast lane into consumers' homes. Unsurprisingly, people liked YouTube a lot more than Google Video, and YouTube thrived. In fact, in 2006, Google bought it for stock valued at $1.65 billion - nice chunk for three guys over a pizzeria in San Mateo.</p><p>But it's not just tech companies and small businesses that rely on an open internet. In a submission to the FCC in 2014, a coalition that includes Visa, Bank of America, UPS, and Ford explained that QUOTE 'Every retailer with an online catalogue, every manufacturer with online product specifications, every insurance company with online claims processing, every bank offering online account management, every company with a website-every business in America interacting with its customers online is dependent upon an open Internet.'</p><p>I've repeated this quote on the floor and at rallies time and time again over the years because I think it perfectly exemplifies the importance of this issue. Preserving net neutrality is only controversial for the few deep-pocketed entities that stand to financially gain without it.</p><p>If FCC Chairman Pai ultimately has his way, we'll be entering a digital world where the powerful outrank the majority; a world where a handful of multibillion-dollar companies have the power to control how users get their information; and a world where the deepest pockets can pay for a fast lane while their competitors stall in the slow lane.</p><p>For nearly nine years, I have been calling net neutrality the free speech issue of our time because it embraces our most basic constitutional freedoms. And ironically, the kind of civic participation that has inspired so many of us in recent months - and has effected real change, like in the fight for net neutrality and the successful efforts to save the Affordable Care Act-have depended, in no small part, on a free and open internet.</p><p>Now, in 2015, the FCC's vote to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act didn't just mean good things for net neutrality-it also had important implications for consumer privacy. It gave the agency the authority - and the responsibility - to implement rules to protect Americans' privacy by giving consumers greater control of their personal data that is collected and used by their broadband providers. That was a big win.</p><p>Republicans didn't see it that way. One of the first things they did this Congress was to repeal those rules, which was a huge blow to Americans' right to privacy.</p><p>For my part, I have long believed that Americans have a fundamental right to privacy. I believe that they deserve both transparency and accountability from the companies that have the capacity to trade on the details of their lives. And should they choose to leave personal information in the hands of those companies, they certainly deserve to know that their information is being safeguarded to the greatest degree possible.</p><p>This transparency and accountability should come from all the companies that have access to Americans' sensitive information. This includes internet service providers like Comcast and AT&amp;T, but also edge providers like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.</p><p>In 2011, I served as Chair for the inaugural hearing of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law - a subcommittee that I founded after it became abundantly clear that our nation's privacy laws had failed to keep pace with rapidly-evolving technologies.</p><p>When people talked about protecting their privacy when I was growing up, they were talking about protecting it from the government. They talked about unreasonable searches and seizures, about keeping the government out of their bedrooms. They talked about whether the government was trying to keep tabs on the books they read or the rallies they attended. Over the last 40 or 50 years, we've seen a fundamental shift in who has our information and what they're doing with it. That's not to say that we still shouldn't be worried about protecting ourselves from government abuses. But now, we also have relationships with large corporations that are obtaining, storing, sharing - and in many cases, selling - enormous amounts of our personal information.</p><p>When the Constitution was written, the founders had no way of anticipating the new technologies that would evolve in the coming centuries. They had no way of anticipating the telephone, for example, and so the Supreme Court ruled over 40 years ago that a wiretap constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. The founders had no idea that one day the police would be able to remotely track your movements through a GPS device, and so the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that this was also a search that required court approval.</p><p>All of this is a good thing: Our laws need to reflect the evolution of technology and the changing expectations of American society. This is why the Constitution is often called a 'living' document. But we have a long way to go to get our modern laws in line with modern technology.</p><p>My goal for the Subcommittee was to help members understand both the benefits and privacy implications of emerging technologies; to educate the public and raise awareness about how their data are being collected, used, and shared; and, if necessary, to legislate to fill gaps in the law. And when politics prevented legislation, I repeatedly pressed companies - many of them more than once - to be more transparent about how they were treating their customers' private information, including users' location data, web-browsing histories, and even their finger and face prints.</p><p>As consumer awareness has evolved, these companies have taken important steps to improve transparency of their use of Americans' personal information, but unfortunately, accumulating massive troves of information isn't just a side project that they can choose to halt at any given time; for many of them, it's their whole business model. We are not their customers; we are their product.</p><p>Recently, we've seen just how scary this business model can be. In October of this year, the Judiciary Committee examined Russia's manipulation of social media during the 2016 election, and both the public and members of Congress were shocked to learn the outsized role that the major tech companies play in so many aspects of our lives, based primarily on the mass collection of our personal information and complex algorithms that are shrouded in secrecy.</p><p>Not only do these companies guide what we see, read, and buy on a regular basis, but their dominance - specifically in the market of information - now requires that we consider their role in the integrity of our democracy. And unfortunately, this fall's hearings demonstrated that they may not be up to the challenge that they've created for themselves.</p><p>The size of these companies is not - in isolation - the problem. But I am extremely concerned about these platforms' use of Americans' personal information to further solidify their market power and consequently extract unfair conditions from the content creators and innovators that rely on their platforms to reach consumers. And as has become alarmingly clear in recent months, companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have unprecedented power to guide Americans' access to information and potentially shape the future of journalism. It should go without saying that such power comes with great responsibility.</p><p>Everyone is currently - and rightfully - focused on Russian manipulation of social media, but as lawmakers, it is incumbent upon us to ask the broader questions. How did big tech come to control so many aspects of our lives? How is it using our personal information to strengthen its reach and its bottom line? Are these companies engaging in anticompetitive behavior that restricts the free flow of information and commerce? Are they failing to take simple precautions to respect our privacy and protect our democracy? And finally, what role should these companies play in our lives, and how do we ensure transparency and accountability from them going forward?</p><p>Modern technology has fundamentally altered the way we live our lives. And it's given us extraordinary benefits. But as these companies continue to grow and evolve, challenges like those we've recently confronted on the Judiciary Committee will only grow and evolve with them. So we must now muster the will to meaningfully address the tough questions related to competition, privacy, and ultimately the integrity of our democracy.</p><p>Now, I won't be here to ask those questions. I will do what I can to find the answers from the outside, but it's my colleagues in the Senate who must prioritize them going forward. There's simply too much at stake. And I know that they will do so with the help of a tireless advocacy community and the brilliant minds who have long contemplated these incredibly complex issues and ensured that lawmakers pay attention. And more importantly, they will do so with the support and encouragement of the American people.</p><p>I've witnessed significant highs and significant lows in the fight to protect consumers' rights, but the most important lesson that I've learned along the way is that ordinary Americans can wield extraordinary power when they raise their voices. For this reason, and despite significant setbacks in recent months, I know that it is the public's interests that can ultimately prevail.</p><p>Thank you, M. President.</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS828007I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R95-V3G1-JDG9-Y2PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3215\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 29, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He also discussed this morning\u2019s SenateCommerce Committee hearing entitled, \u201cTerrorism and Social Media: Is Big Tech Doing Enough?\u201d and his return to the Senate Banking Committee, which today voted in support of Jay Powell to chair the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.  </p><p><br/>Joe Kernen (3:40): \u201cBoth sides use immigration as sort of a political football to highlight worries about terrorism, the people that want to end chain migration and lotteries, they say that, I don\u2019t know, most of the incidents that have happened have been perpetrated by individuals that got here that way. Others say \u2018not so.\u2019 What\u2019s the right middle ground there, how do we solve, where do you think we\u2019re going to go? Will the government stay open?\u201d  <br/>Sen. Moran (4:19): \u201cWe ought to have a continuing resolution, not shut down government, but we ought to do it for a very short period of time \u2013 a day or two \u2013 and stay here and resolve these differences. Because not only are we talking about DACA and immigration, the attempt to resolve those issues which are very important, but also disaster assistance, the list is long133; CHIP, the program for healthcare, the Collins-Nelson bill. We ought not delay these things until March. I\u2019m a member of the Appropriations Committee as well and I don\u2019t want us to be back here in February with another continuing resolution. We need to get out of the CR business and get to doing 12 appropriations bills. This is where we can prioritize spending, we can reduce spending, and perhaps most importantly we can rein in agencies, departments and bureaucrats with directions about how the money can be spent.\u201d  <br/>Sen. Moran (5:14): \u201cCongress every once in a while, we get some credit these days and it\u2019s perhaps one of our greater successes \u2013 reining in regulations.

Because not only are we talking about DACA and immigration, the attempt to resolve those issues which are very important, but also disaster assistance, the list is long\u2026 CHIP, the program for healthcare, the Collins-Nelson bill. We ought not delay these things until March. I\u2019m a member of the Appropriations Committee as well and I don\u2019t want us to be back here in February with another continuing resolution. We need to get out of the CR business and get to doing 12 appropriations bills.

Dems and the media have moved on from blaming Hillary Clinton's loss on Vladimir Putin; now they're blaming Facebook and Cambridge Analytica[1]. Gus Hurwitz[2] and I have doubts about the claims of illegality, but I reprise my frequent critique of privacy laws: they are uniquely likely to be enforced against those who annoy governing elites (because they're so vague and disconnected from objectionable conduct that they can be enforced against almost anyone). Alan Cohn describes the many regulatory agencies now feeling emboldened to take a whack at cryptocurrencies[3]. He's hopeful that only bad actors will actually feel the blow. I lay out the remarkably aggressive, and novel, enforcement philosophy behind CFIUS's rejection of the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal[4] - and the steadily advancing Congressional effort[5] to regulate Silicon Valley's Chinese connections more closely. That effort has featured some remarkably harsh political attacks[6] on tech giants like IBM and GE. </p><p>Is all this hate for techies good or bad for the effort to reimpose net neutrality[7] through the courts? The states[8]? Stephanie Roy maps the terrain, which turns out to be every bit as muddled as you thought the last time you read about it. Need another reason to hate technology? How about this: hackers are soon going to kill someone[9]. I explain the latest scary reports from Saudi Arabia's industrial control system[10] - and America's[11]. Pressed for time, we do quick hits on stories that deserved more but got crowded out:Why you won't go wrong betting that privacy zealots[12] hate cybersecurity[13]. Trouble in AMD's chipsets[14] raises backdoor and supply chain worries. Treasury sanctions the usual Russians for election meddling[15]. Hal Martin's[16] dumb argument for making mass theft of classified documents harder (\"Geez, who can keep track of a single document when you're stealing terabytes?\") is rejected. And for those who wonder why the right is starting to hate Big Tech as much as the left does, here's one week's worth of stories from Silicon Valley that got heavy attention from conservative sites: Twitter suspends comedian Steven Crowder[17] for a video in which an intern crashed an LGBTQ meeting in SXSW claiming to identify as a computer. YouTube[18] follows suit. Yet somehow Louis Farrakhan[19] keeps both his Twitter account and its coveted blue check while tweeting crap like this: \"the FBI has been the worst enemy of Black advancement. The Jews have control over those agencies of government.\" At the same time that it's broadcasting Farrakhan, Twitter[20] seems to be blocking much of the Drudge Report. And Western Journal (WJ)[21]says Facebook's new algorithm for \"giving a boost to quality news\" reduced lefty site traffic by 2 percent and righty site traffic by 14 percent. As an example, comparing two NY tabloids with very different politics, WJ says the change boosted Facebook's traffic to the lefty Daily News by 24 percent and cut the righty NY Post's traffic by 11 percent. (Similar claims[22] were made by another conservative site using a different methodology. Finally, our interview is with Pete Chronis[23], Turner's Chief Information Security Officer, and author of the new book, The Cyber Conundrum[24]. Pete lays out his vision for a cybersecurity moon shot, and the two of us explore particular cybersecurity remedies that make up the effort. We take detours to consider the vulnerabilities equities process[25], both here[26] and in China[27]. We also touch on the unwise purist stand being taken by IETF on TLS 1.3;[28] the engineers seem determined to offer internet users what might be called \"Privacy and Insecurity - By Design.\" (And to bring this post full circle, if you were wondering why ordinary people are getting sick of dancing to the tune of Silicon Valley engineers, the IETF's stiff-necked and counterproductive position on security for corporate network users would be a good place to start.)

That law lets online services post content from users without assuming legal liability for it, as traditional publishers do. </p><p>The DOJ's proposal would remove that protection if those services... ...purposefully facilitate or solicit third-party content that violates federal law....fail to apply \"good faith\" in content moderation, meaning they consistently apply their own terms of service and provide \"reasonable\" explanations of enforcement actions....\"purposefully blind themselves and law enforcement to illicit material.\" That's a reference to platforms that encrypt users' communications without giving the government access. The big picture: The DOJ proposals join a raft of other plans to modify Section 230. President Trump's May 28 \"Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship\"[2] called for narrowing the scope of the law and ordered the Commerce Department to petition the Federal Communications Commission to craft and enforce rules that would narrow the law.A bill proposed Wednesday by Sen. Josh Hawley[3] (R-Mo.) would require online platforms to include in their terms of service a pledge of \"good faith\" and all details of their content moderation policies, then let users who feel wronged sue the firms.The EARN IT Act[4], an earlier bipartisan proposal in the Senate, took aim at child sexual exploitation online and threatened platforms with losing their immunity under Section 230 if they failed to meet government-set standards for preventing abuse. Between the lines: Most of these proposals are fueled by conservatives' anger at what they view as bias and censorship by the platforms, most prominently Twitter's move to police two[5] of Trump's tweets[6]. Perception of such bias is widespread on the right, but evidence remains scarce. What they're saying: \"The era of self-regulation for Silicon Valley is over,\" said Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.). \"No longer will we let Big Tech hide behind these liability protections as a pretense to bully competitors or to suppress free speech.\"\"The practical effects of the recommendations are to repeal Section 230 because they allow completely unfounded litigation to get past early dismissal,\" said Neil Chilson, senior research fellow with the Charles Koch Institute and former chief technologist at the Federal Trade Commission. \"Given that Section 230 never immunized platforms from federal crimes, the biggest effect is to enable trial lawyers to bring a wide range of cases that they couldn't before.\"The DOJ proposals \"would seriously curtail platforms' ability to moderate content and respond quickly to emerging problems \u2014 like new kinds of abusive online behavior, which internet users are endlessly inventive in coming up with,\" said Daphne Keller, director of the program on platform regulation at Stanford's Cyber Policy Center.A Facebook spokesperson: \"The Trump administration has said we have censored too much content and Democrats and civil rights groups are saying that we aren't taking down enough. Section 230 allows us to focus on what matters most: fighting harmful content while protecting political speech.\" Our thought bubble: Aggrieved users have been demanding \"good faith\" and consistency from content moderators for as long as we've been online \u2014 from today's social networks to blogging platforms, comment sections to discussion forums, bulletin boards to USENET. Handing responsibility for resolving these endless queues of contention to the legal system might benefit lawyers and judges, but it's unlikely to satisfy anyone else. \"It is definitely a full employment act for lawyers. We can litigate this endlessly and still not know for sure what the standards for things like 'good faith' are.\" Keller says. The bottom line: The odds aren't good for any of these bills to pass a Congress where each party controls one house. But some of the promoters of rewriting Section 230 may be less interested in enacting a law than in intimidating tech companies.

Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, has introduced Senate Bill 6281, which he hopes will be able to appeal to a diversity of stakeholders in its pursuit of an overarching policy framework.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bill, whose stipulations apply to companies with 100,000 customers or more, set out a framework in which consumers have \"data rights of access, correction, deletion, data portability and opt out of the processing.\" However, the bill has also left out several consumer privileges long sought by privacy rights activists, like a private right action provision, which would allow individuals to sue technology companies for abuses and leaves enforcement authority instead to the state's attorney general.</p><p>\"When the previous bill didn't pass the House, we spent an incredibly robust six-plus months since the last session working with stakeholders, working with consumer privacy groups and advocates [and the House] ... in a thorough, expansive effort to reach consensus so that we can move forward,\" Carlyle said, speaking with Government Technology.</p><p>Those stakeholders included powerful technology lobby groups like CompTIA, TechNet, and the Internet Association. Carlyle said he also took input from consumer and civil rights groups like Consumer Reports and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which he said were sometimes involved in negotiations over bill language with industry representatives.</p><p>But some of those rights groups have actually lined up behind several opposing pieces of legislation introduced by Rep. Norma Smith, R-Clinton. Smith, who is the ranking member of the state's House Innovation, Technology and Economic Development Committee, has worked together with the ACLU and other consumer groups to craft five bills that would create consumer rights over a person's data and biometric identifiers.</p><p>Smith's legislation would do a number of things to expand consumer rights. They include creating a charter of consumer data rights around which companies would have to structure their data policies as well as transforming the office of the state's chief privacy officer from an appointed one to an elected one, making it more accountable to the public. It would also provide for a private right of action and force data brokers to register with the state, among other things.</p><p>Smith said that Carlyle's legislation leaves numerous loopholes that will allow companies to take get away with privacy abuses.</p><p>\"It is a very corporate-centric bill,\" she said. \"You [should] start with a consumer focus. You build a bill that really empowers consumers, that provides clear direction as regards to the corporate responsibility ... and then [provide] strong enforcement mechanisms.\"</p><p>Smith also provided GT with copies of letters from the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer lobbying group, which were submitted to the Senate and House that argue Carlyle's legislation would \"do little to change business practices built on exploiting individuals' personal information for profit or provide meaningful privacy protections for Washingtonians,\" and were overly influenced by \"Big Tech.\"</p><p>\"I just have a different policy view,\" Carlyle said, responding to Smith's criticism. \"Her work is very thoughtful ... I think her policy position is just as legitimate as the approach I'm taking on.\"</p><p>Carlyle said that his bill, which is built to take on the abuses of large companies, has been instructed by large privacy bills that came before it and that the law, should it pass, would continue to evolve and be adapted to improve consumer rights.</p><p>\"What we learned from GDPR and from California is that [it's important to] get the larger entities data right relative to the consumer's right to opt out, delete and correct, [which] then allows us to learn and bring smaller businesses onboard down the road as we fine tune, rather than thrusting this obligation on every single industry in every single sector,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't think that we're ever going to be done dealing with the regulatory framework of consumer data and the issue of privacy. We're living in a new era,\" he said.</p><p>Government Technology is a sister site to Governing.

'This legislation represents a significant breakthrough \u2014 the first time a state or nation has passed a new law devoted exclusively to putting guardrails in place for the use of facial recognition technology,' Smith wrote in a blog post[1]. But why is Microsoft so happy about new tech restrictions coming to its own home state? Probably because the company helped create them. </p><p>Microsoft lobbied hard for the bill, which was sponsored by own of its own employees: State senator Joe Nguyen, a senior program manager at the software giant. [Read: Snowden says the surveillance states we're creating now will outlast the coronavirus[2]] Washington's new rules are more detailed than those in any other US state[3], many of which have no laws about facial recognition at all. But they're also much laxer than cities such as San Francisco, which has outright banned local agencies from using the tech[4]. That means Microsoft can still cash in when customers in Washington want facial recognition tech, whether it's identifying customers or searching for suspected criminals. Even better for Microsoft, some of the rules are to the company's benefit. The law only permits government agencies to use the software if it's got an application programming interface (API), or some other tech that tests performance across different groups of users. It also requires vendors to reveal any reports of bias. Smith cheerily noted that what's good for the public is also good for business, as the testing will help companies improve the tech \u2014 and convince customers it works. 'Washington's new law shows how regulation and market forces can move forward together in a way that advances innovation to meet public needs,' he said.Why big tech is backing regulationNow that the backlash against big tech made new regulation inevitable, Silicon Valley giants have been focusing on influencing the rules that govern them. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has endorsed federal privacy legislation[5], Jeff Bezos says[6] Amazon is generously writing facial recognition laws to pitch to lawmakers, and Alphabet boss Sundar Pichar has called for AI regulation[7]. Pichar gave a hint of the motivations during a January policy speech in the EU's hometown of Brussels: 'Sensible regulation must also take a proportionate approach, balancing potential harms with social opportunities,' he said[8]. 'This is especially true in areas that are high risk and high value.' Facial recognition has particularly high risks and high value. The surveillance software is a powerful security tool, but it also threatens privacy rights and is notoriously biased against women and people of color[9]. In fairness to Washington's legislators, some of the state's new rules will help protect civil liberties. Before using facial recognition, agencies will have to first give public notice, hold at least three community meetings, and publish a report on the potential impact Humans will have to review any decisions based on the tech, such as verifying the identity of somebody it's flagged for attention, and law enforcement agencies will need a warrant to use it in their investigations. It's better than no limits at all, but that doesn't make it good enough \u2014 whatever Microsoft says.

Probably because the company helped create them.<br/>Microsoft lobbied hard for the bill, which was sponsored by own of its own employees: State senator Joe Nguyen, a senior program manager at the software giant.<br/>[Read: Snowden says the surveillance states we're creating now will outlast the coronavirus]<br/>Washington's new rules are more detailed than those in any other US state, many of which have no laws about facial recognition at all. But they're also much laxer than cities such as San Francisco, which has outright banned local agencies from using the tech.<br/>That means Microsoft can still cash in when customers in Washington want facial recognition tech, whether it's identifying customers or searching for suspected criminals.<br/>Even better for Microsoft, some of the rules are to the company's benefit.<br/>The law only permits government agencies to use the software if it's got an application programming interface (API), or some other tech that tests performance across different groups of users. It also requires vendors to reveal any reports of bias.<br/>Smith cheerily noted that what's good for the public is also good for business, as the testing will help companies improve the tech - and convince customers it works.<br/>\"Washington's new law shows how regulation and market forces can move forward together in a way that advances innovation to meet public needs,\" he said.<br/>Why big tech is backing regulationNow that the backlash against big tech made new regulation inevitable, Silicon Valley giants have been focusing on influencing the rules that govern them.<br/>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has endorsed federal privacy legislation, Jeff Bezos says Amazon is generously writing facial recognition laws to pitch to lawmakers, and Alphabet boss Sundar Pichar has called for AI regulation.<br/>Pichar gave a hint of the motivations during a January policy speech in the EU's hometown of Brussels:<br/>\"Sensible regulation must also take a proportionate approach, balancing potential harms with social opportunities,\" he said. \"This is especially true in areas that are high risk and high value.\"<br/>Facial recognition has particularly high risks and high value. The surveillance software is a powerful security tool, but it also threatens privacy rights and is notoriously biased against women and people of color.<br/>In fairness to Washington's legislators, some of the state's new rules will help protect civil liberties.

With the chief executives of Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon arrayed on screens in front of him, the firebrand Republican congressman let rip. \"I'll just cut to the chase. Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" he said, referring to Google's \"censorship\" of far-right sites such as Breitbart and The Daily Caller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mary Gay Scanlon, a Democrat, hit back. \"I'd like to redirect your attention to antitrust law rather than fringe conspiracy theories,\" she said. Jordan began yelling. The gavel pounded. Jamie Raskin, another Democrat, screamed \"Put your mask on!\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was an unedifying moment in an otherwise momentous day. The hearing in front of the House judiciary's antitrust subcommittee marked the first time the bosses of America's tech titans - minus Microsoft - were together asked the same questions: are you too big? Are you abusing your power to crush competition, hurt consumers and undermine society?</p><p>The answers were rehearsed and broadly clung to a similar, if tenuous, argument, of which more shortly. But what was clear was that this hearing was different from previous ones, which were often hastily organised affairs in response to a specific scandal. Beyond the grandstanding and political theatre, congressmen were better prepared. They asked tougher, more probing questions. Committee chairman David Cicilline was clear: \"These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated.\" There is reason to believe he will follow through on his words with a long-promised crackdown on Silicon Valley.</p><p>The antitrust movement has its roots in the early 20th century when government began breaking up monopolies in steel, oil and, decades later, telecoms. The challenges posed by the Silicon Valley behemoths are very different. The reason those powers have not been exercised is that since the late 1970s, a shift in antitrust orthodoxy made the concept of consumer welfare the guiding principle.</p><p>The idea was that unless customers were being gouged, there was no harm - but given that on the internet so many of the services are free to the end user, this concept is no longer fit for purpose. A revamped regime is likely to take a more expansive view of harms - to include predatory pricing and other anti-competitive behaviour - as reasons to fine, penalise or even break up the tech giants.</p><p>The hearing traces back 13 months, to the first week in June, when the tectonic plates shifted dramatically beneath the feet of the Big Four. Up to that point, none had ever been investigated on antitrust grounds, aside from Google. Within hours of each other, however, Cicilline's committee, along with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, each launched antitrust probes into all four. States' attorneys-general followed suit.</p><p>The decades of unfettered growth and astounding lack of any real regulation appeared, finally, to be coming to a close. Which led to last week's public flogging. The four companies are together worth $5 trillion (\u00a33.8 trillion), sit atop a cash mountain of $420bn and last year generated $770bn in sales. Yet the tycoons who run them all attempted to paint their companies as the plucky start-ups they once were. \"Many of our competitors have hundreds of millions or billions of users,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, plaintively. \"History shows if we don't keep innovating, someone will replace every company here today.\"</p><p>No one seemed moved by his argument, or really any of the points that the chief executives attempted to get across over nearly six hours. Their answers were not really the point. The hearing was an exercise in framing: to cast a group of disparate companies as varied shades of the same threat. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon may operate in different markets and in different ways, but they are all gatekeepers with the power to set the rules for companies that must go through their platforms to reach customers.</p><p>A year of digging by Congress has yielded 1.3 million internal documents. In emails, executives unguardedly talk of \"land grabs\" and \"neutralising\" threats - hardly the lexicon of starry-eyed disruptors - providing the ammunition for lawmakers no longer willing to take Big Tech at its word. The Department of Justice is understood to be weeks away from filing an antitrust lawsuit against Google.</p><p>Congress's resolve to bring the sector to heel was no doubt buttressed on Thursday when Amazon, Apple and Facebook all posted \"blow-out\" financial results for the three months to June. Facebook doubled profits to $5.2bn despite a 1,000-strong advertiser boycott. Alphabet, Google's parent, saw sales decline for the first time in its history, dropping 2% to $38bn, though its $7bn in profits still beat Wall Street expectations. While the rest of the economy is in flames, Apple and Amazon posted record quarters.</p><p>Each of the companies is vulnerable in different ways. For Apple it is the App Store. The iPhone giant charges companies 30% for any money spent on or in apps that operate on its phones, iPads and computers. Cicilline called it \"highway robbery\". Apple says it is the cost of access to what is essentially one of the world's biggest storefronts: there are 1.5 billion Apple devices in use.</p><p>The European Union launched a market abuse inquiry into the App Store last month after Spotify complained that Apple was forcing it to pay 15% of its income. With Amazon, politicians were interested in whether it mines the data of companies that sell via its website to develop its own, rival products. The company opened a probe after a Wall Street Journal expos\u00e9 revealed the practice.</p><p>Amazon's Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, offered this unconvincing response: \"We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private-label business, but I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\"</p><p>Google will get hit over the same issue: operating a marketplace while also participating in it. A recent report in The Markup found travel searches on Google regularly returned Google's own flight and booking results ahead of rivals'. Google called the analysis \"flawed and misleading\".</p><p>Facebook was framed as a paranoid crusher of competitors, with many of the queries revolving around its takeover of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Congress cited emails that laid bare Zuckerberg's ruthless streak. In one email, he admitted his company could \"likely always just buy any competitive start-up\".</p><p>Big Tech will struggle to pass off its sharp-elbowed tactics as consumer- friendly, but it will try. Both Google and Amazon have more lobbyists in their pay than there are sitting US senators.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-64900392</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GW-1N31-JCJY-G1TK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1115\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 2, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

With the chief executives of Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon arrayed on screens in front of him, the firebrand Republican congressman let rip. \"I'll just cut to the chase. Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" he said, referring to Google's \"censorship\" of farright sites such as Breitbart and The Daily Caller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mary Gay Scanlon, a Democrat, hit back. \"I'd like to redirect your attention to antitrust law rather than fringe conspiracy theories,\" she said. Jordan began yelling. The gavel pounded. Jamie Raskin, another Democrat, screamed \"Put your mask on!\".</p><p>It was an unedifying moment in an otherwise momentous day. The hearing in front of the House judiciary's antitrust subcommittee marked the first time the bosses of America's tech titans - minus Microsoft - were together asked the same questions: are you too big? Are you abusing your power to crush competition, hurt consumers and undermine society? The answers were rehearsed and broadly clung to a similar, if tenuous, argument, of which more shortly. But what was clear was that this hearing was different from previous ones, which were often hastily organised affairs in response to a specific scandal. Beyond the grandstanding and political theatre, congressmen were better prepared. They asked tougher, more probing questions. Committee chairman David Cicilline was clear: \"These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated.\" There is reason to believe he will follow through on his words with a longpromised crackdown on Silicon Valley. The antitrust movement has its roots in the early 20th century when government began breaking up monopolies in steel, oil and, decades later, telecoms. The challenges posed by the Silicon Valley behemoths are very different. The reason those powers have not been exercised is that since the late 1970s, a shift in antitrust orthodoxy made the concept of consumer welfare the guiding principle.</p><p>The idea was that unless customers were being gouged, there was no harm - but given that on the internet so many of the services are free to the end user, this concept is no longer fit for purpose. A revamped regime is likely to take a more expansive view of harms - to include predatory pricing and other anti-competitive behaviour - as reasons to fine, penalise or even break up the tech giants. The hearing traces back 13 months, to the first week in June, when the tectonic plates shifted dramatically beneath the feet of the Big Four. Up to that point, none had ever been investigated on antitrust grounds, aside from Google. Within hours of each other, however, Cicilline's committee, along with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, each launched antitrust probes into all four. States' attorneys-general followed suit.</p><p>The decades of unfettered growth and astounding lack of any real regulation appeared, finally, to be coming to a close. Which led to last week's public flogging. The four companies are together worth $5 trillion (\u00a33.8 trillion), sit atop a cash mountain of $420bn and last year generated $770bn in sales. Yet the tycoons who run them all attempted to paint their companies as the plucky start-ups they once were. \"Many of our competitors have hundreds of millions or billions of users,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, plaintively. \"History shows if we don't keep innovating, someone will replace every company here today.\"No one seemed moved by his argument, or really any of the points that the chief executives attempted to get across over nearly six hours. Their answers were not really the point. The hearing was an exercise in framing: to cast a group of disparate companies as varied shades of the same threat. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon may operate in different markets and in different ways, but they are all gatekeepers with the power to set the rules for companies that must go through their platforms to reach customers.</p><p>A year of digging by Congress has yielded 1.3 million internal documents. In emails, executives unguardedly talk of \"land grabs\" and \"neutralising\" threats - hardly the lexicon of starry-eyed disruptors - providing the ammunition for lawmakers no longer willing to take Big Tech at its word. The Department of Justice is understood to be weeks away from filing an antitrust lawsuit against Google.</p><p>Congress's resolve to bring the sector to heel was no doubt buttressed on Thursday when Amazon, Apple and Facebook all posted \"blow-out\" financial results for the three months to June. Facebook doubled profits to $5.2bn despite a 1,000-strong advertiser boycott. Alphabet, Google's parent, saw sales decline for the first time in its history, dropping 2% to $38bn, though its $7bn in profits still beat Wall Street expectations. While the rest of the economy is in flames, Apple and Amazon posted record quarters.</p><p>Each of the companies is vulnerable in different ways. For Apple it is the App Store. The iPhone giant charges companies 30% for any money spent on or in apps that operate on its phones, iPads and computers. Cicilline called it \"highway robbery\". Apple says it is the cost of access to what is essentially one of the world's biggest storefronts: there are 1.5 billion Apple devices in use.</p><p>The European Union launched a market abuse inquiry into the App Store last month after Spotify complained that Apple was forcing it to pay 15% of its income. With Amazon, politicians were interested in whether it mines the data of companies that sell via its website to develop its own, rival products. The company opened a probe after a Wall Street Journal expos\u00e9 revealed the practice.</p><p>Amazon's Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, offered this unconvincing response: \"We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private-label business, but I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\"</p><p>Google will get hit over the same issue: operating a marketplace while also participating in it. A recent report in The Markup found travel searches on Google regularly returned Google's own flight and booking results ahead of rivals'. Google called the analysis \"flawed and misleading\".</p><p>Facebook was framed as a paranoid crusher of competitors, with many of the queries revolving around its takeover of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Congress cited emails that laid bare Zuckerberg's ruthless streak. In one email, he admitted his company could \"likely always just buy any competitive start-up\".</p><p>Big Tech will struggle to pass off its sharp-elbowed tactics as consumerfriendly, but it will try. Both Google and Amazon have more lobbyists in their pay than there are sitting US senators.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Hot seat: clockwise from top left, Sundar Pichai of Google, Apple's Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Jeff Bezos of Amazon</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-162047749</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GW-NGW1-DYTY-C4PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1115\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 2, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

With the chief executives of Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon arrayed on screens in front of him, the firebrand Republican congressman let rip. \"I'll just cut to the chase. Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" he said, referring to Google's \"censorship\" of farright sites such as Breitbart and The Daily Caller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mary Gay Scanlon, a Democrat, hit back. \"I'd like to redirect your attention to antitrust law rather than fringe conspiracy theories,\" she said. Jordan began yelling. The gavel pounded. Jamie Raskin, another Democrat, screamed \"Put your mask on!\".</p><p>It was an unedifying moment in an otherwise momentous day. The hearing in front of the House judiciary's antitrust subcommittee marked the first time the bosses of America's tech titans - minus Microsoft - were together asked the same questions: are you too big? Are you abusing your power to crush competition, hurt consumers and undermine society? The answers were rehearsed and broadly clung to a similar, if tenuous, argument, of which more shortly. But what was clear was that this hearing was different from previous ones, which were often hastily organised affairs in response to a specific scandal. Beyond the grandstanding and political theatre, congressmen were better prepared. They asked tougher, more probing questions. Committee chairman David Cicilline was clear: \"These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated.\" There is reason to believe he will follow through on his words with a longpromised crackdown on Silicon Valley. The antitrust movement has its roots in the early 20th century when government began breaking up monopolies in steel, oil and, decades later, telecoms. The challenges posed by the Silicon Valley behemoths are very different. The reason those powers have not been exercised is that since the late 1970s, a shift in antitrust orthodoxy made the concept of consumer welfare the guiding principle.</p><p>The idea was that unless customers were being gouged, there was no harm - but given that on the internet so many of the services are free to the end user, this concept is no longer fit for purpose. A revamped regime is likely to take a more expansive view of harms - to include predatory pricing and other anti-competitive behaviour - as reasons to fine, penalise or even break up the tech giants. The hearing traces back 13 months, to the first week in June, when the tectonic plates shifted dramatically beneath the feet of the Big Four. Up to that point, none had ever been investigated on antitrust grounds, aside from Google. Within hours of each other, however, Cicilline's committee, along with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, each launched antitrust probes into all four. States' attorneys-general followed suit.</p><p>The decades of unfettered growth and astounding lack of any real regulation appeared, finally, to be coming to a close. Which led to last week's public flogging. The four companies are together worth $5 trillion (\u00a33.8 trillion), sit atop a cash mountain of $420bn and last year generated $770bn in sales. Yet the tycoons who run them all attempted to paint their companies as the plucky start-ups they once were. \"Many of our competitors have hundreds of millions or billions of users,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, plaintively. \"History shows if we don't keep innovating, someone will replace every company here today.\"No one seemed moved by his argument, or really any of the points that the chief executives attempted to get across over nearly six hours. Their answers were not really the point. The hearing was an exercise in framing: to cast a group of disparate companies as varied shades of the same threat. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon may operate in different markets and in different ways, but they are all gatekeepers with the power to set the rules for companies that must go through their platforms to reach customers.</p><p>A year of digging by Congress has yielded 1.3 million internal documents. In emails, executives unguardedly talk of \"land grabs\" and \"neutralising\" threats - hardly the lexicon of starry-eyed disruptors - providing the ammunition for lawmakers no longer willing to take Big Tech at its word. The Department of Justice is understood to be weeks away from filing an antitrust lawsuit against Google.</p><p>Congress's resolve to bring the sector to heel was no doubt buttressed on Thursday when Amazon, Apple and Facebook all posted \"blow-out\" financial results for the three months to June. Facebook doubled profits to $5.2bn despite a 1,000-strong advertiser boycott. Alphabet, Google's parent, saw sales decline for the first time in its history, dropping 2% to $38bn, though its $7bn in profits still beat Wall Street expectations. While the rest of the economy is in flames, Apple and Amazon posted record quarters.</p><p>Each of the companies is vulnerable in different ways. For Apple it is the App Store. The iPhone giant charges companies 30% for any money spent on or in apps that operate on its phones, iPads and computers. Cicilline called it \"highway robbery\". Apple says it is the cost of access to what is essentially one of the world's biggest storefronts: there are 1.5 billion Apple devices in use.</p><p>The European Union launched a market abuse inquiry into the App Store last month after Spotify complained that Apple was forcing it to pay 15% of its income. With Amazon, politicians were interested in whether it mines the data of companies that sell via its website to develop its own, rival products. The company opened a probe after a Wall Street Journal expos\u00e9 revealed the practice.</p><p>Amazon's Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, offered this unconvincing response: \"We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private-label business, but I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\"</p><p>Google will get hit over the same issue: operating a marketplace while also participating in it. A recent report in The Markup found travel searches on Google regularly returned Google's own flight and booking results ahead of rivals'. Google called the analysis \"flawed and misleading\".</p><p>Facebook was framed as a paranoid crusher of competitors, with many of the queries revolving around its takeover of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Congress cited emails that laid bare Zuckerberg's ruthless streak. In one email, he admitted his company could \"likely always just buy any competitive start-up\".</p><p>Big Tech will struggle to pass off its sharp-elbowed tactics as consumerfriendly, but it will try. Both Google and Amazon have more lobbyists in their pay than there are sitting US senators.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Hot seat: clockwise from top left, Sundar Pichai of Google, Apple's Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Jeff Bezos of Amazon</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-162038386</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GW-NGW1-DYTY-C426-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1115\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 2, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Mr. President, I rise to deliver the second in a series of floor speeches that I offer as I close out my time in the Senate. This afternoon, I want to talk about Americans' relationship with telecommunications and technology companies and what that means for their access to essential services and for their privacy. When I entered the Senate in July of 2009, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid asked me to serve on the Judiciary Committee. </p><p>I pointed out that there are a lot of lawyers in the Senate and that I wasn't one of them, but he said he needed Members with my perspective on the committee. I wondered how my background could possibly serve me on Judiciary, but it did--almost immediately--when in December of that year, Comcast announced its intention to acquire NBCUniversal. I happened to know a lot about the effects of media consolidation because I used to work in media. When powerful corporations are permitted to acquire other powerful corporations, it is the American consumers who are left facing higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service from their telecommunications providers. I questioned why an already powerful company should be allowed to get even bigger and thus extract more leverage over consumers and the businesses reliant on its platform. It was through my work on Comcast and NBCUniversal that I learned about the rising costs of internet, phone, and TV services, as well as the importance of preserving net neutrality. I also became interested in how giant telecommunications companies, as well as ever-evolving tech companies, were treating the massive troves of user data they were collecting on a perpetual basis. I believe consumers have a fundamental right to know what information is being collected about them. I believe they have a right to decide whether they want to share that information and with whom they want to share it and when. I believe consumers have a right to expect that companies that store their personal information will store it securely. [[Page S8173]] I also believe all Americans deserve affordable access to high- quality telecommunications services--services they depend on to communicate with the world, get an education, and find a job. I believe the internet should remain the open platform for innovation, economic growth, and freedom of expression it has always been. Perhaps it was the complex nature of these issues or even the financial incentive to turn a blind eye, but when I came to the Senate, very few Members of Congress were talking about corporate consolidation, commercial privacy, or net neutrality--issues that have gained much deserved attention in more recent years. Whatever the reason for other Members' hesitance, I felt it was incumbent upon me to get into the weeds on these issues so I could be a leader in the Senate and ultimately address the concerns of ordinary Minnesotans. That is why, when the interests of the American consumers have clashed with the desires of powerful telecommunications and technology companies, I have always tried to put the public first and to fight on their behalf by shedding light on corporate abuses and using all the tools at my disposal to curb them. Again, it is through my work on the Judiciary Committee--and, more specifically, my work on media and technology policy--that I believe my perspective from my previous career has been of most value. Comcast's proposal to acquire NBCU immediately made me uncomfortable because I had seen their motives for this deal before. In 1993, during my 13th season at ``Saturday Night Live,'' the Big Three networks--NBC, CBS, and ABC--pressured Congress to change the rules that had previously prevented them from owning any of the shows they aired in prime time. The purpose of the rules had been to prevent the networks from prioritizing their own shows over others or otherwise harming competing programming. Unsurprisingly, after the rules were repealed, the networks--contrary to their guarantees and assurances they had given Congress--began giving the shows they owned preferential treatment. At the time, ``Seinfeld,'' which aired on NBC, was not owned by NBC and had been produced before the rules had changed--was the No. 1 show on television, which made the Thursday night timeslot following ``Seinfeld'' the most valuable real estate on television. I watched as shows that eventually wound up in that premium location were all owned, at least in part, by NBC. So when I became a Senator, one of the first major deals I opposed was Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal. As in the case of AT&amp;T's current bid to buy Time Warner, this deal was about giving one company the ability to control both the programming and the pipes that carry it. I knew from my time in media that a combined Comcast-NBCUniversal would have strong incentives to favor its own programming over that of others and restrict competing distributors from accessing that programming. I knew these incentives would hurt competing content creators, inhibit the free flow of information, and ultimately harm consumers. Unfortunately, I was not wrong. In the years after its acquisition of NBCUniversal, Comcast repeatedly violated the terms of its agreements with the FCC and the Department of Justice, favoring its own news programming over its competitors in Comcast's channel lineup and failing to live up to its promises regarding offering affordable standalone broadband, racial diversity in programming--they did not live up to their promises there--and online video distribution. Because merger conditions are extremely difficult and costly to enforce, competition and consumers were harmed in the process. Comcast's behavior in the wake of acquiring NBCUniversal was one of the major reasons I then opposed its proposal to turn around and buy Time Warner Cable a couple years later. It was also one of the major reasons I believe that later deal was ultimately dropped after objections from the FCC and the Department of Justice. For a long time in the Senate, it was a lonely battle. For over a year, I was the only Senator to oppose Comcast's proposals to buy Time Warner Cable--a deal that would have given the combined company 57 percent of the broadband market--but advocates and ordinary citizens raised their voices, and together we were able to stop the deal. Most recently, I have led my colleagues in scrutinizing AT&amp;T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, and I have once again called on regulators to move to block the deal for the inevitable harm it will cause to competition and consumers. I have been proud to lead these efforts, and I leave here in a much different environment than when I arrived. I know there are strong voices in the Senate that will carry on the fight when I am gone. These efforts to slow down and halt media consolidation are part of a very important, larger development we have seen in our country. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the American public's-- and, in turn, Congress's--interest in combating corporate consolidation. When I first entered the Senate, I wasn't sure most Americans understood what was at stake when these powerful companies wanted to combine. Vertical integration and antitrust laws sounded like obscure, almost boring, topics, but more and more Americans are getting educated about these issues, and more and more Members of Congress are working to get Washington focused on how they affect the lives of real people. Just look at the fight for net neutrality. For many of the same reasons that I opposed Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal, I have long supported strong net neutrality rules to ensure that the internet remains a level playing field where everyone can participate on equal footing, free from discrimination by large internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T. Net neutrality preserves the internet as the engine for innovation that it has always been and allows businesses of all sizes to thrive-- even when they are up against the largest, most profitable corporations. Here is just one example I found useful in explaining net neutrality: In 2005, three guys set up shop over a pizzeria in a strip mall in San Mateo, CA, where they launched the now-ubiquitous YouTube. Video- sharing websites were in their infancy, but these guys already faced competition from something that preceded it called Google Video, but Google Video wasn't very good. Because of net neutrality, YouTube was able to compete with Google Video on a level playing field. The giant internet service providers treated YouTube's videos the same as they did Google's, and Google couldn't pay them to gain an unfair advantage, like a fast lane into consumer homes. They were treated the same, neutrally. The content was neutral--net neutrality. People really liked YouTube. They preferred YouTube to Google Video, and YouTube thrived. In fact, in 2006, Google bought it for stock valued at $1.65 billion. That is a nice chunk for three guys over a pizzeria in San Mateo. It is not just tech companies and small businesses that rely on open internet. In a submission to the FCC in 2014, a coalition that includes Visa, Bank of America, UPS, and Ford explained that ``every retailer with an online catalogue, every manufacturer with online product specifications, every insurance company with online claims processing, every bank offering online account management, every company with a website--every business in America interacting with its customers online is dependent upon an open Internet.'' I have repeated this quote on the floor and at rallies time and time again over the years because I think it perfectly exemplifies the importance of this issue. Preserving net neutrality is only controversial for the few deep- pocketed entities that stand to financially gain without it. If FCC Chairman Pai ultimately has his way, we will be entering a digital world where the powerful outrank the majority, a world where a handful of multibillion-dollar companies have the power to control how users get their information, and a world where the deepest pockets can pay for a fast lane while their competitors stall in the slow lane. For nearly 9 years, I have been calling net neutrality the free speech issue [[Page S8174]] of our time because it embraces our most basic constitutional freedoms. And ironically, the kind of civic participation that has aspired so many of us in recent months--and has effected real change, like in the fight for net neutrality and the successful efforts to save the Affordable Care Act--has depended in no small part on a free and open internet. In 2015, the FCC's vote to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers under title II of the Communications Act didn't just mean good things for net neutrality; it also had important implications for consumer privacy. It gave the agency the authority and the responsibility to implement rules to protect Americans' privacy by giving consumers greater control of their personal data that is collected and used by their broadband providers. That was a big win. Republicans didn't see it that way. One of the first things they did this Congress was to repeal those rules, which was a huge blow to Americans' right to privacy. For my part, I have long believed that Americans have a fundamental right to privacy. I believe they deserve both transparency and accountability from the companies that have the capacity to trade on the details of their lives. And should they choose to leave personal information in the hands of those companies, they certainly deserve to know that their information is being safeguarded to the greatest degree possible. This transparency and accountability should come from all the companies that have access to Americans' sensitive information. This includes internet service providers like Comcast and AT&amp;T but also edge providers like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. In 2011, I served as chair for the inaugural hearing of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law--a subcommittee that I founded after it became abundantly clear that our Nation's privacy laws had failed to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies. When people talked about protecting their privacy when I was growing up, they were talking about protecting it from the government. They talked about unreasonable searches and seizures, about keeping the government out of their bedrooms. They talked about whether the government was trying to keep tabs on the books they read or the rallies they attended. Over the last 40 or 50 years, we have seen a fundamental shift in who has our information and what they are doing with it. That is not to say that we still shouldn't be worried about protecting ourselves from government abuses, but now we also have relationships with large corporations that are obtaining, storing, sharing and in many cases selling enormous amounts of our personal information. When the Constitution was written, the Founders had no way of anticipating the new technologies that would evolve in the coming centuries. They had no way of anticipating the telephone, for example, and so the Supreme Court ruled over 40 years ago that a wiretap constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. The Founders had no idea that one day the police would be able to remotely track your movements through a GPS device, and so the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that this was also a search that required court approval. All of this is a good thing. Our laws need to reflect the evolution of technology and changing expectations of American society. This is why the Constitution is often called a living document. But we have a long way to go to get to the point where our modern laws are in line with modern technology. My goal for the subcommittee was to help members understand both the benefits and privacy implications of emerging technologies; to educate the public and raise awareness about how their data is being collected, used, and shared; and, if necessary, to legislate to fill gaps in the law. When politics prevented legislation, I repeatedly pressed companies--many of them more than once--to be more transparent about how they were treating their customers' private information, including users' location data, web-browsing histories, and even their finger and face prints. As consumer awareness has evolved, these companies have taken important steps to improve transparency of their use of Americans' personal information. But unfortunately, accumulating massive troves of information isn't just a side project they can choose to halt at any given time; for many of them, it is their whole business model. We are not their customers; we are their product. Recently, we have seen just how scary this business model can be. In October of this year, the Judiciary Committee examined Russia's manipulation of social media during the 2016 campaign, and both the public and Members of Congress were shocked to learn the outsized role that the major tech companies play in so many aspects of our lives, based primarily on the mass collection of personal information and complex algorithms that are shrouded in secrecy. Not only do these companies guide what we see, read, and buy on a regular basis, but their dominance--specifically in the market of information--now requires that we consider their role in the integrity of our democracy. Unfortunately, this fall's hearings demonstrated that they may not be up to the challenge that they have created for themselves. The size of these companies is not--in isolation--the problem, but I am extremely concerned about these platforms' use of Americans' personal information to further solidify their market power and consequently extract unfair conditions from the content creators and innovators who rely on their platforms to reach consumers. As has become alarmingly clear in recent months, companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have unprecedented power to guide Americans' access to information and potentially shape the future of journalism. It should go without saying that such power comes with great responsibility. Everyone is currently and rightfully focused on Russian manipulation of social media, but as lawmakers, it is incumbent upon us to ask the broader questions: How did big tech come to control so many aspects of our lives? How is it using our personal information to strengthen its reach and its bottom line? Are these companies engaging in anticompetitive behavior that restricts the free flow of information in commerce? Are they failing to take simple precautions to respect our privacy and to protect our democracy? And finally, what role should these companies play in our lives, and how do we ensure transparency and accountability from them going forward? Modern technology has fundamentally altered the way we live our lives, and it has given us extraordinary benefits. As these companies continue to grow and evolve, challenges like those we have recently confronted in the Judiciary Committee will only grow and evolve with them. So we must now muster the will to meaningfully address the tough questions related to competition, privacy, and ultimately the integrity of our democracy. I will not be here to ask those questions. I will do what I can to find the answers from the outside, but it is my colleagues in the Senate who must prioritize them going forward. There is simply too much at stake. I know that they will do so with the help of a tireless advocacy community and the brilliant minds who have long contemplated these incredibly complex issues and ensured that lawmakers pay attention. And more importantly, they will do so with the support and encouragement of the American people. I have witnessed significant highs and significant lows in the fight to protect consumers' rights, but the most important lesson I have learned along the way is that ordinary Americans can wield extraordinary power when they raise their voices. For this reason and despite significant setbacks in recent months, I know that it is the public's interests that can ultimately prevail. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SANDERS.

Mr. President, I rise to deliver the second in a series of floor speeches that I offer as I close out my time in the Senate. This afternoon, I want to talk about Americans' relationship with telecommunications and technology companies and what that means for their access to essential services and for their privacy. When I entered the Senate in July of 2009, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid asked me to serve on the Judiciary Committee. I pointed out that there are a lot of lawyers in the Senate and that I wasn't one of them, but he said he needed Members with my perspective on the committee. </p><p>I wondered how my background could possibly serve me on Judiciary, but it did--almost immediately--when in December of that year, Comcast announced its intention to acquire NBCUniversal. I happened to know a lot about the effects of media consolidation because I used to work in media. When powerful corporations are permitted to acquire other powerful corporations, it is the American consumers who are left facing higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service from their telecommunications providers. I questioned why an already powerful company should be allowed to get even bigger and thus extract more leverage over consumers and the businesses reliant on its platform. It was through my work on Comcast and NBCUniversal that I learned about the rising costs of internet, phone, and TV services, as well as the importance of preserving net neutrality. I also became interested in how giant telecommunications companies, as well as ever-evolving tech companies, were treating the massive troves of user data they were collecting on a perpetual basis. I believe consumers have a fundamental right to know what information is being collected about them. I believe they have a right to decide whether they want to share that information and with whom they want to share it and when. I believe consumers have a right to expect that companies that store their personal information will store it securely. [[Page S8173]] I also believe all Americans deserve affordable access to high- quality telecommunications services--services they depend on to communicate with the world, get an education, and find a job. I believe the internet should remain the open platform for innovation, economic growth, and freedom of expression it has always been. Perhaps it was the complex nature of these issues or even the financial incentive to turn a blind eye, but when I came to the Senate, very few Members of Congress were talking about corporate consolidation, commercial privacy, or net neutrality--issues that have gained much deserved attention in more recent years. Whatever the reason for other Members' hesitance, I felt it was incumbent upon me to get into the weeds on these issues so I could be a leader in the Senate and ultimately address the concerns of ordinary Minnesotans. That is why, when the interests of the American consumers have clashed with the desires of powerful telecommunications and technology companies, I have always tried to put the public first and to fight on their behalf by shedding light on corporate abuses and using all the tools at my disposal to curb them. Again, it is through my work on the Judiciary Committee--and, more specifically, my work on media and technology policy--that I believe my perspective from my previous career has been of most value. Comcast's proposal to acquire NBCU immediately made me uncomfortable because I had seen their motives for this deal before. In 1993, during my 13th season at ``Saturday Night Live,'' the Big Three networks--NBC, CBS, and ABC--pressured Congress to change the rules that had previously prevented them from owning any of the shows they aired in prime time. The purpose of the rules had been to prevent the networks from prioritizing their own shows over others or otherwise harming competing programming. Unsurprisingly, after the rules were repealed, the networks--contrary to their guarantees and assurances they had given Congress--began giving the shows they owned preferential treatment. At the time, ``Seinfeld,'' which aired on NBC, was not owned by NBC and had been produced before the rules had changed--was the No. 1 show on television, which made the Thursday night timeslot following ``Seinfeld'' the most valuable real estate on television. I watched as shows that eventually wound up in that premium location were all owned, at least in part, by NBC. So when I became a Senator, one of the first major deals I opposed was Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal. As in the case of AT&amp;T's current bid to buy Time Warner, this deal was about giving one company the ability to control both the programming and the pipes that carry it. I knew from my time in media that a combined Comcast-NBCUniversal would have strong incentives to favor its own programming over that of others and restrict competing distributors from accessing that programming. I knew these incentives would hurt competing content creators, inhibit the free flow of information, and ultimately harm consumers. Unfortunately, I was not wrong. In the years after its acquisition of NBCUniversal, Comcast repeatedly violated the terms of its agreements with the FCC and the Department of Justice, favoring its own news programming over its competitors in Comcast's channel lineup and failing to live up to its promises regarding offering affordable standalone broadband, racial diversity in programming--they did not live up to their promises there--and online video distribution. Because merger conditions are extremely difficult and costly to enforce, competition and consumers were harmed in the process. Comcast's behavior in the wake of acquiring NBCUniversal was one of the major reasons I then opposed its proposal to turn around and buy Time Warner Cable a couple years later. It was also one of the major reasons I believe that later deal was ultimately dropped after objections from the FCC and the Department of Justice. For a long time in the Senate, it was a lonely battle. For over a year, I was the only Senator to oppose Comcast's proposals to buy Time Warner Cable--a deal that would have given the combined company 57 percent of the broadband market--but advocates and ordinary citizens raised their voices, and together we were able to stop the deal. Most recently, I have led my colleagues in scrutinizing AT&amp;T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, and I have once again called on regulators to move to block the deal for the inevitable harm it will cause to competition and consumers. I have been proud to lead these efforts, and I leave here in a much different environment than when I arrived. I know there are strong voices in the Senate that will carry on the fight when I am gone. These efforts to slow down and halt media consolidation are part of a very important, larger development we have seen in our country. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the American public's-- and, in turn, Congress's--interest in combating corporate consolidation. When I first entered the Senate, I wasn't sure most Americans understood what was at stake when these powerful companies wanted to combine. Vertical integration and antitrust laws sounded like obscure, almost boring, topics, but more and more Americans are getting educated about these issues, and more and more Members of Congress are working to get Washington focused on how they affect the lives of real people. Just look at the fight for net neutrality. For many of the same reasons that I opposed Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal, I have long supported strong net neutrality rules to ensure that the internet remains a level playing field where everyone can participate on equal footing, free from discrimination by large internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T. Net neutrality preserves the internet as the engine for innovation that it has always been and allows businesses of all sizes to thrive-- even when they are up against the largest, most profitable corporations. Here is just one example I found useful in explaining net neutrality: In 2005, three guys set up shop over a pizzeria in a strip mall in San Mateo, CA, where they launched the now-ubiquitous YouTube. Video- sharing websites were in their infancy, but these guys already faced competition from something that preceded it called Google Video, but Google Video wasn't very good. Because of net neutrality, YouTube was able to compete with Google Video on a level playing field. The giant internet service providers treated YouTube's videos the same as they did Google's, and Google couldn't pay them to gain an unfair advantage, like a fast lane into consumer homes. They were treated the same, neutrally. The content was neutral--net neutrality. People really liked YouTube. They preferred YouTube to Google Video, and YouTube thrived. In fact, in 2006, Google bought it for stock valued at $1.65 billion. That is a nice chunk for three guys over a pizzeria in San Mateo. It is not just tech companies and small businesses that rely on open internet. In a submission to the FCC in 2014, a coalition that includes Visa, Bank of America, UPS, and Ford explained that ``every retailer with an online catalogue, every manufacturer with online product specifications, every insurance company with online claims processing, every bank offering online account management, every company with a website--every business in America interacting with its customers online is dependent upon an open Internet.'' I have repeated this quote on the floor and at rallies time and time again over the years because I think it perfectly exemplifies the importance of this issue. Preserving net neutrality is only controversial for the few deep- pocketed entities that stand to financially gain without it. If FCC Chairman Pai ultimately has his way, we will be entering a digital world where the powerful outrank the majority, a world where a handful of multibillion-dollar companies have the power to control how users get their information, and a world where the deepest pockets can pay for a fast lane while their competitors stall in the slow lane. For nearly 9 years, I have been calling net neutrality the free speech issue [[Page S8174]] of our time because it embraces our most basic constitutional freedoms. And ironically, the kind of civic participation that has aspired so many of us in recent months--and has effected real change, like in the fight for net neutrality and the successful efforts to save the Affordable Care Act--has depended in no small part on a free and open internet. In 2015, the FCC's vote to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers under title II of the Communications Act didn't just mean good things for net neutrality; it also had important implications for consumer privacy. It gave the agency the authority and the responsibility to implement rules to protect Americans' privacy by giving consumers greater control of their personal data that is collected and used by their broadband providers. That was a big win. Republicans didn't see it that way. One of the first things they did this Congress was to repeal those rules, which was a huge blow to Americans' right to privacy. For my part, I have long believed that Americans have a fundamental right to privacy. I believe they deserve both transparency and accountability from the companies that have the capacity to trade on the details of their lives. And should they choose to leave personal information in the hands of those companies, they certainly deserve to know that their information is being safeguarded to the greatest degree possible. This transparency and accountability should come from all the companies that have access to Americans' sensitive information. This includes internet service providers like Comcast and AT&amp;T but also edge providers like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. In 2011, I served as chair for the inaugural hearing of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law--a subcommittee that I founded after it became abundantly clear that our Nation's privacy laws had failed to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies. When people talked about protecting their privacy when I was growing up, they were talking about protecting it from the government. They talked about unreasonable searches and seizures, about keeping the government out of their bedrooms. They talked about whether the government was trying to keep tabs on the books they read or the rallies they attended. Over the last 40 or 50 years, we have seen a fundamental shift in who has our information and what they are doing with it. That is not to say that we still shouldn't be worried about protecting ourselves from government abuses, but now we also have relationships with large corporations that are obtaining, storing, sharing and in many cases selling enormous amounts of our personal information. When the Constitution was written, the Founders had no way of anticipating the new technologies that would evolve in the coming centuries. They had no way of anticipating the telephone, for example, and so the Supreme Court ruled over 40 years ago that a wiretap constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. The Founders had no idea that one day the police would be able to remotely track your movements through a GPS device, and so the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that this was also a search that required court approval. All of this is a good thing. Our laws need to reflect the evolution of technology and changing expectations of American society. This is why the Constitution is often called a living document. But we have a long way to go to get to the point where our modern laws are in line with modern technology. My goal for the subcommittee was to help members understand both the benefits and privacy implications of emerging technologies; to educate the public and raise awareness about how their data is being collected, used, and shared; and, if necessary, to legislate to fill gaps in the law. When politics prevented legislation, I repeatedly pressed companies--many of them more than once--to be more transparent about how they were treating their customers' private information, including users' location data, web-browsing histories, and even their finger and face prints. As consumer awareness has evolved, these companies have taken important steps to improve transparency of their use of Americans' personal information. But unfortunately, accumulating massive troves of information isn't just a side project they can choose to halt at any given time; for many of them, it is their whole business model. We are not their customers; we are their product. Recently, we have seen just how scary this business model can be. In October of this year, the Judiciary Committee examined Russia's manipulation of social media during the 2016 campaign, and both the public and Members of Congress were shocked to learn the outsized role that the major tech companies play in so many aspects of our lives, based primarily on the mass collection of personal information and complex algorithms that are shrouded in secrecy. Not only do these companies guide what we see, read, and buy on a regular basis, but their dominance--specifically in the market of information--now requires that we consider their role in the integrity of our democracy. Unfortunately, this fall's hearings demonstrated that they may not be up to the challenge that they have created for themselves. The size of these companies is not--in isolation--the problem, but I am extremely concerned about these platforms' use of Americans' personal information to further solidify their market power and consequently extract unfair conditions from the content creators and innovators who rely on their platforms to reach consumers. As has become alarmingly clear in recent months, companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have unprecedented power to guide Americans' access to information and potentially shape the future of journalism. It should go without saying that such power comes with great responsibility. Everyone is currently and rightfully focused on Russian manipulation of social media, but as lawmakers, it is incumbent upon us to ask the broader questions: How did big tech come to control so many aspects of our lives? How is it using our personal information to strengthen its reach and its bottom line? Are these companies engaging in anticompetitive behavior that restricts the free flow of information in commerce? Are they failing to take simple precautions to respect our privacy and to protect our democracy? And finally, what role should these companies play in our lives, and how do we ensure transparency and accountability from them going forward? Modern technology has fundamentally altered the way we live our lives, and it has given us extraordinary benefits. As these companies continue to grow and evolve, challenges like those we have recently confronted in the Judiciary Committee will only grow and evolve with them. So we must now muster the will to meaningfully address the tough questions related to competition, privacy, and ultimately the integrity of our democracy. I will not be here to ask those questions. I will do what I can to find the answers from the outside, but it is my colleagues in the Senate who must prioritize them going forward. There is simply too much at stake. I know that they will do so with the help of a tireless advocacy community and the brilliant minds who have long contemplated these incredibly complex issues and ensured that lawmakers pay attention. And more importantly, they will do so with the support and encouragement of the American people. I have witnessed significant highs and significant lows in the fight to protect consumers' rights, but the most important lesson I have learned along the way is that ordinary Americans can wield extraordinary power when they raise their voices. For this reason and despite significant setbacks in recent months, I know that it is the public's interests that can ultimately prevail. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Progressives, conservatives and the Trump administration are probing the internet giants. Two companies are particularly in the crosshairs of lawmakers and regulators.It does not happen everyday that Greg Walden, a long Republican Congressman from Oregon and Elisabeth Warren, the Democratic Senator and progressive presidential candidate, agree on a key political issue.But Walden, who was a key player in the GOP's failed effort to repeal and replace President Obama's signature health care law which made health care available for millions of Americans, and Elisabeth Warren, who campaigns for an even more expansive health insurance reform called Medicare for All, agree that it is time to regulate the US-based internet giants.Already last year when Facebook's founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, testified before Congress Walden offered a pointed \u2014 and it turns out \u2014 prognostic inquiry. </p><p>\"At what point is a platform like that a common carrier in the information age?,\" he asked, referring to the US government's definition of utility which, applied to Facebook, would enable the Federal Communications Commission to regulate the company. What gives Walden's willingness to consider regulating Facebook even more weight is the fact that Facebook operates a data center in his electoral district.Warren, meanwhile, made breaking up Google, Facebook and Amazon a key plank of her election campaign. After a rollout of a policy proposal on how Warren plans to unwind Big Tech, last month saw the putting up a billboard in the heart of Silicon Valley that calls for the breakup of the major internet companies.From darling to targetWith their pronounced views on regulating Big Tech, Walden and Warren may earlier have been outliers in their respective parties, but over the past year the notion that Google, Facebook, Amazon and others have accrued too much power and should be regulated has rapidly evolved from fringe to mainstream. \"These corporations were really the darlings of American commerce and it's hard to believe as someone who has been working on these issues for three or four years how quickly that has changed not just among progressives, but also among conservatives here in the US,\" said Sarah Miller, vice president of the Open Markets Institute, an antimonopoly think tank in Washington. \"So if I were sitting in Silicon Valley I would start to get a little bit worried right now.\"That's because a barrage of inquiries about the power and conduct of Google, Facebook and Co. is coming from all sides. The House Judiciary Committee just announced a broad, bipartisan antitrust probe against the Big Tech companies. Meanwhile the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reportedly divided up oversight of the four major internet players Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple and are exploring antitrust investigations. Several US states have also expressed concerns about the power of Big Tech firms and could launch their own investigations. Washington catching up with rest of the world That Washington, after years of looking away, is now prepared to take a hard look at the de facto monopolistic power that the Big Tech companies have acquired in recent years (according to many scholars) is welcome \u2014 and long overdue, said Spencer Weber Waller, director of the Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies at Loyola University in Chicago. \"I think it's terrific. The rest of the world gets it,\" he said, noting that the EU and major European countries like Germany have been focused on the power of these companies for some time. \"And I am pleased that the United States is spending more attention and resources to look at it.\"That the growing debate over the power of the internet giants coincides with the US presidential election campaign only raises the public awareness of the issue which features as a key component of the platforms of not just Warren, but many of the more than a dozen Democratic candidates. President Donald Trump has also repeatedly talked about potentially breaking up the Big Tech companies.Historic campaign issueWhile Republicans and Democrats want to reign in Big Tech, they often do so for different reasons. \"Some conservatives don't like the tech giants because they are biased politically, some progressives don't like the tech giants because they think they are abusing their corporate power,\" said Weber Waller. But the end result is the same: more scrutiny for Big Tech.That the issue of monopoly power of US companies in the internet sector, but also in the pharmaceutical industry, could evolve into a significant 2020 campaign topic is historic, said Weber Waller. \"I can only think of one presidential election that in the US really turned on what people's view on antitrust were and that goes all the way back to 1912.\"That election was noteworthy because of its focus on the abuse of power by business interests and economic inequality, but also because it featured four candidates \u2014 Republican, a Democrat, a Socialist and a former president, Theodore Roosevelt, who ran for the Progressive Party.It's too early to tell whether corporate power will shape the upcoming election like it did it more than a century ago. But it is already a huge leap that it is now mainstream to advocate for the breakup of the Big Tech companies, a position long held by the Open Markets Institute.Breaking up Facebook and Amazon\"These companies in our view are some of the world's most dangerous monopolies,\" said Open Markets' Miller. That's because Google and Facebook have de facto \"control over the way people communicate and receive news all over the world.\"As a consequence and a first step, she added, \"we have called on the Federal Trade Commission to break up Facebook and to reverse some of the acquisitions that were approved erroneously, Instagram and WhatsApp in particular.\"But Amazon, she noted, should also be broken because of its monopolistic market power. \"Amazon is seeking to become the railroad of 21st century commerce where anyone who wants to participate in the economy in a meaningful way has to ride the rails of Amazon to get to their customers.\"To be sure, a breakup of Facebook or Amazon is not imminent and would be something like a revolution in light of the US government's past comparatively deferential behavior toward major corporations. But since the 2016 presidential election we also know that even highly unexpected things can happen. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109991155977604840725176900022</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7829</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8N-RPJ1-JCMN-Y4DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1099\"/><timeReceived>11:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Deutsche Welle Business</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 5, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

If approved, the plan would allow ISPs like Verizonto charge companies for internet service, potentially giving a major advantage to web giants who could afford to pay premium charges for faster-loading websites, videos, and other content.</p><p>Reactions from both public and private sectors to the fast lane proposal have been divisive, with big tech companies like Googlepublicly standing against the plan, while broadband providers like Verizonand AT&amp;T have acted in support of it.</p><p>AT&amp;T senior executive Jim Cicconi described the plan as an attempt to \u201cfoster an investment environment... so that all consumers can have the fastest Internet lanes in the world,\u201d while almost 150 tech companies, including Google, Amazon, and Netflix, signed a petition urging the FCC to vote against it, calling paid fast lanes \u201ca threat to the internet.\u201d</p><p>In previous years, former VerizonCEO <person><nameText>Ivan Seidenberg </nameText></person>cited disabled access in a similar argument against net neutrality, claiming that it can prevent companies from quickly transmitting medical data by not allowing them to prioritize those services over spam.</p><p>But Verizon\u2019s most recent claim that net neutrality could have negative consequences for disabled users hasn\u2019t been corroborated by the FCC. Commission chairman Tom Wheeler said that even if the fast lane plan is not approved, companies providing special services to disabled users would be able to pay ISPs for speedier service.</p><p>Wheeler, a former cable company lobbyist, is a proponent of fast lane services.</p><p>For further information please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.commondreams.org\">http://www.commondreams.org</url><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-UON5990700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CHW-76P1-DXCW-D183-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"375\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>June 26, 2014 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That would be Margrethe Vestager, who is taking on a second five-year stint as Europe\u2019s competition chief, this time with added responsibility for overall digital regulation.</p><p>As American politicians and regulators look at ways of restraining the power of Big Tech, a tendency to look across the Atlantic has been understandable. Brussels began its first informal probe into Google nearly a decade ago, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Margrethe_Vestager\"> Ms Vestager</url> has since earned a reputation as the regulator who has done the most to rattle Silicon Valley.</p><p>But her success has been mixed and it wouldn\u2019t do to follow too closely in her footsteps. Instead, it is where the European digital chief trains her guns next that matters.</p><p>Ms Vestager\u2019s first term was marked by success in extracting cash for perceived wrongdoing, including more than \u20ac8bn in antitrust fines from Google and a demand for Apple to cough up \u20ac13bn in an illegal state aid case (all of these cases are under appeal).</p><p>But the fines belie the fact that she hasn\u2019t done anything to change the competitive dynamics in digital markets. </p><p>Take Google. The EU took aim at two of its core business drivers: How it steers search traffic to other Google services, and how it uses Android to lock users into its mobile services. </p><p>Yet the rival companies who were supposedly the beneficiaries of the search case faded away long before the commission took action. And Google\u2019s mobile services \u2014 like its Play store for apps \u2014 look too deeply entrenched in the Android world to allow much room for competition.</p><p>Cases like these highlight the difficulty of restraining powerful and self-reinforcing digital platforms. By the time regulators notice \u2014 let alone reach the point of pressing for remedies \u2014 it is often too late.</p><p>Not to be deterred, Ms Vestager showed this week that she is ready for round two. First, she pulled out a weapon that had been gathering dust in the EU antitrust arsenal. Taking on US chipmaker Broadcom, she revealed that she would push for \u201cinterim measures\u201d \u2014 forcing an immediate suspension of alleged anti-competitive practices even before a case has been proved. It was a clear declaration of intent at the start of a new term.</p><p>For American companies, which already bristle at the commission acting as both prosecutor and judge in competition cases, this pre-emptive intervention in market practices adds an unwelcome new twist.</p><p>There are other weapons at her disposal, including pushing for break-ups. However, any attempt to go that far would stir up a transatlantic political storm and Ms Vestager made clear in a hearing in Brussels this week that such a move is very much a last resort.</p><p>Perhaps even more significantly, she has been mulling new ways to eat into the power of the tech platforms. For instance, she is working on many of the ideas put forward in <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/competition/publications/reports/kd0419345enn.pdf\"> a report</url> she commissioned from a group of experts earlier this year on ways to reinforce digital competition policy, according to a person familiar with her thinking.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Weekly podcast</emphasis></p><p>Sign up here to the new podcast from Gideon Rachman, the FT\u2019s chief foreign affairs columnist, and listen in on his conversations with the decision makers and thinkers from all over the globe who are shaping world affairs</p><p>One result could be to shift more of the burden of proof in antitrust cases on to the defendants, requiring powerful tech platforms to show that changes they make to business practices are actually pro-competitive, rather than attempts to shut out rivals.</p><p>Other ideas are being weighed to penetrate the big data fortresses that have been built around the platforms. Traditional antitrust rules were not designed to deal with the massive aggregation of online data. </p><p>In the only prominent case so far, German federal regulators have ruled against Facebook\u2019s practice of applying user data from Instagram and WhatsApp to target advertising on its core social networking services. However, any changes at Facebook have been put on hold pending an appeal, and other antitrust enforcers have yet to follow the lead in taking aim at the data strongholds.</p><p>This is where Ms Vestager\u2019s new role, as EU tech policy chief, could come in handy. She will have ways to look more broadly across the business practices of leading tech companies and propose tighter regulations. The amassing of data is front and centre in her thinking. Possible responses include forcing dominant companies to give access to some of their data to allow new entrants into their markets, as well as new rules that would limit how data can be pooled.</p><p>Any attempts to free up data to make digital markets more competitive, however, will run smack into privacy concerns, and there won\u2019t be any shortcuts. Whether through enforcement actions or proposed legislation, it will take years to see the final results. But, halfway through a decade-long campaign to hold Silicon Valley accountable, Ms Vestager is about to take the fight to a new level.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-04f35a9aeb3c11e9a2403b065ef5fc55</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7M-F001-DXP9-90WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><timeReceived>10:52 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 10, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002GD1</classCode><className>BROADCOM CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The House Financial Services Committee will also hold a hearing on Libra the next day.</p><p>Lawmakers on both committees said this week they saw the potential for Libra to increase access to financial services for underserved individuals. But their bigger focus was a litany of concerns they have about Libra, including privacy issues, money laundering, financial stability worries and its potential to upend the U.S. dollar.</p><p>\"Allowing big tech companies to take over the payments system or position themselves to influence monetary policy would be a huge mistake and threatens to undermine our democracy,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee.</p><p>Brown made those comments at a semiannual hearing with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who said Libra could bring benefits but raises \"serious concerns\" that regulators will examine. Powell said staff at the Financial Stability Oversight Council, an interagency group of U.S. regulators, have begun talking about Libra.</p><p>The project also got the attention of President Donald Trump, who said in a Twitter post that Libra \"will have little standing or dependability\" and called on Facebook or other companies seeking to perform banking activities to seek a new banking charter.</p><p>At an industry event, Rep. French Hill, R-Ark., said he did not support a moratorium on Facebook's Libra project, which House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters, D-Calif., had called for in a letter to Facebook executives July 2. However, Hill cautioned that most leaks and cyberthreats come from mistakes in software code and said Facebook needs to answer questions about the design of the blockchain underpinning Libra.</p><p>After Powell's first day of Hill testimony, Facebook's Marcus said on Twitter that he agrees concerns around Libra \"should be addressed carefully and patiently, and that it shouldn't be rushed. This is why we shared plans early.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the House Financial Services Committee clashed over a series of proposals from Democrats that would establish a mandatory framework for companies issuing environmental, social and governance disclosures.</p><p>Among the proposals discussed at a July 10 subcommittee hearing was a draft bill from Rep. Juan Vargas, D-Calif., that would require publicly traded companies to release certain ESG disclosures. Under the legislation, those points would be set by the SEC using recommendations from a sustainable finance advisory committee that would also be established by Vargas' bill.</p><p>Democrats, along with several witnesses at the hearing, argued the bills would be welcomed in the sustainable finance community, as money managers have been pushing companies for more comparable and in-depth data about their ESG opportunities and risks. Republicans blasted the drafted legislation, though. Several members of the committee raised concerns about the investment returns from managers deploying ESG strategies, while also saying the disclosures could influence companies' decisions to enter the public markets.</p><p>At the Fed</p><p>Powell's Hill testimony indicated the Fed is preparing to cut interest rates at their July meeting, as officials' worries over the growth and inflation outlook persist. But Fed officials' recent commentary highlights a split at the central bank about whether it should take action in July and how aggressive it should be.</p><p>Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles, meanwhile, said during the week that he expects regulators to repropose a new way to implement the Volcker rule this fall after they heard concerns about their May 2018 proposal.</p><p>He also said at a Fed conference on stress testing that the regulator is considering more changes to the annual examinations, including offering more transparency for banks to prepare for the tests.</p><p>\"Like a teacher, we don't want banks to fail, we want them to learn,\" he said.</p><p>Other news</p><p>Allison Herren Lee was officially sworn in as the fifth commissioner at the SEC, putting the securities regulator's top panel back at full capacity.</p><p>Lee, who worked for former SEC Commissioner Kara Stein and as an enforcement attorney at the agency, was sworn into her position July 8. She joins Commissioner Robert Jackson Jr. as the commission's other Democratic representative.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLXTR-52830760</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLXTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK1-7P21-F19Y-C417-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">427798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Financial Extra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The second is the advice of our nation\u2019s crony Capitol: Hire a lobbyist to get politicians, regulators and bureaucrats to enact policies that protect you from competition.</p><p>Nowhere has the spirit of entrepreneurship been greater in the world than Silicon Valley. It is a bastion of free enterprise and proof the American Dream remains a reality.</p><p>Yet, ever since Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,  famously told Bill Gates in 2000 \u201cIf you want to get involved in business, then get involved in Washington,\u201d the Valley\u2019s relationship with Washington has changed. The evolution of Big Tech has been well-documented.  Once adverse to the ways of Washington, the industry has embraced the capital\u2019s pay-to-influence culture, and headlines this week paint a startling picture:</p><p>The Hill:  McCarthy\u2019s rise could be boon for tech</p><p>Politico: Tech riding high with expected McCarthy ascension</p><p>In article after article, <person><nameText>Kevin McCarthy, </nameText></person>the third-ranking House Republican, is portrayed as the \u201cunofficial ambassador to Silicon Valley for House Republicans.\u201d  Facebook\u2019s vice president of U.S. public policy told one Washington publication that McCarthy \u201cintuitively understands the industry\u2019s culture of innovation and knows what\u2019s needed to protect it.\u201d</p><p>Protect it?</p><p>Facebook didn\u2019t grow into a $168 billion company because Washington took steps to protect it.  The same is true for tech giants Amazon, Apple, eBay, Google, Intel and Microsoft.  Nonetheless, companies and industries increasingly see their future tied to various actors in Washington.  Take Dave Brat\u2019s stunning victory last week.  It sent shockwaves through the business community.  Again, the headlines said it all:</p><p>Politico: Wall Street loses ally with Eric Cantor loss</p><p>KC Business Journal: How Eric Cantor\u2019s loss is bad for business \u2014 big business, that is</p><p>Boeing\u2019s stock dropped 2.3 percent the day after Brat\u2019s victory on fears the Export-Import Bank would not be reauthorized.  The taxpayer-backed export agency is predicted to \u201csupport\u201d $10 billion in Boeing sales this year even though the company stated less than a year ago it could find its own financing.</p><p>On Fox News Sunday last week, George Will explained the significance of the Ex-Im Bank, which he said played \u201ca larger role\u201d than amnesty in Brat\u2019s victory:</p><p>    \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something that may get done now because of this, and that is de- authorizing, refusing to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, which is known in Washington for very good reason as Boeing\u2019s bank, and has become a symbol to people like David Brat of crony capitalism, not without reason.\u201d</p><p>Even if you set aside the merits of this particular government intervention or that particular program, the degree to which businesses rely on the U.S. government and the ability a single member of Congress has to affect an industry is alarming.</p><p>The defeat of one politician and the elevation of another should not have an impact on industry, but it does. As government growth has gone unchecked, so too has the influence of government, politicians and bureaucrats in private sector business plans. Whether we want to admit it or not, America\u2019s economy is a political economy.</p><p>For more information please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.heritage.org\">http://www.heritage.org</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-UON5835586</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CGC-FKB1-J9XT-P42C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>June 20, 2014 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

A real buzz killer), there was an uptick in suicides among moguls by less dramatic means for a few years. Today, amidst the cascading bad economic news, investors seemingly have only two worries. </p><p>First, that further waves of COVID-19 infections and deaths might sidetrack the economy's reopening and affect profits. The second is that procrastinators might be left behind \u2014 FOMO, the Fear of Missing Out \u2014as the market continues to rise. One thing that they're not losing any sleep over is that working class consciousness is rising to the radical level of the 1930s when capitalism faced genuine peril. In 2020, as in the 1930s, the economy is tanking, unemployment is at Great Depression levels with another 1.5 million workers having filed for unemployment last week, Federal regulations (600+) having been dismantled, CEO compensation now at 287 times that of workers and of the 11 Fed financial bailouts, 10 went to Wall Street banks. Further, at the inception of the Covid-19 outbreak, over 70 percent of Americans were already living on the financial edge, with lifetime savings depleted, and home foreclosures multiplying. Now, many of the jobs losses are terminal, millions of stores remain shut down across the country, angry protesters throng the streets, and an exceedingly grim future awaits most of the citizens. Again, as in 1933, the Federal government is taking bold action. But instead of FDR's New Deal, this time the decisive action entails a a $4.5 trillion bailout of emergency corporate lending, some pittance payments to workers, and ominous threats about the dire consequences of not returning to their jobs. What accounts for the difference in the government's response then and now? I suggest that both responses were self-serving actions by the ruling elite and it's to our peril not to understand that fact. As I've noted previously, big tech companies have proven virtually immune to what's happening in the economy inhabited by the rest of us. The tech-heavy NASDAQ recently surpassed 10,000 before retreating and Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Facebook are soaring. Apple and Microsoft recently became the first to reach $1.5 trillion market caps. According to investment strategists, the Fed's maintaining low interest and inflation rates has been the magic elixir for these big tech companies. Robert Armstrong, writing in The Financial Times (quoted in NYT, 6/11/2020) notes, in a strikingly nonchalant manner, that all of this is only more 'evidence of an inherent and structural tension between the owning class and the working class.' In the United States, where a small percentage owns most of the wealth, they reap the gains from a resurgent stock market. Thus, as Armstrong continues, 'Covid-19 has put working-and-middle-class people under severe strain, while the asset-owning class have felt relatively little pain.' The Great Depression's Legacy: FDR's Efforts to Save Capitalism After the Great Crash of 1929, a broad spectrum of prominent American writers, artists, poets, playwrights, and painters offered enthusiastic support for socialist ideas. Concurrently, ordinary citizens were questioning the precepts of capitalism and the traditional U.S. political system. Breadlines, shantytowns and hunger marches were growing along with the growing appeal of left-wing class politics and labor radicalism. Unaffiliated groups were organizing self-help cooperatives and racially integrated Unemployed Councils, organized by Communists, were springing up. Protests blocking evictions were occurring in major cities, often involving violent confrontation with the police. From 1930-1932, over 700 actions by the unemployed were reported to the Communist party's newspaper, the Daily Worker. (Note: The CP ultimately followed directives from the CP International in joining the 'Popular Front' and supporting the New Deal.) In an article titled, 'How FDR Saved Capitalism[1],' the late, neoconservative political scientist and sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset lavished effusive praise on President Franklin D. Roosevelt's conscious effort to blunt widespread anticapitalist sentiments and undercut the appeal of left-wing radicals.1[2] At the time, left parties and associated movements emerged in Wisconsin, New York, California, Minnesota, Washington,Nebraska, Oregon, and North Dakota. In Minnesota, Governor Floyd Olson (Farmer-Labor Party) pioneered unemployment insurance, anti-foreclosure laws, public works programs, a pro-worker labor code and public pensions. In one speech he said, 'I hope the present system of government goes right to hell' and proposed abolishing capitalism and establishing government control 'over all means of production.'2[3] FDR rejected radical politics but the New Deal was deeply influenced by the president's keen awareness of needing to propose policies that would ween discontented workers away from demanding deep structural changes.The president employed three basic tactics: First, he was masterful in lifting and incorporating left demands into his rhetoric. Second, he sought to co-opt some leaders by extending patronage to non-Democratic Party state and local officials. Part of this involved setting aside references to the Democratic Party, per se, and frequently mentioning farmers, women, labor, minorities and liberals. Finally, as part of his expedient and temporary tilt toward the left, FDR was not above disingenuously threatening that to save capitalism from itself it might be necessary to 'equalize the distribution of wealth' and 'throw to the wolves the forty-six men reputed to have incomes in excess of one million dollars.' This was all presaged in his FDR's first presidential inaugural address in 1933. Ira Katznelson, author of Fear Itself, a book celebrated by mainstream reviewers, wrote 'A climate of universal fear deeply affected political understandings and concerns. Nothing was sure.'3[4].In the fifth sentence of his inaugural speech on March 4,1933, President Roosevelt uttered the famous phrase: 'Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.' He then proceeded to blame the depression on 'unscrupulous money changers' who lacked any vision. The president blamed 'callous and selfish bankers and businessmen who persisted in engaging in the 'evils of the old order.' While offering to work with legislators, FDR made clear that if Congress failed to act there would be a need for a 'temporary departure from the normal balance of public procedure.' The president would seek 'broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.' Robert Morley, a law professor at Columbia, had created the original 'Brain Trust' to advise Roosevelt during the 1932 presidential campaign. He was also responsible for writing FDR's inaugural address although the latter never acknowledged it. Later, Morley said that because of the speech, 'Capitalism was saved in eight days.' Hyperbole aside, the critical point is that Katznelson and many other liberal historians agree that saving capitalism was a major objective of the New Deal and that some form of 'liberal democracy' was the preferred means of accomplishing that end. W.E.B. DuBois had hoped the incipient New Deal would be the opening, the first step toward socialism. However, by 1938, Roosevelt, perhaps concluding the threat had past, slowed his reforms and even proposed a traditional balanced budget. Tellingly, when the Recession of 1937-38 resulted in Republicans defeating several third party incumbents, FDR responded, 'We have on the positive side eliminated Phil La Follete and the Farmer-Labor people in the Northwest as a standing Third Party threat.' I trust that others, far better versed in the New Deal period will comment and I'll only suggest a line of inquiry that needs fleshing out: Unlike today's predator class, who've little to worry about, their counterparts in the 1930s had more to fear than 'fear itself' \u2014 and acted accordingly.That is, 'the spectre that haunted the New Deal years was the fear of the dominant class of a renewed populist alliance \u2014 this time strengthened by a more combative and a more mature industrial proletariat than had existed in the 1890s.4[5] Liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger wrote of the moment, 'It was now a matter of seeing whether a representative democracy could conquer economic collapse. It was a matter of staving off violence \u2014 even some thought \u2014 revolution.'5[6] Many people now understand that spending on World World II was what 'saved capitalism' but I suspect the myth that benevolent motives dominated New Deal thinking is still believed by many. Shedding further light on this matter should prove useful in clarifying and responding to both the diversions and opportunities awaiting us in the near future. What about today? Not 'A few bad police apples,' but a Rotten Capitalist Tree If polls are to be believed, a majority of the public agrees with the core positions put forth by Black LIves Matter and support the protests against police brutality. I've been encouraged by the fact that hundreds of thousands of young, white Millennials have been in the streets, often outnumbering black participants. For example, between 60-65 percent of the demonstrators in New York and Washington were white youth under age 34. We are at a propitious moment and the critical question is whether the momentum of the protests will transition to a wider and deeper critique that extends beyond the police. We can be certain that efforts are forthcoming to co-opt BLM supporters with cosmetic, liberal palliatives and to divert protests into the cul-de-sac of identity politics, the most insidiously effective weapon in corporatocracy's toolbox. Resisting these maneuvers will require a politically astute, creative, and sustained response. Can we go further and explicitly explain that the police under capitalism can never be reformed to take the side of Black, Brown and working class people? All available evidence suggests that from their inception, the foremost function of the police has been to safeguard the capitalist private property of those who own and rule the country. As Chris Hedges recently pointed out, 'The crisis we face is not, as the ruling elites want us to believe, limited to police violence. It is a class and generational revolt. It will not be solved by new police reforms. The problem is an economic and political system that has by design created a nation of serfs and obscenely rich masters.'6[7] A new mass political formation of people prepared to engage in widespread civil disobedience and face arrest, remains our only hope for secular salvation and much depends upon how we creatively reimagine making our case. It's a daunting challenge and not the first time we've needed to take inspiration from Antonio Gramsci's invocation: pessimism of the intellect; optimism of the will.Unless otherwise specified, quotes in the next three paragraph are from Seymour Martin Lipset and Gary Marks, 'How FDR Saved Capitalism,' HOOVER DIGEST, January 1, 2001. It's fitting that the article is associated with the Hoover Institute. Housed at Stanford University, it's named for Herbert Hoover and its mission is to promote private enterprise in the United States. Candoleeza Rice will assume its directorship on September 1, 2020. Stanford University, was founded by the railroad Robber Baron Leland Stanford who amassed his fortune by exploiting Chinese labor. Seymour Martin Lipset (1922-2006), a prominent American sociologist and political scientist, was a neoconservative, noted for championing the idea of American exceptionalism. I'm chagrined to acknowledge that Lipset was once President of the American Political Science Association.Ira Katznelson, Fear Itself: The New Deal and the Origin of Our Times.

Welcome to the program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By now you have heard all about the tragedy of Germanwings Flight 9525, I've been watching the coverage on CNN closely all week. And I have some particular questions that haven't been answered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So today I've invited several experts to get those answers that I think we're all looking for, among the things that I want to know, was this crime premeditated? In other words how could Andreas Lubitz have known that the captain would have to go and use the bathroom giving him time to change the flight course. Did he make his terrible decision in the spur of a moment?</p><p/><p>Another question, even though this airplane was in the words of investigators shredded like confetti is there a way to retrieve the texts, the e-mails, the videos that passengers likely took and wrote in those last terrible minutes?</p><p/><p>Here's one more. What's the duty of a mental health professional to report on a troubled pilot? Our experts are here to break it down but first, to the very latest of what's happening right now on the ground. CNN's Frederick Pleitgen is in Germany with more.</p><p/><p>Fred, I know that the \"Bild\" newspaper has spoken to a former girlfriend. What is she saying?</p><p/><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, she's saying that she was together with Andreas Lubitz for about five months last year. She said or she described him as a very sensitive man, someone who need a lot of care, a lot of attention, someone who could also be quite flattering. She was an airline stewardess herself on Germanwings as well but she also said that he was someone who had a very dark side. Someone who at night would wake up because he was having bad dreams, someone who would go into rages when they had fights who apparently locked himself in the bathroom once for an extended period of time.</p><p/><p>She says ultimately the reason why they split up was because she was starting to become afraid of him and she also said that it was clear to her that he had some sort of psychological problems but it was certainly something that she said that he was trying to hide because, of course, he'd always had this big dream of being a pilot and he didn't want it destroyed by the fact that he had these health issues. Michael.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: A gliding acquaintance says that Lubitz was familiar with the area around the crash site. What are you hearing about that?</p><p/><p>PLEITGEN: It's interesting because he was part of an aeronautics and hand gliding club in his town of Montabaur. Strangely enough that giding club apparently quite frequently went to excursions down to southern France, to the foothills of the Alps. So apparently Lubitz was also very familiar with the terrain there. This acquaintance of his says that the aeroclub was there about 10 times and he does recall at least one time that Lubitz himself was there as well.</p><p/><p>There is another media report out there saying that Lubitz was obsessed by the Alps that he loved the mountains there, and so certainly he would have known the terrain where he crashed and also the acquaintance also said that he was very familiar actually with the crash site itself, with that area around there. He says he's flown over that many, many times.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: And Frederik, finally, today's \"New York Times\" says that those physician notes that were found in his apartment were from different doctors, suggesting perhaps that he went for a second opinion as to his fitness, his relative fitness. Do you know anything about that?</p><p/><p>PLEITGEN: Well, yes, \"The New York Times\" is saying that he went and tried to get a second opinion. We reached out to the University Medical Center in Dusseldorf which is a town that he lived in. They confirmed to us that he was there for diagnostics twice this year. It wasn't for depression, they didn't say however, whether it might have been for some other mental problem. Certainly, the doctors notes that were found inside his apartment, there seemed to be several of them and of course the state prosecutor of Dusseldorf said that they had been destroyed obviously in attempt to try to hide from his employer that he had some sort of illness, that he was dealing with, by the way, for an extended period of time, the medical records show.</p><p/><p>But again, we're still trying to find out what exactly he was suffering from. There are many media outlets that are reporting that it was some sort of depression-related thing. But what exactly it was, we don't know just yet.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Frederik Pleitgen, thank you very much.</p><p/><p>Let's dive right into all of this now. Joining me is psychiatrist Dr. Gail Saltz and CNN safety analyst and former FAA safety inspector David Soucie. I'd like to try and cover a lot of ground with my many, many questions.</p><p/><p>David, I'll begin with you. Is this the way you would do it? Is this the way that a pilot seeking to crash an airplane would go about it, by manually switching the auto pilot from 33,000 feet to 96 feet, isn't there a faster way?</p><p/><p>DAVID SOUCIE, CNN SAFETY ANALYST: Historically there has been and there has been done this way with Egypt Air and Silk Air, it's violent movement. This is different. But it is also a different aircraft. Because this aircraft is designed to protect itself from that kind of thing. So to put it forward, it wouldn't let you do that. It wouldn't let you just go into an uncontrolled descent. So it's a little bit -</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: This was probably sick to even ask but probably the most expeditious way then for him to go about.</p><p/><p>SOUCIE: I suppose that's correct. Yes.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Doctor, why doesn't a guy like this kill himself outside that aircraft instead of killing 149 innocents with him?</p><p/><p>GAIL SALTZ, PSYCHIATRIST AND PSYCHOANALYST: The question was what was his motivation? So most suicides, in fact, the vast majority of killing yourself if you are depressed and that's your intent. Only 2.5 percent are really killing somebody else and usually it's killing one other person, a person that you're angry at.</p><p/><p>So this is vanishingly rare. And this is a mass murder which makes you think about things like sociopathy, rage, desire for infamy. Those things would be motivators.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: I've heard many draw conclusions about his breathing, how he was able to maintain some rate of normal breathing for that final nine minutes. It strikes me as a lay person that you're only able to evaluate the breathing in the context of other factors that we now know, like changing the flight altitude. The breathing alone, I mean, he could have had a heart attack and maintained breathing.</p><p/><p>SALTZ: You can. You can lose consciousness and maintain breathing. So it must have been a combination of those two things that made them think that he was awake the whole time.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: David, let's talk about the toggling of that lock switch. If the co-pilot toggled the door control to lock and thereby disabled emergency access for five minutes, is there anything that the pilot, who is trapped in the cabin, could do to gain access?</p><p/><p>SOUCIE: Nothing at all. Nothing at all.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: As long as he keeps his finger on the button in a lock position.</p><p/><p>SOUCIE: Well and past five minutes as well he could just continue to hold it down.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: OK. Because there are reports that after five minutes there is a burst of 30 seconds of opportunity that would allow the pilot to come back in.</p><p/><p>SOUCIE: Well, after the - only after the five minutes can you enter the code which then triggers the 30 seconds period to notify the captain, if the captain does not respond by opening the door or locking the door, the door actually opens for five seconds by itself. SMERCONISH: Doctor, he would have had to maintain an amazing level of constitution to hear the pilot outside banging on the door, trying to break down the door, and then in the end, people screaming for as long as nine minutes, maintain that breathing, and continue to do that which he was doing.</p><p/><p>SALTZ: I think there are two possibilities that that suggest. One is that you know, this was premeditated, this is a person who's thought a lot about this and does not have the empathy to be concerned about that. In other words, we're talking about sociopathy, someone who would plan that. This is what they wanted so it's not going to upset them.</p><p/><p>The other possibility is that, you know, they have suffered so much themselves that the relative suffering of others is not that disturbing to them.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Somehow he was able to put on blinders -</p><p/><p>SALTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Meaning for hearing purposes. And block it all out.</p><p/><p>SALTZ: Well, it doesn't mean it was blocked out. It may mean that it fit with whatever - this is completely conjecture you have to realize. We don't know what was in his mind. But you know, when people internally suffer terrible depression, or psychosis, I mean it is utter torment. And that kind of torment might really surpass the idea that other people would be screaming or frightened.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: David, the FAA two person in the cockpit rule was designed to address incapacitation on the part of a pilot. Is it appropriate in a circumstance like this, will it thwart a pilot himself who has turned bad?</p><p/><p>SOUCIE: Actually, we should clarify a little bit why that rule is in place. The only reason that rule is in place originally is the fact that there was - there were no cameras to identify someone trying to get in. So they had to have a second person there because just looking through a peep hole to identify who that person is. So that was the original.</p><p/><p>But the second part of your question, I'm sorry, I kind of got side tracked on that.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Will this new methodology of requiring two individuals in the cockpit, will that necessarily prevent a cockpit, a pilot who turns bad?</p><p/><p>SOUCIE: It certainly will because since that's been implemented and the airlines that it has been implemented in there has been no attempts, not even attempts at suicide or any kind of disruption in the cockpit since that rule.</p><p/><p>SALTZ: I'm also going to add to that. It's very different to have people behind you that are anonymous in a plane that you're killing and somebody that you actually take on in a cockpit.</p><p/><p>SOUCIE: So deterrent rather than prevention. This is not going to stop an attack that has already started. What it will do is prevent one from starting in the first place.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Can a pilot who is being treated for mental health issues maintain his or her career, or is this a professional death sentence?</p><p/><p>SALTZ: Absolutely they can maintain their career. The issue is really the beginning of treatment. So, you want to stop them from being responsible for other people when they are in the depths of the illness. And when they are beginning medication which has some risk associated with it. We know that it may increase agitation or some suicide risk at the beginning of medication. That's why pilots aren't supposed to fly then.</p><p/><p>But these are treatment - let's put it this way. If it is depression, it is a treatable illness and once it is treated somebody is like anybody else. One out of every 10 people get depression. Are we going to say that those people should never be responsible for anyone else? Then one out of 10 should never drive, one out of 10 should never - it doesn't make sense. The point is when depression is resolved you are back to functional.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: One of the few cases I remember from law school that I can cite by name is the Terasoft case. You know of what I'm speaking.</p><p/><p>SALTZ: Correct.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: What is the duty on the part of a mental health practitioner dealing with someone like him, again we're presuming, but presuming that he is unfit, is there a duty to report him to the employer?</p><p/><p>SALTZ: So, the duty to warn for a psychiatrist or a mental healthcare worker is basically if the patient has in any way let you know that they are a risk to themselves or other people. So had he said anything about you know, I have a plan or I want to do this or even I want to kill myself, that psychiatrist would have a duty to warn law enforcement or whoever is deemed at risk.</p><p/><p>So, if he says something about taking down a plane, of course that would be the employer, or you know, whoever he mentioned. If he said I want to get my girlfriend. That he would - you would have a duty to warn the girlfriend. But this is a person who everybody is saying was very secretive. And psychiatrists aren't mind readers so if he mentioned nothing of any of this, then actually the psychiatrist has a duty to keep confidentiality.</p><p/><p>I know people have said \"hey -\"</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: But did he go too far?</p><p/><p>SALTZ: Do we go too far? So the question is this. This man probably would never have come into treatment at all if - that's the issue really, right? If you think you have no confidentiality, if you just come in and say \"I have depression, and now I'm going to report it to your employer,\" you're never going to come in the first place.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: To a lay person it sounds frightening. I've seen the list of medications that according to the FAA standard that one can be on and still be working.</p><p/><p>SALTZ: Yes.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: You want to dissuade me from my discomfort?</p><p/><p>SALTZ: Yes, I think - yes, I do. Because I think that you have to look at what are the specific side effects of those medications. So if we're talking about medical problems , I mean, if the only person who could fly is somebody who is on zero medications, has zero medical problems, then we're probably taking out any one who has experience, the very person that we want to be flying for us.</p><p/><p>So I think that what people have to understand is psychiatric illnesses can impair you in a short-term but once treated, not in the long term. Psychotic disorder like schizophrenia that's a different story.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: It troubles me though the idea that, again, let's make the presumption and let the audience know this is based on conjecture and reporting. It troubles me to think that mental health professional would have deemed him unfit, unfit for what, not to be a CNN host, they knew he was a pilot. Unfit to take command of 149 other lives?</p><p/><p>SALTZ: We don't know. We don't know if that's true. We knew somebody wrote a note that said you may not work this day. Now, I don't know if that was permission not to work, if that was by that doctor -</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: The \"Times\" is reporting today that multiple physicians, two or more, that would suggest that he went for a second opinion.</p><p/><p>SALTZ: But we don't know -</p><p/><p>SOUCIE: Did they know that he was a pilot? Did they know that he was a pilot? That would be my question.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: I'm assuming that they do. I mean.</p><p/><p>SOUCIE: There is no way to know. Unless you are a medical examiner, designated by the FAA, the European Association, you wouldn't know. There is no - if he doesn't tell you \"I'm a pilot,\" how would you know?</p><p/><p>SALTZ: I would say this. If it was a mental health professional who said you are too depressed to be flying in my opinion, then yes, I would say that would be a duty to warn.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Is this finally the instance that brings about real time transmission of cockpit data?</p><p/><p>SOUCIE: I can hope so. But here is something really historical with this event. There's already been action taken, there has been safety measures taken, they - EASA (ph), not only the airlines have taken measures to say we do need two people in that cockpit now as a mitigation but the regulatory authority themselves, they totally skipped right over this part of figuring out what happened and then applying the regulation, which is incredibly time consuming, Flight 447 we're still waiting on things to respond to that accident.</p><p/><p>But this is different. This is very different. I think there is a shift in the culture and I think partly it's because of all of the exposure that the airlines in this industry have gotten.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: But the pilot union has stood in opposition to the idea of real time transmission of data. How in the face of this and all of the questions that remain can they uphold that position?</p><p/><p>SOUCIE: What they are really against, and have been historically, which I think is not the case now, is that the transmission of real- time video data. Now the transmission of actual data, it happens all the time. Information from the aircraft. Now the audio and video is what they are objecting to.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: If i work at a 7-11, there's video being recorded of what I do for a living.</p><p/><p>SOUCIE: Surveillance from the time they drive to work.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: As a lay person, can I make another suggestion. Shouldn't there be some means from the cabin of alerting forces on the ground that \"hey, there is something going on in the cockpit\"?</p><p/><p>SOUCIE: There are in new aircrafts. There is a way to do that. It's not mandatory, it's not regulated but it's part of a maintenance thing. It sends information about maintenance. The seat back on Seat 5D doesn't work. They type it in. It goes straight to maintenance. By the time the aircraft lands the parts are there, they're ready to fix it. That's the kind of technology we're looking at now.</p><p/><p>SALTZ: On the ground they could unlock the door I'm just saying, right. If they knew there was a problem going on and there was a way to unlock the door. Then something like this -</p><p/><p>SOUCIE: Now we're talking about remote control. That's a big subject right now.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Final issue, a pilot who is a friend of mine. He's an aviation attorney at home in Philadelphia, he said to me, don't underestimate that bi-annual review which is a medical review of those who maintain their license to fly. He said that the interaction with the FAA airmen, there is a degree of mental health review that takes place in that process. Either of you want to respond?</p><p/><p>SALTZ: Very, very small. I think insufficient. I think that in the biannual review, much more to be in place will be both a psychological and a mental review. I think.</p><p/><p>SOUCIE: It's not a litmus test. You can't say \"hey, this guy is OK and this guy is not.\" So what happens is with the FAA we encourage them to say get a relationship with this person, try to get in their head. But it's not like psychological (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>SALTZ: That's not a trained professional, right. There should be - there are rudimentary minimalistic reviews that any primary care physician can do that would at least be somewhat of a check list to flag.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Dare I say it seems to me that the system that we have generally works, in this case this guy, if in fact he was washed out of training for a time period, because of mental health issues he should have been gone. That's the answer.</p><p/><p>SALTZ: If he was brought back he should have at least - there should be reviews like the six month reviews because we know someone who has had a history of depression can have it again.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Thank you, you got through three quarters of my list. The rest of the program I'm getting to everything else. So thank you very much.</p><p/><p>We still have so much more to get to on this. Coming up, next, what if during those last few minutes passengers were able to reach out to loved ones with e-mails, texts, videos, there could be evidence out there. The plane may be completely destroyed but we'll find out if it's technically possible to retrieve those final moments.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Welcome back. Investigators are facing the daunting task of combing through the French mountainside for clues to exactly what may have led the co-pilot to deliberately crash the plane. A significant piece to this puzzle would be whether passengers on board left any kind of evidence that shows exactly what was going on as the plane went down.</p><p/><p>Despite the fact that the airplane is completely destroyed, could investigators find any form of electronic data like e-mails, texts or cell phone video. Let's get a little bit more on this from CNN technology correspondent Samuel Burke.</p><p/><p>I flew on an A-320 yesterday. I had wi-fi, I was sending e-mails, I could have watched a movie had I chosen to do so. Presumably, by now, we know if any one had been able to send, successfully send a text, an e-mail, a video of what was transpiring. That hasn't taken place. Does that mean all is lost?</p><p/><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely not. There is still a chance that there's some type of information, photos, videos on a cell phone that may be wasn't sent to somebody but could be backed up in the cloud.</p><p/><p>Now I think it may sound ridiculous to some that people would have a phone out in this type of situation, but the truth is, Michael, this is exactly what people do nowadays. We have so many instances, just go on Youtube and type in air turbulence. And you'll see when people think the plane is about to crash this is exactly what they do.</p><p/><p>This is a video you're seeing right here of a flight that was going from South Korea to Dallas. You hear people on there saying good-bye to their wives, to their children, praying. And this is literally people what they think could be the last moments of their life, this is what many - what the new generation does, it's in a cellphone.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: In my understanding you to say you wouldn't necessarily have had to transmit it. So if I had my iPhone on that flight and if had taken video but I didn't even try to send it or I tried to send it but I didn't have service so I couldn't, it might never the less be in the cloud.</p><p/><p>BURKE: Absolutely. For instance, I use Flicker and it automatically updates all of my photos and videos to the Flicker website and many people do the same thing with iCloud so that even if you didn't send it to your wife or to whomever, it's still backed up on a server.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Even without cell service?</p><p/><p>BURKE: Well, here's the thing. Germanwings does not have wi-fi, unlike the flight you were on yesterday. We know Germanwings doesn't have wi-fi. But you have to remember they were getting closer and closer to the ground, so they may - there is a much greater likelihood at that point you're starting to get cell service, you're starting to get 3G, maybe even 4g.</p><p/><p>So even without send the picture, your internet is picking up even though this is a very amount of time it only takes a few seconds for a photo to start syncing and going into the cloud.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: OK, next question. Let's assume that that is the case which would be wonderful from an evidentiary standpoint. Who gets access?</p><p/><p>BURKE: What's interesting here is you would assume the authorities would get access but the answer to that is no, the authorities wouldn't get access at least not immediately because things are so well encrypted now, many of these tech companies after the Snowden revelations have moved to encrypt things so tightly that not even the tech companies can get in if they want. The authorities might be able to go to the tech companies, say \"sorry, there is nothing we can do\" because they literally don't have the keys.</p><p/><p>So what it would take is somebody going into their loved ones -</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: A family member.</p><p/><p>BURKE: Exactly, going into their iCloud account, going into some other type of cloud service where it's backed up, finding the photos, videos, e-mails, whatever content might have been saved on the phone and syncs and then giving it to the authorities.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: I'm not making light of this but I presume those family members would then be putting in the family pet names and all of the other usual suspects for what the passcodes, because you need the passcode. BURKE: Well, don't' forget many loved ones know the passwords of their wives, of their husbands but yes, you're absolutely right. A lot of times people - this is a situation not just people who died in a plane crash. The situation that a lot of family members find themselves in when a loved one died, they want access to their phone, to their gmail accounts, they go in and start guessing the password.</p><p/><p>And the truth is many times loved ones know those hints, where did you grow up, what was your maiden name, that is something that a loved one knows and can try to get into the account that way.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: A great point that you make. I assume that the law is still unresolved in this area. If you lose a loved one, their personal effects, their papers, their letters and so forth. They become - whomever is the beneficiary of the estate. Is the law yet settled in terms of social media. You lose a loved one and you have their phone, you have their computer, you have their laptop, can you necessarily get access?</p><p/><p>BURKE: Technology has moved much faster than our legislation. So in many places this is a very gray area. Going into somebody's account, if you know their password, well you know their password but trying to essentially hack your way in, it is illegal in some places. But again, does anybody know that you're doing it? You could say you got the e-mails and they were delivered to you. It's a very gray zone and we're seeing technology companies now trying to put measures in place that so i can give you access to my account if I die.</p><p/><p>It's kind of a digital will, if you will. And we're starting to see companies like Facebook, like Google put measures into place but it's moving very slowly.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Bottom line, Samuel, you presume that at this moment 149 grieving families are trying to get access to whatever the technology, the cyber evidence might be of their loved ones?</p><p/><p>BURKE: Absolutely. If I were in the situation this horrible situation that many of these families find themselves in, I would absolutely be trying to get into the Flicker account, if I had the password and trying to see if there is evidence that I could provide to the authorities.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Excellent report. Thank you. Samuel Burke.</p><p/><p>Coming up officials say that the captain of Germanwings flight 9525 tried for nearly 10 minutes to break into the cockpit. But was unsuccessful. Could post-9/11 security measures have played a role in the deadly crash.</p><p/><p>Plus technology is already out there that would let authorities in a crisis take complete remote control of the plane from the ground. We'll tell you more about that.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>[18:31:46] MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST: Welcome back. The terror attacks on 9/11 sparked increase security measures on airplanes to keep the bad guys out of the cockpit. And ironically, those same protections made it possible for the co-pilot of the Germanwings flight to go on a deadly path of destruction. The co- pilot deliberately carried out the disaster after locking the steel reinforced door to the cockpit.</p><p/><p>Joining me now is CNN national security analyst, Juliette Kayyem. She's also a former secretary for homeland security.</p><p/><p>Juliette, can we blame this on bin Laden?</p><p/><p>JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Oh, well, that's probably sort of too easy. Let's say it is clear that cockpit -- changes to the cockpit door that were made after 9/11 which were absolutely necessary and I have to say absolutely successful if you're looking at the threat of passengers coming into the cockpit, that that actually had this just tragic irony of the kind of disasters that we saw this week.</p><p/><p>So, like everything else, times change, risks change, and so security has to adapt to not -- you know, a threat, which is rare. but nonetheless, we've seen which is a pilot or co-pilot bringing an airplane down.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: So, the FAA, of course, has a two-person rule in the cockpit. We learned that. And now, other airlines, including Germanwings, are falling in line in that standard.</p><p/><p>Given your expertise in a national security area, are you confident that that's sufficient to ward off this type of a threat going forward? Meaning from a pilot.</p><p/><p>KAYYEM: Well, look, no security measure is perfect. And so, the way we think about it now in terms of -- especially in terms of systems like a global transportation system is that you have layered defenses. So, you look at the pilot, the passengers, the luggage, what's going on at the airport, and you put in so many different kinds of security defenses so that it makes anything that any one wants to do a little bit harder.</p><p/><p>Nothing is going to be perfect. Our global transportation system is only as strong as its weakest link. So, even if Lufthansa puts the two-pilot rule in, look, you need universal rules.</p><p/><p>But -- so that's a way to think about security. It's not like we're going to do this and it's going to fix everything and there will never be a risk again. It's just you want to put enough things in that make -- that minimize the risk for passengers or whoever else. So, that's why I'm for -- you know, videos in the cockpit. It doesn't make sense from a security perspective, it may not stop a pilot from doing something, but it will certainly help investigators and certainly the family members after the fact.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: How worried are you that the Islamic State, al Qaeda, ISIL, ISIS, radical Islam, whatever word choice you think appropriate, are paying close attention and adding now to their playbook?</p><p/><p>KAYYEM: So, they -- they are not idiots in the sense that they are looking at the news, they see all sorts of vulnerabilities in our airport system and everywhere else in terms of soft targets. I tend to take the emotionality out of these things. So, you know, the politics, the psychology, the ideology matter less to me than can we put in systems that will protect us from either the sort of random co- pilot who may have psychological problems, to an international terrorist organization that wants to bring down a plane.</p><p/><p>[18:35:04] For security purposes, the intent matters less than can you put a system in place that makes it harder for anyone, regardless of ideology of harming a large number of people.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: I worry that sometimes we overreact and have in a number of instances post-September 11. It seems -- given what we know, there's still a lot of unanswered questions. But it seems to me there was a system in place here, and it's not door that represented the failure. Presumably, the failure was on the part of the Lufthansa subsidiary that had a guy working for them that there were plenty of red flags that showed up in the course of his training, and still, with 600 hours under his belt, and a mental health issue, he was permitted to fly.</p><p/><p>KAYYEM: Right. I think that's absolutely right. Instead of looking only at the cockpit door issue which I do think is an important thing to assess, it's 15 -- almost 15 years after September 11, security should is not remain the same. We have to be mobile and fluid in how we think about security.</p><p/><p>Obviously, there's an issue regarding the psychology of pilots. Look, the military has dealt with this issue, large institutions always have to deal with this issue and get better at it. So, we don't want to look one way and say, oh, we solved it. There's obviously a number of reasons for why this happened, and why we didn't have defenses in place to avert it from happening. And we have to learn from both of them.</p><p/><p>So, we don't want to just go in with blinders about, oh, it's the cockpit door. There's a variety of factors, some of them we may never know. But some of them that could help avoid the next incident. And that's just the way we have to look at it. It's no consolation to the family members, but if we can learn how to do this better to avoid or at least minimize the likelihood that this happens again --</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>KAYYEM: -- then we learned from this tragedy.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Juliette Kayyem, thank you.</p><p/><p>KAYYEM: Thank you.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Coming up, much more of our continuing coverage of the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525. What's next for the grieving families of the passengers on that doomed jet? An attorney who represented families from another high profile plane crash joins me to weigh in.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>[18:41:04] SMERCONISH: Welcome back.</p><p/><p>While the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 is highly uncommon, it's not unheard of. Tragedies like this have occurred in the past and in some cases, air crash investigators found that the pilots expressed their intentions beforehand. That takes me to my next question. Would the legal liability of Germanwings be capped if the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane?</p><p/><p>Joining me now to discuss is Mitch Baumeister. He's an aviation attorney who represented several victim families after the crash of Egypt Air Flight 990.</p><p/><p>Mitch, that flight, Egypt Air 990, would seem analogous to what we're dealing with here. Remind us of what the facts were.</p><p/><p>MITCH BAUMEISTER, AVIATION ATTORNEY, BAUMEISTER AND SAMUELS: Well, in Egypt Air 990, Michael, we had a relief co-pilot, individual who was not going to be promoted to captain, there were a bunch of personal issues surrounding his conduct in the United States and in Egypt, and he took off, was a flight from L.A., remained overnight at JFK, then at JFK to Egypt flight.</p><p/><p>When they took off around Nantucket, he as a relief pilot went in and took the controls, the captain left the flight cockpit, left, he then took control of the plane, said, I put my hands in -- I put myself in God's hands, whatever will happen will happen, and he lit early drove the plane into the ocean. The captain returned and got in the cockpit, and actually said to this relief pilot, pull with me, do something, shut the power. Help me.</p><p/><p>He continued to push the plane into the ocean, chanting in Arabic that \"I'm in God's hands, God will take care of me\", and essentially committed his own suicide as the NTSB said, the cause of the crash was due to his direct pilot inputs, as a result of that, he committed mass murder as well as his own suicide. And --</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: I remember that -- I remember that the NTSB came to that conclusion. Is my memory accurate in that Egypt Air through the end refused to admit that that's what the cause was?</p><p/><p>BAUMEISTER: Absolutely. And, you know, having done this for 40 years and involved in every major crash, whenever we have foreign carriers and foreign governments, many of the governments own the airlines, we run into resistance for the professionalism of the NTSB. And they never wanted to acknowledge that their pilot had done this, they wanted to blame it on some kind of mechanical error.</p><p/><p>So, you are 100 percent right, Michael. Your memory is spot on. And that's what happened. Now, in 40 years, I want you to understand, and having been involved in the Lockerbie disaster and representing the fellow -- the people, Todd Beamer and Jeremy Glick in United 93 during 9/11, this is such a rare occurrence. And as a pilot over 40 years, this is such a rare occurrence, this is really the only time I have ever seen Egypt Air 990, although recently they reported it may have happened in Mozambique, and, of course, now, if the facts as stated are proven it will have happened here, sadly and tragically, in Germanwings.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Will there be a cap on damages?</p><p/><p>BAUMEISTER: There will not, Michael. And that's the second most important point. That's really one of the main reasons I'm here today.</p><p/><p>I want people to understand -- there's a lot of misinformation out there and I'm glad you asked me to come on. Unlike a domestic crash, namely a flight wholly within the United States or domestic country, this tragedy is governed by the Montreal Convention. And in the Montreal Convention, regardless of the pilot's actions, even -- as a former prosecutor who tried murder cases, even though this is a deliberate act, descending from altitude flying it into the mountain, this will not -- not only not cap the damages, which are unlimited to the extent they are provable, it will hold the airline responsible under Article 21 of the Montreal Convention.</p><p/><p>[09:45:00] And just quickly, Article 21 says the carrier will pay above approximately 150,000 automatic damages paid to the families. The carrier will be responsible for full unlimited damages above that $150,000, unless it can prove that the crash was not due to the wrongful act of its agent in the course and scope of his or her employment and we know that's, in fact, what happened here. Or, such crash was caused solely by the act of a third party.</p><p/><p>For example, flying over the ocean, and some foreign ship shot them down. Neither one of these facts obtained there will be litigation under the Montreal Convention, and there will be no cap or limit on the damages.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Mitch Baumeister, thank you so much.</p><p/><p>BAUMEISTER: OK, Michael, thank you.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Coming up, we'll head out live to Germany with the very latest on the crash investigation.</p><p/><p>Plus, ground personnel flying a jetliner by remote control. It's almost a reality. But is it a good idea?</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>[18:50:20] SMERCONISH: Welcome back.</p><p/><p>Rescue crews are battling treacherous conditions to find bodies and that one missing black box. Debris from Flight 9525 scattered across rugged remote terrain in the French Alps. Let's get right to CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, who's live in Dusseldorf with the very latest.</p><p/><p>Fred, it seems to me investigators would most want to speak to a former girlfriend to find out his mental state.</p><p/><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, probably her and I'm guessing that his family as well. However, the \"Bild\" newspaper, which is the biggest tabloid in Germany, has managed to speak to one of the ex-girlfriends, and she said that Andreas Lubitz was a man who needed a lot of attention, a man who can be sensitive, very flattering at times as well, but also someone who apparently had a dark side to him.</p><p/><p>Also, she said he became erratic at times, that he became very angry, especially when he was talking about his employer. He felt that Germanwings wasn't treating him well.</p><p/><p>This is according to the \"Bild\" newspaper. So, we're only getting this from a third source, but it certainly is, of course, a major point to these investigators, to speak to anyone who had direct contact with Andreas Lubitz, especially, of course, someone like a girlfriend, someone like his parents, someone like his brother who he was living with as well, Michael.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Do we know anything about the investigation relative to medications that he was on at the time of the crash or medications that he had stopped taking just before the crash?</p><p/><p>PLEITGEN: Very little about medications. It's -- all that we have is from the prosecutor's office, and they're saying that he was being treated for some sort of illness, and that he had been treated for it for a very long time and he was seeing a doctor. And also, of course, he had those sick notes that he tore up. It's unclear what medications he might have been on, but it's something investigators will be looking at as well.</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Frederik Pleitgen, thank you very much for your report.</p><p/><p>Coming up, the possibility of pilotless aircraft is already being explored. We'll look at a new technology that could save a plane from being hijacked.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>[18:56:47] SMERCONISH: Welcome back.</p><p/><p>The crash of the Germanwings flight has reignited the debate about aircraft control. There's already a technology that's been developed that would let authorities on the ground intervene if there's a crisis in the air. Boeing has a patent, and Google has already conducted a test flight.</p><p/><p>So, why isn't it being used?</p><p/><p>CNN's Tom Foreman has the answer. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Michael. Boeing has a patent. Google has had a test flight of one of these planes. Big tech names all over the world are looking at this idea of airplanes that can be flown remotely from the ground in the belief that this might make them impervious from terrorist attacks, from criminal acts, and from any other sort of assault.</p><p/><p>(voice-over): Watch closely. This plane over England has a crew at the controls, passengers in the back, but something extraordinary is about to happen. A pilot on the ground is taking over.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready to take control.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Proceed.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have control.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're on control.</p><p/><p>FOREMAN: This is the $94 million ASTRAEA project by the British Aerospace Company, BAE, one of several efforts around the world to develop planes that can be flown remotely.</p><p/><p>DUNCAN CASEY, TEST ENGINEER, BAE SYSTEMS: What you can hear at the moment is the discussion with air traffic that's exactly the same as the pilots would be having if they were in charge of the steering of the aircraft.</p><p/><p>FOREMAN: Military success with drones has driven much of the interest and some efforts are focused on airplanes in hazard conditions, such as hurricane research and fighting wildfires. Analysts say pilotless planes could be a $400 billion a year global business.</p><p/><p>So, why not passenger flights? First, the airline industry has remarkable safety record despite high profile disasters. Many believe on board pilots remain the most reliable way to handle problems and retrofitting planes would cost billions of dollars. And second, passengers may not be ready.</p><p/><p>Robert Goyer is with \"Flying\" magazine.</p><p/><p>ROBERT GOYER, FLYING MAGAZINE: I start by asking myself that question. How would I feel getting into an airplane that didn't have pilots up front? And I wouldn't do it.</p><p/><p>FOREMAN (on camera): There are a lot of unanswered questions still. For example, what happens if one of the planes gets free of electronic tether, what if terrorists take over a ground control station and in that fashion start controlling the plane. One possible answer would be to add more than one station at a time so that any plane must be controlled from multiple points.</p><p/><p>But even then, what if somebody hacks into the data stream and they take over the plane that way. All of these questions are going to have to be answered, because even though our planes are becoming more and more automated, and some take off and land pretty much on their own, this idea of controlling one from the ground has to be worked out in much more detail before it becomes a reality -- Michael.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>SMERCONISH: Thank you, Tom. I'm reminded of the fact that elevators used to have operators as well.</p><p/><p>Thank you so much for joining me.

Welcome to the program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By now you have heard all about the tragedy of Germanwings Flight 9525, I've been watching the coverage on CNN closely all week.  And I have some particular questions that haven't been answered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So today I've invited several experts to get those answers that I think we're all looking for, among the things that I want to know, was this crime premeditated?  In other words how could Andreas Lubitz have known that the captain would have to go and use the bathroom giving him time to change the flight course.  Did he make his terrible decision in the spur of a moment?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Another question, even though this airplane was in the words of investigators shredded like confetti is there a way to retrieve the texts, the e-mails, the videos that passengers likely took and wrote in those last terrible minutes?</p><p>Here's one more.  What's the duty of a mental health professional to report on a troubled pilot?  Our experts are here to break it down but first, to the very latest of what's happening right now on the ground. CNN's Frederick Pleitgen is in Germany with more.</p><p>Fred, I know that the \"Bild\" newspaper has spoken to a former girlfriend.  What is she saying?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, she's saying that she was together with Andreas Lubitz for about five months last year.  She said or she described him as a very sensitive man, someone who need a lot of care, a lot of attention, someone who could also be quite flattering.  She was an airline stewardess herself on Germanwings as well but she also said that he was someone who had a very dark side.  Someone who at night would wake up because he was having bad dreams, someone who would go into rages when they had fights who apparently locked himself in the bathroom once for an extended period of time.</p><p>She says ultimately the reason why they split up was because she was starting to become afraid of him and she also said that it was clear to her that he had some sort of psychological problems but it was certainly something that she said that he was trying to hide because, of course, he'd always had this big dream of being a pilot and he didn't want it destroyed by the fact that he had these health issues. Michael.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  A gliding acquaintance says that Lubitz was familiar with the area around the crash site.  What are you hearing about that?</p><p>PLEITGEN:  It's interesting because he was part of an aeronautics and hand gliding club in his town of Montabaur.  Strangely enough that giding club apparently quite frequently went to excursions down to southern France, to the foothills of the Alps.  So apparently Lubitz was also very familiar with the terrain there.  This acquaintance of his says that the aeroclub was there about 10 times and he does recall at least one time that Lubitz himself was there as well.</p><p>There is another media report out there saying that Lubitz was obsessed by the Alps that he loved the mountains there, and so certainly he would have known the terrain where he crashed and also the acquaintance also said that he was very familiar actually with the crash site itself, with that area around there.  He says he's flown over that many, many times.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  And Frederik, finally, today's \"New York Times\" says that those physician notes that were found in his apartment were from different doctors, suggesting perhaps that he went for a second opinion as to his fitness, his relative fitness.  Do you know anything about that?</p><p>PLEITGEN:  Well, yes, \"The New York Times\" is saying that he went and tried to get a second opinion.  We reached out to the University Medical Center in Dusseldorf which is a town that he lived in.  They confirmed to us that he was there for diagnostics twice this year.  It wasn't for depression, they didn't say however, whether it might have been for some other mental problem.  Certainly, the doctors notes that were found inside his apartment, there seemed to be several of them and of course the state prosecutor of Dusseldorf said that they had been destroyed obviously in attempt to try to hide from his employer that he had some sort of illness, that he was dealing with, by the way, for an extended period of time, the medical records show.</p><p>But again, we're still trying to find out what exactly he was suffering from.  There are many media outlets that are reporting that it was some sort of depression-related thing.  But what exactly it was, we don't know just yet.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  Frederik Pleitgen, thank you very much.</p><p>Let's dive right into all of this now.  Joining me is psychiatrist Dr. Gail Saltz and CNN safety analyst and former FAA safety inspector David Soucie.  I'd like to try and cover a lot of ground with my many, many questions.</p><p>David, I'll begin with you.  Is this the way you would do it?  Is this the way that a pilot seeking to crash an airplane would go about it, by manually switching the auto pilot from 33,000 feet to 96 feet, isn't  there a faster way?</p><p>DAVID SOUCIE, CNN SAFETY ANALYST:  Historically there has been and there has been done this way with Egypt Air and Silk Air, it's violent movement.  This is different.  But it is also a different aircraft. Because this aircraft is designed to protect itself from that kind of thing.  So to put it forward, it wouldn't let you do that.  It wouldn't let you just go into an uncontrolled descent.  So it's a little bit -</p><p>SMERCONISH:  This was probably sick to even ask but probably the most expeditious way then for him to go about.</p><p>SOUCIE:  I suppose that's correct.   Yes.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  Doctor, why doesn't a guy like this kill himself outside that aircraft instead of killing 149 innocents with him?</p><p>GAIL SALTZ, PSYCHIATRIST AND PSYCHOANALYST:  The question was what was his motivation?  So most suicides, in fact, the vast majority of killing yourself if you are depressed and that's your intent.  Only 2.5 percent are really killing somebody else and usually it's killing one other person, a person that you're angry at.</p><p>So this is vanishingly rare.  And this is a mass murder which makes you think about things like sociopathy, rage, desire for infamy. Those things would be motivators.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  I've heard many draw conclusions about his breathing, how he was able to maintain some rate of normal breathing for that final nine minutes.  It strikes me as a lay person that you're only able to evaluate the breathing in the context of other factors that we now know, like changing the flight altitude.  The breathing alone, I mean, he could have had a heart attack and maintained breathing.</p><p>SALTZ:  You can.  You can lose consciousness and maintain breathing. So it must have been a combination of those two things that made them think that he was awake the whole time.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  David, let's talk about the toggling of that lock switch. If the co-pilot toggled the door control to lock and thereby disabled emergency access for five minutes, is there anything that the pilot, who is trapped in the cabin, could do to gain access?</p><p>SOUCIE:  Nothing at all.  Nothing at all.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  As long as he keeps his finger on the button in a lock position.</p><p>SOUCIE:  Well and past five minutes as well he could just continue to hold it down.  </p><p>SMERCONISH:  OK.  Because there are reports that after five minutes there is a burst of 30 seconds of opportunity that would allow the pilot to come back in.</p><p>SOUCIE:  Well, after the - only after the five minutes can you enter the  code which then triggers the 30 seconds period to notify the captain, if the captain does not respond by opening the door or locking the door, the door actually opens for five seconds by itself. SMERCONISH:  Doctor, he would have had to maintain an amazing level of constitution to hear the pilot outside banging on the door, trying to break down the door, and then in the end, people screaming for as long as nine minutes, maintain that breathing, and continue to do that which he was doing.</p><p>SALTZ:  I think there are two possibilities that that suggest.  One is that you know, this was premeditated, this is a person who's thought a lot about this and does not have the empathy to be concerned about that.  In other words, we're talking about sociopathy, someone who would plan that.  This is what they wanted so it's not going to upset them.</p><p>The other possibility is that, you know, they have suffered so much themselves that the relative suffering of others is not that disturbing to them.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  Somehow he was able to put on blinders -</p><p>SALTZ:  Right.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  Meaning for hearing purposes.  And block it all out.</p><p>SALTZ:  Well, it doesn't mean it was blocked out.  It may mean that it fit with whatever - this is completely conjecture you have to realize. We don't know what was in his mind.  But you know, when people internally suffer terrible depression, or psychosis, I mean it is utter torment.  And that kind of torment might really surpass the idea that other people would be screaming or frightened.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  David, the FAA two person in the cockpit rule was designed to address incapacitation on the part of a pilot.  Is it appropriate in a circumstance like this, will it thwart a pilot himself who has turned bad?</p><p>SOUCIE:  Actually, we should clarify a little bit why that rule is in place.  The only reason that rule is in place originally is the fact that there was - there were no cameras to identify someone trying to get in.  So they had to have a second person there because just looking through a peep hole to identify who that person is.  So that was the original.</p><p>But the second part of your question, I'm sorry, I kind of got side tracked on that.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  Will this new methodology of requiring two individuals in the cockpit, will that necessarily prevent a cockpit, a pilot who turns bad?</p><p>SOUCIE:  It certainly will because since that's been implemented and the airlines that it has been implemented in there has been no attempts, not even attempts at suicide or any kind of disruption in the cockpit since that rule.</p><p>SALTZ:  I'm also going to add to that.  It's very different to have people behind you that are anonymous in a plane that you're killing and somebody that you actually take on in a cockpit.</p><p>SOUCIE:  So deterrent rather than prevention.  This is not going to stop an attack that has already started.  What it will do is prevent one from starting in the first place.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  Can a pilot who is being treated for mental health issues maintain his or her career, or is this a professional death sentence? </p><p>SALTZ:  Absolutely they can maintain their career.  The issue is really the beginning of treatment.  So, you want to stop them from being responsible for other people when they are in the depths of the illness.  And when they are beginning medication which has some risk associated with it.  We know that it may increase agitation or some suicide risk at the beginning of medication.  That's why pilots aren't supposed to fly then.</p><p>But these are treatment - let's put it this way.  If it is depression, it is a treatable illness and once it is treated somebody is like anybody else.  One out of every 10 people get depression.  Are we going to say that those people should never be responsible for anyone else?  Then one out of 10 should never drive, one out of 10 should never - it doesn't make sense.  The point is when depression is resolved you are back to functional.  </p><p>SMERCONISH:  One of the few cases I remember from law school that I can cite by name is the Terasoft case.  You know of what I'm speaking.</p><p>SALTZ:  Correct.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  What is the duty on the part of a mental health practitioner dealing with someone like him, again we're presuming, but presuming that he is unfit, is there a duty to report him to the employer? </p><p>SALTZ:  So, the duty to warn for a psychiatrist or a mental healthcare worker is basically if the patient has in any way let you know that they are a risk to themselves or other people.  So had he said anything about  you know, I have a plan or I want to do this or even I want to kill myself, that psychiatrist would have a duty to warn law enforcement or  whoever is deemed at risk.</p><p>So, if he says something about taking down a plane, of course that would be the employer, or you know, whoever he mentioned.  If he said I want to get my girlfriend.  That he would - you would have a duty to warn the girlfriend.  But this is a person who everybody is saying was very secretive.  And psychiatrists aren't mind readers so if he mentioned nothing of any of this, then actually the psychiatrist has a duty to keep confidentiality.</p><p>I know people have said \"hey -\"</p><p>SMERCONISH:  But did he go too far?</p><p>SALTZ:  Do we go too far?  So the question is this.  This man probably would never have come into treatment at all if - that's the issue really, right?  If you think you have no confidentiality, if you just come in and say \"I have depression, and now I'm going to report it to your employer,\" you're never going to come in the first place.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  To a lay person it sounds frightening.  I've seen the list of medications that according to the FAA standard that one can be on and still be working.</p><p>SALTZ:  Yes.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  You want to dissuade me from my discomfort?</p><p>SALTZ:  Yes, I think - yes, I do.  Because I think that you have to look at what are the specific side effects of those medications.  So if we're talking about medical problems , I mean, if the only person who could fly is somebody who is on zero medications, has zero medical problems, then we're probably taking out any one who has experience, the very person  that we want to be flying for us.</p><p>So I think that what people have to understand is psychiatric illnesses can impair you in a short-term but once treated, not in the long term.  Psychotic disorder like schizophrenia that's a different story.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  It troubles me though the idea that, again, let's make the presumption and let the audience know this is based on conjecture and reporting.  It troubles me to think that mental health professional would have deemed him unfit, unfit for what, not to be a CNN host, they knew he  was a pilot.  Unfit to take command of 149 other lives?</p><p>SALTZ:  We don't know.  We don't know if that's true.  We knew somebody wrote a note that said you may not work this day.  Now, I don't know if that was permission not to work, if that was by that doctor -</p><p>SMERCONISH:  The \"Times\" is reporting today that multiple physicians, two or more, that would suggest that he went for a second opinion.</p><p>SALTZ:  But we don't know -</p><p>SOUCIE:  Did they know that he was a pilot?  Did they know that he was a pilot?  That would be my question.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  I'm assuming that they do.  I mean.</p><p>SOUCIE:  There is no way to know.  Unless you are a medical examiner, designated by the FAA, the European Association, you wouldn't know. There is no - if he doesn't tell you \"I'm a pilot,\" how would you know? </p><p>SALTZ:  I would say this.  If it was a mental health professional who said you are too depressed to be flying in my opinion, then yes, I would say that would be a duty to warn.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  Is this finally the instance that brings about real time transmission of cockpit data?</p><p>SOUCIE:  I can hope so.  But here is something really historical with this event.  There's already been action taken, there has been safety measures taken, they - EASA (ph), not only the airlines have taken measures to say we do need two people in that cockpit now as a mitigation but the regulatory authority themselves, they totally skipped right over this part of figuring out what happened and then applying the regulation, which is incredibly time consuming, Flight 447 we're still waiting on things to respond to that accident.</p><p>But this is different.  This is very different.  I think there is a shift in the culture and I think partly it's because of all of the exposure that the airlines in this industry have gotten.  </p><p>SMERCONISH:  But the pilot union has stood in opposition to the idea of real time transmission of data.  How in the face of this and all of the questions that remain can they uphold that position?</p><p>SOUCIE:  What they are really against, and have been historically, which I think is not the case now, is that the transmission of real- time video data.  Now the transmission of actual data, it happens all the time.  Information from the aircraft.  Now the audio and video is what they are objecting to.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  If i work at a 7-11, there's video being recorded of what I do for a living.  </p><p>SOUCIE:  Surveillance from the time they drive to work.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  As a lay person, can I make another suggestion. Shouldn't there be some means from the cabin of alerting forces on the ground that \"hey, there is something going on in the cockpit\"?</p><p>SOUCIE:  There are in new aircrafts.  There is a way to do that.  It's not mandatory, it's not regulated but it's part of a maintenance thing.  It sends information about maintenance.  The seat back on Seat 5D doesn't work.  They type it in.  It goes straight to maintenance. By the time the aircraft lands the parts are there, they're ready to fix it.  That's the kind of technology we're looking at now.</p><p>SALTZ:  On the ground they could unlock the door I'm just saying, right.  If they knew there was a problem going on and there was a way to unlock the door.  Then something like this -</p><p>SOUCIE:  Now we're talking about remote control.  That's a big subject right now.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Final issue, a pilot who is a friend of mine.  He's an aviation attorney at home in Philadelphia, he said to me, don't underestimate that bi-annual review which is a medical review of those who maintain their license to fly.  He said that the interaction with the FAA airmen, there is a degree of mental health review that takes place in that process.  Either of you want to respond?</p><p>SALTZ:  Very, very small.  I think insufficient.  I think that in the biannual review, much more to be in place will be both a psychological and a mental review.  I think.</p><p>SOUCIE:  It's not a litmus test.  You can't say \"hey, this guy is OK and this guy is not.\"  So what happens is with the FAA we encourage them to say get a relationship with this person, try to get in their head.  But it's not like psychological (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SALTZ:  That's not a trained professional, right.  There should be - there are rudimentary minimalistic reviews that any primary care physician can do that would at least be somewhat of a check list to flag.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  Dare I say it seems to me that the system that we have generally works, in this case this guy, if in fact he was washed out of training for a time period, because of mental health issues he should have been gone.  That's the answer.</p><p>SALTZ:  If he was brought back he should have at least - there should be reviews like the six month reviews because we know someone who has had a history of depression can have it again.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  Thank you, you got through three quarters of my list. The rest of the program I'm getting to everything else.  So thank you very much.</p><p>We still have so much more to get to on this.  Coming up, next, what if during those last few minutes passengers were able to reach out to loved ones with e-mails, texts, videos, there could be evidence out there.  The plane may be completely destroyed but we'll find out if it's technically possible to retrieve those final moments.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMERCONISH:  Welcome back.  Investigators are facing the daunting task of combing through the French mountainside for clues to exactly what may have led the co-pilot to deliberately crash the plane.  A significant piece to this puzzle would be whether passengers on board left any kind of evidence that shows exactly what was going on as the plane went down.  </p><p>Despite the fact that the airplane is completely destroyed, could investigators find any form of electronic data like e-mails, texts or cell phone video.  Let's get a little bit more on this from CNN technology correspondent Samuel Burke.</p><p>I flew on an A-320 yesterday.  I had wi-fi, I was sending e-mails, I could have watched a movie had I chosen to do so.  Presumably, by now, we know if any one had been able to send, successfully send a text, an e-mail, a video of what was transpiring.  That hasn't taken place. Does that mean all is lost?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely not.  There is still a chance that there's some type of information, photos, videos on a cell phone that may be wasn't sent to somebody but could be backed up in the cloud.</p><p>Now I think it may sound ridiculous to some that people would have a phone out in this type of situation, but the truth is, Michael, this is exactly what people do nowadays.  We have so many instances, just go on Youtube and type in air turbulence.  And you'll see when people think the plane is about to crash this is exactly what they do.</p><p>This is a video you're seeing right here of a flight that was going from South Korea to Dallas.  You hear people on there saying good-bye to their wives, to their children, praying.  And this is literally people what they think could be the last moments of their life, this is what many - what the new generation does, it's in a cellphone.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  In my understanding you to say you wouldn't necessarily have had to transmit it.  So if I had my iPhone on that flight and if had taken video but I didn't even try to send it or I tried to send it but I didn't have service so I couldn't, it might never the less be in the cloud.</p><p>BURKE:  Absolutely.  For instance, I use Flicker and it automatically updates all of my photos and videos to the Flicker website and many people do the same thing with iCloud so that even if you didn't send it to your wife or to whomever, it's still backed up on a server.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  Even without cell service?</p><p>BURKE:  Well, here's the thing.  Germanwings does not have wi-fi, unlike the flight you were on yesterday.  We know Germanwings doesn't have wi-fi.  But you have to remember they were getting closer and closer to the ground, so they may - there is a much greater likelihood at that point you're starting to get cell service, you're starting to get 3G, maybe even 4g.</p><p>So even without send the picture, your internet is picking up even though this is a very amount of time it only takes a few seconds for a photo to start syncing and going into the cloud. </p><p>CAVUTO:  OK, next question.  Let's assume that that is the case which would be wonderful from an evidentiary standpoint.  Who gets access?</p><p>BURKE:  What's interesting here is you would assume the authorities would get access but the answer to that is no, the authorities wouldn't get access at least not immediately because things are so well encrypted  now, many of these tech companies after the Snowden revelations have moved to encrypt things so tightly that not even the tech companies can  get in if they want.  The authorities might be able to go to the tech companies, say \"sorry, there is nothing we can do\" because they literally don't have the keys.</p><p>So what it would take is somebody going into their loved ones -</p><p>SMERCONISH:  A family member.</p><p>BURKE: Exactly, going into their iCloud account, going into some other type of cloud service where it's backed up, finding the photos, videos, e-mails, whatever content might have been saved on the phone and syncs and then giving it to the authorities.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  I'm not making light of this but I presume those family members would then be putting in the family pet names and all of the other usual suspects for what the passcodes, because you need the passcode.   BURKE:  Well, don't' forget many loved ones know the passwords of their wives, of their husbands but yes, you're absolutely right.  A lot of times people - this is a situation not just people who died in a plane crash.  The situation that a lot of family members find themselves in when a loved one died, they want access to their phone, to their gmail accounts, they go in and start guessing the password.</p><p>And the truth is many times loved ones know those hints, where did you grow up, what was your maiden name, that is something that a loved one knows and can try to get into the account that way.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  A great point that you make.  I assume that the law is still unresolved in this area.  If you lose a loved one, their personal effects, their papers, their letters and so forth.  They become - whomever is the beneficiary of the estate.  Is the law yet settled in terms of social media.  You lose a loved one and you have their phone, you have their computer, you have their laptop, can you necessarily get access?</p><p>BURKE:  Technology has moved much faster than our legislation.  So in many places this is a very gray area.  Going into somebody's account, if you know their password, well you know their password but trying to essentially hack your way in, it is illegal in some places.  But again, does anybody know that you're doing it?  You could say you got the e-mails and they were delivered to you.  It's a very gray zone and we're  seeing technology companies now trying to put measures in place that so i can give you access to my account if I die.</p><p>It's kind of a digital will, if you will.  And we're starting to see companies like Facebook, like Google put measures into place but it's moving very slowly.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  Bottom line, Samuel, you presume that at this moment 149 grieving families are trying to get access to whatever the technology, the cyber evidence might be of their loved ones?</p><p>BURKE:  Absolutely.  If I were in the situation this horrible situation that many of these families find themselves in, I would absolutely be trying to get into the Flicker account, if I had the password and trying to see if there is evidence that I could provide to the authorities.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  Excellent report.  Thank you.  Samuel Burke.</p><p>Coming up officials say that the captain of Germanwings flight 9525 tried for nearly 10 minutes to break into the cockpit.  But was unsuccessful.  Could post-9/11 security measures have played a role in the deadly crash.  </p><p>Plus technology is already out there that would let authorities in a crisis take complete remote control of the plane from the ground. We'll tell you more about that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:31:46] MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST:  Welcome back.   The terror attacks on 9/11 sparked increase security measures on airplanes to keep the bad guys out of the cockpit.  And ironically, those same protections made it possible for the co-pilot of the Germanwings flight to go on a deadly path of destruction.  The co- pilot deliberately carried out the disaster after locking the steel reinforced door to the cockpit.</p><p>Joining me now is CNN national security analyst, Juliette Kayyem. She's also a former secretary for homeland security.  </p><p>Juliette, can we blame this on bin Laden?  </p><p>JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Oh, well, that's probably sort of too easy.  Let's say it is clear that cockpit -- changes to the cockpit door that were made after 9/11 which were absolutely necessary and I have to say absolutely successful if you're looking at the threat of passengers coming into the cockpit, that that actually had this just tragic irony of the kind of disasters that we saw this week.  </p><p>So, like everything else, times change, risks change, and so security has to adapt to not -- you know, a threat, which is rare. but nonetheless, we've seen which is a pilot or co-pilot bringing an airplane down.  </p><p>SMERCONISH:  So, the FAA, of course, has a two-person rule in the cockpit.  We learned that.  And now, other airlines, including Germanwings, are falling in line in that standard.  </p><p>Given your expertise in a national security area, are you confident that that's sufficient to ward off this type of a threat going forward?  Meaning from a pilot.  </p><p>KAYYEM:  Well, look, no security measure is perfect.  And so, the way we think about it now in terms of -- especially in terms of systems like a global transportation system is that you have layered defenses. So, you look at the pilot, the passengers, the luggage, what's going on at the airport, and you put in so many different kinds of security defenses so that it makes anything that any one wants to do a little bit harder.  </p><p>Nothing is going to be perfect.  Our global transportation system is only as strong as its weakest link.  So, even if Lufthansa puts the two-pilot rule in, look, you need universal rules. </p><p>But -- so that's a way to think about security.  It's not like we're going to do this and it's going to fix everything and there will never be a risk again.  It's just you want to put enough things in that make -- that minimize the risk for passengers or whoever else.  So, that's why I'm for -- you know, videos in the cockpit.  It doesn't make sense from a security perspective, it may not stop a pilot from doing something, but it will certainly help investigators and certainly the family members after the fact.  </p><p>SMERCONISH:  How worried are you that the Islamic State, al Qaeda, ISIL, ISIS, radical Islam, whatever word choice you think appropriate, are paying close attention and adding now to their playbook?  </p><p>KAYYEM:  So, they -- they are not idiots in the sense that they are looking at the news, they see all sorts of vulnerabilities in our airport system and everywhere else in terms of soft targets.  I tend to take the emotionality out of these things.  So, you know, the politics, the psychology, the ideology matter less to me than can we put in systems that will protect us from either the sort of random co- pilot who may have psychological problems, to an international terrorist organization that wants to bring down a plane.  </p><p>[18:35:04] For security purposes, the intent matters less than can you put a system in place that makes it harder for anyone, regardless of ideology of harming a large number of people.  </p><p>SMERCONISH:  I worry that sometimes we overreact and have in a number of instances post-September 11.  It seems -- given what we know, there's still a lot of unanswered questions.  But it seems to me there was a system in place here, and it's not door that represented the failure.  Presumably, the failure was on the part of the Lufthansa subsidiary that had a guy working for them that there were plenty of red flags that showed up in the course of his training, and still, with 600 hours under his belt, and a mental health issue, he was permitted to fly.  </p><p>KAYYEM:  Right.  I think that's absolutely right.  Instead of looking only at the cockpit door issue which I do think is an important thing to assess, it's 15 -- almost 15 years after September 11, security should is not remain the same.  We have to be mobile and fluid in how we think about security.  </p><p>Obviously, there's an issue regarding the psychology of pilots.  Look, the military has dealt with this issue, large institutions always have to deal with this issue and get better at it.  So, we don't want to look one way and say, oh, we solved it.  There's obviously a number of reasons for why this happened, and why we didn't have defenses in place to avert it from happening.  And we have to learn from both of them.  </p><p>So, we don't want to just go in with blinders about, oh, it's the cockpit door.  There's a variety of factors, some of them we may never know.  But some of them that could help avoid the next incident.  And that's just the way we have to look at it.  It's no consolation to the family members, but if we can learn how to do this better to avoid or at least minimize the likelihood that this happens again -- </p><p>SMERCONISH:  Absolutely.  </p><p>KAYYEM:  -- then we learned from this tragedy.  </p><p>SMERCONISH:  Juliette Kayyem, thank you.  </p><p>KAYYEM:  Thank you.</p><p>SMERCONISH:  Coming up, much more of our continuing coverage of the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525.  What's next for the grieving families of the passengers on that doomed jet?   An attorney who represented families from another high profile plane crash joins me to weigh in.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:41:04] SMERCONISH:  Welcome back.  </p><p>While the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 is highly uncommon, it's not unheard of.  Tragedies like this have occurred in the past and in some cases, air crash investigators found that the pilots expressed their intentions beforehand.  That takes me to my next question. Would the legal liability of Germanwings be capped if the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane?  </p><p>Joining me now to discuss is Mitch Baumeister.  He's an aviation attorney who represented several victim families after the crash of Egypt Air Flight 990.  </p><p>Mitch, that flight, Egypt Air 990, would seem analogous to what we're dealing with here.  Remind us of what the facts were.  </p><p>MITCH BAUMEISTER, AVIATION ATTORNEY, BAUMEISTER AND SAMUELS:  Well, in Egypt Air 990, Michael, we had a relief co-pilot, individual who was not going to be promoted to captain, there were a bunch of personal issues surrounding his conduct in the United States and in Egypt, and he took off, was a flight from L.A., remained overnight at JFK, then at JFK to Egypt flight.  </p><p>When they took off around Nantucket, he as a relief pilot went in and took the controls, the captain left the flight cockpit, left, he then took control of the plane, said, I put my hands in -- I put myself in God's hands, whatever will happen will happen, and he lit early drove the plane into the ocean.  The captain returned and got in the cockpit, and actually said to this relief pilot, pull with me, do something, shut the power.  Help me.  </p><p>He continued to push the plane into the ocean, chanting in Arabic that \"I'm in God's hands, God will take care of me\", and essentially committed his own suicide as the NTSB said, the cause of the crash was due to his direct pilot inputs, as a result of that, he committed mass murder as well as his own suicide.  And --  </p><p>SMERCONISH:  I remember that -- I remember that the NTSB came to that conclusion.  Is my memory accurate in that Egypt Air through the end refused to admit that that's what the cause was?  </p><p>BAUMEISTER:  Absolutely.  And, you know, having done this for 40 years and involved in every major crash, whenever we have foreign carriers and foreign governments, many of the governments own the airlines, we run into resistance for the professionalism of the NTSB.  And they never wanted to acknowledge that their pilot had done this, they wanted to blame it on some kind of mechanical error.  </p><p>So, you are 100 percent right, Michael.  Your memory is spot on.  And that's what happened.   Now, in 40 years, I want you to understand, and having been involved in the Lockerbie disaster and representing the fellow -- the people, Todd Beamer and Jeremy Glick in United 93 during 9/11, this is such a rare occurrence.  And as a pilot over 40 years, this is such a rare occurrence, this is really the only time I have ever seen Egypt Air 990, although recently they reported it may have happened in Mozambique, and, of course, now, if the facts as stated are proven it will have happened here, sadly and tragically, in Germanwings.  </p><p>SMERCONISH:  Will there be a cap on damages?  </p><p>BAUMEISTER:  There will not, Michael.  And that's the second most important point.  That's really one of the main reasons I'm here today.  </p><p>I want people to understand -- there's a lot of misinformation out there and I'm glad you asked me to come on.  Unlike a domestic crash, namely a flight wholly within the United States or domestic country, this tragedy is governed by the Montreal Convention.  And in the Montreal Convention, regardless of the pilot's actions, even -- as a former prosecutor who tried murder cases, even though this is a deliberate act, descending from altitude flying it into the mountain, this will not -- not only not cap the damages, which are unlimited to the extent they are provable, it will hold the airline responsible under Article 21 of the Montreal Convention.  </p><p>[09:45:00] And just quickly, Article 21 says the carrier will pay above approximately 150,000 automatic damages paid to the families. The carrier will be responsible for full unlimited damages above that $150,000, unless it can prove that the crash was not due to the wrongful act of its agent in the course and scope of his or her employment and we know that's, in fact, what happened here.  Or, such crash was caused solely by the act of a third party.  </p><p>For example, flying over the ocean, and some foreign ship shot them down.  Neither one of these facts obtained there will be litigation under the Montreal Convention, and there will be no cap or limit on the damages.  </p><p>SMERCONISH:  Mitch Baumeister, thank you so much.  </p><p>BAUMEISTER:  OK, Michael, thank you.  </p><p>SMERCONISH:  Coming up, we'll head out live to Germany with the very latest on the crash investigation.  </p><p>Plus, ground personnel flying a jetliner by remote control.  It's almost a reality.  But is it a good idea?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:50:20] SMERCONISH:  Welcome back.  </p><p>Rescue crews are battling treacherous conditions to find bodies and that one missing black box.  Debris from Flight 9525 scattered across rugged remote terrain in the French Alps.   Let's get right to CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, who's live in Dusseldorf with the very latest.</p><p>Fred, it seems to me investigators would most want to speak to a former girlfriend to find out his mental state.  </p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, probably her and I'm guessing that his family as well.  However, the \"Bild\" newspaper, which is the biggest tabloid in Germany, has managed to speak to one of the ex-girlfriends, and she said that Andreas Lubitz was a man who needed a lot of attention, a man who can be sensitive, very flattering at times as well, but also someone who apparently had a dark side to him.  </p><p>Also, she said he became erratic at times, that he became very angry, especially when he was talking about his employer.  He felt that Germanwings wasn't treating him well.  </p><p>This is according to the \"Bild\" newspaper.  So, we're only getting this from a third source, but it certainly is, of course, a major point to these investigators, to speak to anyone who had direct contact with Andreas Lubitz, especially, of course, someone like a girlfriend, someone like his parents, someone like his brother who he was living with as well, Michael.  </p><p>SMERCONISH:  Do we know anything about the investigation relative to medications that he was on at the time of the crash or medications that he had stopped taking just before the crash?  </p><p>PLEITGEN:  Very little about medications.  It's -- all that we have is from the prosecutor's office, and they're saying that he was being treated for some sort of illness, and that he had been treated for it for a very long time and he was seeing a doctor.  And also, of course, he had those sick notes that he tore up.  It's unclear what medications he might have been on, but it's something investigators will be looking at as well.  </p><p>SMERCONISH:  Frederik Pleitgen, thank you very much for your report.  </p><p>Coming up, the possibility of pilotless aircraft is already being explored.  We'll look at a new technology that could save a plane from being hijacked.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:56:47] SMERCONISH:  Welcome back.  </p><p>The crash of the Germanwings flight has reignited the debate about aircraft control.  There's already a technology that's been developed that would let authorities on the ground intervene if there's a crisis in the air.  Boeing has a patent, and Google has already conducted a test flight.  </p><p>So, why isn't it being used?  </p><p>CNN's Tom Foreman has the answer.   (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Michael.  Boeing has a patent. Google has had a test flight of one of these planes.  Big tech names all over the world are looking at this idea of airplanes that can be flown remotely from the ground in the belief that this might make them impervious from terrorist attacks, from criminal acts, and from any other sort of assault.</p><p>(voice-over):  Watch closely.  This plane over England has a crew at the controls, passengers in the back, but something extraordinary is about to happen.  A pilot on the ground is taking over.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ready to take control.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Proceed.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have control.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You're on control.</p><p>FOREMAN:  This is the $94 million ASTRAEA project by the British Aerospace Company, BAE, one of several efforts around the world to develop planes that can be flown remotely.  </p><p>DUNCAN CASEY, TEST ENGINEER, BAE SYSTEMS:  What you can hear at the moment is the discussion with air traffic that's exactly the same as the pilots would be having if they were in charge of the steering of the aircraft.  </p><p>FOREMAN:  Military success with drones has driven much of the interest and some efforts are focused on airplanes in hazard conditions, such as hurricane research and fighting wildfires.  Analysts say pilotless planes could be a $400 billion a year global business.  </p><p>So, why not passenger flights?  First, the airline industry has remarkable safety record despite high profile disasters.  Many believe on board pilots remain the most reliable way to handle problems and retrofitting planes would cost billions of dollars.  And second, passengers may not be ready.  </p><p>Robert Goyer is with \"Flying\" magazine.  </p><p>ROBERT GOYER, FLYING MAGAZINE:  I start by asking myself that question.  How would I feel getting into an airplane that didn't have pilots up front?  And I wouldn't do it.  </p><p>FOREMAN (on camera):  There are a lot of unanswered questions still. For example, what happens if one of the planes gets free of electronic tether, what if terrorists take over a ground control station and in that fashion start controlling the plane.  One possible answer would be to add more than one station at a time so that any plane must be controlled from multiple points.  </p><p>But even then, what if somebody hacks into the data stream and they take over the plane that way.   All of these questions are going to have to be answered, because even though our planes are becoming more and more automated, and some take off and land pretty much on their own, this idea of controlling one from the ground has to be worked out in much more detail before it becomes a reality -- Michael.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SMERCONISH:  Thank you, Tom.

A significant piece to this puzzle would be whether passengers on board left any kind of evidence that shows exactly what was going on as the plane went down. The terror attacks on 9/11 sparked increase security measures on airplanes to keep the bad guys out of the cockpit, and ironically, those same protections made it possible for the co-pilot of the Germanwings flight to go on a deadly path of destruction. Rescue crews are battling treacherous conditions to find bodies and that one missing black box, as debris from Flight 9525 scattered across rugged remote terrain in the French Alps.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST: I'm Michael Smerconish. Welcome to the program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By now you have heard all about the tragedy of Germanwings Flight 9525, I've been watching the coverage on CNN closely all week. And I have some particular questions that haven't been answered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So today I've invited several experts to get those answers that I think we're all looking for, among the things that I want to know, was this crime premeditated? In other words how could Andreas Lubitz have known that the captain would have to go and use the bathroom giving him time to change the flight course. Did he make his terrible decision in the spur of a moment?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Another question, even though this airplane was in the words of investigators shredded like confetti is there a way to retrieve the texts, the e-mails, the videos that passengers likely took and wrote in those last terrible minutes?</p><p>Here's one more. What's the duty of a mental health professional to report on a troubled pilot? Our experts are here to break it down but first, to the very latest of what's happening right now on the ground. CNN's Frederick Pleitgen is in Germany with more.</p><p>Fred, I know that the \"Bild\" newspaper has spoken to a former girlfriend. What is she saying?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, she's saying that she was together with Andreas Lubitz for about five months last year. She said or she described him as a very sensitive man, someone who need a lot of care, a lot of attention, someone who could also be quite flattering. She was an airline stewardess herself on Germanwings as well but she also said that he was someone who had a very dark side. Someone who at night would wake up because he was having bad dreams, someone who would go into rages when they had fights who apparently locked himself in the bathroom once for an extended period of time.</p><p>She says ultimately the reason why they split up was because she was starting to become afraid of him and she also said that it was clear to her that he had some sort of psychological problems but it was certainly something that she said that he was trying to hide because, of course, he'd always had this big dream of being a pilot and he didn't want it destroyed by the fact that he had these health issues. Michael.</p><p>SMERCONISH: A gliding acquaintance says that Lubitz was familiar with the area around the crash site. What are you hearing about that?</p><p>PLEITGEN: It's interesting because he was part of an aeronautics and hand gliding club in his town of Montabaur. Strangely enough that giding club apparently quite frequently went to excursions down to southern France, to the foothills of the Alps. So apparently Lubitz was also very familiar with the terrain there. This acquaintance of his says that the aeroclub was there about 10 times and he does recall at least one time that Lubitz himself was there as well.</p><p>There is another media report out there saying that Lubitz was obsessed by the Alps that he loved the mountains there, and so certainly he would have known the terrain where he crashed and also the acquaintance also said that he was very familiar actually with the crash site itself, with that area around there. He says he's flown over that many, many times.</p><p>SMERCONISH: And Frederik, finally, today's \"New York Times\" says that those physician notes that were found in his apartment were from different doctors, suggesting perhaps that he went for a second opinion as to his fitness, his relative fitness. Do you know anything about that?</p><p>PLEITGEN: Well, yes, \"The New York Times\" is saying that he went and tried to get a second opinion. We reached out to the University Medical Center in Dusseldorf which is a town that he lived in. They confirmed to us that he was there for diagnostics twice this year. It wasn't for depression, they didn't say however, whether it might have been for some other mental problem. Certainly, the doctors notes that were found inside his apartment, there seemed to be several of them and of course the state prosecutor of Dusseldorf said that they had been destroyed obviously in attempt to try to hide from his employer that he had some sort of illness, that he was dealing with, by the way, for an extended period of time, the medical records show.</p><p>But again, we're still trying to find out what exactly he was suffering from. There are many media outlets that are reporting that it was some sort of depression-related thing. But what exactly it was, we don't know just yet.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Frederik Pleitgen, thank you very much.</p><p>Let's dive right into all of this now. Joining me is psychiatrist Dr. Gail Saltz and CNN safety analyst and former FAA safety inspector David Soucie. I'd like to try and cover a lot of ground with my many, many questions.</p><p>David, I'll begin with you. Is this the way you would do it? Is this the way that a pilot seeking to crash an airplane would go about it, by manually switching the auto pilot from 33,000 feet to 96 feet, isn't there a faster way?</p><p>DAVID SOUCIE, CNN SAFETY ANALYST: Historically there has been and there has been done this way with Egypt Air and Silk Air, it's violent movement. This is different. But it is also a different aircraft. Because this aircraft is designed to protect itself from that kind of thing. So to put it forward, it wouldn't let you do that. It wouldn't let you just go into an uncontrolled descent. So it's a little bit -</p><p>SMERCONISH: This was probably sick to even ask but probably the most expeditious way then for him to go about.</p><p>SOUCIE: I suppose that's correct. Yes.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Doctor, why doesn't a guy like this kill himself outside that aircraft instead of killing 149 innocents with him?</p><p>GAIL SALTZ, PSYCHIATRIST AND PSYCHOANALYST: The question was what was his motivation? So most suicides, in fact, the vast majority of killing yourself if you are depressed and that's your intent. Only 2.5 percent are really killing somebody else and usually it's killing one other person, a person that you're angry at.</p><p>So this is vanishingly rare. And this is a mass murder which makes you think about things like sociopathy, rage, desire for infamy. Those things would be motivators.</p><p>SMERCONISH: I've heard many draw conclusions about his breathing, how he was able to maintain some rate of normal breathing for that final nine minutes. It strikes me as a lay person that you're only able to evaluate the breathing in the context of other factors that we now know, like changing the flight altitude. The breathing alone, I mean, he could have had a heart attack and maintained breathing.</p><p>SALTZ: You can. You can lose consciousness and maintain breathing. So it must have been a combination of those two things that made them think that he was awake the whole time.</p><p>SMERCONISH: David, let's talk about the toggling of that lock switch. If the co-pilot toggled the door control to lock and thereby disabled emergency access for five minutes, is there anything that the pilot, who is trapped in the cabin, could do to gain access?</p><p>SOUCIE: Nothing at all. Nothing at all.</p><p>SMERCONISH: As long as he keeps his finger on the button in a lock position.</p><p>SOUCIE: Well and past five minutes as well he could just continue to hold it down.</p><p>SMERCONISH: OK. Because there are reports that after five minutes there is a burst of 30 seconds of opportunity that would allow the pilot to come back in.</p><p>SOUCIE: Well, after the - only after the five minutes can you enter the code which then triggers the 30 seconds period to notify the captain, if the captain does not respond by opening the door or locking the door, the door actually opens for five seconds by itself. SMERCONISH: Doctor, he would have had to maintain an amazing level of constitution to hear the pilot outside banging on the door, trying to break down the door, and then in the end, people screaming for as long as nine minutes, maintain that breathing, and continue to do that which he was doing.</p><p>SALTZ: I think there are two possibilities that that suggest. One is that you know, this was premeditated, this is a person who's thought a lot about this and does not have the empathy to be concerned about that. In other words, we're talking about sociopathy, someone who would plan that. This is what they wanted so it's not going to upset them.</p><p>The other possibility is that, you know, they have suffered so much themselves that the relative suffering of others is not that disturbing to them.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Somehow he was able to put on blinders -</p><p>SALTZ: Right.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Meaning for hearing purposes. And block it all out.</p><p>SALTZ: Well, it doesn't mean it was blocked out. It may mean that it fit with whatever - this is completely conjecture you have to realize. We don't know what was in his mind. But you know, when people internally suffer terrible depression, or psychosis, I mean it is utter torment. And that kind of torment might really surpass the idea that other people would be screaming or frightened.</p><p>SMERCONISH: David, the FAA two person in the cockpit rule was designed to address incapacitation on the part of a pilot. Is it appropriate in a circumstance like this, will it thwart a pilot himself who has turned bad?</p><p>SOUCIE: Actually, we should clarify a little bit why that rule is in place. The only reason that rule is in place originally is the fact that there was - there were no cameras to identify someone trying to get in. So they had to have a second person there because just looking through a peep hole to identify who that person is. So that was the original.</p><p>But the second part of your question, I'm sorry, I kind of got side tracked on that.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Will this new methodology of requiring two individuals in the cockpit, will that necessarily prevent a cockpit, a pilot who turns bad?</p><p>SOUCIE: It certainly will because since that's been implemented and the airlines that it has been implemented in there has been no attempts, not even attempts at suicide or any kind of disruption in the cockpit since that rule.</p><p>SALTZ: I'm also going to add to that. It's very different to have people behind you that are anonymous in a plane that you're killing and somebody that you actually take on in a cockpit.</p><p>SOUCIE: So deterrent rather than prevention. This is not going to stop an attack that has already started. What it will do is prevent one from starting in the first place.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Can a pilot who is being treated for mental health issues maintain his or her career, or is this a professional death sentence?</p><p>SALTZ: Absolutely they can maintain their career. The issue is really the beginning of treatment. So, you want to stop them from being responsible for other people when they are in the depths of the illness. And when they are beginning medication which has some risk associated with it. We know that it may increase agitation or some suicide risk at the beginning of medication. That's why pilots aren't supposed to fly then.</p><p>But these are treatment - let's put it this way. If it is depression, it is a treatable illness and once it is treated somebody is like anybody else. One out of every 10 people get depression. Are we going to say that those people should never be responsible for anyone else? Then one out of 10 should never drive, one out of 10 should never - it doesn't make sense. The point is when depression is resolved you are back to functional.</p><p>SMERCONISH: One of the few cases I remember from law school that I can cite by name is the Terasoft case. You know of what I'm speaking.</p><p>SALTZ: Correct.</p><p>SMERCONISH: What is the duty on the part of a mental health practitioner dealing with someone like him, again we're presuming, but presuming that he is unfit, is there a duty to report him to the employer?</p><p>SALTZ: So, the duty to warn for a psychiatrist or a mental healthcare worker is basically if the patient has in any way let you know that they are a risk to themselves or other people. So had he said anything about you know, I have a plan or I want to do this or even I want to kill myself, that psychiatrist would have a duty to warn law enforcement or whoever is deemed at risk.</p><p>So, if he says something about taking down a plane, of course that would be the employer, or you know, whoever he mentioned. If he said I want to get my girlfriend. That he would - you would have a duty to warn the girlfriend. But this is a person who everybody is saying was very secretive. And psychiatrists aren't mind readers so if he mentioned nothing of any of this, then actually the psychiatrist has a duty to keep confidentiality.</p><p>I know people have said \"hey -\"</p><p>SMERCONISH: But did he go too far?</p><p>SALTZ: Do we go too far? So the question is this. This man probably would never have come into treatment at all if - that's the issue really, right? If you think you have no confidentiality, if you just come in and say \"I have depression, and now I'm going to report it to your employer,\" you're never going to come in the first place.</p><p>SMERCONISH: To a lay person it sounds frightening. I've seen the list of medications that according to the FAA standard that one can be on and still be working.</p><p>SALTZ: Yes.</p><p>SMERCONISH: You want to dissuade me from my discomfort?</p><p>SALTZ: Yes, I think - yes, I do. Because I think that you have to look at what are the specific side effects of those medications. So if we're talking about medical problems , I mean, if the only person who could fly is somebody who is on zero medications, has zero medical problems, then we're probably taking out any one who has experience, the very person that we want to be flying for us.</p><p>So I think that what people have to understand is psychiatric illnesses can impair you in a short-term but once treated, not in the long term. Psychotic disorder like schizophrenia that's a different story.</p><p>SMERCONISH: It troubles me though the idea that, again, let's make the presumption and let the audience know this is based on conjecture and reporting. It troubles me to think that mental health professional would have deemed him unfit, unfit for what, not to be a CNN host, they knew he was a pilot. Unfit to take command of 149 other lives?</p><p>SALTZ: We don't know. We don't know if that's true. We knew somebody wrote a note that said you may not work this day. Now, I don't know if that was permission not to work, if that was by that doctor -</p><p>SMERCONISH: The \"Times\" is reporting today that multiple physicians, two or more, that would suggest that he went for a second opinion.</p><p>SALTZ: But we don't know -</p><p>SOUCIE: Did they know that he was a pilot? Did they know that he was a pilot? That would be my question.</p><p>SMERCONISH: I'm assuming that they do. I mean.</p><p>SOUCIE: There is no way to know. Unless you are a medical examiner, designated by the FAA, the European Association, you wouldn't know. There is no - if he doesn't tell you \"I'm a pilot,\" how would you know?</p><p>SALTZ: I would say this. If it was a mental health professional who said you are too depressed to be flying in my opinion, then yes, I would say that would be a duty to warn.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Is this finally the instance that brings about real time transmission of cockpit data?</p><p>SOUCIE: I can hope so. But here is something really historical with this event. There's already been action taken, there has been safety measures taken, they - EASA (ph), not only the airlines have taken measures to say we do need two people in that cockpit now as a mitigation but the regulatory authority themselves, they totally skipped right over this part of figuring out what happened and then applying the regulation, which is incredibly time consuming, Flight 447 we're still waiting on things to respond to that accident.</p><p>But this is different. This is very different. I think there is a shift in the culture and I think partly it's because of all of the exposure that the airlines in this industry have gotten.</p><p>SMERCONISH: But the pilot union has stood in opposition to the idea of real time transmission of data. How in the face of this and all of the questions that remain can they uphold that position?</p><p>SOUCIE: What they are really against, and have been historically, which I think is not the case now, is that the transmission of real- time video data. Now the transmission of actual data, it happens all the time. Information from the aircraft. Now the audio and video is what they are objecting to.</p><p>SMERCONISH: If i work at a 7-11, there's video being recorded of what I do for a living.</p><p>SOUCIE: Surveillance from the time they drive to work.</p><p>SMERCONISH: As a lay person, can I make another suggestion. Shouldn't there be some means from the cabin of alerting forces on the ground that \"hey, there is something going on in the cockpit\"?</p><p>SOUCIE: There are in new aircrafts. There is a way to do that. It's not mandatory, it's not regulated but it's part of a maintenance thing. It sends information about maintenance. The seat back on Seat 5D doesn't work. They type it in. It goes straight to maintenance. By the time the aircraft lands the parts are there, they're ready to fix it. That's the kind of technology we're looking at now.</p><p>SALTZ: On the ground they could unlock the door I'm just saying, right. If they knew there was a problem going on and there was a way to unlock the door. Then something like this -</p><p>SOUCIE: Now we're talking about remote control. That's a big subject right now.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Final issue, a pilot who is a friend of mine. He's an aviation attorney at home in Philadelphia, he said to me, don't underestimate that bi-annual review which is a medical review of those who maintain their license to fly. He said that the interaction with the FAA airmen, there is a degree of mental health review that takes place in that process. Either of you want to respond?</p><p>SALTZ: Very, very small. I think insufficient. I think that in the biannual review, much more to be in place will be both a psychological and a mental review. I think.</p><p>SOUCIE: It's not a litmus test. You can't say \"hey, this guy is OK and this guy is not.\" So what happens is with the FAA we encourage them to say get a relationship with this person, try to get in their head. But it's not like psychological (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SALTZ: That's not a trained professional, right. There should be - there are rudimentary minimalistic reviews that any primary care physician can do that would at least be somewhat of a check list to flag.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Dare I say it seems to me that the system that we have generally works, in this case this guy, if in fact he was washed out of training for a time period, because of mental health issues he should have been gone. That's the answer.</p><p>SALTZ: If he was brought back he should have at least - there should be reviews like the six month reviews because we know someone who has had a history of depression can have it again.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Thank you, you got through three quarters of my list. The rest of the program I'm getting to everything else. So thank you very much.</p><p>We still have so much more to get to on this. Coming up, next, what if during those last few minutes passengers were able to reach out to loved ones with e-mails, texts, videos, there could be evidence out there. The plane may be completely destroyed but we'll find out if it's technically possible to retrieve those final moments.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Welcome back. Investigators are facing the daunting task of combing through the French mountainside for clues to exactly what may have led the co-pilot to deliberately crash the plane. A significant piece to this puzzle would be whether passengers on board left any kind of evidence that shows exactly what was going on as the plane went down.</p><p>Despite the fact that the airplane is completely destroyed, could investigators find any form of electronic data like e-mails, texts or cell phone video. Let's get a little bit more on this from CNN technology correspondent Samuel Burke.</p><p>I flew on an A-320 yesterday. I had wi-fi, I was sending e-mails, I could have watched a movie had I chosen to do so. Presumably, by now, we know if any one had been able to send, successfully send a text, an e-mail, a video of what was transpiring. That hasn't taken place. Does that mean all is lost?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely not. There is still a chance that there's some type of information, photos, videos on a cell phone that may be wasn't sent to somebody but could be backed up in the cloud.</p><p>Now I think it may sound ridiculous to some that people would have a phone out in this type of situation, but the truth is, Michael, this is exactly what people do nowadays. We have so many instances, just go on Youtube and type in air turbulence. And you'll see when people think the plane is about to crash this is exactly what they do.</p><p>This is a video you're seeing right here of a flight that was going from South Korea to Dallas. You hear people on there saying good-bye to their wives, to their children, praying. And this is literally people what they think could be the last moments of their life, this is what many - what the new generation does, it's in a cellphone.</p><p>SMERCONISH: In my understanding you to say you wouldn't necessarily have had to transmit it. So if I had my iPhone on that flight and if had taken video but I didn't even try to send it or I tried to send it but I didn't have service so I couldn't, it might never the less be in the cloud.</p><p>BURKE: Absolutely. For instance, I use Flicker and it automatically updates all of my photos and videos to the Flicker website and many people do the same thing with iCloud so that even if you didn't send it to your wife or to whomever, it's still backed up on a server.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Even without cell service?</p><p>BURKE: Well, here's the thing. Germanwings does not have wi-fi, unlike the flight you were on yesterday. We know Germanwings doesn't have wi-fi. But you have to remember they were getting closer and closer to the ground, so they may - there is a much greater likelihood at that point you're starting to get cell service, you're starting to get 3G, maybe even 4g.</p><p>So even without send the picture, your internet is picking up even though this is a very amount of time it only takes a few seconds for a photo to start syncing and going into the cloud.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, next question. Let's assume that that is the case which would be wonderful from an evidentiary standpoint. Who gets access?</p><p>BURKE: What's interesting here is you would assume the authorities would get access but the answer to that is no, the authorities wouldn't get access at least not immediately because things are so well encrypted now, many of these tech companies after the Snowden revelations have moved to encrypt things so tightly that not even the tech companies can get in if they want. The authorities might be able to go to the tech companies, say \"sorry, there is nothing we can do\" because they literally don't have the keys.</p><p>So what it would take is somebody going into their loved ones -</p><p>SMERCONISH: A family member.</p><p>BURKE: Exactly, going into their iCloud account, going into some other type of cloud service where it's backed up, finding the photos, videos, e-mails, whatever content might have been saved on the phone and syncs and then giving it to the authorities.</p><p>SMERCONISH: I'm not making light of this but I presume those family members would then be putting in the family pet names and all of the other usual suspects for what the passcodes, because you need the passcode. BURKE: Well, don't' forget many loved ones know the passwords of their wives, of their husbands but yes, you're absolutely right. A lot of times people - this is a situation not just people who died in a plane crash. The situation that a lot of family members find themselves in when a loved one died, they want access to their phone, to their gmail accounts, they go in and start guessing the password.</p><p>And the truth is many times loved ones know those hints, where did you grow up, what was your maiden name, that is something that a loved one knows and can try to get into the account that way.</p><p>SMERCONISH: A great point that you make. I assume that the law is still unresolved in this area. If you lose a loved one, their personal effects, their papers, their letters and so forth. They become - whomever is the beneficiary of the estate. Is the law yet settled in terms of social media. You lose a loved one and you have their phone, you have their computer, you have their laptop, can you necessarily get access?</p><p>BURKE: Technology has moved much faster than our legislation. So in many places this is a very gray area. Going into somebody's account, if you know their password, well you know their password but trying to essentially hack your way in, it is illegal in some places. But again, does anybody know that you're doing it? You could say you got the e-mails and they were delivered to you. It's a very gray zone and we're seeing technology companies now trying to put measures in place that so i can give you access to my account if I die.</p><p>It's kind of a digital will, if you will. And we're starting to see companies like Facebook, like Google put measures into place but it's moving very slowly.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Bottom line, Samuel, you presume that at this moment 149 grieving families are trying to get access to whatever the technology, the cyber evidence might be of their loved ones?</p><p>BURKE: Absolutely. If I were in the situation this horrible situation that many of these families find themselves in, I would absolutely be trying to get into the Flicker account, if I had the password and trying to see if there is evidence that I could provide to the authorities.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Excellent report. Thank you. Samuel Burke.</p><p>Coming up officials say that the captain of Germanwings flight 9525 tried for nearly 10 minutes to break into the cockpit. But was unsuccessful. Could post-9/11 security measures have played a role in the deadly crash.</p><p>Plus technology is already out there that would let authorities in a crisis take complete remote control of the plane from the ground. We'll tell you more about that.</p><p>[18:31:46] MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST: Welcome back. The terror attacks on 9/11 sparked increase security measures on airplanes to keep the bad guys out of the cockpit. And ironically, those same protections made it possible for the co-pilot of the Germanwings flight to go on a deadly path of destruction. The co- pilot deliberately carried out the disaster after locking the steel reinforced door to the cockpit.</p><p>Joining me now is CNN national security analyst, Juliette Kayyem. She's also a former secretary for homeland security.</p><p>Juliette, can we blame this on bin Laden?</p><p>JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Oh, well, that's probably sort of too easy. Let's say it is clear that cockpit -- changes to the cockpit door that were made after 9/11 which were absolutely necessary and I have to say absolutely successful if you're looking at the threat of passengers coming into the cockpit, that that actually had this just tragic irony of the kind of disasters that we saw this week.</p><p>So, like everything else, times change, risks change, and so security has to adapt to not -- you know, a threat, which is rare. but nonetheless, we've seen which is a pilot or co-pilot bringing an airplane down.</p><p>SMERCONISH: So, the FAA, of course, has a two-person rule in the cockpit. We learned that. And now, other airlines, including Germanwings, are falling in line in that standard.</p><p>Given your expertise in a national security area, are you confident that that's sufficient to ward off this type of a threat going forward? Meaning from a pilot.</p><p>KAYYEM: Well, look, no security measure is perfect. And so, the way we think about it now in terms of -- especially in terms of systems like a global transportation system is that you have layered defenses. So, you look at the pilot, the passengers, the luggage, what's going on at the airport, and you put in so many different kinds of security defenses so that it makes anything that any one wants to do a little bit harder.</p><p>Nothing is going to be perfect. Our global transportation system is only as strong as its weakest link. So, even if Lufthansa puts the two-pilot rule in, look, you need universal rules.</p><p>But -- so that's a way to think about security. It's not like we're going to do this and it's going to fix everything and there will never be a risk again. It's just you want to put enough things in that make -- that minimize the risk for passengers or whoever else. So, that's why I'm for -- you know, videos in the cockpit. It doesn't make sense from a security perspective, it may not stop a pilot from doing something, but it will certainly help investigators and certainly the family members after the fact.</p><p>SMERCONISH: How worried are you that the Islamic State, al Qaeda, ISIL, ISIS, radical Islam, whatever word choice you think appropriate, are paying close attention and adding now to their playbook?</p><p>KAYYEM: So, they -- they are not idiots in the sense that they are looking at the news, they see all sorts of vulnerabilities in our airport system and everywhere else in terms of soft targets. I tend to take the emotionality out of these things. So, you know, the politics, the psychology, the ideology matter less to me than can we put in systems that will protect us from either the sort of random co- pilot who may have psychological problems, to an international terrorist organization that wants to bring down a plane.</p><p>[18:35:04] For security purposes, the intent matters less than can you put a system in place that makes it harder for anyone, regardless of ideology of harming a large number of people.</p><p>SMERCONISH: I worry that sometimes we overreact and have in a number of instances post-September 11. It seems -- given what we know, there's still a lot of unanswered questions. But it seems to me there was a system in place here, and it's not door that represented the failure. Presumably, the failure was on the part of the Lufthansa subsidiary that had a guy working for them that there were plenty of red flags that showed up in the course of his training, and still, with 600 hours under his belt, and a mental health issue, he was permitted to fly.</p><p>KAYYEM: Right. I think that's absolutely right. Instead of looking only at the cockpit door issue which I do think is an important thing to assess, it's 15 -- almost 15 years after September 11, security should is not remain the same. We have to be mobile and fluid in how we think about security.</p><p>Obviously, there's an issue regarding the psychology of pilots. Look, the military has dealt with this issue, large institutions always have to deal with this issue and get better at it. So, we don't want to look one way and say, oh, we solved it. There's obviously a number of reasons for why this happened, and why we didn't have defenses in place to avert it from happening. And we have to learn from both of them.</p><p>So, we don't want to just go in with blinders about, oh, it's the cockpit door. There's a variety of factors, some of them we may never know. But some of them that could help avoid the next incident. And that's just the way we have to look at it. It's no consolation to the family members, but if we can learn how to do this better to avoid or at least minimize the likelihood that this happens again --</p><p>SMERCONISH: Absolutely.</p><p>KAYYEM: -- then we learned from this tragedy.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Juliette Kayyem, thank you.</p><p>KAYYEM: Thank you.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Coming up, much more of our continuing coverage of the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525. What's next for the grieving families of the passengers on that doomed jet? An attorney who represented families from another high profile plane crash joins me to weigh in.</p><p>[18:41:04] SMERCONISH: Welcome back.</p><p>While the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 is highly uncommon, it's not unheard of. Tragedies like this have occurred in the past and in some cases, air crash investigators found that the pilots expressed their intentions beforehand. That takes me to my next question. Would the legal liability of Germanwings be capped if the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane?</p><p>Joining me now to discuss is Mitch Baumeister. He's an aviation attorney who represented several victim families after the crash of Egypt Air Flight 990.</p><p>Mitch, that flight, Egypt Air 990, would seem analogous to what we're dealing with here. Remind us of what the facts were.</p><p>MITCH BAUMEISTER, AVIATION ATTORNEY, BAUMEISTER AND SAMUELS: Well, in Egypt Air 990, Michael, we had a relief co-pilot, individual who was not going to be promoted to captain, there were a bunch of personal issues surrounding his conduct in the United States and in Egypt, and he took off, was a flight from L.A., remained overnight at JFK, then at JFK to Egypt flight.</p><p>When they took off around Nantucket, he as a relief pilot went in and took the controls, the captain left the flight cockpit, left, he then took control of the plane, said, I put my hands in -- I put myself in God's hands, whatever will happen will happen, and he lit early drove the plane into the ocean. The captain returned and got in the cockpit, and actually said to this relief pilot, pull with me, do something, shut the power. Help me.</p><p>He continued to push the plane into the ocean, chanting in Arabic that \"I'm in God's hands, God will take care of me\", and essentially committed his own suicide as the NTSB said, the cause of the crash was due to his direct pilot inputs, as a result of that, he committed mass murder as well as his own suicide. And --</p><p>SMERCONISH: I remember that -- I remember that the NTSB came to that conclusion. Is my memory accurate in that Egypt Air through the end refused to admit that that's what the cause was?</p><p>BAUMEISTER: Absolutely. And, you know, having done this for 40 years and involved in every major crash, whenever we have foreign carriers and foreign governments, many of the governments own the airlines, we run into resistance for the professionalism of the NTSB. And they never wanted to acknowledge that their pilot had done this, they wanted to blame it on some kind of mechanical error.</p><p>So, you are 100 percent right, Michael. Your memory is spot on. And that's what happened. Now, in 40 years, I want you to understand, and having been involved in the Lockerbie disaster and representing the fellow -- the people, Todd Beamer and Jeremy Glick in United 93 during 9/11, this is such a rare occurrence. And as a pilot over 40 years, this is such a rare occurrence, this is really the only time I have ever seen Egypt Air 990, although recently they reported it may have happened in Mozambique, and, of course, now, if the facts as stated are proven it will have happened here, sadly and tragically, in Germanwings.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Will there be a cap on damages?</p><p>BAUMEISTER: There will not, Michael. And that's the second most important point. That's really one of the main reasons I'm here today.</p><p>I want people to understand -- there's a lot of misinformation out there and I'm glad you asked me to come on. Unlike a domestic crash, namely a flight wholly within the United States or domestic country, this tragedy is governed by the Montreal Convention. And in the Montreal Convention, regardless of the pilot's actions, even -- as a former prosecutor who tried murder cases, even though this is a deliberate act, descending from altitude flying it into the mountain, this will not -- not only not cap the damages, which are unlimited to the extent they are provable, it will hold the airline responsible under Article 21 of the Montreal Convention.</p><p>[09:45:00] And just quickly, Article 21 says the carrier will pay above approximately 150,000 automatic damages paid to the families. The carrier will be responsible for full unlimited damages above that $150,000, unless it can prove that the crash was not due to the wrongful act of its agent in the course and scope of his or her employment and we know that's, in fact, what happened here. Or, such crash was caused solely by the act of a third party.</p><p>For example, flying over the ocean, and some foreign ship shot them down. Neither one of these facts obtained there will be litigation under the Montreal Convention, and there will be no cap or limit on the damages.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Mitch Baumeister, thank you so much.</p><p>BAUMEISTER: OK, Michael, thank you.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Coming up, we'll head out live to Germany with the very latest on the crash investigation.</p><p>Plus, ground personnel flying a jetliner by remote control. It's almost a reality. But is it a good idea?</p><p>[18:50:20] SMERCONISH: Welcome back.</p><p>Rescue crews are battling treacherous conditions to find bodies and that one missing black box. Debris from Flight 9525 scattered across rugged remote terrain in the French Alps. Let's get right to CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, who's live in Dusseldorf with the very latest.</p><p>Fred, it seems to me investigators would most want to speak to a former girlfriend to find out his mental state.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, probably her and I'm guessing that his family as well. However, the \"Bild\" newspaper, which is the biggest tabloid in Germany, has managed to speak to one of the ex-girlfriends, and she said that Andreas Lubitz was a man who needed a lot of attention, a man who can be sensitive, very flattering at times as well, but also someone who apparently had a dark side to him.</p><p>Also, she said he became erratic at times, that he became very angry, especially when he was talking about his employer. He felt that Germanwings wasn't treating him well.</p><p>This is according to the \"Bild\" newspaper. So, we're only getting this from a third source, but it certainly is, of course, a major point to these investigators, to speak to anyone who had direct contact with Andreas Lubitz, especially, of course, someone like a girlfriend, someone like his parents, someone like his brother who he was living with as well, Michael.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Do we know anything about the investigation relative to medications that he was on at the time of the crash or medications that he had stopped taking just before the crash?</p><p>PLEITGEN: Very little about medications. It's -- all that we have is from the prosecutor's office, and they're saying that he was being treated for some sort of illness, and that he had been treated for it for a very long time and he was seeing a doctor. And also, of course, he had those sick notes that he tore up. It's unclear what medications he might have been on, but it's something investigators will be looking at as well.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Frederik Pleitgen, thank you very much for your report.</p><p>Coming up, the possibility of pilotless aircraft is already being explored. We'll look at a new technology that could save a plane from being hijacked.</p><p>[18:56:47] SMERCONISH: Welcome back.</p><p>The crash of the Germanwings flight has reignited the debate about aircraft control. There's already a technology that's been developed that would let authorities on the ground intervene if there's a crisis in the air. Boeing has a patent, and Google has already conducted a test flight.</p><p>So, why isn't it being used?</p><p>CNN's Tom Foreman has the answer. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Michael. Boeing has a patent. Google has had a test flight of one of these planes. Big tech names all over the world are looking at this idea of airplanes that can be flown remotely from the ground in the belief that this might make them impervious from terrorist attacks, from criminal acts, and from any other sort of assault.</p><p>(voice-over): Watch closely. This plane over England has a crew at the controls, passengers in the back, but something extraordinary is about to happen. A pilot on the ground is taking over.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready to take control.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Proceed.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have control.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're on control.</p><p>FOREMAN: This is the $94 million ASTRAEA project by the British Aerospace Company, BAE, one of several efforts around the world to develop planes that can be flown remotely.</p><p>DUNCAN CASEY, TEST ENGINEER, BAE SYSTEMS: What you can hear at the moment is the discussion with air traffic that's exactly the same as the pilots would be having if they were in charge of the steering of the aircraft.</p><p>FOREMAN: Military success with drones has driven much of the interest and some efforts are focused on airplanes in hazard conditions, such as hurricane research and fighting wildfires. Analysts say pilotless planes could be a $400 billion a year global business.</p><p>So, why not passenger flights? First, the airline industry has remarkable safety record despite high profile disasters. Many believe on board pilots remain the most reliable way to handle problems and retrofitting planes would cost billions of dollars. And second, passengers may not be ready.</p><p>Robert Goyer is with \"Flying\" magazine.</p><p>ROBERT GOYER, FLYING MAGAZINE: I start by asking myself that question. How would I feel getting into an airplane that didn't have pilots up front? And I wouldn't do it.</p><p>FOREMAN (on camera): There are a lot of unanswered questions still. For example, what happens if one of the planes gets free of electronic tether, what if terrorists take over a ground control station and in that fashion start controlling the plane. One possible answer would be to add more than one station at a time so that any plane must be controlled from multiple points.</p><p>But even then, what if somebody hacks into the data stream and they take over the plane that way. All of these questions are going to have to be answered, because even though our planes are becoming more and more automated, and some take off and land pretty much on their own, this idea of controlling one from the ground has to be worked out in much more detail before it becomes a reality -- Michael.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SMERCONISH: Thank you, Tom. I'm reminded of the fact that elevators used to have operators as well.</p><p>Thank you so much for joining me.

A significant piece to this puzzle would be whether passengers on board left any kind of evidence that shows exactly what was going on as the plane went down. The terror attacks on 9/11 sparked increase security measures on airplanes to keep the bad guys out of the cockpit, and ironically, those same protections made it possible for the co-pilot of the Germanwings flight to go on a deadly path of destruction. Rescue crews are battling treacherous conditions to find bodies and that one missing black box, as debris from Flight 9525 scattered across rugged remote terrain in the French Alps.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST: I'm Michael Smerconish. Welcome to the program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By now you have heard all about the tragedy of Germanwings flight 9525, I've been watching the coverage on CNN closely all week. And I have some particular questions that haven't been answered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So today I've invited several experts to get those answers that I think we're all looking for, among the things that I want to know, was this crime premeditated? In other words how could Andreas Lubitz have known that the captain would have to go and use the bathroom giving him time to change the flight course. Did he make his terrible decision in the spur of a moment?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Another question, even though this airplane was in the words of investigators shredded like confetti is there a way to retrieve the texts, the e-mails, the videos that passengers likely took and wrote in those last terrible minutes?</p><p>Here's one more. What's the duty of a mental health professional to report on a troubled pilot? Our experts are here to break it down but first, to the very latest of what's happening right now on the ground. CNN's Frederick Pleitgen is in Germany with more.</p><p>Fred, I know that the \"Bild\" newspaper has spoken to a former girlfriend. What is she saying?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, she's saying that she was together with Andreas Lubitz for about five months last year. She said or she described him as a very sensitive man, someone who need a lot of care, a lot of attention, someone who could also be quite flattering. She was an airline stewardess herself on Germanwings as well but she also said that he was someone who had a very dark side. Someone who at night would wake up because he was having bad dreams, someone who would go into rages when they had fights who apparently locked himself in the bathroom once for an extended period of time.</p><p>She says ultimately the reason why they split up was because she was starting to become afraid of him and she also said that it was clear to her that he had some sort of psychological problems but it was certainly something that she said that he was trying to hide because, of course, he'd always had this big dream of being a pilot and he didn't want it destroyed by the fact that he had these health issues. Michael.</p><p>SMERCONISH: A gliding acquaintance says that Lubitz was familiar with the area around the crash site. What are you hearing about that?</p><p>PLEITGEN: It's interesting because he was part of an aeronautics and hand gliding club in his town of Montabaur. Strangely enough that giding club apparently quite frequently went to excursions down to southern France, to the foothills of the Alps. So apparently Lubitz was also very familiar with the terrain there. This acquaintance of his says that the aeroclub was there about 10 times and he does recall at least one time that Lubitz himself was there as well.</p><p>There is another media report out there saying that Lubitz was obsessed by the Alps that he loved the mountains there, and so certainly he would have known the terrain where he crashed and also the acquaintance also said that he was very familiar actually with the crash site itself, with that area around there. He says he's flown over that many, many times.</p><p>SMERCONISH: And Frederik, finally, today's \"New York Times\" says that those physician notes that were found in his apartment were from different doctors, suggesting perhaps that he went for a second opinion as to his fitness, his relative fitness. Do you know anything about that?</p><p>PLEITGEN: Well, yes, \"The New York Times\" is saying that he went and tried to get a second opinion. We reached out to the University Medical Center in Dusseldorf which is a town that he lived in. They confirmed to us that he was there for diagnostics twice this year. It wasn't for depression, they didn't say however, whether it might have been for some other mental problem. Certainly, the doctors notes that were found inside his apartment, there seemed to be several of them and of course the state prosecutor of Dusseldorf said that they had been destroyed obviously in attempt to try to hide from his employer that he had some sort of illness, that he was dealing with, by the way, for an extended period of time, the medical records show.</p><p>But again, we're still trying to find out what exactly he was suffering from. There are many media outlets that are reporting that it was some sort of depression-related thing. But what exactly it was, we don't know just yet.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Frederik Pleitgen, thank you very much.</p><p>Let's dive right into all of this now. Joining me is psychiatrist Dr. Gail Saltz and CNN safety analyst and former FAA safety inspector David Soucie. I'd like to try and cover a lot of ground with my many, many questions.</p><p>David, I'll begin with you. Is this the way you would do it? Is this the way that a pilot seeking to crash an airplane would go about it, by manually switching the auto pilot from 33,000 feet to 96 feet, isn't there a faster way?</p><p>DAVID SOUCIE, CNN SAFETY ANALYST: Historically there has been and there has been done this way with Egypt Air and Silk Air, it's violent movement. This is different. But it is also a different aircraft. Because this aircraft is designed to protect itself from that kind of thing. So to put it forward, it wouldn't let you do that. It wouldn't let you just go into an uncontrolled descent. So it's a little bit -</p><p>SMERCONISH: This was probably sick to even ask but probably the most expeditious way then for him to go about.</p><p>SOUCIE: I suppose that's correct. Yes.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Doctor, why doesn't a guy like this kill himself outside that aircraft instead of killing 149 innocents with him?</p><p>GAIL SALTZ, PSYCHIATRIST AND PSYCHOANALYST: The question was what was his motivation? So most suicides, in fact, the vast majority of killing yourself if you are depressed and that's your intent. Only 2.5 percent are really killing somebody else and usually it's killing one other person, a person that you're angry at.</p><p>So this is vanishingly rare. And this is a mass murder which makes you think about things like sociopathy, rage, desire for infamy. Those things would be motivators.</p><p>SMERCONISH: I've heard many draw conclusions about his breathing, how he was able to maintain some rate of normal breathing for that final nine minutes. It strikes me as a lay person that you're only able to evaluate the breathing in the context of other factors that we now know, like changing the flight altitude. The breathing alone, I mean, he could have had a heart attack and maintained breathing.</p><p>SALTZ: You can. You can lose consciousness and maintain breathing. So it must have been a combination of those two things that made them think that he was awake the whole time.</p><p>SMERCONISH: David, let's talk about the toggling of that lock switch. If the co-pilot toggled the door control to lock and thereby disabled emergency access for five minutes, is there anything that the pilot, who is trapped in the cabin, could do to gain access?</p><p>SOUCIE: Nothing at all. Nothing at all.</p><p>SMERCONISH: As long as he keeps his finger on the button in a lock position.</p><p>SOUCIE: Well and past five minutes as well he could just continue to hold it down.</p><p>SMERCONISH: OK. Because there are reports that after five minutes there is a burst of 30 seconds of opportunity that would allow the pilot to come back in.</p><p>SOUCIE: Well, after the - only after the five minutes can you enter the code which then triggers the 30 seconds period to notify the captain, if the captain does not respond by opening the door or locking the door, the door actually opens for five seconds by itself. SMERCONISH: Doctor, he would have had to maintain an amazing level of constitution to hear the pilot outside banging on the door, trying to break down the door, and then in the end, people screaming for as long as nine minutes, maintain that breathing, and continue to do that which he was doing.</p><p>SALTZ: I think there are two possibilities that that suggest. One is that you know, this was premeditated, this is a person who's thought a lot about this and does not have the empathy to be concerned about that. In other words, we're talking about sociopathy, someone who would plan that. This is what they wanted so it's not going to upset them.</p><p>The other possibility is that, you know, they have suffered so much themselves that the relative suffering of others is not that disturbing to them.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Somehow he was able to put on blinders -</p><p>SALTZ: Right.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Meaning for hearing purposes. And block it all out.</p><p>SALTZ: Well, it doesn't mean it was blocked out. It may mean that it fit with whatever - this is completely conjecture you have to realize. We don't know what was in his mind. But you know, when people internally suffer terrible depression, or psychosis, I mean it is utter torment. And that kind of torment might really surpass the idea that other people would be screaming or frightened.</p><p>SMERCONISH: David, the FAA two person in the cockpit rule was designed to address incapacitation on the part of a pilot. Is it appropriate in a circumstance like this, will it thwart a pilot himself who has turned bad?</p><p>SOUCIE: Actually, we should clarify a little bit why that rule is in place. The only reason that rule is in place originally is the fact that there was - there were no cameras to identify someone trying to get in. So they had to have a second person there because just looking through a peep hole to identify who that person is. So that was the original.</p><p>But the second part of your question, I'm sorry, I kind of got side tracked on that.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Will this new methodology of requiring two individuals in the cockpit, will that necessarily prevent a cockpit, a pilot who turns bad?</p><p>SOUCIE: It certainly will because since that's been implemented and the airlines that it has been implemented in there has been no attempts, not even attempts at suicide or any kind of disruption in the cockpit since that rule.</p><p>SALTZ: I'm also going to add to that. It's very different to have people behind you that are anonymous in a plane that you're killing and somebody that you actually take on in a cockpit.</p><p>SOUCIE: So deterrent rather than prevention. This is not going to stop an attack that has already started. What it will do is prevent one from starting in the first place.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Can a pilot who is being treated for mental health issues maintain his or her career, or is this a professional death sentence?</p><p>SALTZ: Absolutely they can maintain their career. The issue is really the beginning of treatment. So, you want to stop them from being responsible for other people when they are in the depths of the illness. And when they are beginning medication which has some risk associated with it. We know that it may increase agitation or some suicide risk at the beginning of medication. That's why pilots aren't supposed to fly then.</p><p>But these are treatment - let's put it this way. If it is depression, it is a treatable illness and once it is treated somebody is like anybody else. One out of every 10 people get depression. Are we going to say that those people should never be responsible for anyone else? Then one out of 10 should never drive, one out of 10 should never - it doesn't make sense. The point is when depression is resolved you are back to functional.</p><p>SMERCONISH: One of the few cases I remember from law school that I can cite by name is the Terasoft case. You know of what I'm speaking.</p><p>SALTZ: Correct.</p><p>SMERCONISH: What is the duty on the part of a mental health practitioner dealing with someone like him, again we're presuming, but presuming that he is unfit, is there a duty to report him to the employer?</p><p>SALTZ: So, the duty to warn for a psychiatrist or a mental healthcare worker is basically if the patient has in any way let you know that they are a risk to themselves or other people. So had he said anything about you know, I have a plan or I want to do this or even I want to kill myself, that psychiatrist would have a duty to warn law enforcement or whoever is deemed at risk.</p><p>So, if he says something about taking down a plane, of course that would be the employer, or you know, whoever he mentioned. If he said I want to get my girlfriend. That he would - you would have a duty to warn the girlfriend. But this is a person who everybody is saying was very secretive. And psychiatrists aren't mind readers so if he mentioned nothing of any of this, then actually the psychiatrist has a duty to keep confidentiality.</p><p>I know people have said \"hey -\"</p><p>SMERCONISH: But did he go too far?</p><p>SALTZ: Do we go too far? So the question is this. This man probably would never have come into treatment at all if - that's the issue really, right? If you think you have no confidentiality, if you just come in and say \"I have depression, and now I'm going to report it to your employer,\" you're never going to come in the first place.</p><p>SMERCONISH: To a lay person it sounds frightening. I've seen the list of medications that according to the FAA standard that one can be on and still be working.</p><p>SALTZ: Yes.</p><p>SMERCONISH: You want to dissuade me from my discomfort?</p><p>SALTZ: Yes, I think - yes, I do. Because I think that you have to look at what are the specific side effects of those medications. So if we're talking about medical problems , I mean, if the only person who could fly is somebody who is on zero medications, has zero medical problems, then we're probably taking out any one who has experience, the very person that we want to be flying for us.</p><p>So I think that what people have to understand is psychiatric illnesses can impair you in a short-term but once treated, not in the long term. Psychotic disorder like schizophrenia that's a different story.</p><p>SMERCONISH: It troubles me though the idea that, again, let's make the presumption and let the audience know this is based on conjecture and reporting. It troubles me to think that mental health professional would have deemed him unfit, unfit for what, not to be a CNN host, they knew he was a pilot. Unfit to take command of 149 other lives?</p><p>SALTZ: We don't know. We don't know if that's true. We knew somebody wrote a note that said you may not work this day. Now, I don't know if that was permission not to work, if that was by that doctor -</p><p>SMERCONISH: The \"Times\" is reporting today that multiple physicians, two or more, that would suggest that he went for a second opinion.</p><p>SALTZ: But we don't know -</p><p>SOUCIE: Did they know that he was a pilot? Did they know that he was a pilot? That would be my question.</p><p>SMERCONISH: I'm assuming that they do. I mean.</p><p>SOUCIE: There is no way to know. Unless you are a medical examiner, designated by the FAA, the European Association, you wouldn't know. There is no - if he doesn't tell you \"I'm a pilot,\" how would you know?</p><p>SALTZ: I would say this. If it was a mental health professional who said you are too depressed to be flying in my opinion, then yes, I would say that would be a duty to warn.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Is this finally the instance that brings about real time transmission of cockpit data?</p><p>SOUCIE: I can hope so. But here is something really historical with this event. There's already been action taken, there has been safety measures taken, they - EASA (ph), not only the airlines have taken measures to say we do need two people in that cockpit now as a mitigation but the regulatory authority themselves, they totally skipped right over this part of figuring out what happened and then applying the regulation, which is incredibly time consuming, Flight 447 we're still waiting on things to respond to that accident.</p><p>But this is different. This is very different. I think there is a shift in the culture and I think partly it's because of all of the exposure that the airlines in this industry have gotten.</p><p>SMERCONISH: But the pilot union has stood in opposition to the idea of real time transmission of data. How in the face of this and all of the questions that remain can they uphold that position?</p><p>SOUCIE: What they are really against, and have been historically, which I think is not the case now, is that the transmission of real- time video data. Now the transmission of actual data, it happens all the time. Information from the aircraft. Now the audio and video is what they are objecting to.</p><p>SMERCONISH: If i work at a 7-11, there's video being recorded of what I do for a living.</p><p>SOUCIE: Surveillance from the time they drive to work.</p><p>SMERCONISH: As a lay person, can I make another suggestion. Shouldn't there be some means from the cabin of alerting forces on the ground that \"hey, there is something going on in the cockpit\"?</p><p>SOUCIE: There are in new aircrafts. There is a way to do that. It's not mandatory, it's not regulated but it's part of a maintenance thing. It sends information about maintenance. The seat back on Seat 5D doesn't work. They type it in. It goes straight to maintenance. By the time the aircraft lands the parts are there, they're ready to fix it. That's the kind of technology we're looking at now.</p><p>SALTZ: On the ground they could unlock the door I'm just saying, right. If they knew there was a problem going on and there was a way to unlock the door. Then something like this -</p><p>SOUCIE: Now we're talking about remote control. That's a big subject right now.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Final issue, a pilot who is a friend of mine. He's an aviation attorney at home in Philadelphia, he said to me, don't underestimate that bi-annual review which is a medical review of those who maintain their license to fly. He said that the interaction with the FAA airmen, there is a degree of mental health review that takes place in that process. Either of you want to respond?</p><p>SALTZ: Very, very small. I think insufficient. I think that in the biannual review, much more to be in place will be both a psychological and a mental review. I think.</p><p>SOUCIE: It's not a litmus test. You can't say \"hey, this guy is OK and this guy is not.\" So what happens is with the FAA we encourage them to say get a relationship with this person, try to get in their head. But it's not like psychological (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SALTZ: That's not a trained professional, right. There should be - there are rudimentary minimalistic reviews that any primary care physician can do that would at least be somewhat of a check list to flag.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Dare I say it seems to me that the system that we have generally works, in this case this guy, if in fact he was washed out of training for a time period, because of mental health issues he should have been gone. That's the answer.</p><p>SALTZ: If he was brought back he should have at least - there should be reviews like the six month reviews because we know someone who has had a history of depression can have it again.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Thank you, you got through three quarters of my list. The rest of the program I'm getting to everything else. So thank you very much.</p><p>We still have so much more to get to on this. Coming up, next, what if during those last few minutes passengers were able to reach out to loved ones with e-mails, texts, videos, there could be evidence out there. The plane may be completely destroyed but we'll find out if it's technically possible to retrieve those final moments.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Welcome back. Investigators are facing the daunting task of combing through the French mountainside for clues to exactly what may have led the co-pilot to deliberately crash the plane. A significant piece to this puzzle would be whether passengers on board left any kind of evidence that shows exactly what was going on as the plane went down.</p><p>Despite the fact that the airplane is completely destroyed, could investigators find any form of electronic data like e-mails, texts or cell phone video. Let's get a little bit more on this from CNN technology correspondent Samuel Burke.</p><p>I flew on an A-320 yesterday. I had wi-fi, I was sending e-mails, I could have watched a movie had I chosen to do so. Presumably, by now, we know if any one had been able to send, successfully send a text, an e-mail, a video of what was transpiring. That hasn't taken place. Does that mean all is lost?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely not. There is still a chance that there's some type of information, photos, videos on a cell phone that may be wasn't sent to somebody but could be backed up in the cloud.</p><p>Now I think it may sound ridiculous to some that people would have a phone out in this type of situation, but the truth is, Michael, this is exactly what people do nowadays. We have so many instances, just go on Youtube and type in air turbulence. And you'll see when people think the plane is about to crash this is exactly what they do.</p><p>This is a video you're seeing right here of a flight that was going from South Korea to Dallas. You hear people on there saying good-bye to their wives, to their children, praying. And this is literally people what they think could be the last moments of their life, this is what many - what the new generation does, it's in a cellphone.</p><p>SMERCONISH: In my understanding you to say you wouldn't necessarily have had to transmit it. So if I had my iPhone on that flight and if had taken video but I didn't even try to send it or I tried to send it but I didn't have service so I couldn't, it might never the less be in the cloud.</p><p>BURKE: Absolutely. For instance, I use Flicker and it automatically updates all of my photos and videos to the Flicker website and many people do the same thing with iCloud so that even if you didn't send it to your wife or to whomever, it's still backed up on a server.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Even without cell service?</p><p>BURKE: Well, here's the thing. Germanwings does not have wi-fi, unlike the flight you were on yesterday. We know Germanwings doesn't have wi-fi. But you have to remember they were getting closer and closer to the ground, so they may - there is a much greater likelihood at that point you're starting to get cell service, you're starting to get 3G, maybe even 4g.</p><p>So even without send the picture, your internet is picking up even though this is a very amount of time it only takes a few seconds for a photo to start syncing and going into the cloud.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, next question. Let's assume that that is the case which would be wonderful from an evidentiary standpoint. Who gets access?</p><p>BURKE: What's interesting here is you would assume the authorities would get access but the answer to that is no, the authorities wouldn't get access at least not immediately because things are so well encrypted now, many of these tech companies after the Snowden revelations have moved to encrypt things so tightly that not even the tech companies can get in if they want. The authorities might be able to go to the tech companies, say \"sorry, there is nothing we can do\" because they literally don't have the keys.</p><p>So what it would take is somebody going into their loved ones -</p><p>SMERCONISH: A family member.</p><p>BURKE: Exactly, going into their iCloud account, going into some other type of cloud service where it's backed up, finding the photos, videos, e-mails, whatever content might have been saved on the phone and syncs and then giving it to the authorities.</p><p>SMERCONISH: I'm not making light of this but I presume those family members would then be putting in the family pet names and all of the other usual suspects for what the passcodes, because you need the passcode. BURKE: Well, don't' forget many loved ones know the passwords of their wives, of their husbands but yes, you're absolutely right. A lot of times people - this is a situation not just people who died in a plane crash. The situation that a lot of family members find themselves in when a loved one died, they want access to their phone, to their gmail accounts, they go in and start guessing the password.</p><p>And the truth is many times loved ones know those hints, where did you grow up, what was your maiden name, that is something that a loved one knows and can try to get into the account that way.</p><p>SMERCONISH: A great point that you make. I assume that the law is still unresolved in this area. If you lose a loved one, their personal effects, their papers, their letters and so forth. They become - whomever is the beneficiary of the estate. Is the law yet settled in terms of social media. You lose a loved one and you have their phone, you have their computer, you have their laptop, can you necessarily get access?</p><p>BURKE: Technology has moved much faster than our legislation. So in many places this is a very gray area. Going into somebody's account, if you know their password, well you know their password but trying to essentially hack your way in, it is illegal in some places. But again, does anybody know that you're doing it? You could say you got the e-mails and they were delivered to you. It's a very gray zone and we're seeing technology companies now trying to put measures in place that so i can give you access to my account if I die.</p><p>It's kind of a digital will, if you will. And we're starting to see companies like Facebook, like Google put measures into place but it's moving very slowly.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Bottom line, Samuel, you presume that at this moment 149 grieving families are trying to get access to whatever the technology, the cyber evidence might be of their loved ones?</p><p>BURKE: Absolutely. If I were in the situation this horrible situation that many of these families find themselves in, I would absolutely be trying to get into the Flicker account, if I had the password and trying to see if there is evidence that I could provide to the authorities.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Excellent report. Thank you. Samuel Burke.</p><p>Coming up officials say that the captain of Germanwings flight 9525 tried for nearly 10 minutes to break into the cockpit. But was unsuccessful. Could post-9/11 security measures have played a role in the deadly crash.</p><p>Plus technology is already out there that would let authorities in a crisis take complete remote control of the plane from the ground. We'll tell you more about that.</p><p>[09:31:46] MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST: Welcome back. The terror attacks on 9/11 sparked increase security measures on airplanes to keep the bad guys out of the cockpit. And ironically, those same protections made it possible for the co-pilot of the Germanwings flight to go on a deadly path of destruction. The co- pilot deliberately carried out the disaster after locking the steel reinforced door to the cockpit.</p><p>Joining me now is CNN national security analyst, Juliette Kayyem. She's also a former secretary for homeland security.</p><p>Juliette, can we blame this on bin Laden?</p><p>JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Oh, well, that's probably sort of too easy. Let's say it is clear that cockpit -- changes to the cockpit door that were made after 9/11 which were absolutely necessary and I have to say absolutely successful if you're looking at the threat of passengers coming into the cockpit, that that actually had this just tragic irony of the kind of disasters that we saw this week.</p><p>So, like everything else, times change, risks change, and so security has to adapt to not -- you know, a threat, which is rare. but nonetheless, we've seen which is a pilot or co-pilot bringing an airplane down.</p><p>SMERCONISH: So, the FAA, of course, has a two-person rule in the cockpit. We learned that. And now, other airlines, including Germanwings, are falling in line in that standard.</p><p>Given your expertise in a national security area, are you confident that that's sufficient to ward off this type of a threat going forward? Meaning from a pilot.</p><p>KAYYEM: Well, look, no security measure is perfect. And so, the way we think about it now in terms of -- especially in terms of systems like a global transportation system is that you have layered defenses. So, you look at the pilot, the passengers, the luggage, what's going on at the airport, and you put in so many different kinds of security defenses so that it makes anything that any one wants to do a little bit harder.</p><p>Nothing is going to be perfect. Our global transportation system is only as strong as its weakest link. So, even if Lufthansa puts the two-pilot rule in, look, you need universal rules.</p><p>But -- so that's a way to think about security. It's not like we're going to do this and it's going to fix everything and there will never be a risk again. It's just you want to put enough things in that make -- that minimize the risk for passengers or whoever else. So, that's why I'm for -- you know, videos in the cockpit. It doesn't make sense from a security perspective, it may not stop a pilot from doing something, but it will certainly help investigators and certainly the family members after the fact.</p><p>SMERCONISH: How worried are you that the Islamic State, al Qaeda, ISIL, ISIS, radical Islam, whatever word choice you think appropriate, are paying close attention and adding now to their playbook?</p><p>KAYYEM: So, they -- they are not idiots in the sense that they are looking at the news, they see all sorts of vulnerabilities in our airport system and everywhere else in terms of soft targets. I tend to take the emotionality out of these things. So, you know, the politics, the psychology, the ideology matter less to me than can we put in systems that will protect us from either the sort of random co- pilot who may have psychological problems, to an international terrorist organization that wants to bring down a plane.</p><p>[09:35:04] For security purposes, the intent matters less than can you put a system in place that makes it harder for anyone, regardless of ideology of harming a large number of people.</p><p>SMERCONISH: I worry that sometimes we overreact and have in a number of instances post-September 11. It seems -- given what we know, there's still a lot of unanswered questions. But it seems to me there was a system in place here, and it's not door that represented the failure. Presumably, the failure was on the part of the Lufthansa subsidiary that had a guy working for them that there were plenty of red flags that showed up in the course of his training, and still, with 600 hours under his belt, and a mental health issue, he was permitted to fly.</p><p>KAYYEM: Right. I think that's absolutely right. Instead of looking only at the cockpit door issue which I do think is an important thing to assess, it's 15 -- almost 15 years after September 11, security should is not remain the same. We have to be mobile and fluid in how we think about security.</p><p>Obviously, there's an issue regarding the psychology of pilots. Look, the military has dealt with this issue, large institutions always have to deal with this issue and get better at it. So, we don't want to look one way and say, oh, we solved it. There's obviously a number of reasons for why this happened, and why we didn't have defenses in place to avert it from happening. And we have to learn from both of them.</p><p>So, we don't want to just go in with blinders about, oh, it's the cockpit door. There's a variety of factors, some of them we may never know. But some of them that could help avoid the next incident. And that's just the way we have to look at it. It's no consolation to the family members, but if we can learn how to do this better to avoid or at least minimize the likelihood that this happens again --</p><p>SMERCONISH: Absolutely.</p><p>KAYYEM: -- then we learned from this tragedy.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Juliette Kayyem, thank you.</p><p>KAYYEM: Thank you.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Coming up, much more of our continuing coverage of the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525. What's next for the grieving families of the passengers on that doomed jet? An attorney who represented families from another high profile plane crash joins me to weigh in.</p><p>[09:41:04] SMERCONISH: Welcome back.</p><p>While the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 is highly uncommon, it's not unheard of. Tragedies like this have occurred in the past and in some cases, air crash investigators found that the pilots expressed their intentions beforehand. That takes me to my next question. Would the legal liability of Germanwings be capped if the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane?</p><p>Joining me now to discuss is Mitch Baumeister. He's an aviation attorney who represented several victim families after the crash of Egypt Air Flight 990.</p><p>Mitch, that flight, Egypt Air 990, would seem analogous to what we're dealing with here. Remind us of what the facts were.</p><p>MITCH BAUMEISTER, AVIATION ATTORNEY, BAUMEISTER AND SAMUELS: Well, in Egypt Air 990, Michael, we had a relief co-pilot, individual who was not going to be promoted to captain, there were a bunch of personal issues surrounding his conduct in the United States and in Egypt, and he took off, was a flight from L.A., remained overnight at JFK, then at JFK to Egypt flight.</p><p>When they took off around Nantucket, he as a relief pilot went in and took the controls, the captain left the flight cockpit, left, he then took control of the plane, said, I put my hands in -- I put myself in God's hands, whatever will happen will happen, and he lit early drove the plane into the ocean. The captain returned and got in the cockpit, and actually said to this relief pilot, pull with me, do something, shut the power. Help me.</p><p>He continued to push the plane into the ocean, chanting in Arabic that \"I'm in God's hands, God will take care of me\", and essentially committed his own suicide as the NTSB said, the cause of the crash was due to his direct pilot inputs, as a result of that, he committed mass murder as well as his own suicide. And --</p><p>SMERCONISH: I remember that -- I remember that the NTSB came to that conclusion. Is my memory accurate in that Egypt Air through the end refused to admit that that's what the cause was?</p><p>BAUMEISTER: Absolutely. And, you know, having done this for 40 years and involved in every major crash, whenever we have foreign carriers and foreign governments, many of the governments own the airlines, we run into resistance for the professionalism of the NTSB. And they never wanted to acknowledge that their pilot had done this, they wanted to blame it on some kind of mechanical error.</p><p>So, you are 100 percent right, Michael. Your memory is spot on. And that's what happened. Now, in 40 years, I want you to understand, and having been involved in the Lockerbie disaster and representing the fellow -- the people, Todd Beamer and Jeremy Glick in United 93 during 9/11, this is such a rare occurrence. And as a pilot over 40 years, this is such a rare occurrence, this is really the only time I have ever seen Egypt Air 990, although recently they reported it may have happened in Mozambique, and, of course, now, if the facts as stated are proven it will have happened here, sadly and tragically, in Germanwings.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Will there be a cap on damages?</p><p>BAUMEISTER: There will not, Michael. And that's the second most important point. That's really one of the main reasons I'm here today.</p><p>I want people to understand -- there's a lot of misinformation out there and I'm glad you asked me to come on. Unlike a domestic crash, namely a flight wholly within the United States or domestic country, this tragedy is governed by the Montreal Convention. And in the Montreal Convention, regardless of the pilot's actions, even -- as a former prosecutor who tried murder cases, even though this is a deliberate act, descending from altitude flying it into the mountain, this will not -- not only not cap the damages, which are unlimited to the extent they are provable, it will hold the airline responsible under Article 21 of the Montreal Convention.</p><p>[09:45:00] And just quickly, Article 21 says the carrier will pay above approximately 150,000 automatic damages paid to the families. The carrier will be responsible for full unlimited damages above that $150,000, unless it can prove that the crash was not due to the wrongful act of its agent in the course and scope of his or her employment and we know that's, in fact, what happened here. Or, such crash was caused solely by the act of a third party.</p><p>For example, flying over the ocean, and some foreign ship shot them down. Neither one of these facts obtained there will be litigation under the Montreal Convention, and there will be no cap or limit on the damages.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Mitch Baumeister, thank you so much.</p><p>BAUMEISTER: OK, Michael, thank you.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Coming up, we'll head out live to Germany with the very latest on the crash investigation.</p><p>Plus, ground personnel flying a jetliner by remote control. It's almost a reality. But is it a good idea?</p><p>[09:50:20] SMERCONISH: Welcome back.</p><p>Rescue crews are battling treacherous conditions to find bodies and that one missing black box. Debris from Flight 9525 scattered across rugged remote terrain in the French Alps. Let's get right to CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, who's live in Dusseldorf with the very latest.</p><p>Fred, it seems to me investigators would most want to speak to a former girlfriend to find out his mental state.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, probably her and I'm guessing that his family as well. However, the \"Bild\" newspaper, which is the biggest tabloid in Germany, has managed to speak to one of the ex-girlfriends, and she said that Andreas Lubitz was a man who needed a lot of attention, a man who can be sensitive, very flattering at times as well, but also someone who apparently had a dark side to him.</p><p>Also, she said he became erratic at times, that he became very angry, especially when he was talking about his employer. He felt that Germanwings wasn't treating him well.</p><p>This is according to the \"Bild\" newspaper. So, we're only getting this from a third source, but it certainly is, of course, a major point to these investigators, to speak to anyone who had direct contact with Andreas Lubitz, especially, of course, someone like a girlfriend, someone like his parents, someone like his brother who he was living with as well, Michael.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Do we know anything about the investigation relative to medications that he was on at the time of the crash or medications that he had stopped taking just before the crash?</p><p>PLEITGEN: Very little about medications. It's -- all that we have is from the prosecutor's office, and they're saying that he was being treated for some sort of illness, and that he had been treated for it for a very long time and he was seeing a doctor. And also, of course, he had those sick notes that he tore up. It's unclear what medications he might have been on, but it's something investigators will be looking at as well.</p><p>SMERCONISH: Frederik Pleitgen, thank you very much for your report.</p><p>Coming up, the possibility of pilotless aircraft is already being explored. We'll look at a new technology that could save a plane from being hijacked.</p><p>[09:56:47] SMERCONISH: Welcome back.</p><p>The crash of the Germanwings flight has reignited the debate about aircraft control. There's already a technology that's been developed that would let authorities on the ground intervene if there's a crisis in the air. Boeing has a patent, and Google has already conducted a test flight.</p><p>So, why isn't it being used?</p><p>CNN's Tom Foreman has the answer. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Michael. Boeing has a patent. Google has had a test flight of one of these planes. Big tech names all over the world are looking at this idea of airplanes that can be flown remotely from the ground in the belief that this might make them impervious from terrorist attacks, from criminal acts, and from any other sort of assault.</p><p>(voice-over): Watch closely. This plane over England has a crew at the controls, passengers in the back, but something extraordinary is about to happen. A pilot on the ground is taking over.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready to take control.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Proceed.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have control.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're on control.</p><p>FOREMAN: This is the $94 million ASTRAEA project by the British Aerospace Company, BAE, one of several efforts around the world to develop planes that can be flown remotely.</p><p>DUNCAN CASEY, TEST ENGINEER, BAE SYSTEMS: What you can hear at the moment is the discussion with air traffic that's exactly the same as the pilots would be having if they were in charge of the steering of the aircraft.</p><p>FOREMAN: Military success with drones has driven much of the interest and some efforts are focused on airplanes in hazard conditions, such as hurricane research and fighting wildfires. Analysts say pilotless planes could be a $400 billion a year global business.</p><p>So, why not passenger flights? First, the airline industry has remarkable safety record despite high profile disasters. Many believe on board pilots remain the most reliable way to handle problems and retrofitting planes would cost billions of dollars. And second, passengers may not be ready.</p><p>Robert Goyer is with \"Flying\" magazine.</p><p>ROBERT GOYER, FLYING MAGAZINE: I start by asking myself that question. How would I feel getting into an airplane that didn't have pilots up front? And I wouldn't do it.</p><p>FOREMAN (on camera): There are a lot of unanswered questions still. For example, what happens if one of the planes gets free of electronic tether, what if terrorists take over a ground control station and in that fashion start controlling the plane. One possible answer would be to add more than one station at a time so that any plane must be controlled from multiple points.</p><p>But even then, what if somebody hacks into the data stream and they take over the plane that way. All of these questions are going to have to be answered, because even though our planes are becoming more and more automated, and some take off and land pretty much on their own, this idea of controlling one from the ground has to be worked out in much more detail before it becomes a reality -- Michael.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SMERCONISH: Thank you, Tom. I'm reminded of the fact that elevators used to have operators as well.</p><p>Thank you so much for joining me.

Their testimony revealed\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://msmagazine.com/blog/2017/12/08/exploited-endangered-female-factory-workers-vietnam-open-work-conditions/\">major health impacts related to toxic exposure and overwork</url>. Nearly all reported experiencing \"extreme fatigue or dizziness,\" sometimes fainting spells. Chronic bone, joint, and leg pain were routine. Rest time is slotted between constantly rotating shifts: \"many are kept on alternating day and night shift schedules, regardless of weekends.\" Miscarriages are reportedly \"extremely common-even expected.\"</p><p>One worker described the typical daily work routine: \"Some of us stand during work while others have to shuttle between two ends of the production line...it is very difficult for a 3-month pregnant woman. As they have to stand or shuttle all day long, many have suffered a miscarriage.\"</p><p>For the workers raising children, currently half the female workforce, the Samsung factories deliberately separate mothers from families through\u00a0the dormitory system. Workers are kept in group housing on isolated compounds, where the company prohibits children from living with parents. Instead, \"children live with family members in another town or city.\"</p><p>Workers also appear to be ill-informed of potential hazards at a job that might otherwise seem like a step up from the drudge work that has traditionally dominated the\u00a0rural communities from which they're drawn. Most interviewees seemed to lack a clear understanding about how their working conditions related to their health.</p><p>One worker reflected, \"I think working in shifts makes me tired, our health cannot be adapted to a night shift immediately after changing from a day shift. For example, I have to sleep all day before a night shift and working at night I am more tired.... I was always in that state of health in the first years and now it remains the same. My co-workers told me that I would gradually get used to it.\"</p><p>\"Despite the fact that they work in an open factory setting where other workers are using a variety of substances, they did not consider their own job to be either using chemicals or to have any remote possibility of chemical exposure,\" IPEN researcher Joe\u00a0DiGangi\u00a0says. Productivity takes priority over safety training or standards for protective gear. Some workers reported to researchers that \"the training period seemed to vary based on how much of a hurry the factory was in for a particular production deadline.\"</p><p>The conditions in Vietnam point to the business motives for Samsung to \"streamline\" operations by outsourcing much of its multinational supply chain to countries with much cheaper modes of production than its home base of South Korea, including lesser labor and regulatory costs in poorer Southeast Asian countries.</p><p>Such abuses might be treated more seriously if they took place closer to Samsung's headquarter. The company has\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/samsung-south-korea-lee-yoon-jung-wins-compensation-brain-tumor/\">been embroiled in a high-profile lawsuit</url> over the case of a woman who died of a brain tumor after working at a Korea-based facility from 1997 to 2003-      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/exploding-phones-are-just-one-of-samsungs-safety-liabilities/\">part of a pattern of toxic exposures at Samsung factories</url>. According to DiGangi, longtime workplace-safety advocates say the situation in Vietnam \"reminds them strongly of Samsung here in Korea 10 years ago.\" The pattern signals that as Samsung expands its global empire and intensifies mass production of new models, the supply chain is slipping backward on occupational-safety conditions. Even in South Korea, workers have for years seen their claims for injury-related compensation       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://stopsamsung.wordpress.com/2017/10/06/another-samsung-victim-dies-as-sharps-reaches-new-momentum/\">thwarted by the company</url>, which has a reputation for cronyism, corrupt political connections, and intense corporate secrecy.</p><p>With no real independent trade unions and severe restrictions on labor organizing generally, Vietnamese workers have limited recourse compared to their South Korean counterparts. Samsung has reportedly threatened workers with dismissal and lawsuits if they continue to speak out about working conditions.</p><p>Samsung has cautiously addressed IPEN's findings. <url normalizedValue=\"https://business-humanrights.org/en/vietnam-study-finds-that-miscarriages-extreme-fatigue-fainting-dizziness-are-common-among-women-workers-in-samsung-factories-company-denies-allegations\">In a letter to the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre</url>, the company argued that the study was inaccurate and that Samsung's own \"on-site audits of the facilities in December 2016 and June 2017...show a reality that refutes the violations\" reported by IPEN researchers.</p><p>The Vietnamese labor ministry recently conducted its own audit of the facilities and reported on several labor violations, including excessive hours. But IPEN argues that \"large gaps still remain\" because the government has not addressed numerous occupational-safety concerns, including chemical contamination.</p><p>IPEN hopes Vietnam's government pursues deeper investigations. But economic factors often shape the politics of multinational investment for exporting countries.\u00a0\"The climate in the country is one that's very protective of foreign direct investment, and since Samsung is such a large contributor to that, they are quite careful about how the company is treated,\" DiGangi says.</p><p>With major investments at stake in Vietnam, Samsung may be focused more on corporate damage control for its brand than on addressing damage to workers' health. Samsung has threatened IPEN's local NGO partners with legal action, though the researchers stand by their findings. </p><p>DiGangi hopes the report will stimulate greater public awareness about the working conditions in the global tech supply chain. Consumer pressure on the company to improve on labor issues could perhaps spur Samsung to at least \"publicly state that workers have a right to speak about their working conditions,\" he says. \"That's something that a trade union would typically insist upon but the company\u00a0should state that.\" Future research should be done transparently,\u00a0DiGangi adds,\u00a0\"with the involvement of workers themselves\" as truly independent auditors, since they\u00a0\"have the best sense of their own work and their own jobs.\"</p><p>For now, the workers continue to be silenced, and the massive global demand for the devices they produce will speak loudest for Samsung's executives. As long as consumers continue to see their phones as indispensable, whatever the cost to workers' health, and multinational companies treat their workers' bodies as disposable, the message from the market to the workers is still: \"Get used to it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATMAG-268357</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYJ-BBD1-DXR3-235M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465017</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1178\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Nation Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7718\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 2, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X7D</classCode><className>MANUFACTURING FACILITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CZUL</classCode><className>NIGHT &amp;

Ad Policy[2] An in-depth investigation of VietnameseSamsung production facilities[3] peels back the shrink-wrap of Big Tech to reveal an extremely vulnerable, mostly female workforce that may be sacrificing its neurologic and reproductive health in digitized Dickensian workshops to make cutting-edge smartphones. The study, a collaboration between the global environmental watchdog IPEN and the Vietnam-based\u00a0Center for Gender, Family and Environment in Development[4] (CGFED), is based on interviews with 45 workers\u201480 percent of them women\u2014at two factories in a provincial city in Vietnam.

As they have to stand or shuttle all day long, many have suffered a miscarriage.'Tech Economy For the workers raising children, currently half the female workforce, the Samsung factories deliberately separate mothers from families through\u00a0the dormitory system. Workers are kept in group housing on isolated compounds, where the company prohibits children from living with parents. Instead, 'children live with family members in another town or city.' Workers also appear to be ill-informed of potential hazards at a job that might otherwise seem like a step up from the drudge work that has traditionally dominated the\u00a0rural communities from which they're drawn. Most interviewees seemed to lack a clear understanding about how their working conditions related to their health.One worker reflected, 'I think working in shifts makes me tired, our health cannot be adapted to a night shift immediately after changing from a day shift. For example, I have to sleep all day before a night shift and working at night I am more tired. I was always in that state of health in the first years and now it remains the same. My co-workers told me that I would gradually get used to it.'Current Issue <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/january-15-22-2018-issue/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/january-15-22-2018-issue/</url> 'Despite the fact that they work in an open factory setting where other workers are using a variety of substances, they did not consider their own job to be either using chemicals or to have any remote possibility of chemical exposure,' IPEN researcher Joe\u00a0DiGangi\u00a0says. Productivity takes priority over safety training or standards for protective gear. Some workers reported to researchers that 'the training period seemed to vary based on how much of a hurry the factory was in for a particular production deadline.' The conditions in Vietnam point to the business motives for Samsung to 'streamline' operations by outsourcing much of its multinational supply chain to countries with much cheaper modes of production than its home base of South Korea, including lesser labor and regulatory costs in poorer Southeast Asian countries. Such abuses might be treated more seriously if they took place closer to Samsung's headquarter. The company has\u00a0been embroiled in a high-profile lawsuit[6] over the case of a woman who died of a brain tumor after working at a Korea-based facility from 1997 to 2003\u2014part of a pattern of toxic exposures at Samsung factories[7]. According to DiGangi, longtime workplace-safety advocates say the situation in Vietnam 'reminds them strongly of Samsung here in Korea 10 years ago.' The pattern signals that as Samsung expands its global empire and intensifies mass production of new models, the supply chain is slipping backward on occupational-safety conditions. Even in South Korea, workers have for years seen their claims for injury-related compensation thwarted by the company[8], which has a reputation for cronyism, corrupt political connections, and intense corporate secrecy. With no real independent trade unions and severe restrictions on labor organizing generally, Vietnamese workers have limited recourse compared to their South Korean counterparts. Samsung has reportedly threatened workers with dismissal and lawsuits if they continue to speak out about working conditions. Samsung has cautiously addressed IPEN's findings. In a letter to the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre[9], the company argued that the study was inaccurate and that Samsung's own 'on-site audits of the facilities in December 2016 and June 2017show a reality that refutes the violations' reported by IPEN researchers. The Vietnamese labor ministry recently conducted its own audit of the facilities and reported on several labor violations, including excessive hours. But IPEN argues that 'large gaps still remain' because the government has not addressed numerous occupational-safety concerns, including chemical contamination.IPEN hopes Vietnam's government pursues deeper investigations. But economic factors often shape the politics of multinational investment for exporting countries.\u00a0'The climate in the country is one that's very protective of foreign direct investment, and since Samsung is such a large contributor to that, they are quite careful about how the company is treated,' DiGangi says. With major investments at stake in Vietnam, Samsung may be focused more on corporate damage control for its brand than on addressing damage to workers' health. Samsung has threatened IPEN's local NGO partners with legal action, though the researchers stand by their findings. DiGangi hopes the report will stimulate greater public awareness about the working conditions in the global tech supply chain. Consumer pressure on the company to improve on labor issues could perhaps spur Samsung to at least 'publicly state that workers have a right to speak about their working conditions,' he says. 'That's something that a trade union would typically insist upon but the company\u00a0should state that.' Future research should be done transparently,\u00a0DiGangi adds,\u00a0'with the involvement of workers themselves' as truly independent auditors, since they\u00a0'have the best sense of their own work and their own jobs.' For now, the workers continue to be silenced, and the massive global demand for the devices they produce will speak loudest for Samsung's executives. As long as consumers continue to see their phones as indispensable, whatever the cost to workers' health, and multinational companies treat their workers' bodies as disposable, the message from the market to the workers is still: 'Get used to it.'

The powerful executives are set to defend their companies as buttressing competition and offering essential services to consumers. The four CEOs are testifying remotely for a hearing Wednesday by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust that was delayed until 1 p.m. ET.    President Donald Trump, meanwhile, continued his drive against the big tech companies for what he says, without evidence, is bias against him and conservatives in general.    Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple will face Congress Wednesday after a more than year long anti-trust investigation. They're facing accusations of unfairly favoring their own products in the digital marketplaces they operate from Congress.    In a tweet, he challenged Congress to crack down on the companies.    \u201cIf Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted before the start of the hearing. \u201cIn Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!\"    Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.    The White House cited an earlier Trump executive order in that direction and his request to federal regulators to issue guidelines.\u201cPresident Trump will continue to fight back against unfair, un-American, and politically biased censorship of Americans online,\" the White House said in a statement Wednesday.    The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world\u2019s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.    Critics question whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.    In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding is needed.    Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.    The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices.    Each company has a distinct profile and each tech titan has his own approach and story to tell.    For Bezos, who presides over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal \u201csmart\u201d tech and beyond, it will be his first-ever appearance before Congress.    Bezos is introducing himself, in a way, in his hearing testimony, unusual for the occasion. He lays out his challenging life story growing up in New Mexico as the son of a single mother in high school, and later with an adoptive father who emigrated from Cuba at 16. Previewing his written testimony in a blog post Tuesday, Bezos traces his origins as a \u201cgarage inventor\u201d who came up with the concept of an online bookstore in 1994.    He addresses the issue of Amazon\u2019s power in what he describes as a huge and competitive global retail market. The company accounts for less than 4% of retail in the U.S., Bezos maintains. He affirms his rebuff to critics who call for the company to be broken up: Walmart is more than twice Amazon\u2019s size, he says.    Bezos initially declined to testify unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He\u2019ll likely face questioning over a Wall Street Journal report that found Amazon employees used confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusations.    In the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook\u2019s handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook\u2019s refusal to take action on inflammatory Trump posts that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters.    Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage. \u201cWe believe in values \u2014democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression \u2014 that the American economy was built on,\u201d he says in his testimony prepared for the hearing.    \u201cI understand that people have concerns about the size and perceived power that tech companies have,\u201d Zuckerberg's statement says. \u201cUltimately, I believe companies shouldn\u2019t be making so many judgments about important issues like harmful content, privacy and election integrity on their own. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve called for a more active role for governments and regulators, and updated rules for the internet.\u201d    European regulators have concluded that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the e-commerce market, and fined Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., a record $2.7 billion. Google has disputed the findings and is appealing.    Attorneys general from both parties in 50 states and territories, led by Texas, launched an antitrust investigation of Google in September, focused on its online advertising business.    \u201cGoogle operates in highly competitive and dynamic global markets, in which prices are free or falling, and products are constantly improving,\" Pichai says in his written testimony. \u201cCompetition in ads \u2014 from Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Comcast and others \u2014 has helped lower online advertising costs by 40% over the last 10 years, with these savings passed down to consumers through lower prices.\"    Apple, whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world, faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay.    \u201cApple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,\" Cook says.    He is making the case that the fees Apple charges apps to sell services and other goods are reasonable, especially compared with what other tech companies collect. In over a decade since the App Store launched, \u201cwe have never raised the commission or added a single fee,\" Cook says in his testimony.    ___    Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url

The powerful executives are set to defend their companies as buttressing competition and offering essential services to consumers. The four CEOs are testifying remotely for a hearing Wednesday by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust that was delayed until 1 p.m. ET.    President Donald Trump, meanwhile, continued his drive against the big tech companies for what he says, without evidence, is bias against him and conservatives in general.    Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple will face Congress Wednesday after a more than year long anti-trust investigation. They're facing accusations of unfairly favoring their own products in the digital marketplaces they operate from Congress.    In a tweet, he challenged Congress to crack down on the companies.    \u201cIf Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted before the start of the hearing. \u201cIn Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!\"    Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.    The White House cited an earlier Trump executive order in that direction and his request to federal regulators to issue guidelines.\u201cPresident Trump will continue to fight back against unfair, un-American, and politically biased censorship of Americans online,\" the White House said in a statement Wednesday.    The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world\u2019s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.    Critics question whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.    In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding is needed.    Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.    The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices.    Each company has a distinct profile and each tech titan has his own approach and story to tell.    For Bezos, who presides over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal \u201csmart\u201d tech and beyond, it will be his first-ever appearance before Congress.    Bezos is introducing himself, in a way, in his hearing testimony, unusual for the occasion. He lays out his challenging life story growing up in New Mexico as the son of a single mother in high school, and later with an adoptive father who emigrated from Cuba at 16. Previewing his written testimony in a blog post Tuesday, Bezos traces his origins as a \u201cgarage inventor\u201d who came up with the concept of an online bookstore in 1994.    He addresses the issue of Amazon\u2019s power in what he describes as a huge and competitive global retail market. The company accounts for less than 4% of retail in the U.S., Bezos maintains. He affirms his rebuff to critics who call for the company to be broken up: Walmart is more than twice Amazon\u2019s size, he says.    Bezos initially declined to testify unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He\u2019ll likely face questioning over a Wall Street Journal report that found Amazon employees used confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusations.    In the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook\u2019s handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook\u2019s refusal to take action on inflammatory Trump posts that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters.    Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage. \u201cWe believe in values \u2014democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression \u2014 that the American economy was built on,\u201d he says in his testimony prepared for the hearing.    \u201cI understand that people have concerns about the size and perceived power that tech companies have,\u201d Zuckerberg's statement says. \u201cUltimately, I believe companies shouldn\u2019t be making so many judgments about important issues like harmful content, privacy and election integrity on their own. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve called for a more active role for governments and regulators, and updated rules for the internet.\u201d    European regulators have concluded that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the e-commerce market, and fined Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., a record $2.7 billion. Google has disputed the findings and is appealing.    Attorneys general from both parties in 50 states and territories, led by Texas, launched an antitrust investigation of Google in September, focused on its online advertising business.    \u201cGoogle operates in highly competitive and dynamic global markets, in which prices are free or falling, and products are constantly improving,\" Pichai says in his written testimony. \u201cCompetition in ads \u2014 from Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Comcast and others \u2014 has helped lower online advertising costs by 40% over the last 10 years, with these savings passed down to consumers through lower prices.\"    Apple, whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world, faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay.    \u201cApple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,\" Cook says.    He is making the case that the fees Apple charges apps to sell services and other goods are reasonable, especially compared with what other tech companies collect. In over a decade since the App Store launched, \u201cwe have never raised the commission or added a single fee,\" Cook says in his testimony.    ___    Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url

The powerful executives are set to defend their companies as buttressing competition and offering essential services to consumers. The four CEOs are testifying remotely for a hearing Wednesday by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust that was delayed until 1 p.m. ET.   Health President Donald Trump, meanwhile, continued his drive against the big tech companies for what he says, without evidence, is bias against him and conservatives in general.   Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple will face Congress Wednesday after a more than year long anti-trust investigation. They're facing accusations of unfairly favoring their own products in the digital marketplaces they operate from Congress. In a tweet, he challenged Congress to crack down on the companies.  \u201cIf Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted before the start of the hearing. \u201cIn Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!\"  Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.   The White House cited an earlier Trump executive order in that direction and his request to federal regulators to issue guidelines.\u201cPresident Trump will continue to fight back against unfair, un-American, and politically biased censorship of Americans online,\" the White House said in a statement Wednesday.  The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world\u2019s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.   Critics question whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.   In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding is needed.  Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.  The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices.  Each company has a distinct profile and each tech titan has his own approach and story to tell.  For Bezos, who presides over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal \u201csmart\u201d tech and beyond, it will be his first-ever appearance before Congress.  Bezos is introducing himself, in a way, in his hearing testimony, unusual for the occasion. He lays out his challenging life story growing up in New Mexico as the son of a single mother in high school, and later with an adoptive father who emigrated from Cuba at 16. Previewing his written testimony in a blog post Tuesday, Bezos traces his origins as a \u201cgarage inventor\u201d who came up with the concept of an online bookstore in 1994.   He addresses the issue of Amazon\u2019s power in what he describes as a huge and competitive global retail market. The company accounts for less than 4% of retail in the U.S., Bezos maintains. He affirms his rebuff to critics who call for the company to be broken up: Walmart is more than twice Amazon\u2019s size, he says.  Bezos initially declined to testify unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He\u2019ll likely face questioning over a Wall Street Journal report that found Amazon employees used confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusations.  In the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook\u2019s handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook\u2019s refusal to take action on inflammatory Trump posts that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters.   Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage. \u201cWe believe in values \u2014democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression \u2014 that the American economy was built on,\u201d he says in his testimony prepared for the hearing.   \u201cI understand that people have concerns about the size and perceived power that tech companies have,\u201d Zuckerberg's statement says. \u201cUltimately, I believe companies shouldn\u2019t be making so many judgments about important issues like harmful content, privacy and election integrity on their own. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve called for a more active role for governments and regulators, and updated rules for the internet.\u201d  European regulators have concluded that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the e-commerce market, and fined Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., a record $2.7 billion. Google has disputed the findings and is appealing.   Attorneys general from both parties in 50 states and territories, led by Texas, launched an antitrust investigation of Google in September, focused on its online advertising business.   \u201cGoogle operates in highly competitive and dynamic global markets, in which prices are free or falling, and products are constantly improving,\" Pichai says in his written testimony. \u201cCompetition in ads \u2014 from Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Comcast and others \u2014 has helped lower online advertising costs by 40% over the last 10 years, with these savings passed down to consumers through lower prices.\"  Apple, whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world, faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay.   \u201cApple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,\" Cook says.  He is making the case that the fees Apple charges apps to sell services and other goods are reasonable, especially compared with what other tech companies collect. In over a decade since the App Store launched, \u201cwe have never raised the commission or added a single fee,\" Cook says in his testimony.  ___  Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url

The powerful executives are set to defend their companies as buttressing competition and offering essential services to consumers. The four CEOs are testifying remotely for a hearing Wednesday by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust that was delayed until 1 p.m. ET.    President Donald Trump, meanwhile, continued his drive against the big tech companies for what he says, without evidence, is bias against him and conservatives in general.    Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple will face Congress Wednesday after a more than year long anti-trust investigation. They're facing accusations of unfairly favoring their own products in the digital marketplaces they operate from Congress.    In a tweet, he challenged Congress to crack down on the companies.    \u201cIf Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted before the start of the hearing. \u201cIn Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!\"    Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.    The White House cited an earlier Trump executive order in that direction and his request to federal regulators to issue guidelines.\u201cPresident Trump will continue to fight back against unfair, un-American, and politically biased censorship of Americans online,\" the White House said in a statement Wednesday.    The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world\u2019s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.    Critics question whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.    In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding is needed.    Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.    The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices.    Each company has a distinct profile and each tech titan has his own approach and story to tell.    For Bezos, who presides over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal \u201csmart\u201d tech and beyond, it will be his first-ever appearance before Congress.    Bezos is introducing himself, in a way, in his hearing testimony, unusual for the occasion. He lays out his challenging life story growing up in New Mexico as the son of a single mother in high school, and later with an adoptive father who emigrated from Cuba at 16. Previewing his written testimony in a blog post Tuesday, Bezos traces his origins as a \u201cgarage inventor\u201d who came up with the concept of an online bookstore in 1994.    He addresses the issue of Amazon\u2019s power in what he describes as a huge and competitive global retail market. The company accounts for less than 4% of retail in the U.S., Bezos maintains. He affirms his rebuff to critics who call for the company to be broken up: Walmart is more than twice Amazon\u2019s size, he says.    Bezos initially declined to testify unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He\u2019ll likely face questioning over a Wall Street Journal report that found Amazon employees used confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusations.    In the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook\u2019s handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook\u2019s refusal to take action on inflammatory Trump posts that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters.    Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage. \u201cWe believe in values \u2014democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression \u2014 that the American economy was built on,\u201d he says in his testimony prepared for the hearing.    \u201cI understand that people have concerns about the size and perceived power that tech companies have,\u201d Zuckerberg's statement says. \u201cUltimately, I believe companies shouldn\u2019t be making so many judgments about important issues like harmful content, privacy and election integrity on their own. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve called for a more active role for governments and regulators, and updated rules for the internet.\u201d    European regulators have concluded that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the e-commerce market, and fined Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., a record $2.7 billion. Google has disputed the findings and is appealing.    Attorneys general from both parties in 50 states and territories, led by Texas, launched an antitrust investigation of Google in September, focused on its online advertising business.    \u201cGoogle operates in highly competitive and dynamic global markets, in which prices are free or falling, and products are constantly improving,\" Pichai says in his written testimony. \u201cCompetition in ads \u2014 from Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Comcast and others \u2014 has helped lower online advertising costs by 40% over the last 10 years, with these savings passed down to consumers through lower prices.\"    Apple, whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world, faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay.    \u201cApple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,\" Cook says.    He is making the case that the fees Apple charges apps to sell services and other goods are reasonable, especially compared with what other tech companies collect. In over a decade since the App Store launched, \u201cwe have never raised the commission or added a single fee,\" Cook says in his testimony.    ___    Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url

The four command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them is the world\u2019s richest individual (Bezos); another is the fourth-ranked billionaire (Zuckerberg). Their industry has transformed society, linked people around the globe, mined and commercialized users\u2019 personal data, and infuriated critics on both the left and right over speech.    Critics question whether the companies, grown increasingly powerful after gobbling up scores of rivals, stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.    The four CEOs are testifying remotely for a hearing Wednesday by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.    In its bipartisan investigation, the panel collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding is needed.    Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.    The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices.    Each company has a distinct profile and sets its widening footprint in specific markets, and each tech titan has his own approach and story to tell.    For Bezos, who presides over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal \u201csmart\u201d tech and beyond, it will be his first-ever appearance before Congress.    Bezos is introducing himself, in a way, in his hearing testimony, unusual for the occasion. He lays out his challenging life story growing up in New Mexico as the son of a single mother in high school, and later with an adoptive father who emigrated from Cuba at 16. Previewing his written testimony in a blog post Tuesday, Bezos traces his origins as a \u201cgarage inventor\u201d who came up with the concept of an online bookstore in 1994.    He addresses the issue of Amazon\u2019s power in what he describes as a huge and competitive global retail market. The company accounts for less than 4% of retail in the U.S., Bezos maintains. He affirms his rebuff to critics who call for the company to be broken up: Walmart is more than twice Amazon\u2019s size, he says.    Bezos initially declined to testify unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He\u2019ll likely face questioning over a Wall Street Journal report that found Amazon employees used confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusation    In the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook\u2019s handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook\u2019s refusal to take action on inflammatory Trump posts that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters.    Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage. \u201cWe believe in values \u2014democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression \u2014 that the American economy was built on,\u201d he says in his testimony prepared for the hearing.    \u201cI understand that people have concerns about the size and perceived power that tech companies have,\u201d Zuckerberg's statement says. \u201cUltimately, I believe companies shouldn\u2019t be making so many judgments about important issues like harmful content, privacy and election integrity on their own. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve called for a more active role for governments and regulators, and updated rules for the internet.\u201d    European regulators have concluded that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the e-commerce market, and fined Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., a record $2.7 billion. Google has disputed the findings and is appealing.    Attorneys general from both parties in 50 states and territories, led by Texas, launched an antitrust investigation of Google in September, focused on its online advertising business.    \u201cGoogle operates in highly competitive and dynamic global markets, in which prices are free or falling, and products are constantly improving,\" Pichai says in his written testimony. \u201cCompetition in ads \u2014 from Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Comcast and others \u2014 has helped lower online advertising costs by 40% over the last 10 years, with these savings passed down to consumers through lower prices.\"    Apple, whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world, faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay.    \u201cApple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,\" Cook says.    He is making the case that the fees Apple charges apps to sell services and other goods are reasonable, especially compared with what other tech companies collect. In over a decade since the App Store launched, \u201cwe have never raised the commission or added a single fee,\" Cook says in his testimony.    ___    Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url

Amazon's Jeff Bezos, in his first appearance before Congress, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices even as they provided data highlighting how competitive their markets are and the value of their innovation and essential services to consumers. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.    The scrutiny of Big Tech could lead to new restrictions on its power, though forced breakups appear unlikely.    The four CEOs were testifying remotely at a hearing of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, while most lawmakers sat, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington.    Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.    Bezos said that he couldn\u2019t guarantee that Amazon had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.    Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have scrutinized Amazon\u2019s relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.    \u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d Bezos said in a response to a question from U.S Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee to you that that policy hasn\u2019t been violated.\u201d    Pichai's opening remarks touted Google's value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in the home districts of the antitrust panel's Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, and its ranking Republican, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.    But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.    Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline\u2019s attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them from defecting to a rival service such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing.    Facebook, in turn, faced renewed focus on its gobbling up of competitors. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, told Zuckerberg that documents obtained from the company \u201ctell a very disturbing story\u201d of Facebook\u2019s acquisition of the Instagram messaging service.    Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple will face Congress Wednesday after a more than year long anti-trust investigation. They're facing accusations of unfairly favoring their own products in the digital marketplaces they operate from Congress.    He said the documents show Zuckerberg called Instagram a threat that could \u201cmeaningfully hurt\u201d Facebook.    Zuckerberg responded that Facebook viewed Instagram as both a competitor and a \u201ccomplement\u201d to Facebook\u2019s services, but also acknowledged that it competed with Facebook on photo-sharing. Some critics of Facebook have called for the company to divest Instagram and its WhatsApp messaging service.    As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances that the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China. \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.    In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.    \u201cIf Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted.    During a House Antitrust Subcommittee Hearing Wednesday, Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Ga., played testimony from a third-party seller on Amazon who claims the company retaliated against her when her bookselling business grew too successful. \u201cAs we grew, we were shrinking Amazon\u2019s marketshare in the textbook category,\u201d the small business owner said. \u201cIn retaliation, Amazon started restricting us from selling. We haven\u2019t sold a single book in the last 10 months. We were never given a reason.\u201d    Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can't use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.    Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.    The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world\u2019s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.    Critics have questioned whether the companies  stifle competition  and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.    In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.    Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort.    House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D, R.I., questioned Google CEO Sundar Pichai about his company\u2019s treatment of Yelp. \u201cThe choice Google gave Yelp was, \u2019Let us steal your content or effectively disappear from the web,\u2019\u201d said Cicilline. \u201cMr. Pichai, isn\u2019t that anti-competitive?\u201d    Cicilline also said Wednesday that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cthese giants stand to profit\u201d and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online. Sensenbrenner, the subcommittee's top Republican, rejected the idea that new legislation is needed, suggesting that antitrust reform could be a difficult mission for Democrats in Congress.    The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices.    During a House Antitrust Subcommittee Hearing Wednesday, Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., claimed Google\u2019s algorithm for marking emails as spam was targeting \"only\" conservative Republican campaign emails. Steube said a supporter told him campaign emails were \"suddenly\" going to his spam folder. Google CEO Sundar Pichai denied that was the case, and Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., offered her own rebuke. \u201cI\u2019m a Democrat from Florida, and I\u2019ve heard complaints of my emails going into spam as well.\u201d    Of the four tech leaders, Apple CEO Tim Cook faced the lightest scrutiny Wednesday \u2014 a likely reflection of the difficulty of making an antitrust case against the company whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world.    \u201cApple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,\u201d Cook told lawmakers.    But the company still faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay.    Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-WI, criticized Facebook\u2019s decision to remove a viral video of doctors claiming hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19. CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the decision saying that \u201csome of the data suggests it might be harmful to people, we think we should take that down. That could cause imminent risk of harm.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42716069715</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-13V1-F07F-80NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1481\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NBC Los Angeles</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Amazon's Jeff Bezos, in his first appearance before Congress, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices even as they provided data highlighting how competitive their markets are and the value of their innovation and essential services to consumers. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.    The scrutiny of Big Tech could lead to new restrictions on its power, though forced breakups appear unlikely.    The four CEOs were testifying remotely at a hearing of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, while most lawmakers sat, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington.    Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.    Bezos said that he couldn\u2019t guarantee that Amazon had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.    Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have scrutinized Amazon\u2019s relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.    \u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d Bezos said in a response to a question from U.S Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee to you that that policy hasn\u2019t been violated.\u201d    Pichai's opening remarks touted Google's value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in the home districts of the antitrust panel's Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, and its ranking Republican, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.    But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.    Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline\u2019s attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them from defecting to a rival service such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing.    Facebook, in turn, faced renewed focus on its gobbling up of competitors. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, told Zuckerberg that documents obtained from the company \u201ctell a very disturbing story\u201d of Facebook\u2019s acquisition of the Instagram messaging service.    Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple will face Congress Wednesday after a more than year long anti-trust investigation. They're facing accusations of unfairly favoring their own products in the digital marketplaces they operate from Congress.    He said the documents show Zuckerberg called Instagram a threat that could \u201cmeaningfully hurt\u201d Facebook.    Zuckerberg responded that Facebook viewed Instagram as both a competitor and a \u201ccomplement\u201d to Facebook\u2019s services, but also acknowledged that it competed with Facebook on photo-sharing. Some critics of Facebook have called for the company to divest Instagram and its WhatsApp messaging service.    As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances that the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China. \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.    In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.    \u201cIf Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted.    During a House Antitrust Subcommittee Hearing Wednesday, Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Ga., played testimony from a third-party seller on Amazon who claims the company retaliated against her when her bookselling business grew too successful. \u201cAs we grew, we were shrinking Amazon\u2019s marketshare in the textbook category,\u201d the small business owner said. \u201cIn retaliation, Amazon started restricting us from selling. We haven\u2019t sold a single book in the last 10 months. We were never given a reason.\u201d    Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can't use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.    Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter.

A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.    Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort.    House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D, R.I., questioned Google CEO Sundar Pichai about his company\u2019s treatment of Yelp. \u201cThe choice Google gave Yelp was, \u2019Let us steal your content or effectively disappear from the web,\u2019\u201d said Cicilline. \u201cMr. Pichai, isn\u2019t that anti-competitive?\u201d    Cicilline also said Wednesday that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cthese giants stand to profit\u201d and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online. Sensenbrenner, the subcommittee's top Republican, rejected the idea that new legislation is needed, suggesting that antitrust reform could be a difficult mission for Democrats in Congress.    The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices.    During a House Antitrust Subcommittee Hearing Wednesday, Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., claimed Google\u2019s algorithm for marking emails as spam was targeting \"only\" conservative Republican campaign emails. Steube said a supporter told him campaign emails were \"suddenly\" going to his spam folder. Google CEO Sundar Pichai denied that was the case, and Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., offered her own rebuke. \u201cI\u2019m a Democrat from Florida, and I\u2019ve heard complaints of my emails going into spam as well.\u201d    Of the four tech leaders, Apple CEO Tim Cook faced the lightest scrutiny Wednesday \u2014 a likely reflection of the difficulty of making an antitrust case against the company whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world.    \u201cApple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,\u201d Cook told lawmakers.    But the company still faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay.    Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-WI, criticized Facebook\u2019s decision to remove a viral video of doctors claiming hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19. CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the decision saying that \u201csome of the data suggests it might be harmful to people, we think we should take that down. That could cause imminent risk of harm.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42716059832</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-13V1-F07F-80MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1481\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NBC Chicago</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The video was the #1 trending video on YouTube on Tuesday. Boston Dynamics used to be part of Google but was sold to Softbank[1] earlier this year. This robot seems to be electric powered, and has gotten a major cosmetic update since the last time it was seen in public. It also is no longer equipped with a robot arm. An engineer at Boston Dynamics told Business Insider earlier this year[2] that for demos, SpotMini is semi-automated and controlled with with an Xbox controller.\u00a0Youtube Embed: </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/kgaO45SyaO4\">http://www.youtube.com/embed/kgaO45SyaO4</url> Width: 640px Height: 360px NOW WATCH: We put the iPhone X's Face ID to the ultimate test with identical twins \u2014 and the results surprised us[3]See Also: The first-ever robot citizen has 7 humanoid 'siblings' \u2014 here's what they look like[4]Under fire for pointing kids to disturbing videos, YouTube promises to put in place new age restrictions[5]Sen.

It is now key that these measures are enforced in a proportionate and targeted way.\"</p><p>The code, which is legally backed by a requirement in the Data Protection Act 2018 for the ICO to prepare a code of practice containing guidance \"on standards of age-appropriate design of relevant information society services which are likely to be accessed by children\" had faced criticism in earlier drafts over the risk it could force the entire internet to be made child safe, owing to ambiguity over whether any given site is likely to be accessed by children.</p><p>In the final version of the code, the ICO says it will take a \"commonsense\" approach to the question, but notes that \"if your service is the kind of service that you would not want children to use in any case, then your focus should be on how you prevent access.</p><p>\"If your service is not aimed at children but is not inappropriate for them to use either, then your focus should be on assessing how appealing your service will be to them.\"</p><p>The initial focus of the code is likely to be large social media companies, including YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat, all of which have significant numbers of child users and, until now, few legal restrictions on how they can be treated.</p><p>But the changes have not eased all fears.

The CMA even goes as far as to suggest unwinding elements of Google's 2007 merger with Double-Click, a $3.1bn (\u00a32.4bn) deal that cemented its power over the advertising technology market.</p><p>Both firms have achieved so-called strategic market status, according to the CMA - potentially harming consumer choice, damaging publishers and newspapers, and hampering technical innovation.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is already undertaking a similar investigation.</p><p>The competition bureau was responding to questions by the Star as to whether a similar action will be undertaken by the federal agency responsible for monitoring and regulating competition in Canada. Recent steps, including the hiring this month of its first chief digital enforcement officer, indicate that the agency is bulking up to take on the big technology companies.</p><p>And experts say it is only a matter of time before Canada joins the United States and the European Union in antitrust investigations.</p><p>\"This is a big deal and we should be paying attention because this will impact Canada,\" said professor Mihkel Tombak, Hatch Chair in Technology Management at the University of Toronto and an expert in antitrust issues.</p><p>\"I think it's inevitable that the Canadian authorities here will be looking at how they should be taking a more aggressive stance,\" Tombak said.</p><p>In Canada, it will be up to the competition bureau to determine whether an investigation is warranted. And one former commissioner says she thinks the agency will eventually have to follow the lead of European and U.S. counterparts.</p><p>\"I think regulators are very interested in the issue and that the competition bureau will eventually do something, the question is what?\" said Melanie Aitken, co-head of the Antitrust Group at law firm Bennett Jones and the former Canadian Commissioner of Competition in an interview.</p><p>\"These are really tough decisions facing the competition commissioner.\"</p><p>The scope of the conversation around these issues in the U.S. and elsewhere is broad, but Aitken said defining the issues will be paramount.</p><p>\"Some think it's a privacy issue, others may think it's a data protection or competition problem. And certainly a privacy issue can relate to a competition issue. A lot of people are trying to get their arms around what can be legitimately addressed. And what mechanisms or tools to use to do so.\"</p><p>The U.S. did not mention which tech companies would be under investigation. But this month, the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook $5 billion for mishandling user information. In Europe, Amazon is already under an antitrust investigation by the EU's Competition Commission, announced last week. And critics of big tech have been more vocal than ever, calling for the breaking up of some companies.</p><p>\"The EU has been more aggressive on investigating these companies, but the U.S. is following suit,\" U of T's Tombak said. \"What often happens in competition cases is that companies get prosecuted in other jurisdictions and Canadians take a similar path.\"</p><p>The big question, Tombak said, is if the big firms are \"stepping over the line\" and choking off small firms that contribute to innovation.</p><p>\"It's not illegal to be in a dominant position. You may be dominant because you're really good. But if you're abusing that position, that's a problem.\"</p><p>The competition bureau's Albert said the bureau could not confirm whether an official investigation into technology firms was underway.</p><p>\"The bureau is required by law to conduct its work confidentially,\" Albert said.</p><p>However, he pointed out that the bureau is working closely with the federal innovation department and policy-makers to \"take a look under the hood\" of digital competition policy and hosted a forum looking at that subject in May.</p><p>In July, the bureau hired former IBM executive George McDonald as its first chief digital enforcement officer. McDonald will \"boost our digital intelligence gathering skills,\" Albert said.</p><p>Given the more limited Canadian resources to investigate tech giants, lawyer Aitken, who was also on the steering committee of the International Competition Network, says the bureau may do more \"surgical strikes\" addressing narrower issues at the most egregious offenders.</p><p>\"I think the bureau will more likely be looking at discreet behaviours or acquisitions rather than embarking on a massive investigation, which is possible in the United States, which is more resource capable,\" Aitken said.</p><p>Tech giants have traditionally been given a hands-off approach by antitrust regulators focused on pricing at least in respect to acquisitions of competitors. In the usual scenario, if one company gobbles up a competitor in the market, competition is reduced and pricing may go up. But products offered by companies such as Facebook and Google are seemingly free. However, that thinking has shifted.</p><p>\"A typical analysis of mergers and antitrust is whether prices go up,\" Aitken said. \"But often with these powerful platforms you're not really going to find price effects ... So how to determine the material effect on competition so as to block a merger will be a real challenge for the competition authorities.\"</p><p>U of T's Tombak said one wider issue to be considered is whether antitrust legislation will impact innovation overall.</p><p>\"Do big firms contribute disproportionately to innovation? The jury is still out.\"</p><p>Tombak said Canadian regulators have traditionally been more moderate than their U.S. or European counterparts with antitrust legislation.</p><p>In some cases that hasn't worked too well. The Canadian Privacy Commissioner announced this year it is taking Facebook to court over privacy violations and \"refusing to implement recommendations to address deficiencies.\"</p><p>Former competition bureau commissioner Aitken said that, in her experience - which includes high-profile litigation against the Toronto Real Estate Board over opening up the Multiple Listing Service, and challenging Visa and Mastercard over card acceptance rules - getting compliance from companies through enforcement remains one of the most important tools for Canadian regulators.</p><p>\"Advocacy is important. But it alone doesn't get you far. You need to have the resources and the right tools to back them up. That's a powerful way to correct behaviour.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019072555161284</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN5-7KV1-JBTY-W1Y1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1081\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation of digital markets, due to be announced this week, is rightly near the top of the in-tray for the new Government.</p><p>This work is so fundamental to the future of all kinds of businesses that it is hard to overstate its importance. The dominant online players - Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon - are constantly expanding into more aspects of life and commerce. In places, the harm they cause is obvious. They sometimes act as platforms for bullies, terrorists, criminals and disinformation. The Government has already proposed new regulations to tackle such negligence, but it is the CMA's investigation that offers the best chance of getting to the root of the problem.</p><p>Many of the worst aspects of the internet and Big Tech are a result of the incentives baked into the opaque and uncompetitive digital advertising supply chain. Facebook and Google dominate, and the systems they have built reward quantity over quality, both in terms of online content and its audience. As middlemen they hoover up too much of the money advertisers spend.</p><p>These systems were also built by takeovers, particularly in Google's case. Though it came to dominate the consumer search market by investing in innovation and providing a superior service, its advertising technology, where the money is made, was assembled by acquisitions.</p><p>If competition watchdogs, led by the CMA's determined chief executive Andrea Coscelli, can find a way to open the industry to competition, we will be on the road to redemption. When Facebook and Google are forced to compete in a fair market, causing harm and getting away with it will be a lot more difficult.</p><p>This will of course be massively challenging work for competition watchdogs around the world, even as they form alliances.

Rakuten subsidiary Kobo is an e-book seller and a maker of e-readers. Any e-book bought via in-app purchasing within the Kobo Apple app is hit with a 30% commission, making it less attractively priced. To get around this, users can buy directly from the Kobo website, but that is a barrier to the impulse buying that doing it in-app facilitates.</p><p>This complaint echoes one by streaming giant Spotify, from March 2019, which claims similar practices prioritise Apple Music over competing services. In an open letter on its site, Spot-ify said Apple was \"acting as both player and referee to deliberately disadvantage other app developers\". It had turned to the commission after attempts to engage Apple directly had failed. It's quite a read, so if antitrust cases do it for you I recommend perusing the full post.</p><p>In May, Tile, which makes Bluetooth tracking tags and offers a tracking service, wrote to the commission saying Apple had made policy changes that benefited Apple's own \"Find My\" app, a Tile competitor.</p><p>Naturally, Apple has strenuously denied it is anticompetitive. In a statement on June 15 - preceding the European Commission announcement by a mere day, coincidentally? - Apple shared the findings of Boston-based Analysis Group that the App Store ecosystem had facilitated $519bn in \"billings and sales globally\" in 2019.</p><p>In a press release on its own newsroom page, Apple said that because it \"only receives a commission from the billings associated with digital goods and services, more than 85% of the $519bn total accrues solely to third-party developers and businesses of all sizes\". The highest-value categories covered digital goods and service apps (which would include e-books and music streaming services), and in-app advertising.</p><p>This is just one skirmish in what is shaping up to be a multiplayer war among titans on many fronts. Apple was recently fined about $1.2bn by France's competition authority, Autorit\u00e9 de la Concurrence, for the ways in which it had restricted how wholesalers sold Apple products, including a deal with two wholesalers not to compete.</p><p>The US Federal Trade Commission has asked Apple (along with Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft) to supply information on a number of acquisitions over the past decade. Also stateside in 2019, the judiciary committee in the House of Representatives made formal document requests to Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Apple, and it has hosted several panels with companies that feel aggrieved by potentially monopolistic practices, including Tile, and audio company Sonos.</p><p>Tech-focused publication The Verge (Vox media) published an extensive report on this topic in March 2019. Its take on the house judiciary committee process is that \"congressional investigations tend to be aimed at informing future bills rather than uncovering crimes, so it's unlikely the pressure will have an immediate impact. Still, these investigations can produce important documents and often lay the groundwork for more aggressive and sustained regulation down the road.\"</p><p>The latest news may centre on Apple, but the current top tier bogey of antitrust commentators is, arguably, Amazon. This e-commerce behemoth is growing at pace and has even been boosted by coronavirus-focused lockdowns as people stay away from shops and have goods delivered instead. It is the focus of two preliminary antitrust investigations in the US (in California and Washington state).</p><p>In April the Wall Street Journal accused Amazon of using the data it gets through third-party sales to \"develop competing products\". On Monday, through its lawyers, Amazon confirmed that CEO Jeff Bezos (the wealthiest person on earth) will make himself available to the house judiciary committee. Amazon is not subject to the dreaded \"Apple app store tax\" because of a deal between the two.</p><p>Tangentially, Sonos found itself in hot water earlier in 2020 and ultimately had to reverse a policy for older Sonos devices to be \"bricked\" by excluding them from updates. Sonos and Google have also been flinging lawsuits at each other for alleged patent infringements with regard to their smart speakers.</p><p>Confused? I don't blame you. In short, this mudfight is beginning to resemble a landslide, with supposed bad behaviour and counteraccusations coming from all corners and players. But the regulators are coming for big tech. Watch this space.</p><p>Thompson Ferreira is a freelance journalist, impactAFRICA fellow, and WanaData member.</p><p>.Spot the culprit: Spotify is among the companies that are taking steps in accordance with competition law over the dominance and practices of behemoths such as Apple.

We do have to watch what the effect of that is on some emerging markets, particularly ones that may have debt-sustainability issues, some that have large dollar debt outstanding. If you're talking about the risks around the system, then we are focused on that.\"</p><p>The warning follows a global stock market rout last week that has left key indices on course for their worst month since the financial crisis.</p><p>Investors have taken fright at a cocktail of factors including signs that trade tensions are fuelling a global economic slowdown, some disappointing earnings from big tech companies and a budget row between Italy and the EU. At the same time, increases in US interest rates have signalled the end of the flood of cheap money that has driven a near decadelong bull market for stocks.</p><p>That fear has buffeted emerging markets for much of the year, but in recent weeks the selling has engulfed developed markets too, despite continuing evidence that the American economy is in rude health. Figures on Friday showed that the world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.5% in the third quarter.</p><p>Wall Street's S&amp;P 500 index tumbled by 3.9% last week while the FTSE 100 lost 2.4% as world markets chalked up five straight weeks of decline - the longest losing streak since 2013. The FTSE is now below the peak it reached at the height of the dotcom bubble in 1999.</p><p>The recent declines mean the global bull market for stocks is already over, some observers argue. Analysts at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch said their preferred gauge of global markets, the MSCI World Equal Weighted Index, was down more than 20% since its January 29 peak - the definition of an equity bear market.</p><p>Bailey, tipped in some quarters to succeed Mark Carney as the governor of the Bank of England, said that Britain's banking system was better equipped to handle shocks than it had been during the 2007-8 financial crisis.</p><p>\"We've got a stress test that encompasses not only a hard Brexit but quite a severe adjustment in the outside world, and in particular this emerging market world,\" Bailey said. \"Obviously you can layer onto that growing trade tensions, which would also be a factor that would come into play.</p><p>\"We've got a much more robustly capitalised banking system than we had last time around, thank goodness, which on our assessment is much more capable of withstanding these sorts of shocks.\"</p><p>Economic Outlook, page 4</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Financial Conduct Authority boss Andrew Bailey sees a world of growing risks</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-143030403</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XS9-CYV1-DYTY-C4KH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"498\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Northern Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 28, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001TWF</classCode><className>MERRILL LYNCH &amp;
