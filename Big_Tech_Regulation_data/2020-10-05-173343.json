They hope to push lawmakers to review acts that have made the blanket spying activities legal.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><br/> Both organizations are less than three weeks old, having sprouted up immediately after the Guardian and the Washington Post reported details of the PRISM spying program based on documents provided by former government <person><nameText>contractor Edward Snowden, </nameText></person>purporting to show extensive access to user data from big tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Apple.</p><p><br/>Exercising The Right To Petition The Government<br/>StopWatching.Us is primarily a petition site that has garnered more than 500,000 signatures from individuals. Businesses and organizations ranging from Reddit to the ACLU have also lent their support. The organization has also sent an open letter to Congress, with support from Mozilla, maker of the Firefox Web browser, demanding that lawmakers review the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and disclose the extent of NSA spying. (Currently, details of the program are classified.)<br/> Restore the Fourth is a nonpartisan group whose aim is to strengthen the protections of the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits \"unreasonable searches and seizures,\" as it pertains to digital\u00a0surveillance. Restore The Fourth is the actual organizer of the Fourth of July protests, with StopWatching.Us joined to further the cause and push Congress to action.\u00a0<br/> As for the specifics of what these groups are\u00a0hoping\u00a0to achieve, it's not simply to spread broad claims asking for ambiguous change. Through StopWatching.Us's letter to Congress, both\u00a0organizations\u00a0have outlined a clear and distinct three-step plan they intend to pursue:\u00a0<br/>1) Enact reform ... to Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, the state secrets privilege, and the FISA Amendments Act to make clear that blanket surveillance of the Internet activity and phone records of any person residing in the U.S. is prohibited by law and that violations can be reviewed in adversarial proceedings before a public court;<br/>2) Create a special committee to investigate, report, and reveal to the public the extent of this domestic spying. This committee should create specific recommendations for legal and regulatory reform to end unconstitutional surveillance;<br/>3)\u00a0Hold accountable those public officials who are found to be responsible for this unconstitutional surveillance. Section 215 of the Patriot Act is what allows the NSA to secretly compel businesses[3]\u00a0like Google and Facebook to hand over their data, and FISA (the Foreign Intelligence\u00a0Surveillance\u00a0Act) is the 1978 piece of legislation, amended in 2008, that established the court system such requests move through.\u00a0<br/>So if fireworks and barbecue just don't seem patriotic enough this year, check here[4] to find a protest near you.\u00a0<br/> Photo by gemstone[5]<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://optin.stopwatching.us\">https://optin.stopwatching.us</url>/ [2]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.restorethefourth.net\">http://www.restorethefourth.net</url>/ [3]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/06/07/nsa_prism_scandal_what_patriot_act_section_215_does.html\">http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/06/07/nsa_prism_scandal_what_patriot_act_section_215_does.html</url> [4]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.restorethefourth.net/protests\">http://www.restorethefourth.net/protests</url>/ [5]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/gemstone/3689236762/\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/gemstone/3689236762/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SAYM10848113727957551441812410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDWR-7023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58T8-9H61-F03R-N2SD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"588\"/><timeReceived>8:09 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ReadWriteWeb</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>July 2, 2013 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Massachusetts senator's proposal would hold firms like Facebook and Twitter criminally and civilly responsible for platforming users who spread lies intended to undermine voter turnout. She also hinted at expanding her efforts to other areas of speech.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  It's an odd position for Warren, whose own claims about her past and identity have caused her endless trouble. But it is a good example of progressives' increasingly authoritarian and anti-free speech instincts.  </p><p>  Her plan, which mainly focuses on Election Day disinformation, would almost surely be unconstitutional. And if it did survive constitutional review, who would be charged with determining what counts as \"disinformation\" in the future? Will there be an army of government fact-checkers sifting through Twitter accounts, or will Warren farm out the task of monitoring billions of daily interactions to our trusted media?  </p><p>  Plus, if the state can criminalize disinformation about elections, what is to stop it from criminalizing \"disinformation\" about candidates or science or public policy - or anything that supposedly undermines the common good?  </p><p>  If, say, a person prone to hyperbole publicly accuses Warren of being a proto-fascist scoundrel, is he \"misleading\" voters? What if an elected official claimed to be Native American but really wasn't? Would she be banned?  </p><p>  How about social-media users who assert once widely accepted scientific statements that have fallen into disfavor - statements such as \"life begins at conception\" or \"there are only two genders\"? What about the rhetoric of \"climate-change deniers\"? One wonders if Warren realizes that her plan is a precedent that authorizes the next Donald Trump to dictate the parameters of acceptable speech online.   </p><p>  Now, perhaps Warren envisions a completely independent government bureaucracy - with maybe an Orwellian name like the Free Speech Protection Bureau - to be charged with meting out daily reminders about acceptable thoughts and words.  </p><p>  However Warren's plan is implemented, though, her purpose is to bully social-media companies into regulating discourse in a manner she and media gatekeepers find acceptable. What tech company is going to host an open forum if it's held liable for every allegedly misleading statement posted by its billions of users around the world?  </p><p>  Warren's effort, like attempts to overturn the First Amendment protections of the Supreme Court decision Citizens United, is based on the view that Americans are too weak-minded to be able to scrutinize information on their own.  </p><p>  \"The stakes of this election are too high,\" Warren said. \"We need to fight the spread of false information that disempowers voters and undermines democracy. I'll do my part - and I'm calling on my fellow candidates and big tech companies to do their part, too.\"  </p><p>  The stakes are no higher in 2020 than they were in 2016 or 1916 or 1816. Physical threats may undermine voting rights, but speech does nothing to limit Americans' movements or actions. Nor can it dictate their beliefs. Those who claim otherwise are the ones selling dangerous disinformation.   </p><p>  Unless the Russians were in possession of a secret brainwashing ray in 2016, they didn't control a single vote in 2016, and Warren has no evidence the Kremlin persuaded a single voter to change his mind.  </p><p>  And even if the Russians did change a few minds, thousands of dishonest foreign Twitter bots are still preferable to a single bureaucrat limiting an American's right to free expression.  </p><p>  In truth, if you aren't prepared to handle participating in the boisterous, churning, ugly and sometimes dishonest squabbles of a free nation, you probably shouldn't be voting anyway. If a random Twitter account can convince you that Election Day is in July rather than in November, maybe you're not prepared for the sacred duty of voting.  </p><p>  Because contra Warren, there is no expectation in our \"democracy\" that voters will be shielded from disinformation. It's the citizen's job, not Congress', to find reliable sources of information.

Six months into the coronavirus era, most, though not all Americans may be willing to continue granting extraordinary powers to the government to deal with a threat to public safety. But the questions that they should also be considering is whether that same deference should be extended to big tech companies to censor discourse about the pandemic and what, if anything, can they do to prevent international monopolies from shutting down free speech.    The latest instance of censorship is so extreme and arbitrary that concern over the willingness of companies like Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter to shut down speech they don\u2019t like ought to transcend the political differences that divide Americans. Or at least it would if the question of what can or cannot be said about the pandemic wasn\u2019t bound up with partisan politics and the presidential election.    Regardless of whether you agree with Dr. Scott Atlas about whether the cost in terms of lives lost and damage down to the country of lockdowns justifies them, Google\u2019s ability to remove him from the virtual public square ought to make reining the power of big tech monopolies a national priority.   Removing All Dissent   YouTube, which is owned by Google, removed a video of an interview with Atlas conducted in June originally posted by the Hoover Institution where he serves as a senior fellow. In it, Atlas, a prominent neuroradiologist and professor at Stanford University Medical Center as well as a commentator on public health issues, spoke of his belief that the pandemic lockdowns might have done more harm than good. Since then, his opinions have become of greater interest due to his appointment in August as a presidential advisor and a member of the White House coronavirus task force.    That fact alone ought to make it vital that the public should be able to hear his opinions about the pandemic. YouTube, however, removed the interview from its video streaming service this past weekend for allegedly violating its terms of service. While the video is no longer available, the Hoover Institution has published a transcript of the interview with Atlas.    The justification for this move is similar to those given for the many other instances of YouTube censorship of videos about the COVID-19 crisis. The company has taken upon itself the obligation, as it sees it, to prevent the spread of conspiracy theories about the pandemic as well as misinformation that might compromise public health.    Both Google and YouTube, it should be remembered, have been severely criticized for standards that have effectively reduced the reach of conservative sources of news and opinion sources including The Federalist.    The company, which has an effective monopoly on the Internet outside of China, has continued to maintain that its decisions are not influenced by politics. It has, however, been open about its willingness to shut down what it considers dangerous conversations about the pandemic. While quiet on the specifics of its algorithm or who ultimately makes these vital decisions, the effort subjects government officials to the same rules that seek to direct viewers to what it considers trusted sources as opposed to those that spread false information or conspiracies.    Such actions might be deemed defensible when applied to videos that promoted actions that would patently endanger the health of viewers, denied the existence of the disease, or promoted conspiracy theories that included traditional memes associated with racial bias or antisemitism. Yet, a video from a widely respected think tank in which Atlas discussed a data-driven analysis of the catastrophic impact of the lockdowns does not fit into any of those easily identified categories that might deserve to be flagged.   Questioning the Unquestionable   Atlas didn\u2019t deny the seriousness of the disease or the need to act to prevent its spread \u2014 he merely questioned the efficacy of broad lockdowns. Atlas pointed out the resulting creation of acute economic distress as well as other unintended consequences that compromised public health such as the decrease in doctor visits or treatments for other potentially fatal conditions as well as the effects of school closings on childhood development as well as upticks of abuse.    By any reasonable standard, the questions he poses as well as the data about the costs of lockdowns that he discussed are not only fair comments but also an important topic of public debate. His conclusions can be questioned. The same is true about his ideas about the wisdom of opening all schools and whether such actions would contribute to another wave of infections. But the idea that any discussion of these issues can be shut down with a single click makes the question of regulating the untrammeled censoring power of a global tech monopoly like Google all the more important.    As Avid Roy, the president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity noted , \u201cScience is about constantly questioning established dogmas, and about having an open debate among people with different takes on the available evidence. To suppress that debate, as YouTube did, is to oppose science.\u201d    Indeed, as Roy points out, as is clear from YouTube\u2019s explanation for the removal of the Atlas video, they now act as de facto information gatekeepers for the WHO.     A number of you have asked for more detail as to what exactly @YouTube wrote to @HooverInst . Here is a screenshot of the email Hoover received. pic.twitter.com/wqhOVaDcG1    \u2014 Avik Roy (@Avik) September 14, 2020    The motivation for this policy is obvious. The left-wing billionaires that own Google and the other major tech companies, as well as their overwhelming left-wing staffs , view any commentary from those questioning the lockdowns as a threat to the prevailing narrative about President Trump\u2019s alleged incompetence in dealing with the pandemic. Questions about the lockdowns or any advocacy for limiting the economic and social misery these policies have created are viewed as somehow helping Trump\u2019s re-election.   Reining in the Big Tech Juggernaut   In recent months, more conservatives have taken up the issue of how to counter the ability of tech giants that control the Internet and social media to act as biased censors of public discourse. Twitter\u2019s willingness to allow its team of left-wing \u201cfact-checkers\u201d to undermine the ability of President Trump to communicate his views to the public about a variety of issues, including the pandemic and the integrity of election results, sparked not only outrage but demands that it be stripped of its immunity from prosecution under an obscure provision of federal law.    According to Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, \u201cno provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\u201d That has allowed Twitter \u2014 as well as Facebook and YouTube \u2014 to be treated as Internet bulletin boards that may not be held legally responsible for the content of the material posted on its sites.    But with Twitter and now YouTube expanding their censorship of content, their continued impunity from the same risks faced by other publishers is no longer viable. A bill proposed by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) which seeks to remove their immunity under Section 230 has gained support on the right, though, at present, its chances of passage are unlikely.    Another related and pertinent question is whether the government will finally act to apply antitrust laws against Google, an entity, that now quite clearly wields unaccountable and unprecedented power over public communications. The attorney generals of all 50 states agree in principle with the Department of Justice that antitrust action is needed to limit its power. Yet Attorney General William Barr, who views this issue as a priority, is reportedly encountering resistance from left-leaning career lawyers inside the DOJ and the Democratic state AGs are similarly slow-walking the effort to prevent any announcement of legal action against the tech giants before the election.    YouTube\u2019s arbitrary censorship of Dr. Atlas ought to be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back concerning its ability to shut down speech about COVID-19 issues. For too long, these companies have used their immense wealth to influence Congress to continue granting them impunity to profit from a dangerous monopoly of the public information highway.    The pandemic has increased their wealth and influence but it also should be the turning point that will lead to long-overdue curbs on their power that has made them a far greater threat to democracy than any politician.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43074913703</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V7-M291-F07F-801N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Hoover</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 14, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

But the ongoing war by giant technology companies against voices that disrupt the establishment's narrative is actually good news in a very important sense. Of course, its victims may not see it that way - at least not yet. And those establishment-controlled companies almost certainly did not intend for it to be good news. But in a key sense, the ongoing effort to ban contrarians from the Internet is evidence that truth-tellers are winning, and the establishment is terrified, particularly with the midterms coming up. The bans and censorship show that globalists now realize their lies cannot compete with truth even in a rigged marketplace of ideas replete with \"shadow-banning,\" promoting establishment voices, and more - much less in a true free market of ideas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In other good news, Big Tech's war on free speech appears to be backfiring in a major way, too. But obviously, this is only the beginning.</p><p>The driving factor behind the escalating censorship occurring across social media appears to be the disruption to the establishment's propaganda efforts and its narratives. For instance, consider that of America's top 100 newspapers, just two endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Virtually every major media outlet in America spent endless hours demonizing Trump as a racist, a hater, a sexist, a kook, a conspiracy theorist, a white supremacist, an anti-Semite, and all the other nasty terms they could hurl at him. One study found that more than 90 percent of the coverage of Trump on the big-three broadcast nightly newscasts - CBS, ABC, and NBC - was negative. The establishment media seemed sure their strategy would work, too. The New York Times gave Hillary Clinton an 85-percent chance of winning. The Huffington Post gave her a 98-percent chance of winning the presidency. Newsweek even sent out 125,000 copies of its magazine with \"Madam President\" on the cover.</p><p>But Trump won. Actually, he won a landslide victory in the Electoral College. And ironically, one of the many positions that endeared him to Americans was his willingness to ridicule and expose the dishonest press. Polls in 2016 showed that Americans had largely woken up to the fact that the establishment media was not just biased, but blatantly dishonest. According to a Gallup survey released a couple months before the election, just 14 percent of GOP voters expressed trust in the \"mainstream\" media. Less than a third of Americans more broadly reported having even a \"fair\" amount of trust in the press, the lowest level since Gallup started its surveys on the question in 1972. In short, the credibility of the media was destroyed, and even all of the establishment's propagandists combined could no longer determine the outcome of a presidential election.</p><p>Obviously, the globalist Deep State that dominates the major media was not pleased. Neither were the activists and puppets posing as \"journalists.\" And so a new narrative was bom: Trump won only because dumb, racist Americans were influenced by \"fake news\" and Russian disinformation, much of it spread on social media. Clearly, a solution to this needed to be found. And so, among other tactics, the globalist-controlled Internet giants, most of which have been in bed with government from the start, began stepping up their efforts to control the narrative. Those schemes included hiding alternative voices via \"shadow-banning,\" promoting establishment voices via manipulated algorithms, and eventually, outright banning those who question the establishment's narrative too vigorously or successfully.</p><p>Those efforts to silence dissent are now accelerating. As early as March, CNN began openly behaving more like an activist group than a media organization, blatantly pressuring advertisers to stop allowing their ads to appear on Infowars content. Later, they began lobbying social-media companies to take down one of their most significant competitors, something more than a few voices have described as a \"conspiracy in restraint of trade.\" Behind the scenes, the establishment was panicking, and working overtime to silence its key critics, lest more millions of Americans wake up.</p><p>In June of 2018, many of the titans of the Internet and the establishment media - along with heads of government, leaders of the \"intelligence\" community, royalty, globalist think-tank bosses, top international bureaucrats, agents for the Rothschild banking dynasty, and more - came together behind closed doors and militarized security in Italy at the annual Bilderberg summit to discuss the issue further. The chiefs of Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedln, and Amazon, among others, regularly attend these secretive meetings with fellow globalists. This year, one of the key items on the agenda released to the public was something described as the \"post-truth\" world. Basically, Bilderberg bigwigs were distraught by their collapsing ability to mislead the masses, which could ruin all of their plans as humanity increasingly tunes out their propaganda.</p><p>\"Post-truth\" was selected by Oxford English Dictionary as the \"word of the year\" for 2016. It was defined as \"relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\" In essence, Deep State globalists, outraged that Americans no longer believe their propaganda organs, decided to unleash the lie that people no longer value objective facts, as defined by their propaganda organs. In reality, though, Americans and people around the world were still very interested in facts and truth - they simply realized that the establishment media was not going to provide much. And so, on social media, citizens turned to sources that were offering truth - or at least more truth than they were getting from the Deep State's propaganda machine. The 2016 election, in short, was a major wake-up call to the globalists.</p><p>The Purge</p><p>In response to the death of their credibility, the Big Tech giants launched an ongoing purge of alternative voices from the Internet. That has now culminated in the mass ban of everything Alex Jones from virtually every platform. In early August, after months of threatening to do it. the purge began. Under the guise of enforcing rules against \"hate speech,\" in just one day, Apple, YouTube, and Facebook all removed Jones' content - content that included an exclusive interview with Donald Trump that almost certainly played a role in the president's victory. Other firms quickly piled on, with lesser-known companies such as Spotify, Stitcher, Linkedln, Pinterest, MailChimp, Vimeo, and more joining the frenzy to send Jones and all the content he ever produced down George Orwell's infamous \"memory hole.\" Even Disqus, which provided the comments section for Infowars, banned the site. Not a single one of the companies explained what specific content had allegedly violated their rules. Most cited vague allegations of \"hate speech\" or even \"encouraging violence,\" without providing examples. The establishment media provided cover for the operation by endlessly claiming that Jones had referred to the Sandy Hook shooting as a \"hoax,\" something Jones has repeatedly apologized for - and is hardly hateful.</p><p>Overnight, Jones and his media empire became the most censored media outlet in the world. In an instant, with the click of a button, YouTube - a behemoth owned by Google's parent company Alphabet - removed Infowars videos that, combined, had been viewed billions of times. Jones also lost access to his nearly 2.5 million subscribers. The numbers tell an incredible story. Despite a relatively tiny budget, Jones was a superstar on the YouTube scene. For perspective, Jones' 2.5 million subscribers was about a million more than Fox News, the leading cable news station, had managed to amass. It was almost 2 million more than legacy networks CBS News or NBC News had attracted so far. The Washington Post had fewer than 400,000 subscribers a week after the purge of Jones began, while the New York Times had fewer than 1.5 million. Only CNN, which reportedly has been buying huge numbers of fake followers on social media, had more subscribers than Infowars.</p><p>During the election, though, the reason for the establishment's panic became clear. On an average day during election month - November of 2016 - Infowars was receiving 2.75 million views just on its YouTube channel, according to an analysis of the viewership numbers by the Next News Network. That figure does not account for the massive radio and website audience that helps Infowars reach many millions more around the world. Throughout election month in November, Infowars received more than 82 million views on YouTube alone. By contrast, Fox News' YouTube channel received fewer than 2 million views on an average November day, totaling around 60 million for the month - significantly fewer than Infowars. CNN received less than a million per day - or 30 million for the month - on average. MSNBC received fewer than 750,000 average daily views during election month.</p><p>In short, with a tiny fraction of the budget available to the establishment's propaganda organs, Alex Jones and his Infowars operation weie i caching more people just on YouTube than many of the nation's leading establishment propaganda organs - combined. He also dominated at other social-media services, with millions of followers on Facebook and beyond. Obviously, Jones' competitors at the legacy media were outraged: How could this \"fringe radical extremist kook rightwing conspiracy theorist\" be leaving them in the dust? As of early August, they no longer had to worry about the competition, with Jones having been \"de-platformed\" almost everywhere - or so they thought. More on the backlash later.</p><p>Perhaps nothing illustrates the establishment media's obsession with Alex Jones better than the social-media pages of CNN senior media reporter Oliver Darcy and his sidekick Paul Murphy. Reading their Twitter feeds, it feels like one has entered an alternative universe. For months, the dynamic CNN duo hounded advertisers and social-media companies about Jones and Infowars. They also gave constant updates on their progress. On August 14, for instance, after spending weeks lobbying to have Jones and Infowars removed from social media, Darcy had breaking news to report. \"Twitter spox confirms to me that the company has limited key functions on Alex Jones' account after determining he violated another one of network's policies,\" Darcy reported in one of countless similar moment-by-moment updates in CNN's war on Infowars. \"He can still browse Twitter, but can't tweet, retweet, etc. for 7 days. Jones also required to delete offending tweet.\" Less than a day later, another breaking update. \"Twitter spox confirms to me that Twitter has suspended most functions on the InfoWars account for 7 days for posting [the] same video they took action against on Alex Jones,\" Darcy gushed.</p><p>In between those two tweets, the CNN reporter expressed frustration that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had suggested that putting Jones in \"timeout\" might change his behavior. \"Uhhh,\" wrote the \"senior media reporter.\" Shortly after that, Darcy was at it again, chastising the company for \"only\" giving Jones a seven-day suspension despite alleged \"multiple rule violations.\"</p><p>Indeed, of all the major social-media networks, only Twitter resisted the CNN lobbying and the hateful mobs demanding Jones be censored. But then, even Twitter partially caved, giving Jones a \"suspension\" in mid-August. In an interview with The Hill, CEO Dorsey said the \"timeout\" was meant to \"guide people back towards healthier behaviors and healthier public conversation.\" In other words, the CEO of Twitter wants to use behaviormodification techniques to change its users and make them \"healthy.\" If the behavior modification does not work on Jones, he will no longer be welcome on Twitter. To his credit, Dorsey admitted afterward that Twitter leans left, quite an understatement, but important nonetheless.</p><p>Of course, Jones was not the only high-profile media star to be purged from socialmedia. Another heavyweight who was silenced was Gavin Mclnnes, a pundit with CRTV, along with his group \"Proud Boys,\" which protects conservative speakers from violent fascists styling themselves \"Anti-Fascists\" or Antifa. According to Twitter, which took down his accounts, it was to enforce a prohibition on \"violent extremist groups.\" Also, black conservative Candace Owens with Turning Point USA was censored on Twitter for sending out the exact same tweets as the New York Times ' newest editorial board member-a racist, sexist hatemonger who said being cruel to elderly white men gives her joy. The difference: Owens replaced the word \"white\" with \"Jew\" or \"black\" - and she didn't mean to be offensive; she was simply making a political point about the hypocrisy of the New York Times. Other personalities to face socialmedia censorship include Ron Paul Institute leader Daniel McAdams, Antiwar, corn's Scott Horton, former State Department staffer Peter Van Buren, former Breitbart editor and \"conservative\" homosexual Milo Yiannopoulos, and countless lesser-known names. Twitter was even exposed \"shadow-banning\" prominent Republican congressmen. And a Twitter engineer was caught on camera admitting to an undercover Project Veritas reporter that the platform's algorithms supposedly aimed at stopping \"bots\" are actually used to target Republicans.</p><p>Facebook has been just as bad, if not worse, in targeting voices far beyond Infowars. Websites such as CodelsFreeSpeech.com, which defends the right to distribute computer code that can be used to print 3D firearms, are banned completely. A GOP candidate for Congress had her ad banned because she mentioned the Communist Cambodian genocide, which her family survived. Even the Bible is unwelcome on Facebook. Amid blatant manipulation of its algorithms to clobber traffic levels of conservative and Christian voices, the site has literally been banning people for expressing biblical views. Prominent Brazilian evangelist Julio Severo, for instance, was put in Facebook \"jail\" for posting a Bible verse (Leviticus 18:22) about homosexuality - and nothing else. It was dubbed \"hate speech\" by the giant company, until the resulting scandal forced it to back down. In late 2017, Severo was again penalized by Facebook, this time for saying it was a Christian's duty to love homosexuals and all other sinners. Apparently even implying that homosexuality is a sin - the Bible, the Torah, and the Koran all state that explicitly - is enough to have Facebook \"discipline\" a person like a misbehaving elementary-school child. In other words, the religious beliefs of Christians, Jews, Muslims, and countless others are all considered \"hate speech\" by Facebook. Severo was previously targeted by PayPal, which continues to deny him service based on his religious beliefs.</p><p>Google and YouTube, both owned by Alphabet, have for years been manipulating what people see by designing algorithms that suppress voices they disagree with and promote voices they think should be promoted. It has been getting worse and worse. Prager University, an online creator of mainstream educational videos, is one of countless prominent voices that has been all but crushed by YouTube, which is now restricting its content. \"We are opening the eyes and the minds of the next generation, one five-minute video at a time ... and the left doesn't like it,\" PragerU founder Dennis Prager said in a recent e-mail about the lawsuit they filed against the video site. \"Silicon Valley giants like YouTube continue to censor the ideas they don't agree with. They promote their Leftist ideology and restrict conservative speech.\" Over 500,000 people have signed a petition supporting PragerU. On Facebook, changes by the site eliminated 99.9999 percent of PragerU's reach. Only after the censorship became a national scandal did Facebook back down and apologize.</p><p>The censorship is so out of control that even YouTube creators who simply talked about Alex Jones got penalized. Comically, the popular H3 podcast was taken down while it was defending YouTube's decision to censor Jones. Apparently the name Alex Jones in the title triggered some sort of automatic censorship program that caused the broadcast to be taken down and the channel to receive a penalty.</p><p>Even when it isn't actively censoring things, YouTube is now increasingly trying to sway public opinion. For instance, on videos dealing with \"climate change,\" the social-media giant owned by Google's parent company now adds disclaimers aimed at building up support for the increasingly discredited man-made globalwarming hypothesis.</p><p>Establishment leftists funded by billionaire globalist George Soros developed a complex plan to target conservatives online. In a leaked 2017 document called \"Democracy Matters: A Strategic Plan for Action,\" far-left Democrat operative David Brock of Media Matters outlined the goals and the strategy. \"In the next four years, Media Matters will continue its core mission of disarming right-wing misinformation, while leading the fight against the next generation of conservative information: The proliferation of fake news and propaganda now threatening the country's information ecosystem,\" explains the memo, with \"fake news\" defined as anything that contradicts the establishment's narrative. Among the goals is ensuring the \"defeat [of] Trump either through impeachment or at the ballot box in 2020.\" And to do so, the group boasts of working with social-media giants and Google to limit conservative voices while boosting the reach of voices they support.</p><p>As an illustration of just how far the tech giants can and will go to purge dissidents from the World Wide Web, an astounding case from fall of 2017 offers a troubling picture. Basically, when an obscure racist made fun of a victim of what was reported to be a racist attack, he was completely disappeared from the Internet, with his hosting company taking down his website entirely. Virtually nobody defended the speech itself, but even the CEO of one of the companies that disappeared the Nazi \"Daily Stormer\" site in question expressed concerns. \"Literally, I woke up in a bad mood and decided someone shouldn't be allowed on the Internet,\" the CEO of Cloudflare was quoted as saying in an email to employees. \"No one should have that power.\" And just as countless analysts and pundits predicted, it did not take long for the purge to spread and accelerate.</p><p>For those who, despite all the evidence, still wonder whether the purge is political, a brief survey of all the anti-Christian bigotry and the open calls for violence against conservatives plastered all over social media should suffice. Indeed, as if to prove how radically left-wing the Internet companies' views are, many of them have openly partnered with the far-left Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). Founded by Morris Dees, who was accused in court documents of sexually molesting his stepdaughter, the radical group has become a bad joke even to mainstream left-wing activists. Just in recent years, it has smeared a prominent Muslim as a top \"anti-Muslim extremist,\" a Cherokee Indian married to one of Sacajawea's descendants as the \"matriarch\" of the \"anti-Indian movement,\" and a prominent black law professor as a supporter of white supremacy. Even the mild-mannered Ben Carson was deemed an \"extremist\" by the SPLC for supporting marriage.</p><p>By contrast, the group had nothing but glowing praise for communist terrorist Bill Ayers, whose murderous terror group, working with Castro's intelligence services, murdered American police, bombed the Capitol and the State Department, and made plans to re-educate and exterminate millions of Americans with help from foreign communist dictators. Leading U.S. Christian groups such as the American Family Association have labeled the SPLC an \"anti-Christian hate group.\" Left-wing activists have denounced it as a moneymaking scam. And yet, virtually all of the tech giants have jumped in bed with the radical group, alienating millions of Christians and conservatives in the process.</p><p>Calls for More Purges</p><p>But of course, alienating those who care about honesty and free speech is OK with liberal powerbrokers - both those liberals on the Internet and those in government - because the end game is to so marginalize conservatives that they will be afraid to speak up lest they feel leftist wrath. The totalitarians are desperate to regain control of the narrative and have no intention of allowing Jones and others to continue reaching the masses - much less reaching them with essential information that undermines the establishment's propaganda talking points and agenda. And some of the most virulent would-be totalitarians in government have already dropped the mask.</p><p>Consider Senator Chris Murphy (DConn.), who has an atrocious 14-percent cumulative score for voting constitutionally on The New American magazine's Freedom Index. Shortly after Infowars was taken down, Murphy made clear that this is just the beginning. \"Infowars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart,\" he fumed on social media, perhaps oblivious to the irony of using social media to tear America apart while complaining about the same. \"These companies must do more than take down one website. The survival of our democracy depends on it.\" Setting aside the fact that Murphy apparently does not even know what form of government America's Founders created - a republic - the threat was unmistakable: Censor more voices or face the wrath of lawmakers and establishment globalists. He did not cite any examples of \"hate\" or \"lies\" spread by Infowars.</p><p>Another U.S. senator, Democrat Mark Warner of Virginia (Freedom Index score: 11), went even further, brazenly proposing a government takeover of the Internet. In a leaked proposal widely blasted by critics as a plan for a \"fascist takeover\" of the Internet, Warner called for new rules for social-media companies that would force them to take down \"fake news\" and other content. The scheme, entitled \"Potential Policy Proposals for Regulation of Social Media and Technology Firms,\" would also provide federal funding to \"media literacy programs\" that would supposedly help consumers sort through information online and help them determine what is true and what is not. The scheme seeks \"more disclosure requirements for online political speech,\" too.</p><p>Under the guise of stopping \"Russia,\" the plan would also end online anonymity, demanding that social-media platforms \"authenticate and disclose the geographic origin of all user accounts or posts.\" Basically, \"mandatory identity verification,\" a gambit that was earlier pursued by Obama, would force everyone to provide proof of their identity to social-media giants. Of course, the Founding Fathers often published anonymously - see the Federalist Papers. And still today, journalists, whistleblowers, and people with unpopular political opinions regularly rely on anonymity to be able to function online. Ironically, all of the scheming is said to be needed to protect trust in \"our institutions, democracv. free press, and markets.\" _</p><p>\"The size and reach of these platforms demand that we ensure proper oversight, transparency and effective management of technologies that in large measure undergird our social lives, our economy, and our politics,\" the policy paper argues. \"The hope is that the ideas enclosed here stir the pot and spark a wider discussion - among policymakers, stakeholders, and civil society groups - on the appropriate trajectory of technology policy in the coming years.\" Basically, the plan seems to be to put Bigger Brother government in charge of Big Brother technology companies to finish demolishing Internet freedom. Of course, many of the companies - Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and others - are already in bed with government. Some analysts suggested the massive, coordinated assault on Infowars may have been sparked by word of Warner's proposals.</p><p>Even if the government does not overtly take over, though, the jihad against free speech and content that exposes the establishment's lies will continue to become mor\u0119 brazen and more sophisticated. Microsoft, for instance, threatened to shut down an entire social network, Twitter alternative Gab.ai, because one user posted anti-Semitic comments. And Mozilla, an organization that once defended online freedom but fell to the left and even chased out its leader for supporting heterosexual marriage, has now teamed up with a George Soros-funded \"fact-checking\" service to develop the \"Mozilla Information Trust Initiative.\" Google has also started adding far-left \"fact check\" results that are notorious sources of disinformation, including the discredited Snopes.com. And Twitter CEO Dorsey proposed creating new rules for Twitter based on the UN \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\" which explicitly states that rights and freedoms may not be used contrary to the purposes and principles of the UN.</p><p>The battle to disseminate truth to the masses has been raging for centuries. But with the stakes now higher than ever, Americans must redouble their efforts. *</p><p>The bans and censorship show that globalists now realize their lies cannot compete with truth even in a rigged marketplace of ideas replete with \"shadowbanning,\" promoting establishment voices, and more - much less in a true free market of ideas.</p><p>Consider that of America's top l OO newspapers-just two endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Virtually every major media outlet in America spent endless hours demonizing Trump as a racist, a hater, a sexist, a kook, a conspiracy theorist, etc.</p><p>Schemes included hiding alternative voices via \"shadow-banning,\" promoting establishment voices via manipulated algorithms, and eventually, outright banning of those who question the establishment's narrative too vigorously or successfully.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2113739906</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS4-XGG1-JBHT-D3D9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4376\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New American Sep 17, 2018</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol. 34</volume><issueNumber>No. 18</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 17, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

But the ongoing war by giant technology companies against voices that disrupt the establishment's narrative is actually good news in a very important sense. Of course, its victims may not see it that way - at least not yet. And those establishment-controlled companies almost certainly did not intend for it to be good news. But in a key sense, the ongoing effort to ban contrarians from the Internet is evidence that truth-tellers are winning, and the establishment is terrified, particularly with the midterms coming up. The bans and censorship show that globalists now realize their lies cannot compete with truth even in a rigged marketplace of ideas replete with \"shadow-banning,\" promoting establishment voices, and more - much less in a true free market of ideas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In other good news, Big Tech's war on free speech appears to be backfiring in a major way, too. But obviously, this is only the beginning.</p><p>The driving factor behind the escalating censorship occurring across social media appears to be the disruption to the establishment's propaganda efforts and its narratives. For instance, consider that of America's top 100 newspapers, just two endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Virtually every major media outlet in America spent endless hours demonizing Trump as a racist, a hater, a sexist, a kook, a conspiracy theorist, a white supremacist, an anti-Semite, and all the other nasty terms they could hurl at him. One study found that more than 90 percent of the coverage of Trump on the big-three broadcast nightly newscasts - CBS, ABC, and NBC - was negative. The establishment media seemed sure their strategy would work, too. The New York Times gave Hillary Clinton an 85-percent chance of winning. The Huffington Post gave her a 98-percent chance of winning the presidency. Newsweek even sent out 125,000 copies of its magazine with \"Madam President\" on the cover.</p><p>But Trump won. Actually, he won a landslide victory in the Electoral College. And ironically, one of the many positions that endeared him to Americans was his willingness to ridicule and expose the dishonest press. Polls in 2016 showed that Americans had largely woken up to the fact that the establishment media was not just biased, but blatantly dishonest. According to a Gallup survey released a couple months before the election, just 14 percent of GOP voters expressed trust in the \"mainstream\" media. Less than a third of Americans more broadly reported having even a \"fair\" amount of trust in the press, the lowest level since Gallup started its surveys on the question in 1972. In short, the credibility of the media was destroyed, and even all of the establishment's propagandists combined could no longer determine the outcome of a presidential election.</p><p>Obviously, the globalist Deep State that dominates the major media was not pleased. Neither were the activists and puppets posing as \"journalists.\" And so a new narrative was bom: Trump won only because dumb, racist Americans were influenced by \"fake news\" and Russian disinformation, much of it spread on social media. Clearly, a solution to this needed to be found. And so, among other tactics, the globalist-controlled Internet giants, most of which have been in bed with government from the start, began stepping up their efforts to control the narrative. Those schemes included hiding alternative voices via \"shadow-banning,\" promoting establishment voices via manipulated algorithms, and eventually, outright banning those who question the establishment's narrative too vigorously or successfully.</p><p>Those efforts to silence dissent are now accelerating. As early as March, CNN began openly behaving more like an activist group than a media organization, blatantly pressuring advertisers to stop allowing their ads to appear on Infowars content. Later, they began lobbying social-media companies to take down one of their most significant competitors, something more than a few voices have described as a \"conspiracy in restraint of trade.\" Behind the scenes, the establishment was panicking, and working overtime to silence its key critics, lest more millions of Americans wake up.</p><p>In June of 2018, many of the titans of the Internet and the establishment media - along with heads of government, leaders of the \"intelligence\" community, royalty, globalist think-tank bosses, top international bureaucrats, agents for the Rothschild banking dynasty, and more - came together behind closed doors and militarized security in Italy at the annual Bilderberg summit to discuss the issue further. The chiefs of Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedln, and Amazon, among others, regularly attend these secretive meetings with fellow globalists. This year, one of the key items on the agenda released to the public was something described as the \"post-truth\" world. Basically, Bilderberg bigwigs were distraught by their collapsing ability to mislead the masses, which could ruin all of their plans as humanity increasingly tunes out their propaganda.</p><p>\"Post-truth\" was selected by Oxford English Dictionary as the \"word of the year\" for 2016. It was defined as \"relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\" In essence, Deep State globalists, outraged that Americans no longer believe their propaganda organs, decided to unleash the lie that people no longer value objective facts, as defined by their propaganda organs. In reality, though, Americans and people around the world were still very interested in facts and truth - they simply realized that the establishment media was not going to provide much. And so, on social media, citizens turned to sources that were offering truth - or at least more truth than they were getting from the Deep State's propaganda machine. The 2016 election, in short, was a major wake-up call to the globalists.</p><p>The Purge</p><p>In response to the death of their credibility, the Big Tech giants launched an ongoing purge of alternative voices from the Internet. That has now culminated in the mass ban of everything Alex Jones from virtually every platform. In early August, after months of threatening to do it. the purge began. Under the guise of enforcing rules against \"hate speech,\" in just one day, Apple, YouTube, and Facebook all removed Jones' content - content that included an exclusive interview with Donald Trump that almost certainly played a role in the president's victory. Other firms quickly piled on, with lesser-known companies such as Spotify, Stitcher, Linkedln, Pinterest, MailChimp, Vimeo, and more joining the frenzy to send Jones and all the content he ever produced down George Orwell's infamous \"memory hole.\" Even Disqus, which provided the comments section for Infowars, banned the site. Not a single one of the companies explained what specific content had allegedly violated their rules. Most cited vague allegations of \"hate speech\" or even \"encouraging violence,\" without providing examples. The establishment media provided cover for the operation by endlessly claiming that Jones had referred to the Sandy Hook shooting as a \"hoax,\" something Jones has repeatedly apologized for - and is hardly hateful.</p><p>Overnight, Jones and his media empire became the most censored media outlet in the world. In an instant, with the click of a button, YouTube - a behemoth owned by Google's parent company Alphabet - removed Infowars videos that, combined, had been viewed billions of times. Jones also lost access to his nearly 2.5 million subscribers. The numbers tell an incredible story. Despite a relatively tiny budget, Jones was a superstar on the YouTube scene. For perspective, Jones' 2.5 million subscribers was about a million more than Fox News, the leading cable news station, had managed to amass. It was almost 2 million more than legacy networks CBS News or NBC News had attracted so far. The Washington Post had fewer than 400,000 subscribers a week after the purge of Jones began, while the New York Times had fewer than 1.5 million. Only CNN, which reportedly has been buying huge numbers of fake followers on social media, had more subscribers than Infowars.</p><p>During the election, though, the reason for the establishment's panic became clear. On an average day during election month - November of 2016 - Infowars was receiving 2.75 million views just on its YouTube channel, according to an analysis of the viewership numbers by the Next News Network. That figure does not account for the massive radio and website audience that helps Infowars reach many millions more around the world. Throughout election month in November, Infowars received more than 82 million views on YouTube alone. By contrast, Fox News' YouTube channel received fewer than 2 million views on an average November day, totaling around 60 million for the month - significantly fewer than Infowars. CNN received less than a million per day - or 30 million for the month - on average. MSNBC received fewer than 750,000 average daily views during election month.</p><p>In short, with a tiny fraction of the budget available to the establishment's propaganda organs, Alex Jones and his Infowars operation weie i caching more people just on YouTube than many of the nation's leading establishment propaganda organs - combined. He also dominated at other social-media services, with millions of followers on Facebook and beyond. Obviously, Jones' competitors at the legacy media were outraged: How could this \"fringe radical extremist kook rightwing conspiracy theorist\" be leaving them in the dust? As of early August, they no longer had to worry about the competition, with Jones having been \"de-platformed\" almost everywhere - or so they thought. More on the backlash later.</p><p>Perhaps nothing illustrates the establishment media's obsession with Alex Jones better than the social-media pages of CNN senior media reporter Oliver Darcy and his sidekick Paul Murphy. Reading their Twitter feeds, it feels like one has entered an alternative universe. For months, the dynamic CNN duo hounded advertisers and social-media companies about Jones and Infowars. They also gave constant updates on their progress. On August 14, for instance, after spending weeks lobbying to have Jones and Infowars removed from social media, Darcy had breaking news to report. \"Twitter spox confirms to me that the company has limited key functions on Alex Jones' account after determining he violated another one of network's policies,\" Darcy reported in one of countless similar moment-by-moment updates in CNN's war on Infowars. \"He can still browse Twitter, but can't tweet, retweet, etc. for 7 days. Jones also required to delete offending tweet.\" Less than a day later, another breaking update. \"Twitter spox confirms to me that Twitter has suspended most functions on the InfoWars account for 7 days for posting [the] same video they took action against on Alex Jones,\" Darcy gushed.</p><p>In between those two tweets, the CNN reporter expressed frustration that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had suggested that putting Jones in \"timeout\" might change his behavior. \"Uhhh,\" wrote the \"senior media reporter.\" Shortly after that, Darcy was at it again, chastising the company for \"only\" giving Jones a seven-day suspension despite alleged \"multiple rule violations.\"</p><p>Indeed, of all the major social-media networks, only Twitter resisted the CNN lobbying and the hateful mobs demanding Jones be censored. But then, even Twitter partially caved, giving Jones a \"suspension\" in mid-August. In an interview with The Hill, CEO Dorsey said the \"timeout\" was meant to \"guide people back towards healthier behaviors and healthier public conversation.\" In other words, the CEO of Twitter wants to use behaviormodification techniques to change its users and make them \"healthy.\" If the behavior modification does not work on Jones, he will no longer be welcome on Twitter. To his credit, Dorsey admitted afterward that Twitter leans left, quite an understatement, but important nonetheless.</p><p>Of course, Jones was not the only high-profile media star to be purged from socialmedia. Another heavyweight who was silenced was Gavin Mclnnes, a pundit with CRTV, along with his group \"Proud Boys,\" which protects conservative speakers from violent fascists styling themselves \"Anti-Fascists\" or Antifa. According to Twitter, which took down his accounts, it was to enforce a prohibition on \"violent extremist groups.\" Also, black conservative Candace Owens with Turning Point USA was censored on Twitter for sending out the exact same tweets as the New York Times ' newest editorial board member-a racist, sexist hatemonger who said being cruel to elderly white men gives her joy. The difference: Owens replaced the word \"white\" with \"Jew\" or \"black\" - and she didn't mean to be offensive; she was simply making a political point about the hypocrisy of the New York Times. Other personalities to face socialmedia censorship include Ron Paul Institute leader Daniel McAdams, Antiwar, corn's Scott Horton, former State Department staffer Peter Van Buren, former Breitbart editor and \"conservative\" homosexual Milo Yiannopoulos, and countless lesser-known names. Twitter was even exposed \"shadow-banning\" prominent Republican congressmen. And a Twitter engineer was caught on camera admitting to an undercover Project Veritas reporter that the platform's algorithms supposedly aimed at stopping \"bots\" are actually used to target Republicans.</p><p>Facebook has been just as bad, if not worse, in targeting voices far beyond Infowars. Websites such as CodelsFreeSpeech.com, which defends the right to distribute computer code that can be used to print 3D firearms, are banned completely. A GOP candidate for Congress had her ad banned because she mentioned the Communist Cambodian genocide, which her family survived. Even the Bible is unwelcome on Facebook. Amid blatant manipulation of its algorithms to clobber traffic levels of conservative and Christian voices, the site has literally been banning people for expressing biblical views. Prominent Brazilian evangelist Julio Severo, for instance, was put in Facebook \"jail\" for posting a Bible verse (Leviticus 18:22) about homosexuality - and nothing else. It was dubbed \"hate speech\" by the giant company, until the resulting scandal forced it to back down. In late 2017, Severo was again penalized by Facebook, this time for saying it was a Christian's duty to love homosexuals and all other sinners. Apparently even implying that homosexuality is a sin - the Bible, the Torah, and the Koran all state that explicitly - is enough to have Facebook \"discipline\" a person like a misbehaving elementary-school child. In other words, the religious beliefs of Christians, Jews, Muslims, and countless others are all considered \"hate speech\" by Facebook. Severo was previously targeted by PayPal, which continues to deny him service based on his religious beliefs.</p><p>Google and YouTube, both owned by Alphabet, have for years been manipulating what people see by designing algorithms that suppress voices they disagree with and promote voices they think should be promoted. It has been getting worse and worse. Prager University, an online creator of mainstream educational videos, is one of countless prominent voices that has been all but crushed by YouTube, which is now restricting its content. \"We are opening the eyes and the minds of the next generation, one five-minute video at a time ... and the left doesn't like it,\" PragerU founder Dennis Prager said in a recent e-mail about the lawsuit they filed against the video site. \"Silicon Valley giants like YouTube continue to censor the ideas they don't agree with. They promote their Leftist ideology and restrict conservative speech.\" Over 500,000 people have signed a petition supporting PragerU. On Facebook, changes by the site eliminated 99.9999 percent of PragerU's reach. Only after the censorship became a national scandal did Facebook back down and apologize.</p><p>The censorship is so out of control that even YouTube creators who simply talked about Alex Jones got penalized. Comically, the popular H3 podcast was taken down while it was defending YouTube's decision to censor Jones. Apparently the name Alex Jones in the title triggered some sort of automatic censorship program that caused the broadcast to be taken down and the channel to receive a penalty.</p><p>Even when it isn't actively censoring things, YouTube is now increasingly trying to sway public opinion. For instance, on videos dealing with \"climate change,\" the social-media giant owned by Google's parent company now adds disclaimers aimed at building up support for the increasingly discredited man-made globalwarming hypothesis.</p><p>Establishment leftists funded by billionaire globalist George Soros developed a complex plan to target conservatives online. In a leaked 2017 document called \"Democracy Matters: A Strategic Plan for Action,\" far-left Democrat operative David Brock of Media Matters outlined the goals and the strategy. \"In the next four years, Media Matters will continue its core mission of disarming right-wing misinformation, while leading the fight against the next generation of conservative information: The proliferation of fake news and propaganda now threatening the country's information ecosystem,\" explains the memo, with \"fake news\" defined as anything that contradicts the establishment's narrative. Among the goals is ensuring the \"defeat [of] Trump either through impeachment or at the ballot box in 2020.\" And to do so, the group boasts of working with social-media giants and Google to limit conservative voices while boosting the reach of voices they support.</p><p>As an illustration of just how far the tech giants can and will go to purge dissidents from the World Wide Web, an astounding case from fall of 2017 offers a troubling picture. Basically, when an obscure racist made fun of a victim of what was reported to be a racist attack, he was completely disappeared from the Internet, with his hosting company taking down his website entirely. Virtually nobody defended the speech itself, but even the CEO of one of the companies that disappeared the Nazi \"Daily Stormer\" site in question expressed concerns. \"Literally, I woke up in a bad mood and decided someone shouldn't be allowed on the Internet,\" the CEO of Cloudflare was quoted as saying in an email to employees. \"No one should have that power.\" And just as countless analysts and pundits predicted, it did not take long for the purge to spread and accelerate.</p><p>For those who, despite all the evidence, still wonder whether the purge is political, a brief survey of all the anti-Christian bigotry and the open calls for violence against conservatives plastered all over social media should suffice. Indeed, as if to prove how radically left-wing the Internet companies' views are, many of them have openly partnered with the far-left Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). Founded by Morris Dees, who was accused in court documents of sexually molesting his stepdaughter, the radical group has become a bad joke even to mainstream left-wing activists. Just in recent years, it has smeared a prominent Muslim as a top \"anti-Muslim extremist,\" a Cherokee Indian married to one of Sacajawea's descendants as the \"matriarch\" of the \"anti-Indian movement,\" and a prominent black law professor as a supporter of white supremacy. Even the mild-mannered Ben Carson was deemed an \"extremist\" by the SPLC for supporting marriage.</p><p>By contrast, the group had nothing but glowing praise for communist terrorist Bill Ayers, whose murderous terror group, working with Castro's intelligence services, murdered American police, bombed the Capitol and the State Department, and made plans to re-educate and exterminate millions of Americans with help from foreign communist dictators. Leading U.S. Christian groups such as the American Family Association have labeled the SPLC an \"anti-Christian hate group.\" Left-wing activists have denounced it as a moneymaking scam. And yet, virtually all of the tech giants have jumped in bed with the radical group, alienating millions of Christians and conservatives in the process.</p><p>Calls for More Purges</p><p>But of course, alienating those who care about honesty and free speech is OK with liberal powerbrokers - both those liberals on the Internet and those in government - because the end game is to so marginalize conservatives that they will be afraid to speak up lest they feel leftist wrath. The totalitarians are desperate to regain control of the narrative and have no intention of allowing Jones and others to continue reaching the masses - much less reaching them with essential information that undermines the establishment's propaganda talking points and agenda. And some of the most virulent would-be totalitarians in government have already dropped the mask.</p><p>Consider Senator Chris Murphy (DConn.), who has an atrocious 14-percent cumulative score for voting constitutionally on The New American magazine's Freedom Index. Shortly after Infowars was taken down, Murphy made clear that this is just the beginning. \"Infowars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart,\" he fumed on social media, perhaps oblivious to the irony of using social media to tear America apart while complaining about the same. \"These companies must do more than take down one website. The survival of our democracy depends on it.\" Setting aside the fact that Murphy apparently does not even know what form of government America's Founders created - a republic - the threat was unmistakable: Censor more voices or face the wrath of lawmakers and establishment globalists. He did not cite any examples of \"hate\" or \"lies\" spread by Infowars.</p><p>Another U.S. senator, Democrat Mark Warner of Virginia (Freedom Index score: 11), went even further, brazenly proposing a government takeover of the Internet. In a leaked proposal widely blasted by critics as a plan for a \"fascist takeover\" of the Internet, Warner called for new rules for social-media companies that would force them to take down \"fake news\" and other content. The scheme, entitled \"Potential Policy Proposals for Regulation of Social Media and Technology Firms,\" would also provide federal funding to \"media literacy programs\" that would supposedly help consumers sort through information online and help them determine what is true and what is not. The scheme seeks \"more disclosure requirements for online political speech,\" too.</p><p>Under the guise of stopping \"Russia,\" the plan would also end online anonymity, demanding that social-media platforms \"authenticate and disclose the geographic origin of all user accounts or posts.\" Basically, \"mandatory identity verification,\" a gambit that was earlier pursued by Obama, would force everyone to provide proof of their identity to social-media giants. Of course, the Founding Fathers often published anonymously - see the Federalist Papers. And still today, journalists, whistleblowers, and people with unpopular political opinions regularly rely on anonymity to be able to function online. Ironically, all of the scheming is said to be needed to protect trust in \"our institutions, democracv. free press, and markets.\" _</p><p>\"The size and reach of these platforms demand that we ensure proper oversight, transparency and effective management of technologies that in large measure undergird our social lives, our economy, and our politics,\" the policy paper argues. \"The hope is that the ideas enclosed here stir the pot and spark a wider discussion - among policymakers, stakeholders, and civil society groups - on the appropriate trajectory of technology policy in the coming years.\" Basically, the plan seems to be to put Bigger Brother government in charge of Big Brother technology companies to finish demolishing Internet freedom. Of course, many of the companies - Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and others - are already in bed with government. Some analysts suggested the massive, coordinated assault on Infowars may have been sparked by word of Warner's proposals.</p><p>Even if the government does not overtly take over, though, the jihad against free speech and content that exposes the establishment's lies will continue to become mor\u0119 brazen and more sophisticated. Microsoft, for instance, threatened to shut down an entire social network, Twitter alternative Gab.ai, because one user posted anti-Semitic comments. And Mozilla, an organization that once defended online freedom but fell to the left and even chased out its leader for supporting heterosexual marriage, has now teamed up with a George Soros-funded \"fact-checking\" service to develop the \"Mozilla Information Trust Initiative.\" Google has also started adding far-left \"fact check\" results that are notorious sources of disinformation, including the discredited Snopes.com. And Twitter CEO Dorsey proposed creating new rules for Twitter based on the UN \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\" which explicitly states that rights and freedoms may not be used contrary to the purposes and principles of the UN.</p><p>The battle to disseminate truth to the masses has been raging for centuries. But with the stakes now higher than ever, Americans must redouble their efforts. *</p><p>The bans and censorship show that globalists now realize their lies cannot compete with truth even in a rigged marketplace of ideas replete with \"shadowbanning,\" promoting establishment voices, and more - much less in a true free market of ideas.</p><p>Consider that of America's top l OO newspapers-just two endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Virtually every major media outlet in America spent endless hours demonizing Trump as a racist, a hater, a sexist, a kook, a conspiracy theorist, etc.</p><p>Schemes included hiding alternative voices via \"shadow-banning,\" promoting establishment voices via manipulated algorithms, and eventually, outright banning of those who question the establishment's narrative too vigorously or successfully.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2113739906</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCJ-3V71-JBHT-D29T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4376\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New American Sep 17, 2018</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol. 34</volume><issueNumber>No. 18</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 17, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

But the ongoing war by giant technology companies against voices that disrupt the establishment's narrative is actually good news in a very important sense. Of course, its victims may not see it that way - at least not yet. And those establishment-controlled companies almost certainly did not intend for it to be good news. But in a key sense, the ongoing effort to ban contrarians from the Internet is evidence that truth-tellers are winning, and the establishment is terrified, particularly with the midterms coming up. The bans and censorship show that globalists now realize their lies cannot compete with truth even in a rigged marketplace of ideas replete with \"shadow-banning,\" promoting establishment voices, and more - much less in a true free market of ideas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In other good news, Big Tech's war on free speech appears to be backfiring in a major way, too. But obviously, this is only the beginning.</p><p>The driving factor behind the escalating censorship occurring across social media appears to be the disruption to the establishment's propaganda efforts and its narratives. For instance, consider that of America's top 100 newspapers, just two endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Virtually every major media outlet in America spent endless hours demonizing Trump as a racist, a hater, a sexist, a kook, a conspiracy theorist, a white supremacist, an anti-Semite, and all the other nasty terms they could hurl at him. One study found that more than 90 percent of the coverage of Trump on the big-three broadcast nightly newscasts - CBS, ABC, and NBC - was negative. The establishment media seemed sure their strategy would work, too. The New York Times gave Hillary Clinton an 85-percent chance of winning. The Huffington Post gave her a 98-percent chance of winning the presidency. Newsweek even sent out 125,000 copies of its magazine with \"Madam President\" on the cover.</p><p>But Trump won. Actually, he won a landslide victory in the Electoral College. And ironically, one of the many positions that endeared him to Americans was his willingness to ridicule and expose the dishonest press. Polls in 2016 showed that Americans had largely woken up to the fact that the establishment media was not just biased, but blatantly dishonest. According to a Gallup survey released a couple months before the election, just 14 percent of GOP voters expressed trust in the \"mainstream\" media. Less than a third of Americans more broadly reported having even a \"fair\" amount of trust in the press, the lowest level since Gallup started its surveys on the question in 1972. In short, the credibility of the media was destroyed, and even all of the establishment's propagandists combined could no longer determine the outcome of a presidential election.</p><p>Obviously, the globalist Deep State that dominates the major media was not pleased. Neither were the activists and puppets posing as \"journalists.\" And so a new narrative was bom: Trump won only because dumb, racist Americans were influenced by \"fake news\" and Russian disinformation, much of it spread on social media. Clearly, a solution to this needed to be found. And so, among other tactics, the globalist-controlled Internet giants, most of which have been in bed with government from the start, began stepping up their efforts to control the narrative. Those schemes included hiding alternative voices via \"shadow-banning,\" promoting establishment voices via manipulated algorithms, and eventually, outright banning those who question the establishment's narrative too vigorously or successfully.</p><p>Those efforts to silence dissent are now accelerating. As early as March, CNN began openly behaving more like an activist group than a media organization, blatantly pressuring advertisers to stop allowing their ads to appear on Infowars content. Later, they began lobbying social-media companies to take down one of their most significant competitors, something more than a few voices have described as a \"conspiracy in restraint of trade.\" Behind the scenes, the establishment was panicking, and working overtime to silence its key critics, lest more millions of Americans wake up.</p><p>In June of 2018, many of the titans of the Internet and the establishment media - along with heads of government, leaders of the \"intelligence\" community, royalty, globalist think-tank bosses, top international bureaucrats, agents for the Rothschild banking dynasty, and more - came together behind closed doors and militarized security in Italy at the annual Bilderberg summit to discuss the issue further. The chiefs of Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedln, and Amazon, among others, regularly attend these secretive meetings with fellow globalists. This year, one of the key items on the agenda released to the public was something described as the \"post-truth\" world. Basically, Bilderberg bigwigs were distraught by their collapsing ability to mislead the masses, which could ruin all of their plans as humanity increasingly tunes out their propaganda.</p><p>\"Post-truth\" was selected by Oxford English Dictionary as the \"word of the year\" for 2016. It was defined as \"relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\" In essence, Deep State globalists, outraged that Americans no longer believe their propaganda organs, decided to unleash the lie that people no longer value objective facts, as defined by their propaganda organs. In reality, though, Americans and people around the world were still very interested in facts and truth - they simply realized that the establishment media was not going to provide much. And so, on social media, citizens turned to sources that were offering truth - or at least more truth than they were getting from the Deep State's propaganda machine. The 2016 election, in short, was a major wake-up call to the globalists.</p><p>The Purge</p><p>In response to the death of their credibility, the Big Tech giants launched an ongoing purge of alternative voices from the Internet. That has now culminated in the mass ban of everything Alex Jones from virtually every platform. In early August, after months of threatening to do it. the purge began. Under the guise of enforcing rules against \"hate speech,\" in just one day, Apple, YouTube, and Facebook all removed Jones' content - content that included an exclusive interview with Donald Trump that almost certainly played a role in the president's victory. Other firms quickly piled on, with lesser-known companies such as Spotify, Stitcher, Linkedln, Pinterest, MailChimp, Vimeo, and more joining the frenzy to send Jones and all the content he ever produced down George Orwell's infamous \"memory hole.\" Even Disqus, which provided the comments section for Infowars, banned the site. Not a single one of the companies explained what specific content had allegedly violated their rules. Most cited vague allegations of \"hate speech\" or even \"encouraging violence,\" without providing examples. The establishment media provided cover for the operation by endlessly claiming that Jones had referred to the Sandy Hook shooting as a \"hoax,\" something Jones has repeatedly apologized for - and is hardly hateful.</p><p>Overnight, Jones and his media empire became the most censored media outlet in the world. In an instant, with the click of a button, YouTube - a behemoth owned by Google's parent company Alphabet - removed Infowars videos that, combined, had been viewed billions of times. Jones also lost access to his nearly 2.5 million subscribers. The numbers tell an incredible story. Despite a relatively tiny budget, Jones was a superstar on the YouTube scene. For perspective, Jones' 2.5 million subscribers was about a million more than Fox News, the leading cable news station, had managed to amass. It was almost 2 million more than legacy networks CBS News or NBC News had attracted so far. The Washington Post had fewer than 400,000 subscribers a week after the purge of Jones began, while the New York Times had fewer than 1.5 million. Only CNN, which reportedly has been buying huge numbers of fake followers on social media, had more subscribers than Infowars.</p><p>During the election, though, the reason for the establishment's panic became clear. On an average day during election month - November of 2016 - Infowars was receiving 2.75 million views just on its YouTube channel, according to an analysis of the viewership numbers by the Next News Network. That figure does not account for the massive radio and website audience that helps Infowars reach many millions more around the world. Throughout election month in November, Infowars received more than 82 million views on YouTube alone. By contrast, Fox News' YouTube channel received fewer than 2 million views on an average November day, totaling around 60 million for the month - significantly fewer than Infowars. CNN received less than a million per day - or 30 million for the month - on average. MSNBC received fewer than 750,000 average daily views during election month.</p><p>In short, with a tiny fraction of the budget available to the establishment's propaganda organs, Alex Jones and his Infowars operation weie i caching more people just on YouTube than many of the nation's leading establishment propaganda organs - combined. He also dominated at other social-media services, with millions of followers on Facebook and beyond. Obviously, Jones' competitors at the legacy media were outraged: How could this \"fringe radical extremist kook rightwing conspiracy theorist\" be leaving them in the dust? As of early August, they no longer had to worry about the competition, with Jones having been \"de-platformed\" almost everywhere - or so they thought. More on the backlash later.</p><p>Perhaps nothing illustrates the establishment media's obsession with Alex Jones better than the social-media pages of CNN senior media reporter Oliver Darcy and his sidekick Paul Murphy. Reading their Twitter feeds, it feels like one has entered an alternative universe. For months, the dynamic CNN duo hounded advertisers and social-media companies about Jones and Infowars. They also gave constant updates on their progress. On August 14, for instance, after spending weeks lobbying to have Jones and Infowars removed from social media, Darcy had breaking news to report. \"Twitter spox confirms to me that the company has limited key functions on Alex Jones' account after determining he violated another one of network's policies,\" Darcy reported in one of countless similar moment-by-moment updates in CNN's war on Infowars. \"He can still browse Twitter, but can't tweet, retweet, etc. for 7 days. Jones also required to delete offending tweet.\" Less than a day later, another breaking update. \"Twitter spox confirms to me that Twitter has suspended most functions on the InfoWars account for 7 days for posting [the] same video they took action against on Alex Jones,\" Darcy gushed.</p><p>In between those two tweets, the CNN reporter expressed frustration that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had suggested that putting Jones in \"timeout\" might change his behavior. \"Uhhh,\" wrote the \"senior media reporter.\" Shortly after that, Darcy was at it again, chastising the company for \"only\" giving Jones a seven-day suspension despite alleged \"multiple rule violations.\"</p><p>Indeed, of all the major social-media networks, only Twitter resisted the CNN lobbying and the hateful mobs demanding Jones be censored. But then, even Twitter partially caved, giving Jones a \"suspension\" in mid-August. In an interview with The Hill, CEO Dorsey said the \"timeout\" was meant to \"guide people back towards healthier behaviors and healthier public conversation.\" In other words, the CEO of Twitter wants to use behaviormodification techniques to change its users and make them \"healthy.\" If the behavior modification does not work on Jones, he will no longer be welcome on Twitter. To his credit, Dorsey admitted afterward that Twitter leans left, quite an understatement, but important nonetheless.</p><p>Of course, Jones was not the only high-profile media star to be purged from socialmedia. Another heavyweight who was silenced was Gavin Mclnnes, a pundit with CRTV, along with his group \"Proud Boys,\" which protects conservative speakers from violent fascists styling themselves \"Anti-Fascists\" or Antifa. According to Twitter, which took down his accounts, it was to enforce a prohibition on \"violent extremist groups.\" Also, black conservative Candace Owens with Turning Point USA was censored on Twitter for sending out the exact same tweets as the New York Times ' newest editorial board member-a racist, sexist hatemonger who said being cruel to elderly white men gives her joy. The difference: Owens replaced the word \"white\" with \"Jew\" or \"black\" - and she didn't mean to be offensive; she was simply making a political point about the hypocrisy of the New York Times. Other personalities to face socialmedia censorship include Ron Paul Institute leader Daniel McAdams, Antiwar, corn's Scott Horton, former State Department staffer Peter Van Buren, former Breitbart editor and \"conservative\" homosexual Milo Yiannopoulos, and countless lesser-known names. Twitter was even exposed \"shadow-banning\" prominent Republican congressmen. And a Twitter engineer was caught on camera admitting to an undercover Project Veritas reporter that the platform's algorithms supposedly aimed at stopping \"bots\" are actually used to target Republicans.</p><p>Facebook has been just as bad, if not worse, in targeting voices far beyond Infowars. Websites such as CodelsFreeSpeech.com, which defends the right to distribute computer code that can be used to print 3D firearms, are banned completely. A GOP candidate for Congress had her ad banned because she mentioned the Communist Cambodian genocide, which her family survived. Even the Bible is unwelcome on Facebook. Amid blatant manipulation of its algorithms to clobber traffic levels of conservative and Christian voices, the site has literally been banning people for expressing biblical views. Prominent Brazilian evangelist Julio Severo, for instance, was put in Facebook \"jail\" for posting a Bible verse (Leviticus 18:22) about homosexuality - and nothing else. It was dubbed \"hate speech\" by the giant company, until the resulting scandal forced it to back down. In late 2017, Severo was again penalized by Facebook, this time for saying it was a Christian's duty to love homosexuals and all other sinners. Apparently even implying that homosexuality is a sin - the Bible, the Torah, and the Koran all state that explicitly - is enough to have Facebook \"discipline\" a person like a misbehaving elementary-school child. In other words, the religious beliefs of Christians, Jews, Muslims, and countless others are all considered \"hate speech\" by Facebook. Severo was previously targeted by PayPal, which continues to deny him service based on his religious beliefs.</p><p>Google and YouTube, both owned by Alphabet, have for years been manipulating what people see by designing algorithms that suppress voices they disagree with and promote voices they think should be promoted. It has been getting worse and worse. Prager University, an online creator of mainstream educational videos, is one of countless prominent voices that has been all but crushed by YouTube, which is now restricting its content. \"We are opening the eyes and the minds of the next generation, one five-minute video at a time ... and the left doesn't like it,\" PragerU founder Dennis Prager said in a recent e-mail about the lawsuit they filed against the video site. \"Silicon Valley giants like YouTube continue to censor the ideas they don't agree with. They promote their Leftist ideology and restrict conservative speech.\" Over 500,000 people have signed a petition supporting PragerU. On Facebook, changes by the site eliminated 99.9999 percent of PragerU's reach. Only after the censorship became a national scandal did Facebook back down and apologize.</p><p>The censorship is so out of control that even YouTube creators who simply talked about Alex Jones got penalized. Comically, the popular H3 podcast was taken down while it was defending YouTube's decision to censor Jones. Apparently the name Alex Jones in the title triggered some sort of automatic censorship program that caused the broadcast to be taken down and the channel to receive a penalty.</p><p>Even when it isn't actively censoring things, YouTube is now increasingly trying to sway public opinion. For instance, on videos dealing with \"climate change,\" the social-media giant owned by Google's parent company now adds disclaimers aimed at building up support for the increasingly discredited man-made globalwarming hypothesis.</p><p>Establishment leftists funded by billionaire globalist George Soros developed a complex plan to target conservatives online. In a leaked 2017 document called \"Democracy Matters: A Strategic Plan for Action,\" far-left Democrat operative David Brock of Media Matters outlined the goals and the strategy. \"In the next four years, Media Matters will continue its core mission of disarming right-wing misinformation, while leading the fight against the next generation of conservative information: The proliferation of fake news and propaganda now threatening the country's information ecosystem,\" explains the memo, with \"fake news\" defined as anything that contradicts the establishment's narrative. Among the goals is ensuring the \"defeat [of] Trump either through impeachment or at the ballot box in 2020.\" And to do so, the group boasts of working with social-media giants and Google to limit conservative voices while boosting the reach of voices they support.</p><p>As an illustration of just how far the tech giants can and will go to purge dissidents from the World Wide Web, an astounding case from fall of 2017 offers a troubling picture. Basically, when an obscure racist made fun of a victim of what was reported to be a racist attack, he was completely disappeared from the Internet, with his hosting company taking down his website entirely. Virtually nobody defended the speech itself, but even the CEO of one of the companies that disappeared the Nazi \"Daily Stormer\" site in question expressed concerns. \"Literally, I woke up in a bad mood and decided someone shouldn't be allowed on the Internet,\" the CEO of Cloudflare was quoted as saying in an email to employees. \"No one should have that power.\" And just as countless analysts and pundits predicted, it did not take long for the purge to spread and accelerate.</p><p>For those who, despite all the evidence, still wonder whether the purge is political, a brief survey of all the anti-Christian bigotry and the open calls for violence against conservatives plastered all over social media should suffice. Indeed, as if to prove how radically left-wing the Internet companies' views are, many of them have openly partnered with the far-left Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). Founded by Morris Dees, who was accused in court documents of sexually molesting his stepdaughter, the radical group has become a bad joke even to mainstream left-wing activists. Just in recent years, it has smeared a prominent Muslim as a top \"anti-Muslim extremist,\" a Cherokee Indian married to one of Sacajawea's descendants as the \"matriarch\" of the \"anti-Indian movement,\" and a prominent black law professor as a supporter of white supremacy. Even the mild-mannered Ben Carson was deemed an \"extremist\" by the SPLC for supporting marriage.</p><p>By contrast, the group had nothing but glowing praise for communist terrorist Bill Ayers, whose murderous terror group, working with Castro's intelligence services, murdered American police, bombed the Capitol and the State Department, and made plans to re-educate and exterminate millions of Americans with help from foreign communist dictators. Leading U.S. Christian groups such as the American Family Association have labeled the SPLC an \"anti-Christian hate group.\" Left-wing activists have denounced it as a moneymaking scam. And yet, virtually all of the tech giants have jumped in bed with the radical group, alienating millions of Christians and conservatives in the process.</p><p>Calls for More Purges</p><p>But of course, alienating those who care about honesty and free speech is OK with liberal powerbrokers - both those liberals on the Internet and those in government - because the end game is to so marginalize conservatives that they will be afraid to speak up lest they feel leftist wrath. The totalitarians are desperate to regain control of the narrative and have no intention of allowing Jones and others to continue reaching the masses - much less reaching them with essential information that undermines the establishment's propaganda talking points and agenda. And some of the most virulent would-be totalitarians in government have already dropped the mask.</p><p>Consider Senator Chris Murphy (DConn.), who has an atrocious 14-percent cumulative score for voting constitutionally on The New American magazine's Freedom Index. Shortly after Infowars was taken down, Murphy made clear that this is just the beginning. \"Infowars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart,\" he fumed on social media, perhaps oblivious to the irony of using social media to tear America apart while complaining about the same. \"These companies must do more than take down one website. The survival of our democracy depends on it.\" Setting aside the fact that Murphy apparently does not even know what form of government America's Founders created - a republic - the threat was unmistakable: Censor more voices or face the wrath of lawmakers and establishment globalists. He did not cite any examples of \"hate\" or \"lies\" spread by Infowars.</p><p>Another U.S. senator, Democrat Mark Warner of Virginia (Freedom Index score: 11), went even further, brazenly proposing a government takeover of the Internet. In a leaked proposal widely blasted by critics as a plan for a \"fascist takeover\" of the Internet, Warner called for new rules for social-media companies that would force them to take down \"fake news\" and other content. The scheme, entitled \"Potential Policy Proposals for Regulation of Social Media and Technology Firms,\" would also provide federal funding to \"media literacy programs\" that would supposedly help consumers sort through information online and help them determine what is true and what is not. The scheme seeks \"more disclosure requirements for online political speech,\" too.</p><p>Under the guise of stopping \"Russia,\" the plan would also end online anonymity, demanding that social-media platforms \"authenticate and disclose the geographic origin of all user accounts or posts.\" Basically, \"mandatory identity verification,\" a gambit that was earlier pursued by Obama, would force everyone to provide proof of their identity to social-media giants. Of course, the Founding Fathers often published anonymously - see the Federalist Papers. And still today, journalists, whistleblowers, and people with unpopular political opinions regularly rely on anonymity to be able to function online. Ironically, all of the scheming is said to be needed to protect trust in \"our institutions, democracv. free press, and markets.\" _</p><p>\"The size and reach of these platforms demand that we ensure proper oversight, transparency and effective management of technologies that in large measure undergird our social lives, our economy, and our politics,\" the policy paper argues. \"The hope is that the ideas enclosed here stir the pot and spark a wider discussion - among policymakers, stakeholders, and civil society groups - on the appropriate trajectory of technology policy in the coming years.\" Basically, the plan seems to be to put Bigger Brother government in charge of Big Brother technology companies to finish demolishing Internet freedom. Of course, many of the companies - Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and others - are already in bed with government. Some analysts suggested the massive, coordinated assault on Infowars may have been sparked by word of Warner's proposals.</p><p>Even if the government does not overtly take over, though, the jihad against free speech and content that exposes the establishment's lies will continue to become mor\u0119 brazen and more sophisticated. Microsoft, for instance, threatened to shut down an entire social network, Twitter alternative Gab.ai, because one user posted anti-Semitic comments. And Mozilla, an organization that once defended online freedom but fell to the left and even chased out its leader for supporting heterosexual marriage, has now teamed up with a George Soros-funded \"fact-checking\" service to develop the \"Mozilla Information Trust Initiative.\" Google has also started adding far-left \"fact check\" results that are notorious sources of disinformation, including the discredited Snopes.com. And Twitter CEO Dorsey proposed creating new rules for Twitter based on the UN \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\" which explicitly states that rights and freedoms may not be used contrary to the purposes and principles of the UN.</p><p>The battle to disseminate truth to the masses has been raging for centuries. But with the stakes now higher than ever, Americans must redouble their efforts. *</p><p>The bans and censorship show that globalists now realize their lies cannot compete with truth even in a rigged marketplace of ideas replete with \"shadowbanning,\" promoting establishment voices, and more - much less in a true free market of ideas.</p><p>Consider that of America's top l OO newspapers-just two endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 election.

But the ongoing war by giant technology companies against voices that disrupt the establishment's narrative is actually good news in a very important sense. Of course, its victims may not see it that way - at least not yet. And those establishment-controlled companies almost certainly did not intend for it to be good news. But in a key sense, the ongoing effort to ban contrarians from the Internet is evidence that truth-tellers are winning, and the establishment is terrified, particularly with the midterms coming up. The bans and censorship show that globalists now realize their lies cannot compete with truth even in a rigged marketplace of ideas replete with \"shadow-banning,\" promoting establishment voices, and more - much less in a true free market of ideas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In other good news, Big Tech's war on free speech appears to be backfiring in a major way, too. But obviously, this is only the beginning.</p><p>The driving factor behind the escalating censorship occurring across social media appears to be the disruption to the establishment's propaganda efforts and its narratives. For instance, consider that of America's top 100 newspapers, just two endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Virtually every major media outlet in America spent endless hours demonizing Trump as a racist, a hater, a sexist, a kook, a conspiracy theorist, a white supremacist, an anti-Semite, and all the other nasty terms they could hurl at him. One study found that more than 90 percent of the coverage of Trump on the big-three broadcast nightly newscasts - CBS, ABC, and NBC - was negative. The establishment media seemed sure their strategy would work, too. The New York Times gave Hillary Clinton an 85-percent chance of winning. The Huffington Post gave her a 98-percent chance of winning the presidency. Newsweek even sent out 125,000 copies of its magazine with \"Madam President\" on the cover.</p><p>But Trump won. Actually, he won a landslide victory in the Electoral College. And ironically, one of the many positions that endeared him to Americans was his willingness to ridicule and expose the dishonest press. Polls in 2016 showed that Americans had largely woken up to the fact that the establishment media was not just biased, but blatantly dishonest. According to a Gallup survey released a couple months before the election, just 14 percent of GOP voters expressed trust in the \"mainstream\" media. Less than a third of Americans more broadly reported having even a \"fair\" amount of trust in the press, the lowest level since Gallup started its surveys on the question in 1972. In short, the credibility of the media was destroyed, and even all of the establishment's propagandists combined could no longer determine the outcome of a presidential election.</p><p>Obviously, the globalist Deep State that dominates the major media was not pleased. Neither were the activists and puppets posing as \"journalists.\" And so a new narrative was bom: Trump won only because dumb, racist Americans were influenced by \"fake news\" and Russian disinformation, much of it spread on social media. Clearly, a solution to this needed to be found. And so, among other tactics, the globalist-controlled Internet giants, most of which have been in bed with government from the start, began stepping up their efforts to control the narrative. Those schemes included hiding alternative voices via \"shadow-banning,\" promoting establishment voices via manipulated algorithms, and eventually, outright banning those who question the establishment's narrative too vigorously or successfully.</p><p>Those efforts to silence dissent are now accelerating. As early as March, CNN began openly behaving more like an activist group than a media organization, blatantly pressuring advertisers to stop allowing their ads to appear on Infowars content. Later, they began lobbying social-media companies to take down one of their most significant competitors, something more than a few voices have described as a \"conspiracy in restraint of trade.\" Behind the scenes, the establishment was panicking, and working overtime to silence its key critics, lest more millions of Americans wake up.</p><p>In June of 2018, many of the titans of the Internet and the establishment media - along with heads of government, leaders of the \"intelligence\" community, royalty, globalist think-tank bosses, top international bureaucrats, agents for the Rothschild banking dynasty, and more - came together behind closed doors and militarized security in Italy at the annual Bilderberg summit to discuss the issue further. The chiefs of Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedln, and Amazon, among others, regularly attend these secretive meetings with fellow globalists. This year, one of the key items on the agenda released to the public was something described as the \"post-truth\" world. Basically, Bilderberg bigwigs were distraught by their collapsing ability to mislead the masses, which could ruin all of their plans as humanity increasingly tunes out their propaganda.</p><p>\"Post-truth\" was selected by Oxford English Dictionary as the \"word of the year\" for 2016. It was defined as \"relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\" In essence, Deep State globalists, outraged that Americans no longer believe their propaganda organs, decided to unleash the lie that people no longer value objective facts, as defined by their propaganda organs. In reality, though, Americans and people around the world were still very interested in facts and truth - they simply realized that the establishment media was not going to provide much. And so, on social media, citizens turned to sources that were offering truth - or at least more truth than they were getting from the Deep State's propaganda machine. The 2016 election, in short, was a major wake-up call to the globalists.</p><p>The Purge</p><p>In response to the death of their credibility, the Big Tech giants launched an ongoing purge of alternative voices from the Internet. That has now culminated in the mass ban of everything Alex Jones from virtually every platform. In early August, after months of threatening to do it. the purge began. Under the guise of enforcing rules against \"hate speech,\" in just one day, Apple, YouTube, and Facebook all removed Jones' content - content that included an exclusive interview with Donald Trump that almost certainly played a role in the president's victory. Other firms quickly piled on, with lesser-known companies such as Spotify, Stitcher, Linkedln, Pinterest, MailChimp, Vimeo, and more joining the frenzy to send Jones and all the content he ever produced down George Orwell's infamous \"memory hole.\" Even Disqus, which provided the comments section for Infowars, banned the site. Not a single one of the companies explained what specific content had allegedly violated their rules. Most cited vague allegations of \"hate speech\" or even \"encouraging violence,\" without providing examples. The establishment media provided cover for the operation by endlessly claiming that Jones had referred to the Sandy Hook shooting as a \"hoax,\" something Jones has repeatedly apologized for - and is hardly hateful.</p><p>Overnight, Jones and his media empire became the most censored media outlet in the world. In an instant, with the click of a button, YouTube - a behemoth owned by Google's parent company Alphabet - removed Infowars videos that, combined, had been viewed billions of times. Jones also lost access to his nearly 2.5 million subscribers. The numbers tell an incredible story. Despite a relatively tiny budget, Jones was a superstar on the YouTube scene. For perspective, Jones' 2.5 million subscribers was about a million more than Fox News, the leading cable news station, had managed to amass. It was almost 2 million more than legacy networks CBS News or NBC News had attracted so far. The Washington Post had fewer than 400,000 subscribers a week after the purge of Jones began, while the New York Times had fewer than 1.5 million. Only CNN, which reportedly has been buying huge numbers of fake followers on social media, had more subscribers than Infowars.</p><p>During the election, though, the reason for the establishment's panic became clear. On an average day during election month - November of 2016 - Infowars was receiving 2.75 million views just on its YouTube channel, according to an analysis of the viewership numbers by the Next News Network. That figure does not account for the massive radio and website audience that helps Infowars reach many millions more around the world. Throughout election month in November, Infowars received more than 82 million views on YouTube alone. By contrast, Fox News' YouTube channel received fewer than 2 million views on an average November day, totaling around 60 million for the month - significantly fewer than Infowars. CNN received less than a million per day - or 30 million for the month - on average. MSNBC received fewer than 750,000 average daily views during election month.</p><p>In short, with a tiny fraction of the budget available to the establishment's propaganda organs, Alex Jones and his Infowars operation weie i caching more people just on YouTube than many of the nation's leading establishment propaganda organs - combined. He also dominated at other social-media services, with millions of followers on Facebook and beyond. Obviously, Jones' competitors at the legacy media were outraged: How could this \"fringe radical extremist kook rightwing conspiracy theorist\" be leaving them in the dust? As of early August, they no longer had to worry about the competition, with Jones having been \"de-platformed\" almost everywhere - or so they thought. More on the backlash later.</p><p>Perhaps nothing illustrates the establishment media's obsession with Alex Jones better than the social-media pages of CNN senior media reporter Oliver Darcy and his sidekick Paul Murphy. Reading their Twitter feeds, it feels like one has entered an alternative universe. For months, the dynamic CNN duo hounded advertisers and social-media companies about Jones and Infowars. They also gave constant updates on their progress. On August 14, for instance, after spending weeks lobbying to have Jones and Infowars removed from social media, Darcy had breaking news to report. \"Twitter spox confirms to me that the company has limited key functions on Alex Jones' account after determining he violated another one of network's policies,\" Darcy reported in one of countless similar moment-by-moment updates in CNN's war on Infowars. \"He can still browse Twitter, but can't tweet, retweet, etc. for 7 days. Jones also required to delete offending tweet.\" Less than a day later, another breaking update. \"Twitter spox confirms to me that Twitter has suspended most functions on the InfoWars account for 7 days for posting [the] same video they took action against on Alex Jones,\" Darcy gushed.</p><p>In between those two tweets, the CNN reporter expressed frustration that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had suggested that putting Jones in \"timeout\" might change his behavior. \"Uhhh,\" wrote the \"senior media reporter.\" Shortly after that, Darcy was at it again, chastising the company for \"only\" giving Jones a seven-day suspension despite alleged \"multiple rule violations.\"</p><p>Indeed, of all the major social-media networks, only Twitter resisted the CNN lobbying and the hateful mobs demanding Jones be censored. But then, even Twitter partially caved, giving Jones a \"suspension\" in mid-August. In an interview with The Hill, CEO Dorsey said the \"timeout\" was meant to \"guide people back towards healthier behaviors and healthier public conversation.\" In other words, the CEO of Twitter wants to use behaviormodification techniques to change its users and make them \"healthy.\" If the behavior modification does not work on Jones, he will no longer be welcome on Twitter. To his credit, Dorsey admitted afterward that Twitter leans left, quite an understatement, but important nonetheless.</p><p>Of course, Jones was not the only high-profile media star to be purged from socialmedia. Another heavyweight who was silenced was Gavin Mclnnes, a pundit with CRTV, along with his group \"Proud Boys,\" which protects conservative speakers from violent fascists styling themselves \"Anti-Fascists\" or Antifa. According to Twitter, which took down his accounts, it was to enforce a prohibition on \"violent extremist groups.\" Also, black conservative Candace Owens with Turning Point USA was censored on Twitter for sending out the exact same tweets as the New York Times ' newest editorial board member-a racist, sexist hatemonger who said being cruel to elderly white men gives her joy. The difference: Owens replaced the word \"white\" with \"Jew\" or \"black\" - and she didn't mean to be offensive; she was simply making a political point about the hypocrisy of the New York Times. Other personalities to face socialmedia censorship include Ron Paul Institute leader Daniel McAdams, Antiwar, corn's Scott Horton, former State Department staffer Peter Van Buren, former Breitbart editor and \"conservative\" homosexual Milo Yiannopoulos, and countless lesser-known names. Twitter was even exposed \"shadow-banning\" prominent Republican congressmen. And a Twitter engineer was caught on camera admitting to an undercover Project Veritas reporter that the platform's algorithms supposedly aimed at stopping \"bots\" are actually used to target Republicans.</p><p>Facebook has been just as bad, if not worse, in targeting voices far beyond Infowars. Websites such as CodelsFreeSpeech.com, which defends the right to distribute computer code that can be used to print 3D firearms, are banned completely. A GOP candidate for Congress had her ad banned because she mentioned the Communist Cambodian genocide, which her family survived. Even the Bible is unwelcome on Facebook. Amid blatant manipulation of its algorithms to clobber traffic levels of conservative and Christian voices, the site has literally been banning people for expressing biblical views. Prominent Brazilian evangelist Julio Severo, for instance, was put in Facebook \"jail\" for posting a Bible verse (Leviticus 18:22) about homosexuality - and nothing else. It was dubbed \"hate speech\" by the giant company, until the resulting scandal forced it to back down. In late 2017, Severo was again penalized by Facebook, this time for saying it was a Christian's duty to love homosexuals and all other sinners. Apparently even implying that homosexuality is a sin - the Bible, the Torah, and the Koran all state that explicitly - is enough to have Facebook \"discipline\" a person like a misbehaving elementary-school child. In other words, the religious beliefs of Christians, Jews, Muslims, and countless others are all considered \"hate speech\" by Facebook. Severo was previously targeted by PayPal, which continues to deny him service based on his religious beliefs.</p><p>Google and YouTube, both owned by Alphabet, have for years been manipulating what people see by designing algorithms that suppress voices they disagree with and promote voices they think should be promoted. It has been getting worse and worse. Prager University, an online creator of mainstream educational videos, is one of countless prominent voices that has been all but crushed by YouTube, which is now restricting its content. \"We are opening the eyes and the minds of the next generation, one five-minute video at a time ... and the left doesn't like it,\" PragerU founder Dennis Prager said in a recent e-mail about the lawsuit they filed against the video site. \"Silicon Valley giants like YouTube continue to censor the ideas they don't agree with. They promote their Leftist ideology and restrict conservative speech.\" Over 500,000 people have signed a petition supporting PragerU. On Facebook, changes by the site eliminated 99.9999 percent of PragerU's reach. Only after the censorship became a national scandal did Facebook back down and apologize.</p><p>The censorship is so out of control that even YouTube creators who simply talked about Alex Jones got penalized. Comically, the popular H3 podcast was taken down while it was defending YouTube's decision to censor Jones. Apparently the name Alex Jones in the title triggered some sort of automatic censorship program that caused the broadcast to be taken down and the channel to receive a penalty.</p><p>Even when it isn't actively censoring things, YouTube is now increasingly trying to sway public opinion. For instance, on videos dealing with \"climate change,\" the social-media giant owned by Google's parent company now adds disclaimers aimed at building up support for the increasingly discredited man-made globalwarming hypothesis.</p><p>Establishment leftists funded by billionaire globalist George Soros developed a complex plan to target conservatives online. In a leaked 2017 document called \"Democracy Matters: A Strategic Plan for Action,\" far-left Democrat operative David Brock of Media Matters outlined the goals and the strategy. \"In the next four years, Media Matters will continue its core mission of disarming right-wing misinformation, while leading the fight against the next generation of conservative information: The proliferation of fake news and propaganda now threatening the country's information ecosystem,\" explains the memo, with \"fake news\" defined as anything that contradicts the establishment's narrative. Among the goals is ensuring the \"defeat [of] Trump either through impeachment or at the ballot box in 2020.\" And to do so, the group boasts of working with social-media giants and Google to limit conservative voices while boosting the reach of voices they support.</p><p>As an illustration of just how far the tech giants can and will go to purge dissidents from the World Wide Web, an astounding case from fall of 2017 offers a troubling picture. Basically, when an obscure racist made fun of a victim of what was reported to be a racist attack, he was completely disappeared from the Internet, with his hosting company taking down his website entirely. Virtually nobody defended the speech itself, but even the CEO of one of the companies that disappeared the Nazi \"Daily Stormer\" site in question expressed concerns. \"Literally, I woke up in a bad mood and decided someone shouldn't be allowed on the Internet,\" the CEO of Cloudflare was quoted as saying in an email to employees. \"No one should have that power.\" And just as countless analysts and pundits predicted, it did not take long for the purge to spread and accelerate.</p><p>For those who, despite all the evidence, still wonder whether the purge is political, a brief survey of all the anti-Christian bigotry and the open calls for violence against conservatives plastered all over social media should suffice. Indeed, as if to prove how radically left-wing the Internet companies' views are, many of them have openly partnered with the far-left Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). Founded by Morris Dees, who was accused in court documents of sexually molesting his stepdaughter, the radical group has become a bad joke even to mainstream left-wing activists. Just in recent years, it has smeared a prominent Muslim as a top \"anti-Muslim extremist,\" a Cherokee Indian married to one of Sacajawea's descendants as the \"matriarch\" of the \"anti-Indian movement,\" and a prominent black law professor as a supporter of white supremacy. Even the mild-mannered Ben Carson was deemed an \"extremist\" by the SPLC for supporting marriage.</p><p>By contrast, the group had nothing but glowing praise for communist terrorist Bill Ayers, whose murderous terror group, working with Castro's intelligence services, murdered American police, bombed the Capitol and the State Department, and made plans to re-educate and exterminate millions of Americans with help from foreign communist dictators. Leading U.S. Christian groups such as the American Family Association have labeled the SPLC an \"anti-Christian hate group.\" Left-wing activists have denounced it as a moneymaking scam. And yet, virtually all of the tech giants have jumped in bed with the radical group, alienating millions of Christians and conservatives in the process.</p><p>Calls for More Purges</p><p>But of course, alienating those who care about honesty and free speech is OK with liberal powerbrokers - both those liberals on the Internet and those in government - because the end game is to so marginalize conservatives that they will be afraid to speak up lest they feel leftist wrath. The totalitarians are desperate to regain control of the narrative and have no intention of allowing Jones and others to continue reaching the masses - much less reaching them with essential information that undermines the establishment's propaganda talking points and agenda. And some of the most virulent would-be totalitarians in government have already dropped the mask.</p><p>Consider Senator Chris Murphy (DConn.), who has an atrocious 14-percent cumulative score for voting constitutionally on The New American magazine's Freedom Index. Shortly after Infowars was taken down, Murphy made clear that this is just the beginning. \"Infowars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart,\" he fumed on social media, perhaps oblivious to the irony of using social media to tear America apart while complaining about the same. \"These companies must do more than take down one website. The survival of our democracy depends on it.\" Setting aside the fact that Murphy apparently does not even know what form of government America's Founders created - a republic - the threat was unmistakable: Censor more voices or face the wrath of lawmakers and establishment globalists. He did not cite any examples of \"hate\" or \"lies\" spread by Infowars.</p><p>Another U.S. senator, Democrat Mark Warner of Virginia (Freedom Index score: 11), went even further, brazenly proposing a government takeover of the Internet. In a leaked proposal widely blasted by critics as a plan for a \"fascist takeover\" of the Internet, Warner called for new rules for social-media companies that would force them to take down \"fake news\" and other content. The scheme, entitled \"Potential Policy Proposals for Regulation of Social Media and Technology Firms,\" would also provide federal funding to \"media literacy programs\" that would supposedly help consumers sort through information online and help them determine what is true and what is not. The scheme seeks \"more disclosure requirements for online political speech,\" too.</p><p>Under the guise of stopping \"Russia,\" the plan would also end online anonymity, demanding that social-media platforms \"authenticate and disclose the geographic origin of all user accounts or posts.\" Basically, \"mandatory identity verification,\" a gambit that was earlier pursued by Obama, would force everyone to provide proof of their identity to social-media giants. Of course, the Founding Fathers often published anonymously - see the Federalist Papers. And still today, journalists, whistleblowers, and people with unpopular political opinions regularly rely on anonymity to be able to function online. Ironically, all of the scheming is said to be needed to protect trust in \"our institutions, democracv. free press, and markets.\" _</p><p>\"The size and reach of these platforms demand that we ensure proper oversight, transparency and effective management of technologies that in large measure undergird our social lives, our economy, and our politics,\" the policy paper argues. \"The hope is that the ideas enclosed here stir the pot and spark a wider discussion - among policymakers, stakeholders, and civil society groups - on the appropriate trajectory of technology policy in the coming years.\" Basically, the plan seems to be to put Bigger Brother government in charge of Big Brother technology companies to finish demolishing Internet freedom. Of course, many of the companies - Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and others - are already in bed with government. Some analysts suggested the massive, coordinated assault on Infowars may have been sparked by word of Warner's proposals.</p><p>Even if the government does not overtly take over, though, the jihad against free speech and content that exposes the establishment's lies will continue to become mor\u0119 brazen and more sophisticated. Microsoft, for instance, threatened to shut down an entire social network, Twitter alternative Gab.ai, because one user posted anti-Semitic comments. And Mozilla, an organization that once defended online freedom but fell to the left and even chased out its leader for supporting heterosexual marriage, has now teamed up with a George Soros-funded \"fact-checking\" service to develop the \"Mozilla Information Trust Initiative.\" Google has also started adding far-left \"fact check\" results that are notorious sources of disinformation, including the discredited Snopes.com. And Twitter CEO Dorsey proposed creating new rules for Twitter based on the UN \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\" which explicitly states that rights and freedoms may not be used contrary to the purposes and principles of the UN.</p><p>The battle to disseminate truth to the masses has been raging for centuries. But with the stakes now higher than ever, Americans must redouble their efforts. *</p><p>The bans and censorship show that globalists now realize their lies cannot compete with truth even in a rigged marketplace of ideas replete with \"shadowbanning,\" promoting establishment voices, and more - much less in a true free market of ideas.</p><p>Consider that of America's top l OO newspapers-just two endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Virtually every major media outlet in America spent endless hours demonizing Trump as a racist, a hater, a sexist, a kook, a conspiracy theorist, etc.</p><p>Schemes included hiding alternative voices via \"shadow-banning,\" promoting establishment voices via manipulated algorithms, and eventually, outright banning of those who question the establishment's narrative too vigorously or successfully.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2113739906</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9S-4XS1-DY0W-43S1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4376\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New American Sep 17, 2018</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol. 34</volume><issueNumber>No. 18</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 17, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

But the ongoing war by giant technology companies against voices that disrupt the establishment's narrative is actually good news in a very important sense. Of course, its victims may not see it that way - at least not yet. And those establishment-controlled companies almost certainly did not intend for it to be good news. But in a key sense, the ongoing effort to ban contrarians from the Internet is evidence that truth-tellers are winning, and the establishment is terrified, particularly with the midterms coming up. The bans and censorship show that globalists now realize their lies cannot compete with truth even in a rigged marketplace of ideas replete with \"shadow-banning,\" promoting establishment voices, and more - much less in a true free market of ideas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In other good news, Big Tech's war on free speech appears to be backfiring in a major way, too. But obviously, this is only the beginning.</p><p>The driving factor behind the escalating censorship occurring across social media appears to be the disruption to the establishment's propaganda efforts and its narratives. For instance, consider that of America's top 100 newspapers, just two endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Virtually every major media outlet in America spent endless hours demonizing Trump as a racist, a hater, a sexist, a kook, a conspiracy theorist, a white supremacist, an anti-Semite, and all the other nasty terms they could hurl at him. One study found that more than 90 percent of the coverage of Trump on the big-three broadcast nightly newscasts - CBS, ABC, and NBC - was negative. The establishment media seemed sure their strategy would work, too. The New York Times gave Hillary Clinton an 85-percent chance of winning. The Huffington Post gave her a 98-percent chance of winning the presidency. Newsweek even sent out 125,000 copies of its magazine with \"Madam President\" on the cover.</p><p>But Trump won. Actually, he won a landslide victory in the Electoral College. And ironically, one of the many positions that endeared him to Americans was his willingness to ridicule and expose the dishonest press. Polls in 2016 showed that Americans had largely woken up to the fact that the establishment media was not just biased, but blatantly dishonest. According to a Gallup survey released a couple months before the election, just 14 percent of GOP voters expressed trust in the \"mainstream\" media. Less than a third of Americans more broadly reported having even a \"fair\" amount of trust in the press, the lowest level since Gallup started its surveys on the question in 1972. In short, the credibility of the media was destroyed, and even all of the establishment's propagandists combined could no longer determine the outcome of a presidential election.</p><p>Obviously, the globalist Deep State that dominates the major media was not pleased. Neither were the activists and puppets posing as \"journalists.\" And so a new narrative was bom: Trump won only because dumb, racist Americans were influenced by \"fake news\" and Russian disinformation, much of it spread on social media. Clearly, a solution to this needed to be found. And so, among other tactics, the globalist-controlled Internet giants, most of which have been in bed with government from the start, began stepping up their efforts to control the narrative. Those schemes included hiding alternative voices via \"shadow-banning,\" promoting establishment voices via manipulated algorithms, and eventually, outright banning those who question the establishment's narrative too vigorously or successfully.</p><p>Those efforts to silence dissent are now accelerating. As early as March, CNN began openly behaving more like an activist group than a media organization, blatantly pressuring advertisers to stop allowing their ads to appear on Infowars content. Later, they began lobbying social-media companies to take down one of their most significant competitors, something more than a few voices have described as a \"conspiracy in restraint of trade.\" Behind the scenes, the establishment was panicking, and working overtime to silence its key critics, lest more millions of Americans wake up.</p><p>In June of 2018, many of the titans of the Internet and the establishment media - along with heads of government, leaders of the \"intelligence\" community, royalty, globalist think-tank bosses, top international bureaucrats, agents for the Rothschild banking dynasty, and more - came together behind closed doors and militarized security in Italy at the annual Bilderberg summit to discuss the issue further. The chiefs of Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedln, and Amazon, among others, regularly attend these secretive meetings with fellow globalists. This year, one of the key items on the agenda released to the public was something described as the \"post-truth\" world. Basically, Bilderberg bigwigs were distraught by their collapsing ability to mislead the masses, which could ruin all of their plans as humanity increasingly tunes out their propaganda.</p><p>\"Post-truth\" was selected by Oxford English Dictionary as the \"word of the year\" for 2016. It was defined as \"relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\" In essence, Deep State globalists, outraged that Americans no longer believe their propaganda organs, decided to unleash the lie that people no longer value objective facts, as defined by their propaganda organs. In reality, though, Americans and people around the world were still very interested in facts and truth - they simply realized that the establishment media was not going to provide much. And so, on social media, citizens turned to sources that were offering truth - or at least more truth than they were getting from the Deep State's propaganda machine. The 2016 election, in short, was a major wake-up call to the globalists.</p><p>The Purge</p><p>In response to the death of their credibility, the Big Tech giants launched an ongoing purge of alternative voices from the Internet. That has now culminated in the mass ban of everything Alex Jones from virtually every platform. In early August, after months of threatening to do it. the purge began. Under the guise of enforcing rules against \"hate speech,\" in just one day, Apple, YouTube, and Facebook all removed Jones' content - content that included an exclusive interview with Donald Trump that almost certainly played a role in the president's victory. Other firms quickly piled on, with lesser-known companies such as Spotify, Stitcher, Linkedln, Pinterest, MailChimp, Vimeo, and more joining the frenzy to send Jones and all the content he ever produced down George Orwell's infamous \"memory hole.\" Even Disqus, which provided the comments section for Infowars, banned the site. Not a single one of the companies explained what specific content had allegedly violated their rules. Most cited vague allegations of \"hate speech\" or even \"encouraging violence,\" without providing examples. The establishment media provided cover for the operation by endlessly claiming that Jones had referred to the Sandy Hook shooting as a \"hoax,\" something Jones has repeatedly apologized for - and is hardly hateful.</p><p>Overnight, Jones and his media empire became the most censored media outlet in the world. In an instant, with the click of a button, YouTube - a behemoth owned by Google's parent company Alphabet - removed Infowars videos that, combined, had been viewed billions of times. Jones also lost access to his nearly 2.5 million subscribers. The numbers tell an incredible story. Despite a relatively tiny budget, Jones was a superstar on the YouTube scene. For perspective, Jones' 2.5 million subscribers was about a million more than Fox News, the leading cable news station, had managed to amass. It was almost 2 million more than legacy networks CBS News or NBC News had attracted so far. The Washington Post had fewer than 400,000 subscribers a week after the purge of Jones began, while the New York Times had fewer than 1.5 million. Only CNN, which reportedly has been buying huge numbers of fake followers on social media, had more subscribers than Infowars.</p><p>During the election, though, the reason for the establishment's panic became clear. On an average day during election month - November of 2016 - Infowars was receiving 2.75 million views just on its YouTube channel, according to an analysis of the viewership numbers by the Next News Network. That figure does not account for the massive radio and website audience that helps Infowars reach many millions more around the world. Throughout election month in November, Infowars received more than 82 million views on YouTube alone. By contrast, Fox News' YouTube channel received fewer than 2 million views on an average November day, totaling around 60 million for the month - significantly fewer than Infowars. CNN received less than a million per day - or 30 million for the month - on average. MSNBC received fewer than 750,000 average daily views during election month.</p><p>In short, with a tiny fraction of the budget available to the establishment's propaganda organs, Alex Jones and his Infowars operation weie i caching more people just on YouTube than many of the nation's leading establishment propaganda organs - combined. He also dominated at other social-media services, with millions of followers on Facebook and beyond. Obviously, Jones' competitors at the legacy media were outraged: How could this \"fringe radical extremist kook rightwing conspiracy theorist\" be leaving them in the dust? As of early August, they no longer had to worry about the competition, with Jones having been \"de-platformed\" almost everywhere - or so they thought. More on the backlash later.</p><p>Perhaps nothing illustrates the establishment media's obsession with Alex Jones better than the social-media pages of CNN senior media reporter Oliver Darcy and his sidekick Paul Murphy. Reading their Twitter feeds, it feels like one has entered an alternative universe. For months, the dynamic CNN duo hounded advertisers and social-media companies about Jones and Infowars. They also gave constant updates on their progress. On August 14, for instance, after spending weeks lobbying to have Jones and Infowars removed from social media, Darcy had breaking news to report. \"Twitter spox confirms to me that the company has limited key functions on Alex Jones' account after determining he violated another one of network's policies,\" Darcy reported in one of countless similar moment-by-moment updates in CNN's war on Infowars. \"He can still browse Twitter, but can't tweet, retweet, etc. for 7 days. Jones also required to delete offending tweet.\" Less than a day later, another breaking update. \"Twitter spox confirms to me that Twitter has suspended most functions on the InfoWars account for 7 days for posting [the] same video they took action against on Alex Jones,\" Darcy gushed.</p><p>In between those two tweets, the CNN reporter expressed frustration that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had suggested that putting Jones in \"timeout\" might change his behavior. \"Uhhh,\" wrote the \"senior media reporter.\" Shortly after that, Darcy was at it again, chastising the company for \"only\" giving Jones a seven-day suspension despite alleged \"multiple rule violations.\"</p><p>Indeed, of all the major social-media networks, only Twitter resisted the CNN lobbying and the hateful mobs demanding Jones be censored. But then, even Twitter partially caved, giving Jones a \"suspension\" in mid-August. In an interview with The Hill, CEO Dorsey said the \"timeout\" was meant to \"guide people back towards healthier behaviors and healthier public conversation.\" In other words, the CEO of Twitter wants to use behaviormodification techniques to change its users and make them \"healthy.\" If the behavior modification does not work on Jones, he will no longer be welcome on Twitter. To his credit, Dorsey admitted afterward that Twitter leans left, quite an understatement, but important nonetheless.</p><p>Of course, Jones was not the only high-profile media star to be purged from socialmedia. Another heavyweight who was silenced was Gavin Mclnnes, a pundit with CRTV, along with his group \"Proud Boys,\" which protects conservative speakers from violent fascists styling themselves \"Anti-Fascists\" or Antifa. According to Twitter, which took down his accounts, it was to enforce a prohibition on \"violent extremist groups.\" Also, black conservative Candace Owens with Turning Point USA was censored on Twitter for sending out the exact same tweets as the New York Times ' newest editorial board member-a racist, sexist hatemonger who said being cruel to elderly white men gives her joy. The difference: Owens replaced the word \"white\" with \"Jew\" or \"black\" - and she didn't mean to be offensive; she was simply making a political point about the hypocrisy of the New York Times. Other personalities to face socialmedia censorship include Ron Paul Institute leader Daniel McAdams, Antiwar, corn's Scott Horton, former State Department staffer Peter Van Buren, former Breitbart editor and \"conservative\" homosexual Milo Yiannopoulos, and countless lesser-known names. Twitter was even exposed \"shadow-banning\" prominent Republican congressmen. And a Twitter engineer was caught on camera admitting to an undercover Project Veritas reporter that the platform's algorithms supposedly aimed at stopping \"bots\" are actually used to target Republicans.</p><p>Facebook has been just as bad, if not worse, in targeting voices far beyond Infowars. Websites such as CodelsFreeSpeech.com, which defends the right to distribute computer code that can be used to print 3D firearms, are banned completely. A GOP candidate for Congress had her ad banned because she mentioned the Communist Cambodian genocide, which her family survived. Even the Bible is unwelcome on Facebook. Amid blatant manipulation of its algorithms to clobber traffic levels of conservative and Christian voices, the site has literally been banning people for expressing biblical views. Prominent Brazilian evangelist Julio Severo, for instance, was put in Facebook \"jail\" for posting a Bible verse (Leviticus 18:22) about homosexuality - and nothing else. It was dubbed \"hate speech\" by the giant company, until the resulting scandal forced it to back down. In late 2017, Severo was again penalized by Facebook, this time for saying it was a Christian's duty to love homosexuals and all other sinners. Apparently even implying that homosexuality is a sin - the Bible, the Torah, and the Koran all state that explicitly - is enough to have Facebook \"discipline\" a person like a misbehaving elementary-school child. In other words, the religious beliefs of Christians, Jews, Muslims, and countless others are all considered \"hate speech\" by Facebook. Severo was previously targeted by PayPal, which continues to deny him service based on his religious beliefs.</p><p>Google and YouTube, both owned by Alphabet, have for years been manipulating what people see by designing algorithms that suppress voices they disagree with and promote voices they think should be promoted. It has been getting worse and worse. Prager University, an online creator of mainstream educational videos, is one of countless prominent voices that has been all but crushed by YouTube, which is now restricting its content. \"We are opening the eyes and the minds of the next generation, one five-minute video at a time ... and the left doesn't like it,\" PragerU founder Dennis Prager said in a recent e-mail about the lawsuit they filed against the video site. \"Silicon Valley giants like YouTube continue to censor the ideas they don't agree with. They promote their Leftist ideology and restrict conservative speech.\" Over 500,000 people have signed a petition supporting PragerU. On Facebook, changes by the site eliminated 99.9999 percent of PragerU's reach. Only after the censorship became a national scandal did Facebook back down and apologize.</p><p>The censorship is so out of control that even YouTube creators who simply talked about Alex Jones got penalized. Comically, the popular H3 podcast was taken down while it was defending YouTube's decision to censor Jones. Apparently the name Alex Jones in the title triggered some sort of automatic censorship program that caused the broadcast to be taken down and the channel to receive a penalty.</p><p>Even when it isn't actively censoring things, YouTube is now increasingly trying to sway public opinion. For instance, on videos dealing with \"climate change,\" the social-media giant owned by Google's parent company now adds disclaimers aimed at building up support for the increasingly discredited man-made globalwarming hypothesis.</p><p>Establishment leftists funded by billionaire globalist George Soros developed a complex plan to target conservatives online. In a leaked 2017 document called \"Democracy Matters: A Strategic Plan for Action,\" far-left Democrat operative David Brock of Media Matters outlined the goals and the strategy. \"In the next four years, Media Matters will continue its core mission of disarming right-wing misinformation, while leading the fight against the next generation of conservative information: The proliferation of fake news and propaganda now threatening the country's information ecosystem,\" explains the memo, with \"fake news\" defined as anything that contradicts the establishment's narrative. Among the goals is ensuring the \"defeat [of] Trump either through impeachment or at the ballot box in 2020.\" And to do so, the group boasts of working with social-media giants and Google to limit conservative voices while boosting the reach of voices they support.</p><p>As an illustration of just how far the tech giants can and will go to purge dissidents from the World Wide Web, an astounding case from fall of 2017 offers a troubling picture. Basically, when an obscure racist made fun of a victim of what was reported to be a racist attack, he was completely disappeared from the Internet, with his hosting company taking down his website entirely. Virtually nobody defended the speech itself, but even the CEO of one of the companies that disappeared the Nazi \"Daily Stormer\" site in question expressed concerns. \"Literally, I woke up in a bad mood and decided someone shouldn't be allowed on the Internet,\" the CEO of Cloudflare was quoted as saying in an email to employees. \"No one should have that power.\" And just as countless analysts and pundits predicted, it did not take long for the purge to spread and accelerate.</p><p>For those who, despite all the evidence, still wonder whether the purge is political, a brief survey of all the anti-Christian bigotry and the open calls for violence against conservatives plastered all over social media should suffice. Indeed, as if to prove how radically left-wing the Internet companies' views are, many of them have openly partnered with the far-left Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). Founded by Morris Dees, who was accused in court documents of sexually molesting his stepdaughter, the radical group has become a bad joke even to mainstream left-wing activists. Just in recent years, it has smeared a prominent Muslim as a top \"anti-Muslim extremist,\" a Cherokee Indian married to one of Sacajawea's descendants as the \"matriarch\" of the \"anti-Indian movement,\" and a prominent black law professor as a supporter of white supremacy. Even the mild-mannered Ben Carson was deemed an \"extremist\" by the SPLC for supporting marriage.</p><p>By contrast, the group had nothing but glowing praise for communist terrorist Bill Ayers, whose murderous terror group, working with Castro's intelligence services, murdered American police, bombed the Capitol and the State Department, and made plans to re-educate and exterminate millions of Americans with help from foreign communist dictators. Leading U.S. Christian groups such as the American Family Association have labeled the SPLC an \"anti-Christian hate group.\" Left-wing activists have denounced it as a moneymaking scam. And yet, virtually all of the tech giants have jumped in bed with the radical group, alienating millions of Christians and conservatives in the process.</p><p>Calls for More Purges</p><p>But of course, alienating those who care about honesty and free speech is OK with liberal powerbrokers - both those liberals on the Internet and those in government - because the end game is to so marginalize conservatives that they will be afraid to speak up lest they feel leftist wrath. The totalitarians are desperate to regain control of the narrative and have no intention of allowing Jones and others to continue reaching the masses - much less reaching them with essential information that undermines the establishment's propaganda talking points and agenda. And some of the most virulent would-be totalitarians in government have already dropped the mask.</p><p>Consider Senator Chris Murphy (DConn.), who has an atrocious 14-percent cumulative score for voting constitutionally on The New American magazine's Freedom Index. Shortly after Infowars was taken down, Murphy made clear that this is just the beginning. \"Infowars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart,\" he fumed on social media, perhaps oblivious to the irony of using social media to tear America apart while complaining about the same. \"These companies must do more than take down one website. The survival of our democracy depends on it.\" Setting aside the fact that Murphy apparently does not even know what form of government America's Founders created - a republic - the threat was unmistakable: Censor more voices or face the wrath of lawmakers and establishment globalists. He did not cite any examples of \"hate\" or \"lies\" spread by Infowars.</p><p>Another U.S. senator, Democrat Mark Warner of Virginia (Freedom Index score: 11), went even further, brazenly proposing a government takeover of the Internet. In a leaked proposal widely blasted by critics as a plan for a \"fascist takeover\" of the Internet, Warner called for new rules for social-media companies that would force them to take down \"fake news\" and other content. The scheme, entitled \"Potential Policy Proposals for Regulation of Social Media and Technology Firms,\" would also provide federal funding to \"media literacy programs\" that would supposedly help consumers sort through information online and help them determine what is true and what is not. The scheme seeks \"more disclosure requirements for online political speech,\" too.</p><p>Under the guise of stopping \"Russia,\" the plan would also end online anonymity, demanding that social-media platforms \"authenticate and disclose the geographic origin of all user accounts or posts.\" Basically, \"mandatory identity verification,\" a gambit that was earlier pursued by Obama, would force everyone to provide proof of their identity to social-media giants. Of course, the Founding Fathers often published anonymously - see the Federalist Papers. And still today, journalists, whistleblowers, and people with unpopular political opinions regularly rely on anonymity to be able to function online. Ironically, all of the scheming is said to be needed to protect trust in \"our institutions, democracv. free press, and markets.\" _</p><p>\"The size and reach of these platforms demand that we ensure proper oversight, transparency and effective management of technologies that in large measure undergird our social lives, our economy, and our politics,\" the policy paper argues. \"The hope is that the ideas enclosed here stir the pot and spark a wider discussion - among policymakers, stakeholders, and civil society groups - on the appropriate trajectory of technology policy in the coming years.\" Basically, the plan seems to be to put Bigger Brother government in charge of Big Brother technology companies to finish demolishing Internet freedom. Of course, many of the companies - Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and others - are already in bed with government. Some analysts suggested the massive, coordinated assault on Infowars may have been sparked by word of Warner's proposals.</p><p>Even if the government does not overtly take over, though, the jihad against free speech and content that exposes the establishment's lies will continue to become mor\u0119 brazen and more sophisticated. Microsoft, for instance, threatened to shut down an entire social network, Twitter alternative Gab.ai, because one user posted anti-Semitic comments. And Mozilla, an organization that once defended online freedom but fell to the left and even chased out its leader for supporting heterosexual marriage, has now teamed up with a George Soros-funded \"fact-checking\" service to develop the \"Mozilla Information Trust Initiative.\" Google has also started adding far-left \"fact check\" results that are notorious sources of disinformation, including the discredited Snopes.com. And Twitter CEO Dorsey proposed creating new rules for Twitter based on the UN \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\" which explicitly states that rights and freedoms may not be used contrary to the purposes and principles of the UN.</p><p>The battle to disseminate truth to the masses has been raging for centuries. But with the stakes now higher than ever, Americans must redouble their efforts. *</p><p>The bans and censorship show that globalists now realize their lies cannot compete with truth even in a rigged marketplace of ideas replete with \"shadowbanning,\" promoting establishment voices, and more - much less in a true free market of ideas.</p><p>Consider that of America's top l OO newspapers-just two endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Virtually every major media outlet in America spent endless hours demonizing Trump as a racist, a hater, a sexist, a kook, a conspiracy theorist, etc.</p><p>Schemes included hiding alternative voices via \"shadow-banning,\" promoting establishment voices via manipulated algorithms, and eventually, outright banning of those who question the establishment's narrative too vigorously or successfully.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2113739906</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB1-BDR1-DY0W-44GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4376\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New American Sep 17, 2018</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol. 34</volume><issueNumber>No. 18</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 17, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Her paper[2] [PDF] points out policy changes that have been made by several tech companies not in response to users or US government activity, but to get out ahead of increasing regulatory pressure[3] in Europe. In the recent past, these platforms routinely defended the rights of everyone around the world to engage in free speech, even if that meant offending local governments. Now, with the internet headed towards enforced Balkanization[4] backed by hefty fines, US companies are now routinely engaging in preemptive censorship of content perfectly legal in the US (and arguably legal elsewhere).More recently, social media companies have revised their speech policies concerning extremist and hateful expression. </p><p>Unlike previous changes, however, these revisions were not the result of market forces. They were not made to accommodate the wishes of advertisers and advocates. Instead, they were adopted to stave off threatened European regulation. After terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels in late 2015, European regulators excoriated tech companies for failing to combat terrorist recruitment on their platforms. Their message was clear: online platforms would face onerous civil and criminal penalties unless their policies and processes resulted in the rapid removal of extremist speech.As Citron points out, much of the content being taken down by Google and others isn't even illegal under more extreme speech laws passed in European nations. The laws written in response to tragedies have managed to turn social media platforms into tools of government oppression.All of this might enjoy some justification if EU regulators focused their efforts on speech proscribed in their countries. But this has not been the case. Calls to remove hate speech have quickly ballooned to cover expression that does not violate existing European law, including 'online radicalization' and 'fake news.' EU officials have pressed a view of hate speech that can be extended to political dissent and newsworthy developments. At risk is censorship creep on a global scale.Companies headquartered in the nation with the most free speech protections are turning their back on protecting free speech. Overblown fears of radicalization have resulted in the removal of content with inherent journalistic value (not to mention possible investigative value) and efforts to clamp down[5] on something no one can seem to define (\"fake news\") is turning American companies against American values. While there is something to be said about taking steps to prevent the spread of terrorism, the attack on \"fake news\" presents a real threat to free speech, when all that's at stake there is the careers of politicians and their spin doctors. The paper notes that it isn't just current laws forcing this change. It's the threat of even more direct regulation of internet service providers. To head off more draconian measures, platforms are trying to guess what lawmakers might find offensive, often aided by moderation-via-heckler's-veto: policing content reported by users. The results have already been disastrous, turning European regulation of speech into darkly-comic embarrassments[6]. What's being targeted by these haphazard efforts are topics of conversation where more speech, rather than less, would be extraordinarily useful. Terrorism is worldwide problem but a bunch of memory-holing isn't going to make it go away. Convincing those inclined to radicalization to step away from the precipice takes social interaction, as much of it public as possible. If nothing else, a social media paper trail can help track down those who've decided to do harm to others. The same goes for \"fake news.\" It needs fact-checking, debunking, and rebuttals. Simply making it vanish only further convinces those already swayed by fake news that the content of removed articles must be so full of truth, the government/Big Tech/George Soros paid to have it deleted from the public consciousness. Efforts like these breed conspiracy theorists, rather than deter them. And it's not just about what's already happening, no matter how disturbing that is. It's what will happen if tech companies don't reverse course and stop acquiescing to every request to engage in further content moderation. Mission creep will set in, pushed along by legislators who'd like to see all sorts of speech they don't like removed from the internet.Without clear guidelines and specific examples, vague terms are vulnerable to revision and expansion. Consider the Code's definition of 'illegal hate speech': speech inciting violence or hatred against a group or a member of such a group based on race, religion, national, or ethnic origin. Inciting hatred against a group is an ambiguous concept. It could be interpreted to cover speech widely understood as hateful, such as describing members of a religious group as vermin responsible for crime and disease. But it could also be understood as covering speech that many would characterize as newsworthy. Given the term's ambiguity, incitement of hatred could extend to criticism of Catholics for covering up priests' sexual exploitation of children. It could be interpreted as applying to speech challenging Islamic fundamentalism for its homophobia or suppression of women. It could be extended to speech exposing hatred faced by racial minorities.The lawmakers who've set this system in motion can't be trusted to rein it in before it causes real damage. As Citron notes, they haven't been honest and open about their intentions to this point. There's no reason to believe honesty and transparency are just over the horizon.Despite the protestations of EU regulators, they are neither voluntary nor the product of meaningful public-private partnerships. Instead, they are the result of government coercion occurring outside the rule of law. What is different about the pressure from states now is that it has brought about changes that risk worldwide censorship creep. Because governments are using terms of service to achieve their ends, the resulting suppression of speech will be global.The internet is the world's greatest communications tool. It's no wonder so many governments seek to control it. That part isn't surprising. What is both surprising and horrifying is how accommodating major platforms have become. While it's understandable they're uninterested in losing large numbers of users in other countries, they've made decisions to block or delete content that isn't illegal in many of the countries affected by these moderation efforts. What is blocked as \"clear\" violations of some country's law isn't so clear when given a second look. Even the most heinous terrorism-related posting has value outside of its recruitment drive purpose. The public deserves to know what's being done to humans around the world in the name of major religions. Hate speech -- something nearly as poorly defined as \"fake news\" -- has its own value, although little of it is in the words said. It helps those targeted identify possibly dangerous bigots. It lets everyone else know how little value this person adds to a discussion. If it's deleted and its purveyors' accounts suspended, it only serves to harden their hatred and inflate their perception of themselves. Instead of being ignorant and useless, they'll feel they threaten the status quo with the powerful truths, hence the censorship and \"persecution\" by powerful corporations and governments. More speech is always better than less speech. But the snowballs rolling downhill from Google, Facebook, and Twitter are gathering speed. And those who feel the only speech worth protecting is speech they like are winning, in some cases without even having to lift a legislative finger.Permalink[7] | Comments[8] | Email This Story[9] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140820/17420428271/attacks-anonymity-conflate-anonymous-speech-with-trollish-behavior.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140820/17420428271/attacks-anonymity-conflate-anonymous-speech-with-trollish-behavior.shtml</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4407811/Citron-03.pdf\">https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4407811/Citron-03.pdf</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180303/12223539345/eu-commission-says-social-media-companies-must-take-down-terrorist-content-within-one-hour.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180303/12223539345/eu-commission-says-social-media-companies-must-take-down-terrorist-content-within-one-hour.shtml</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160531/17513134587/top-internet-companies-agree-to-vague-notice-takedown-rules-hate-speech-eu.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160531/17513134587/top-internet-companies-agree-to-vague-notice-takedown-rules-hate-speech-eu.shtml</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180105/12051938940/really-bad-ideas-french-president-macron-wants-to-ban-fake-news-during-election.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180105/12051938940/really-bad-ideas-french-president-macron-wants-to-ban-fake-news-during-election.shtml</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180111/15543538989/second-time-week-german-hate-speech-laws-results-deletion-innocent-speech.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180111/15543538989/second-time-week-german-hate-speech-laws-results-deletion-innocent-speech.shtml</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180313/08451839411/censorship-creep-is-setting-as-social-media-companies-try-to-stay-ahead-european-lawmakers.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180313/08451839411/censorship-creep-is-setting-as-social-media-companies-try-to-stay-ahead-european-lawmakers.shtml</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180313/08451839411/censorship-creep-is-setting-as-social-media-companies-try-to-stay-ahead-european-lawmakers.shtml#comments\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180313/08451839411/censorship-creep-is-setting-as-social-media-companies-try-to-stay-ahead-european-lawmakers.shtml#comments</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180313/08451839411/censorship-creep-is-setting-as-social-media-companies-try-to-stay-ahead-european-lawmakers.shtml?op=sharethis\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180313/08451839411/censorship-creep-is-setting-as-social-media-companies-try-to-stay-ahead-european-lawmakers.shtml?op=sharethis</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIRT1023051521154381828251761700046</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIRT-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RWB-VS61-JCMN-Y0G4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1573\"/><timeReceived>10:53 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Techdirt</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Last Monday, some social media companies that carry InfoWars took a stand. Facebook, Spotify and YouTube, among others, removed Jones' accounts from their platforms. They said InfoWars violated their terms of use. Twitter, though, refused to take down InfoWars. CEO Jack Dorsey said the Alex Jones site had not violated its rules, which prohibit direct threats of violence and some forms of hate speech.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                The handling of Alex Jones and his InfoWars poses a big question - what is the responsibility of social media platforms to moderate misinformation or incendiary viewpoints? To answer that question, we have invited Kara Swisher, editor of the tech news site Recode, and also Mark Penn. He's a former Microsoft executive and was a longtime political aide to the Clintons. They wrote opinion pieces on this issue that appeared in The New York Times and The Hill.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                Kara, let's begin with you. You criticized Twitter for its decision to not ban Alex Jones. Why?             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 Because they've spent years and years not dealing with these issues for a long time. By the way, Alex Jones has violated terms of service at Twitter, as pointed out by CNN and many others. And so my issue is that they've taken a very, very long time to deal with an issue they've been very much aware of, and they've sort of wrapped themselves around an axle on this one and never dealt with it fully.             </p><p>LAKSHMI SINGH:                 Mark, let's turn to you. In your piece, you warned about big tech becoming Big Brother. But let's look at the consequences of Alex Jones' conspiracy theories. A man believed the Pizzagate story that Jones promoted during the 2016 election cycle and took an assault rifle and fired inside that establishment. Shouldn't media platforms actually regulate this kind of speech?             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 Well, look - we are a First Amendment society. We were founded on the First Amendment. We don't hold people responsible for speech that doesn't create a threat of imminent violence. If his speech did create a threat of imminent violence, our legal system would hold him responsible. If we are, in effect, going to have these enormous platforms that were meant to be open platforms now decide what gets listened to and what's not, there's no limit to what could happen here or how social pressure can put people in vogue one day and out vogue the next.             </p><p>                Look, I've never read Alex Jones (laughter). I don't have any intention to. But 2 1/2 million people subscribe to his channel. That says somebody's interested in it. And, in a free society where somebody is completely accountable, visible - he says who he is. He's not an anonymous bot - he should not be censored unless he violates those basic rules by which we live in this society.             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 You know, Mark, it's not censorship. It's - this is a private company. That - just the way Disney fired Roseanne, anybody can do anything on private companies. These are not governments. And that's what happens...             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 Oh, I...             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 ...Here. They make it into this First Amendment thing. It's not a First Amendment - he can be...             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 ...It's wrong.             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 He can create a website. He can...             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 I'm saying that...             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 He can create a website...             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 These platforms...             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 He can create a website...             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 ...Are semi-monopolies. They have tremendous power, and it is a failing of the First Amendment and our legislation that it doesn't cover these emerging platforms...             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 Right, exactly.             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 ...Because these are the only places that people can genuinely have a voice. And if they're subject to censorship at the whim of Mark Zuckerberg or the head of Twitter, or you're pushing the head of Twitter to censor somebody - well, we're going to lose the open democracy that we have, and that's far more dangerous than allowing some kooks some airtime. And that has always been our judgment.             </p><p>LAKSHMI SINGH:                 We know that media outlets - we have radio stations, we have, you know, publications that - you know, they decide every day what to run and what to restrict. You know, the Constitution, as you've noted, bars only the government from restricting free speech. But we have media outlets that decide on a daily basis what should be restricted and what should be run. And they don't believe in censorship, but it's about responsibility. So why shouldn't the public expect the same of these tech giants such as Facebook or YouTube to exercise a similar kind of editorial judgment?             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 Well, because these companies were set up as platforms, open platforms in which media companies could then go on the platform and broadcast, much like, say, cable TV. Now, if the companies themselves are going to be media companies, then that's a different role, and they have to be regulated under an entirely different set of protections and rules of the road. Because now they're media companies, and so Congress gave them a special exemption because they were platforms that they're basically not responsible for almost all the content on their platforms. If instead they're going to be media companies, we've got to take that away and treat them as media companies.             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 But, you know, Mark, they...             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 It's complete different.             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 Mark...             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 I'd like to see them stay platforms.             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 Mark, they are not platforms anymore. They're media companies. And they're a different kind of media company. And what they've done is they've ridden on the backs of media companies and taken all of the economics out of it, which has hurt media companies. And then they are essentially media companies.             </p><p>                Now, maybe it's a new kind of media company. Maybe our legislators have to pay a lot more attention and figure out how to do this, although I have grave doubts about that. It's a situation where they get all the benefits and none of the responsibilities, and I would like them to step up and have responsibilities. The minute you do that, you're called - you're saying you want to censor them. You absolutely do not want - I want them to have values and rules and standards like I have to have on my site and any media company has to have.             </p><p>LAKSHMI SINGH:                 But, Kara, you write that Twitter has become a cesspool of hate speech...             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 Yes.             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 ...In recent years. That hate speech may be unpleasant. It may even be...             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 Absolutely.             </p><p>LAKSHMI SINGH:                 ...As one colleague put it, deplorable. But should such comments actually be banned? I mean, where do you draw the line when it comes to expressing personal views that may be highly uncomfortable for the next person?             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 That is something Twitter has to decide. But they can decide that and then reap the problems or the benefits from it. They have created this platform, and they have very little control of it. And then they throw up their hands and say whatever, and I don't think that is an answer now. Now, things have changed and got - have changed rather quickly with these companies having enormous powers. But you can see what happens when a platform is abused. And look at what happened with Facebook and the Russians. They weren't paying attention. They were at - now, they're like...             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 Oh, come on.             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 ...So, so sorry.             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 You know, this is...             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 They...             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 ...Just a gross exaggeration.             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 No, it's not a gross exaggeration.             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 There's...             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 Mark...             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 ...140 million posts a day on Facebook.             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 I'm so sorry they're big, but they still have responsibility for their platform. They - absolutely they have...             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 Well, they should get rid of bots and do an efficient job, but that has nothing to do with censoring anything.             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 My - sorry.             </p><p>LAKSHMI SINGH:                 No, go ahead, Kara. Go ahead.             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 No. My - I'm not talking about the censoring. They don't have responsibility of their platforms. What I want is some really thoughtful people taking control of this and acting like the adults they need to be on these platforms.             </p><p>LAKSHMI SINGH:                 OK, we're going to have to leave it there. Kara Swisher is the editor at large of the tech news website Recode and contributing writer for The New York Times. And Mark Penn is a former Microsoft executive and opinion contributor for The Hill.             </p><p>                Kara, Mark, thank you so much for speaking with us.             </p><p>MARK PENN:                 Thank you.             </p><p>KARA SWISHER:                 Thank you.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRWTC-201808111908</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRWTC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T15-V0Y1-JBJH-314H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429284</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1694\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Weekend All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 11, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A similar amendment was proposed, and then scrapped, earlier this year, with the July 29 decision following overwhelming criticism of the proposed law by human rights and free speech advocates. The promulgation of the social media amendment marks the streamlining of Ankara's increasingly powerful and consolidated censorship model, and has critical implications for the future of free speech and political participation in Turkey and beyond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What the law requires</p><p>The law would require the most popular foreign social media sites, which count 54 million Turkish users, to appoint Turkey-based representatives to address authorities' concerns over content and includes deadlines for its removal. Platforms with more than one million users, including Facebook, Twitter, and other companies popular for social networking and news consumption in the country, could face fines, blocked advertisements, or drastically reduced bandwidth that would effectively block users' access. Article six of the legislation, termed the content removal clause, requires social media companies to rapidly respond to requests for the erasure of digital content, and sites that fail to comply within 48 hours risk stiff fines. Previously, Turkish authorities have exercised censorship by lodging complaints with pliant courts to restrict access to unfavorable digital content via local network providers, and these takedown requests have only increased as social media networks have grown in use and impact; Ankara froze access to 130,000 websites, 7,000 Twitter accounts, and 10,000 YouTube videos in 2019 alone, according to a recent report by the Freedom of Expression Association. Crucially, 67 percent of Turks report using social media as a primary news source, a figure far higher than the global average.[1] The centrality of social media in Turkish news and information consumption, social networking, and popular dissent means that any threat to expression via these channels has far greater and more far-reaching implications for Turkey than media markets of equivalent size. In other words, an increasingly repressive Turkish public square online will almost certainly get a lot smaller.</p><p>As a faster, more consolidated, and punitive alternative, the new regulation places the burden of censoring content on social media firms themselves. While platforms may reject effacement requests, the amendment stipulates an explanation as to the grounds for denial. But stringent compliance parameters namely the narrow response window preclude such a detailed response, rendering this redress mechanism null-by-design. And the requirement for platforms to appoint Turkish nationals as government representatives controlling platforms' content seems designed to encourage government-led censorship of speech or content that it deems threatening or unsavory.</p><p>Initially, the draft bill featured a clause requiring social media platforms to store user data locally. The provision sparked a flurry of concerns. Turkey lacks the infrastructure necessary to store and properly safeguard vast troves of user data. Critics also worry that locally stored data would be easy pickings for law enforcement inspection and surveillance, jeopardizing potential space for dissent and free speech. While the final version of the legislation omitted such a clause, Gurkan Ozturan, the executive director of dokuz8news, suspects a data localization amendment may be on the horizon.</p><p>Impact on civil society</p><p>The law also threatens to limit the margin of maneuver of Turkey's embattled civil society. With vast swathes of the mainstream media controlled by government affiliates, civil society relies on social media platforms to circulate information, mobilize support, and secure accountability. Describing social media as a critical tool for attaining justice, Deniz Yuksel, Turkey advocacy specialist at Amnesty InternationalUSA, points to the harrowing example of the case of Sule Cet, a 23-year-old student murdered in May 2018. Yuksel noted: \"Social media campaigns have a decisive role in securing justice for many marginalized communities in Turkey. Hundreds of thousands of posts with the hashtag #SuleCetIcinAdalet (Justice for Sule Cet) circulated on social media for over a year after two men raped and murdered Sule Cet. In December 2019, public pressure compelled authorities to convict the perpetrators.\" Observers fear the new regulations will hamstring civil society's use of social media and close off alternative avenues to redress. These concerns are shared by Yuksel, who emphasizes that, \"Increasing government oversight over social media also means that calls for justice can easily be censored, denying victims the only opportunity to publicize wrongdoings and seek due process.\" In short, the amendment is aimed directly at the potential for social media companies like Twitter and Facebook to serve as channels for citizens to seek government accountability and transparency, and may do much to threaten the future of independent movements for a more democratic Turkey.</p><p>Ozturan, who also serves as the secretary-general of the Turkish Media Research Association, characterizes the content removal clause as a brazen assault on Turkey's \"digital memory.\" Concerns abound that the Turkish government may exploit the clause to scrub traces of unsavory episodes sustained throughout the AKP's tenure corruption scandals, police abuses, and botched disaster relief efforts. An effort to burnish the ruling party's battered credentials by pruning compromising digital content may result in vast information vacuums, ushering in a sanitized or entirely separate Turkish internet. In an era when the documentation of government and human rights abuses is most readily and easily documented, preserved, and discussed online, the erasure of a country's digital political history in some ways amounts to the slow erasure of a space for civil society.</p><p>How will platforms respond?</p><p>Critically, the major platforms likely to be impacted by this policy change have yet to comment on this potential intervention with their business model, with companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram remaining silent at the time of this writing. This strategy seems to follow that of many influential technology companies, which allows for a balancing act between expanding platforms' reach in an increasingly saturated marketplace and growing calls to tailor their products to the particular regional and political context of users. This comes in the wake of a global reckoning with major tech platforms' growing political power, as well as increased scrutiny of the ways in which this power has been amplified by a new reliance on online communication and work in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although major platforms like Facebook and Twitter have attempted to do more to provide more open information about their interaction with governments, including some transparency reporting and the hiring of more staff with geopolitical and human rights expertise, Turkey's move could be an indication of how the major platforms may handle increasingly dire questions of exploitation of their tools by non-democratic governments.</p><p>Turkey's push to neuter social media mirrors a creeping tendency toward censorship that is gaining traction across the region. Last month, an Egyptian court jailed two female TikTok personalities on charges of violating public morals. Amid a catastrophic financial crisis, Lebanese security services are routinely summoning, and berating, citizens for unfavorable online commentary, while Palestinian authorities are abusing pandemic-induced emergency legislation to trample digital rights. These episodes signal the growing tenacity of governments to patrol, and rein in, previously out of reach digital frontiers. This resolve presages further assaults on social media, which may erode its utility as a channel for critical exchange and news circulation. In the same week that representatives from Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon were summoned for testimony by a Congress increasingly concerned with the overreach and political power of these companies, Turkey's decision should serve as a clear warning about the potential further erosion of big tech's willingness to stand its ground on issues of free and open speech.

Understanding and cherishing the shared values incorporated in the various institutions used to signify upright citizenship. Amongst these values, the rule of law, freedom of expression, basic human rights, etc. stand out! Unfortunately, as societies became more hierarchical and regimented, as is the case today, certain inalienable rights of individuals were visibly devalued. The integrity system gradually gave way to superficial concerns that prioritized the protection of entrenched powers more than anything. The 'deep state' of the industrially advanced countries is a living proof of this generalized societal degradation!</p><p>Freedom of expression is one of those societal values that is being eroded in our hyper technical modernity. The modern informatics that flourished around the 1990s started out by empowering the typical global sheeple (human mass). As technical complexity increased and consolidation within the sector accelerated, the big corporation came to dominate the creation and distribution of information. Today only six corporations in the US account for over 90% of broadcasting! The states themselves have become enthusiastic collaborators in these undemocratic undertakings. See the articles next column, on page 28  and  41. To be sure, the traditional media outlets (print media, cables, etc.) have been losing their turf to the new informatics. In fact, many of them have completely collapsed. Some of the significant ones were bought out by the new tech giants, with the explicit support of the states. Amazon, Google, etc., are now, amongst other things, the new media giants! The extensive reach these tech giants have developed has become a threat to global democracy. As a result, the positive and empowering aspect of the new informatics are being lost swiftly. For instance, the US government has already paved the way for the big tech companies to regulate the flow of Internet traffic, as they wish, thereby undermining the traditionally democratic nature of the Internet!</p><p>Surveillance has always been the hallmark of new informatics. In its latest version, the gadgets of surveillance range from the modest mobile phones to lap tops/desktops all the way to the big mainframe computers used by institutions. The Internet itself is comprised of worldwide networks to facilitate espionages. Thanks to people like Edward Snowden, the global sheeple is now aware of the various manipulative technics employed by the global power that be (TPTB). The 'totalitarian' nature of our modern existence is no more in dispute! Even in the states of the periphery, surveillance has become one of the main functions of the state. Controlling the masses remains one of the objectives of modern states, poor or rich!</p><p>Outright censorship is also one of the objectives of modern states. The 'deep state' is fully collaborating with the new tech firms, in this particular regard. Thanks to people like Manning and Assange, the world has started to get real and valid information about the workings of the 'deep state.' Wikileaks has revealed plenty about the evil projects of the powerful states. Information that has been suppressed for years is now coming to light. False flags that were used as excuses to start wars; assassinations of activists/freedom fighters/peaceful revolutionaries, etc. that were hidden from the public eyes are being revealed by the peaceful warriors of Wikileaks and their likes. Obviously, the 'deep state' is out to get those who are at the forefront of these exposures. Assange and Snowden are already criminalized and condemned by TPTB because they dared to tell the truth. Many others have not been so lucky!</p><p>When misinformation becomes one of the main objectives of entrenched interests, the global sheeple has to start fighting back. To this end, the need for comprehensive community media becomes paramount. If truth be told, the future of private media is very bleak. To start with, these outlets depend on their sponsors for their commercial survival/revenues. Moreover, promoters, by and large, are not very much into telling the truth, rather they are interested in what sells. Usually it is 'make believe' that sells, not necessarily the truth. That is why we have been advocating community media for years. Fully funded by taxpayers, but independently run by elected citizenry and unaffiliated with entrenched interests, is what should be the future of information communication. The sheeple need to have access to the whole truth and not only to those preached by the state and the paid-media!</p><p>'Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle. The real extent of this state of misinformation is known only to those who are in situations to confront facts within their knowledge with the lies of the day.' -Thomas Jefferson to John Norvell, 1807. Good Day!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPETH-CAPETH31012018000553</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPETH2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RJ8-9J11-F00C-628M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433697</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"841\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Crown Publishing All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Capital Ethiopia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 31, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

KROLL, SVP, FINANCE &amp; IR, CENTENE CORPORATION: It's 8:30, so we're going to begin our Investor Day. Good morning. I'm Ed Kroll, Head of Investor Relations for Centene. Thank you for joining us on our June 2019 investor meeting. Momentarily, we will post slides from today's presentation on the home page of our website at centene.com. So those of you who are joining us by webcast today can follow along with the presentations here in the room.</p><p>As we always do, there will be 2 Q&amp;A sessions as part of the program today. We'll have microphones available in the room so those of you here with us can ask a question. And for those of you on the webcast that want to ask a question, you can e-mail me that question at ekroll, K-R-O-L-L, @centene.com, and we'll get you into the queue.</p><p>Now for the obligatory forward-looking statements, which you see up there on the screen. Please...</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, CENTENE CORPORATION: You're not going to read the whole thing, are you?</p><p>EDMUND E. KROLL: No. Thankfully. I did that once for those of you that may remember. Please note that various remarks we make today regarding future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements under U.S. securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the slide you see in front of you and the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed quarterly report with the SEC and other SEC filings. Centene disclaims any obligation to update this forward-looking financial information in the future.</p><p>Additionally, during this presentation, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP, that is generally accepted accounting principles, financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the slides you see in front of you, which are also available on our website at centene.com.</p><p>Please mark your calendars for our second quarter earnings call on Tuesday, July 23, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>When you leave today, as you turn in your badge, we have a Centene backpack for you as our gift, so we hope you enjoy it and find it useful.</p><p>I will now turn the meeting over to our Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer, Michael Neidorff. Michael?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Thank you. Good morning. I'm going to ask our team to stand up for a minute so you know who they are. We're still celebrating a victory in hockey this past week. And there's a couple of new members of the team, future members of the team. So I've asked for them too, Drew and Ken? Where's Ken?</p><p>KENNETH ALAN BURDICK, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, WELLCARE HEALTH PLANS, INC.: Here I am.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Oh my God. Okay. Thank you, Ed. Can we lower this a little bit? Thank you. That's good. Perfect. Fine. Thank you, Ed.</p><p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our 2019 June Investor Day. Before we begin, we'd like to share the following video.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: That reminds us why we're in this business and how our people, programs, partnerships and investments are all working to improve the health of our members and communities.</p><p>I'll start today by saying that Centene has a long history of consistent outperformance, disciplined growth and shareholder returns. We continue to diversify and add capabilities, driving significant revenue and earnings growth and greater opportunities for margin expansion. We are leveraging the best of our systems and expertise to lead and move beyond simply influencing, but towards a more sophisticated and modernized management of health care costs.</p><p>At our Investor Day in 2016, we presented to you as a $40 billion -- excuse me.</p><p>EDMUND E. KROLL: Do you need a doctor with regards to him?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: We're going to take a pause for a few moments for those of you on the webcast. For those of you on the webcast, we had a little medical emergency here that's now been dealt with. Everything's fine, so we'll continue.</p><p>At our Investor Day in June of 2016, we presented to you as a $40 billion company; and in June of 2018, a $60 billion company. Today, with the pending acquisition of WellCare, we present with the potential of becoming a $100 billion premier health care enterprise. This firmly solidifies our 2020 vision of being the industry leader in government-sponsored health care. Over the course of the morning, we will speak in more detail about the WellCare transaction. However, I do not want that to overshadow the ongoing and successful growth and performance of Centene.</p><p>We are still very much a growth company demonstrating our leadership in the industry, independent of WellCare deal. Centene has climbed to #51 on the Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies by revenue. We were also ranked #1 fastest-growing company based on the growth in revenue over a 10-year period and #5 over a 5-year period. This is reflective of the value we have delivered to our shareholders. Growth in our revenue and earnings have achieved compounded annual revenues and returns at a shareholder price of 25% over the past 5 years and 29% over the past 10 years, both as of May 31, 2019.</p><p>Our success continues to be driven by balanced results across our business segments and reflects the strength of our diversify-and-diversification strategy. Like a good fund manager, this strategy allows us to absorb the ups and downs in rate cycles, markets and subsidiary performance. This ensures no one part of the portfolio can jeopardize the whole. The business products and service lines within the portfolio continue to be an essential part of our growth engine. 20 of these businesses are over $1 billion and 7 are over $2.5 billion in estimated 2019 annual revenue. By leveraging our portfolio, Centene is now bringing approximately 350 solutions to 32 states, covering 14.7 million U.S. members and over 700,000 individuals in multiple international markets.</p><p>Centene remains the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the country and the leader in the 4 largest Medicaid states of California, Florida, New York and Texas. The integration of both Health Net and Fidelis have gone smoothly and targeted synergies and accretion levels are being realized and are on track, or really, ahead of schedule. We continue to win Medicaid RFPs in new and existing states, as evidenced by our recent wins in New Mexico, Iowa, North Carolina and the reprocurement of New Hampshire, upholding our industry-leading RFP win rate of 80%.</p><p>Additionally, we expect the Medicaid business segment to continue to grow as states are increasingly outsourcing more complex patient populations, which is an area of long-held expertise for Centene.</p><p>Centene continues to be the national leader in the Health Insurance Marketplace. Ambetter is now serving approximately 2 million exchange members across 20 states and, as expected, is performing well and achieving our targeted margins. Should margins exceed our targeted range of pretax 5% to 10%, any excess would be used to reduce the cost of premiums or enhance benefits for our members. We also continue to see higher than expected member retention and consistency in key demographics within our membership base, and we'll provide more detailed updates later in the program.</p><p>Going into the next decade, we expect our Medicare line of business to be a key driver of our annual growth. We expect our 4-star MA parent rating, along with our strategic joint venture with Ascension and the addition of WellCare's high-performing MA platform to accelerate profitable growth in this segment of the business. We have done a lot of work on plan design and risk-based contracting and are planning further modifications with the addition of these new capabilities.</p><p>Centene remains the largest provider of managed long-term services and support. And our Centurion product is the country's largest provider of state correctional health care. Additionally, we continue to see momentum internationally. Effective at the end of this month, we will have controlling equity interest in our Spanish subsidiary, Ribera Salud, pending regulatory approval.</p><p>We also expect further growth across our international markets in the remaining quarters of the year as we work to grow our global presence. I'll remind our investors that our growing international business does not distract us or impede our ability to continue to pursue the ample growth opportunities in the United States. You will also hear more about how our health care enterprise group continues to drive integration and innovation throughout the organization, leading to improved health outcomes and the development of more efficient care models.</p><p>The building of provider relationships is something Centene has been shaping for years. Our USMM subsidiary is the country's largest home-based primary care ACO. Additionally, we continue to leverage our recent investment in MHM Services and at Community Medical Group to strengthen our provider services specific to our membership. For example, we're working with CMG to establish clinics in underserved areas, and we continue to explore creative ways to merge our payer expertise with the provider expertise of Ribera Salud.</p><p>We are also forming national partnerships with other major corporations like Ascension to deliver a high-quality health care experience, and we'll be discussing this more in future meetings.</p><p>Centene continues to make investments in IT and analytic capabilities. As such, technology has become a core competency of Centene and the common denominator accelerating growth and innovation throughout the enterprise. With it, we are redefining what we can do to transform the health of the community in bold and pioneering ways. This includes next-gen IT platforms, enhanced data analytics and technology-based partnerships such as those being further developed through Interpreta and RxAdvance.</p><p>Later this morning, the team will give you a view of our complex ecosystem and integrated systems approach. We will also highlight how our Centene Forward program is acting as a catalyst to accelerate the delivery of new capabilities. This is just one area in which Centene Forward initiation -- initiative is beginning to generate operating and economic efficiencies. I think you'll find several of these efforts we share with you today compelling and indicative of our relentless pursuit to enhance the agility and culture of excellence that has shaped our success.</p><p>As a reminder, Centene Forward is a key part of our intermediate and long-term margin expansion strategy. Therefore, savings captured will not immediately go to the bottom line in 2019 but are rather self-generating in order to reinvest capital into additional capabilities and technologies. We continue to expect Centene Forward to realize up to $0.5 billion in savings over a multiple year period and the savings being captured are separate and independent of the WellCare synergies.</p><p>More and more, we are asked to comment on the changing winds of political and the headwinds volatility that has become the norm. We speak to these often. However, it's important that we hear from all points of view. With that in mind, we have once again invited a panel of leading experts to speak with you about the current political environment.</p><p>So as we turn now to look ahead, it's important to remember that Centene's long history of growth has been made with deliberate intent, strategic execution and demonstrated ability to integrate. Ribera Salud, Interpreta, RxAdvance, Health Net, Fidelis and soon WellCare have all added expertise and capabilities across the enterprise to better combine our assets and improve our competitive position.</p><p>The strategic acquisition of WellCare is transformational. By bringing together 2 top-performing companies, we are creating a premier health care enterprise and a compelling and diversified portfolio of government-sponsored programs. This acquisition will enhance Centene's industry leadership in Medicaid long-term support services in the marketplace. It will also position Centene to become the fourth largest Medicare provider in the country, as well as a competitive leader for duals. This increased scale will allow us to deploy additional and combine our best-in-class capabilities.</p><p>Further, we see substantial opportunity around the ancillary services and technology as Centene integrates WellCare into its suite of IT digital platforms such as Interpreta, Casenet and RxAdvance. Additionally, this will also significantly increase Centene's scale in pharmacy. On a combined basis, the pro forma annual drug spend will be approximately $30 billion. By adding WellCare, Centene will increase its U.S. footprint from 32 to 50 states, 17 of which contain, at a minimum, all 3 of our Medicaid, Medicare and Marketplace products. This expanded footprint will strengthen Centene's position in key growth markets and continue our successful -- under All Products, All Markets strategy.</p><p>Our ongoing investment in systems has ensured we have the capabilities and scale to accommodate this growth. The combined company will have approximately 23 million recipients, with estimated pro forma 2019 revenues of approximately $100 billion and pro forma EBITDA of $5 billion. I stated earlier that going into the next decade, we expect our Medicare line of business to be a key driver of our annual growth. Strategically, WellCare's strong portfolio of Medicare assets will provide Centene with additional Medicare capabilities, including Medicare Advantage and Part D. This will both strengthen and accelerate the growth of Centene's existing Medicare portfolio once the companies are combined in 2020.</p><p>Both companies share a strong commitment to the communities in which our employees and members live and work. This is a key differentiator for Centene and a core part of WellCare's DNA. The combined company will enhance already robust efforts to address social determinants and other nonmedical barriers to health. Both companies also actually -- are actually aware of the importance of network adequacy and the need to ensure access to high-quality providers. Although we are working as separate companies until the transition is closed, our integration planning teams are working to maintain the relationships currently established with our provider networks and planning for the future risk-based contracting model necessary for the long-term success of the company and providers alike.</p><p>The integration of WellCare will also bring leadership that builds additional capabilities and enhances Centene's management depth and culture of excellence. Last month, we announced that upon completion of the deal, Ken Burdick, current Chief Executive Officer of WellCare; and Drew Asher, current Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of WellCare, will join Centene's executive leadership positions, reporting directly to me. At the governance level, we're looking forward to welcoming 2 new directors from WellCare into Centene's strong and accomplished Board of Directors. These new additions will help enhance and refresh our governance for 2020 and beyond.</p><p>Regulatory discussions are underway and have been constructive. Centene and WellCare each received a request for additional information and documentary information and materials from the federal justice department -- the Federal Department of Justice, which was not unexpected given the size of the deal. We continue to work expeditiously and cooperatively with the DOJ through this process.</p><p>Discussions with appropriate regulatory authorities are underway. The responses have been positive and the states are working with us to capture the best of both companies for their markets. At this point in the process, all Form As and Form Es have been filed, and we have completed our first Form A hearing in Alabama. We expect to have an active summer as Form A reviews continue in other states.</p><p>Last night, we learned, and I want to emphasize in no way do I intend to create an obligation to update you every time we get an approval, but last night, we received word. We received our first approval of a Form A from Kentucky. There are several others pending, and we expect to hear it momentarily. We also expect the momentum to build as the first ones get done.</p><p>Additionally, we are proactively addressing any potential issues in Missouri and Nebraska through a divestiture process that has already commenced. We have already seen a great deal of interest from potential acquirers.</p><p>As you can see on the agenda, I'll spend more time speaking to the integration planning activities already underway and walk you through the leadership structure of the combined company as we close our program today. We are confident that bringing WellCare into Centene's portfolio will provide significant value to our collective shareholders. We believe this deal positions Centene well for long-term growth and solidifies our position as a transformational leader in government services health care. Based on our actions thus far, we continue to maintain our time line for approval and we're looking forward to providing updates as we move through the transaction process.</p><p>So in closing, you will see over the course of today that Centene continues to be a growth company, with continued opportunities to maintain long-term double-digit growth in the top and bottom line. We have clear sight into our growth drivers and M&amp;A will continue to play an important part of our growth story. We have proven our ability to acquire and effectively integrate acquisitions of all sizes and are leveraging our size and scale to form partnerships that are creating a higher quality, more modernized health care experience.</p><p>We remain strategically positioned to continue to capture larger shares of the more than $2 trillion addressable health care market. Our targeted pipeline remains robust as managed care penetration across the government-sponsored health care remains below 50%. We are positioning Centene for the future by continuing to invest in systems, people and capabilities to ensure we can sustain our ability to provide highest-quality health care at the lowest cost.</p><p>With that, I will now turn the podium over to our CFO, Jeff Schwaneke. Jeff?</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SCHWANEKE, EXECUTIVE VP, CFO &amp; TREASURER, CENTENE CORPORATION: Thank you, Michael, and good morning. I want to spend a few minutes highlighting what we have accomplished over the last 5 years, provide an update on our transformation initiatives, Centene Forward, and highlight the WellCare acquisition.</p><p>Over the last 5 years, we have executed on our growth strategy through a combination of organic growth associated with product diversification and geographical expansions, combined with multiple strategic acquisitions. This has produced an industry-leading growth rate of approximately 35% on a compounded basis over the last 5 years, from $16.6 billion in 2014 to $73.2 billion, at the midpoint of our 2019 guidance range.</p><p>This growth has rewarded our shareholders with a 30% compounded growth rate in adjusted diluted earnings per share and a total shareholder return of 210% for a similar time period. The returns to shareholders could have been higher absent the current headline volatility.</p><p>When you expand the time horizon, Centene has rewarded shareholders with a return on their investment of over 1,230% over the last 10 years, significantly outperforming our peers and the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>We continue to execute on our disciplined growth strategy, delivering a successful year in 2018, and that momentum carried into 2019, where we increased our annual revenue and earnings guidance for the second time this year in connection with our first quarter results. Total revenues for 2018 were up over 24% from the prior year and our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 40% over 2017. Additionally, as Michael mentioned, we are now the 51st largest company by revenue in the U.S. as ranked by Fortune.</p><p>Part of our success was the intentional diversification of our revenue base. In 2014, we reported $16.6 billion in revenue, of which 86% was driven by Medicaid. While we have continued to grow the Medicaid revenue stream substantially, we have materially diversified the revenues of the business. In 2019, we expect 68% of our total revenue to be driven by the Medicaid business. This diversification has been driven by strategic M&amp;A, organic growth in Medicare and the commercial business associated with Marketplace.</p><p>Looking at the growth of each product over time, the large growth in Medicaid has been driven by organic growth, with our industry-leading RFP win rate and strategic acquisitions. This has led to a compounded annual Medicaid revenue growth of 28% since 2014 and this was on a base of $14 billion. Even more impressive is our growth in the commercial business. This has been driven by our success in the Marketplace business, that we have scaled from just over $200 million of revenues in 2014 to almost $11 billion today. In addition, the acquisition of Health Net added additional commercial business in California and Oregon. This strategy has delivered a compounded annual growth rate of over 105% since 2014, growing our commercial revenues from $400 million in 2014 to almost $14.6 billion today.</p><p>We have commented in the past about the importance of the Medicare business and our expectations to grow that business through both organic growth and strategic M&amp;A. While we have grown to business substantially over the last 5 years, we have high expectations and continue to invest significant effort and capital to accelerate the growth.</p><p>And lastly, we continue to deploy capital to other lines of business to diversify revenue. This diversification has occurred in the Prison Health business driven by RFP wins and the acquisition of MHM Services. Additionally, the WellCare acquisition provides further opportunity for product expansion and diversification.</p><p>We don't have a top line-only focus. We are also focused on improving margins through process efficiencies and lower medical costs and have improved our net income margins significantly since 2014. As highlighted in our revenue growth, we have diversified the business which has an effect on our operating metrics. As illustrated here, our HBR has decreased and our G&amp;A ratio has increased, driven by the changing mix of the business. This, plus the frequently changing position of the health insurance fee, can be challenging to analyze the business, which is why we've focused on adjusted net income margins. Our adjusted net income margins have increased 80 basis points since 2014 at a time period where our revenues have increased from $17 billion to over $73 billion. This net income margin improvement has driven over $500 million of additional net earnings and added over $7 billion to our market value based on our current trading multiple.</p><p>Going forward, we expect to continue to leverage our scale to drive further margin expansion through Centene Forward and other initiatives. The growth in revenue and increase in net earnings margins continues to drive adjusted EBITDA growth. For the full year 2019, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be in the $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion range. This is 5.1x higher than our adjusted EBITDA in 2014. Additionally, we have improved our adjusted EBITDA margins from 3.9% in 2014 to 4.5% in 2019, at the midpoint of our current forecast range.</p><p>As mentioned previously, we are well on our way to meet our Centene Forward targets and time lines. The value capture generated from our efforts to date will be reinvested in the Centene Forward portfolio to position Centene for the future by enabling additional system capabilities and technology, process improvement and future growth. I want to be clear, Centene Forward is a separate stand-alone work stream and will not be combined with the synergy capture work associated with the WellCare acquisition.</p><p>As a reminder, Centene Forward has 3 key objectives: streamline the organization, ensuring we maintain our energy and leverage our most valuable asset, our people; second, increase automation and digitization with new technologies; and third, strengthen our processes to ensure that we are leveraging our scale and our markets and improving information that results in better outcomes for our members.</p><p>We have launched initiatives across a few areas, including enhanced quality and risk adjustment; process automation and digital transformation; and member experience and care coordination. We have deployed hundreds of colleagues to build cross-functional teams to execute on 100-plus initiatives. Centene Forward is helping us to advance our mission to our members, communities, our provider partners and employees. We have already executed on $300-plus million of initiatives, and we are on track to meet our communicated target of $500 million over the next few years. Just to be clear, even though we have executed on these initiatives, some of the financial benefit will be realized in future periods.</p><p>Today, we'll highlight 2 specific areas of our success across our portfolio: claims robotics and risk adjustment. I will dive deeper into risk adjustment and Brandy will cover claims robotics shortly. We have invested in advancing -- enhancing our advanced analytics and digital capabilities around risk adjustment and quality so that we can, one, better identify members with care gaps; and two, enable our provider partners to close these gaps to drive better outcomes for our members.</p><p>Our focus on these capabilities and processes has driven operational performance improvement and has increased our care gap closure and provider engagement. We significantly increased provider participation in our medical record audit process. This increased participation, along with more targeted analytics, resulted in a 50% improvement in the program's outcomes for Marketplace.</p><p>We have designed and deployed a new incentive program that is focused on improving provider performance and closing these gaps in real time. This program is enabled by advanced analytics to identify coding and care gaps and a digital interface that allows for real-time data sharing with providers. We are targeting 3,000-plus major provider groups that we are treating members with identified coding and care gaps.</p><p>We have reviewed our encounter submission process and used root cause analysis to identify areas for improvement. In Medicare specifically, we are managing the transition from risk adjustment processing system, or RAPS, to encounter data system or EDS. We are pleased to report that through this process, we have reduced the risk score gap between the 2 methodologies to less than 1% for Medicare Advantage. I want to highlight that we have executed this initiative across all of our products where applicable. However, we are able to realize the benefits sooner on the Marketplace business given the speed of reconciliation with CMS.</p><p>So what does all this mean? The risk adjustment initiative for Marketplace has been extremely successful, and we have outperformed our initial expectations. This is based on information from the data aggregators and the final reconciliation will come from CMS at the end of this month. We expect our risk adjustment payable to be lower than the 12/31/2018 estimate by more than $200 million. This is gross and before any potential offsetting effects of minimum MLRs, RADV and other adjustments, which we expect to reduce the net benefit.</p><p>Next, I would like to highlight the WellCare acquisition and begin with our historic performance of acquiring and integrating large-scale acquisitions. We have a long history of delivering on our commitments to investors on both the top and bottom line. This has been driven by strategic M&amp;A with Health Net and Fidelis, and the acquisition of WellCare is the next step in continuing to build shareholder value. These strategic acquisitions have been a major component of our revenue and earnings growth over the last 5 years, and we have delivered on our commitments to investors over that time period, meeting or exceeding revenue and earnings in more than 21 consecutive quarters. This, in combination with our ability to achieve the communicated synergies, has created significant value for our shareholders. We achieved the synergy estimates for the Health Net transaction and are on track to achieve the synergies for the Fidelis acquisition. This track record of realizing the synergy targets gives us confidence in achieving our financial outlook related to acquisitions.</p><p>As it relates to the WellCare acquisition, we have progressed through the integration planning process, and we continue to be comfortable with the $500 million of net synergies by year 2 and more than $700 million of run rate synergies. We are working on ways to accelerate synergy capture and will provide more details as we progress further in the integration planning process.</p><p>Lastly, I wanted to provide an update on our leverage and balance sheet. We have continued to reduce our leverage and have decreased our debt-to-capital ratio by over 700 basis points since the Health Net transaction a little over 3 years ago, and we expect to close the WellCare transaction at 40% and expect to reduce the ratio to the mid- to upper-30% range, 12 to 18 months post-closing.</p><p>Looking at our balance sheet, our debt-to-capital ratio was 36.5% at March 31, 2019. Additionally, when we announced the WellCare transaction, both S&amp;P and Moody's reaffirmed our current ratings for our bonds with S&amp;P maintaining their positive outlook. We have $6.4 billion of senior notes outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 5.6%, including the effect of the interest rate swaps. Additionally, we executed a new $2 billion revolving credit facility during this quarter. This was the first step in the preparation for the WellCare acquisition to rightsize the revolver for the future size of the business.</p><p>Lastly, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2019, which is shown here on this slide and is consistent with our updated guidance we discussed on the first quarter earnings call.</p><p>Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Chris Bowers, who will provide an update on our markets.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER DONALD BOWERS, EVP OF MARKETS, CENTENE CORPORATION: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, I'll update you on our membership growth, our increased scale and diversification and the status of our new states. I'll conclude with an example of how we've turned around the market performance in the state of Missouri, and Dr. Yamaguchi, our Chief Medical Officer, will highlight our diabetes management program.</p><p>Here, you can see Centene's membership at the beginning of 2018, a total of 8.5 million members still heavily weighted towards traditional Medicaid products. Please note, for purposes of the discussion, the numbers reflected on the slide do not include membership in our correctional, Federal Services, administrative services only or involved products.</p><p>The next slide depicts our membership at the end of the first quarter. The growth in all segments is driven by the Fidelis acquisition, Marketplace, the addition of new states and organic growth. The 33% growth to 11.4 million members is still primarily Medicaid, however, it does show a significant 59% growth in our commercial products driven by Marketplace. Complex care and Medicare continue to grow and add to our product diversification.</p><p>As all product lines grow, we are gaining additional expertise and capacity to expand into other markets. This demonstrates our significant growth in individual states. In 2012, we had 13 health plans and only 1 had revenue over $1 billion. Today, we have 27 plans and the majority of them have revenue exceeding $1 billion, which demonstrates the impact of our All Products and All Markets strategies.</p><p>The expanded scale continues to bring stronger market leadership, product and revenue diversity and increased leverage resulting in additional economic benefits to Centene. As we examine the membership drivers for 2019, the growth comes from strong Marketplace enrollment, new implementations in New Mexico and Iowa and the addition of a second long-term care region in Pennsylvania.</p><p>I wanted to give you some specific insight into several of our markets. First, New Mexico. Western Sky Community Care went live on January 1 and this currently has 58,000 members. The plan has a strong start driven by experienced leaders with a disciplined contract and community engagement strategy. This has resulted in a high level of provider, member and state satisfaction. We expect the plan to see continued organic growth as they implement their innovative programs.</p><p>Pennsylvania Health &amp; Wellness expanded long-term care services to the southeast region of the state on January 1, with 30,000 new members, exceeding expectations. This brings the total LTSS membership to 56,000. The plan is preparing for the final phase-in of the membership on January 1, 2020. With the final 2020 implementation, the LTSS membership is estimated at 95,000, with an annualized revenue exceeding $2 billion.</p><p>Arkansas Total Care has seen 2 membership expansions this year. First, the implementation of 11,000 Medicaid IDD and Behavioral Health members on March 1, which was the state's first Medicaid risk product; and secondly, the acquisition of QualChoice on April 1. QualChoice expands our Medicaid expansion membership and adds small and large group commercial members to our product mix.</p><p>Lastly, Iowa Total Care is projected to go live on July 1 with an estimated 300,000 members. This projected increase in membership is driven by the exit of one of the existing MCOs from the state.</p><p>Centene has a history of successful large implementations as demonstrated by our previous Texas implementation of over 400,000 members. As we near the July 1 implementation date, we have had encouraging rate discussions and we look forward to a strong partnership with the state.</p><p>My last topic is a case study of how our Missouri health plan, Home State, financially turned around their Medicaid business in the last 18 to 24 months. Michael has frequently talked about Centene as a portfolio of companies that at any time we may have some plans overperforming and others underperforming. The Missouri health plan started in 2012 with a subscale membership and grew substantially after the state-wide expansion in May of 2017. This additional membership, combined with problematic state policies, drove medical costs that exceeded expectations. One key component of our local approach are CEOs who develop strong working relationships with the regulators. Consistent with that approach, the turnaround started in 2017 by bringing in a new CEO and leadership in several of the functional areas of the plan. This new team worked closely with the state agencies to develop a relationship built on trust, transparency and aligned objectives. They built a partnership that achieved mutually beneficial policy goals and strengthened the Medicaid managed care in the state.</p><p>As we examine the specific drivers of the margin improvement beyond the new leadership in state partnership, there were several key drivers, beginning with network contracting, where several large hospital system contracts were renegotiated to be in line with Medicaid rates. Next, we implemented targeted case management program to address high-risk pregnant members and reduced emergency room utilization. These programs benefited from Centene's predictive models that better identify members who are at risk. We experienced a 10% reduction in ER utilization in 2018 with a focus on ER frequent flyers.</p><p>With the goal of improving member outcomes, there is a continuing effort in 2019 around neonatal and behavioral health programs. By improving the quality scores to help and also earn additional quality incentive revenue, the improved quality scores were closely linked to the improvement in risk adjustment, which drove additional revenue, both through increases in rates and acuity adjustments.</p><p>As an additional strategy, the plan implemented an aggressive payment integrity program that was tailored to Missouri-specific issues resulting in significant cost savings. All these strategies and initiatives drove an improvement of over 500 basis points during the 2-year period, beginning in the latter half of 2017.</p><p>As we look toward 2019 and beyond, the plan continues to implement initiatives to improve member outcomes and reduce costs to ensure a long-term sustainable performance. All of our health plan leaders are looking for new opportunities to grow top line revenue and improve margins. Existing markets like Missouri and Arkansas and new markets like Iowa are always working to partner with their state regulators and improve how we serve our members.</p><p>Next, I'd like to introduce Dr. Ken Yamaguchi, our Chief Medical Officer, to discuss Centene's diabetes management program.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Is this mic live? Okay. I just want to give you a quick update that the guest that fainted is fine. She left with a friend under her own steam and power and so it's fine there. I just thought you'd like you know that.</p><p>KEN YAMAGUCHI, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AND EVP, CENTENE CORPORATION: Thank you, Chris, and good morning. I appreciate the opportunity to present about the diabetes management program, an exciting recent example of our core clinical programs, which, in total, achieved over $100 million in continuous cost of care reduction. This particular program addresses one of the most important population health concerns for Centene.</p><p>Diabetes is an extremely costly chronic disease and accounts for almost 1/4 of all health care costs in the United States. Among Centene members, approximately 500,000 people are living with diabetes in the proportions shown on the slide. Compounding the issue is that a large percentage of people are either noncompliant with treatment or unmanaged. This is particularly a challenge in the Medicaid population. To illustrate, 93% of our members have a claim for hemoglobin A1C test, but at one time, but only 40% of those members have had an associated result documented. Not surprisingly and consistent with the general Medicaid population, 21% of our members have poor control. They have hemoglobin A1C rates greater than 9 with normal being below 6. Many of these members with high A1C rates are not adherent to their medications.</p><p>We thus, in addition to long-standing coaching programs, instituted a multipronged strategy for trying to improve medical adherence to diabetes. This program has several components including: one, the use of telehealth biomonitoring of blood sugar levels through our previously described on-demand product; and two, in select states, we have partnered with providers regarding education on diabetes medication adherence and delivered hemoglobin A1C machines; three, we have developed data science methods to develop predictive algorithms for identifying members who have unrecognized, uncontrolled diabetes, and Mark Brooks will elaborate on this later this morning; four, we've developed member connections representatives in an expanded responsibility as community health workers to provide in-home support for high-risk members; finally, we've developed a unique diabetes management report that identifies the most impactful members to target for intervention.</p><p>We launched the diabetes program over 18 months ago. The foundation was a diabetes report to focus resources to those members most likely to benefit from intervention. A significant number of health plan personnel, including both care management and member connections staff, were trained for this program. To emphasize the most up-to-date education, we established a recurring national diabetes clinical rounds with expert endocrinologists in the field.</p><p>An important component of the program deserving emphasis was that it was executed in part through the use of member connections representatives. You may recall that member connections is a Centene-specific program that employs people hired from the communities that we serve, many of whom have been recipients of Medicaid in the past. They were originally used to provide a means for outreach and enrollment. In addition to this important function, they now have been trained and certified in community health services to provide face-to-face support and education for diabetes treatment. On average, member connection reps make 6 home visits, 3 phone calls per member to drive improvement of diabetes care and medication adherence.</p><p>While early, the program has delivered very promising results to date. For enrolled members, we have seen a 19% reduction in members without a controlled diabetes. Our previous calculations have shown that members who have hemoglobin A1C greater than 9 have, on average, about $110 per member per month increase in expenses compared to those with well-controlled diabetes. We thus anticipate significant savings for this initiative in the future.</p><p>Now while these programs reduce cost, I'd like to emphasize that what has been most important to us is the improvements that we are making in our members' health. Early results like this have been extremely rewarding as we try to make a lasting difference to our members.</p><p>Thank you. And now Kevin Counihan will provide an update on products.</p><p>KEVIN J. COUNIHAN, SVP OF PRODUCTS, CENTENE CORPORATION: Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everybody. We're off to a good start in the performance of our products in 2019. As you know, we offer a broad variety of health insurance products and services targeted to key government market segments and designed to maximize value to our members and customers. Many of these brands you likely recognize such as Ambetter, our marketplace product; Allwell, our Medicare Advantage product; Envolve, our suite of specialty services such as pharmacy, dental, vision and other member support services; Federal Services, which services the TRICARE population; and Centurion, our managed care product suite for correctional facilities.</p><p>The performance of our product suite may be best summarized in 3 parts: first, appropriate pricing; secondly, performing to plan; thirdly, continuing to drive growth. Now let's dive into 2 of these: first, Marketplace; and then secondly, Medicare.</p><p>As Michael mentioned, we had another very strong Marketplace year with peak enrollment of approximately 2 million members, representing over 20% growth from 2018. In fact, peak enrollment since 2016 has grown by approximately 300%. Our effectuation rate has increased from 91% to 94% in 2019, exceeding historic national averages. And I can tell you based on personal experience that those averages tend to be in the mid- to high 80s. In addition, we had 80% member retention.</p><p>For 2019, we expanded into 4 new markets: North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Tennessee. We are now present in almost 75% of Centene markets and aiming to expand into additional counties in existing states in 2020. We are the lowest-cost Silver plan in over 85% of the counties we serve, which represents roughly 68% of the market opportunity. Despite high enrollment growth, our key demographics and gender distribution have remained essentially the same for the past 3 years. Similarly, metal tier selection remains consistent.</p><p>Our Marketplace strategy is in 2 parts. First, providing personalized member coverage and service. More specifically, we focus on the needs of the uninsured and the underinsured. We facilitate culturally sensitive delivery of care, and we leverage deep community and provider relationships. Secondly is discipline. We're disciplined in our network and coverage designs. We promote personal discipline and responsibility and we have disciplined pricing and distribution.</p><p>Now for Medicare. At present, we project Medicare enrollment of approximately 416,000 members, which is consistent with 2018 enrollment as previously announced. This enrollment projection reflects growth in our D-SNP population offsetting membership loss from the prior exiting of unprofitable counties by Fidelis. Our projected revenue for Medicare in 2019 should exceed $5.4 billion, and we continue to offer a broad range of Medicare product options.</p><p>For 2019, we expanded into 2 new states, Illinois, and New Mexico; and into 120 new counties in our existing service area. For 2020, we plan to add 1 new state, Nevada, and expand into 100 new counties in existing states.</p><p>Our product mix has remained fairly consistent over the past 3 years with the exception of D-SNP, which now represents roughly 1/4 of our total enrollment. As you can see, we've seen success in enrollment conversion from the D-SNP population, and we expect D-SNP enrollment to continue to represent an increasing percentage of total enrollment.</p><p>Our Medicare strategy is also in 2 parts: first, to leverage our multiproduct member installed base and optimize our product -- our provider networks to promote value-based care; secondly, to capitalize on our local presence and focus, which promotes product differentiation and community and broker engagement. In tandem with our strategic joint venture with Ascension and WellCare's MA platform, it's obvious that Medicare will be a key driver of future growth.</p><p>So in summary, our products continue to perform to plan and continue to drive growth.</p><p>Now let me introduce Father Patrick Frawley, Senior Vice President of Social Responsibility. Father Frawley?</p><p>PATRICK J. FRAWLEY, SVP OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, CENTENE CORPORATION: Thank you, Kevin. At Centene, social responsibility is not a corporate program or initiative. It's at the core of who we are and what we do. Our commitment to social responsibility is a living expression of our purpose as we strive to improve the health of our communities one person at a time.</p><p>Our efforts in the area of social responsibility center on 5 key areas: sustainability; governance; employee partnership; philanthropy; and community outreach and support, with a special focus on the social determinants of health. These 5 areas are not onetime projects, but rather, reflect Centene's long-term vision and full commitment to the communities we serve.</p><p>Centene has a commitment to the environment. Through our LEED-certified headquarters, and future construction projects have been developed with the goal of state-of-the-art environmentally-conscious design. Employees are engaged through recycling efforts and the recent formation of an employee group to identify additional opportunities to foster sustainability.</p><p>Centene has a commitment to ethical business practices and compliance and our government -- governance policies underscore this.</p><p>Through the commitment to diversity and leadership emanating from the Board and senior management, there are also mandatory compliance training initiatives pursuant to formal Board policy. Centene would not be the successful organization it is without the dedication and commitment to our purpose of our employees.</p><p>Beyond ensuring compliance to just labor practices, Centene has a well-developed program of diversity and inclusion, with more than 4,000 employees participating in at least 1 of 5 affinity employee groups as well as numerous diversity and inclusion initiatives. Employee training and career pathing are well established, and the company has expended significant resources on the development of Centene University and related training programs for continued education and growth of our employees. Centene employees also show their commitment to local communities through volunteer activities and support of their local United Way.</p><p>Giving back to the community served by Centene is a clear example of the company's commitment to social responsibility. The Centene Charitable Foundation has supported charitable activities through its programs of donations and grants, making significant impacts in local communities. In addition, Centene has provided support to develop numerous programs such as the Centene Center for Health Transformation to enhance the health and well-being of the community. Most recently, Centene made a $100 million research grant over 10 years to Washington University, aimed at accelerating affordable customized treatment focusing on Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, diabetes and obesity.</p><p>Centene's commitment to local communities is seen on a daily basis through the partnerships developed on a local level by our family of health plans. Each year, literally thousands of events in hundreds of communities across the country are sponsored by the health plans, many with a focus on addressing the social determinants of health. Centene understands that health is driven by the conditions in which we were born, grow, live, work and age. Our efforts to address the social determinants of health include interventions that improve outcomes for people facing acute and/or chronic health conditions as well as preventing some health conditions before they develop.</p><p>Through our outreach activities on a local level, we strive to address social determinants such as health literacy and access, maternal and child health, food and security, behavioral health, aging, housing, diversity and inclusion, transportation and employment. Whether it's creating community gardens in low-income housing developments in Georgia, partnering with community-based organizations to support behavioral health needs in New Mexico, supporting a senior mobile food pantry in Indiana, sponsoring anti-bullying presentations to school-age children in Missouri, partnering on a campaign to prevent teen pregnancy in South Carolina, sponsoring a migrant education program in Florida, raising funds for college scholarships for rural students in Arizona or working with community partners on cultural and economic revitalization of low-income neighborhoods in New York, Centene confronts the social determinants of health as we bring to life our commitment to social responsibility by living out our purpose day in and day out.</p><p>Understanding that social determinants of health require comprehensive solutions and true partnerships, Centene has recently formed Social Health Bridge, an innovative initiative to help community-based organizations and health care entities work more effectively in forming the local partnerships needed to meaningfully and sustainably tackle these social determinants. It's our goal to bring data-driven and evidence-based approaches to this work while developing value-based revenue streams to increase both capacity and sustainability for long-term community impact. Social Health Bridge will help all partners align their efforts to achieve the health outcomes most critical to the individuals and communities they serve.</p><p>We at Centene are proud of our efforts to be both a good corporate citizen and a faithful steward of what is a noble work: ensuring access to health care while improving the health of the community. This is a commitment that runs deep within our organization and is central to everything we do. While historically we have not felt the need to trumpet our accomplishments, we are nonetheless pleased to be able to share with you how at Centene social responsibility and our purpose go hand in hand. Indeed, at Centene, social responsibility is our purpose in action.</p><p>Thank you. And now please welcome Brandy Burkhalter, Executive Vice President, who will provide an update on operations.</p><p>BRANDY LYNN BURKHALTER, EXECUTIVE VP OF OPERATIONS, CENTENE CORPORATION: Thank you, Father, and good morning. During our December Investor Day, I shared a brief operations update. We covered the significant increase at volume in certain operational metrics and those activities we had underway to address that growth and further position us for the future.</p><p>In December, I shared actions we were taking around our call volume, the claims we process and our interactions with our providers, all of which play a critical role in fulfilling our purpose: transforming the health of our communities.</p><p>Today, I am here to share we remain focused and on track. We continue to leverage our existing operational tools and processes, and build additional capacity through things like automation where we continue to automate workflows to build more efficient interactions in our service centers. Where we can, we leverage across all of our product lines. We continue to deploy bots that can run behind the scenes and process faster and more efficiently than our workforce, especially when some sort of intervention is required. I'll share an example here shortly.</p><p>We use detailed analytics to shape and keep our focus on that next initiative to address or automate, and we've added quality reviews and are looking to adopt further process changes that will allow us to absorb additional new business in the years to come. All of these things and more are part of our continuous improvement, re-engineering effort and some of the transformation activities that both Michael and Jeff mentioned in their opening remarks as part of Centene Forward.</p><p>Jeff shared that Centene Forward is our enterprise initiative to position us for future growth, primarily through streamlining the organization, increasing automation and digitization and strengthening our processes. Today, I wanted to share an update on increasing automation and digitization as it relates to our claims operations. As a reminder, efficiencies gained through Centene Forward and our continuous improvement activities will be reinvested in the business. Investments will include new- and next-generation capabilities and operational tools that will be deployed in 2020 and beyond.</p><p>Our Centene Forward digital team, working with operations and IT, launched a new robotic initiative at the end of last year. This new initiative has realized improved efficiencies for certain claim types that could previously only be handled in a manual fashion. As you can see on the slide, this new initiative has reduced the manual process time by 23% for one claim type and improved our processing efficiency by 471% for another claim type. These efficiencies have led to better member and provider satisfaction while increasing our productivity and allowing our employees who were once tasked with time-consuming manual administrative processes to shift their talents to more value-add activities.</p><p>Some of these value-add activities include designing our next-generation operating systems. Over the next 3 years, with Mark Brooks and the IT team, we are automating, modernizing and building greater capacity through advancing all the components of our operating systems that interface with both our members and our providers.</p><p>Our health care industry often struggles with provider data and accuracy of the data for purposes of paying claims and displaying in our directories for our members to use. We share those struggles, and I wanted to just take a few moments to share what we're doing to address.</p><p>Where possible, we standardize the way we ask for information. That includes contracts to eliminate some of those challenges we have to ingest all that information into our systems. We use third-party resources to validate what we collect is consistent with what others in the industry have, in hopes of providing more accurate information. We perform outreach calls and mailings directly to our providers to confirm the information we have and use, and we join alliances with others in the health care organizations to generate ideas and solutions to some of these problems that could impact the delivery in the overall health care experience for both our providers and our members.</p><p>Today, I also wanted to share an update as it relates to how we are tightening our provider relationships by moving up the continuum towards value-based contracting where we share that total cost of health care. We remain committed to increasing the number of value-based relationships we have with our providers. We started making additional investments in the back half of 2018 to support these efforts.</p><p>The reports developed last year and available to our participating providers in 2019 give physicians more control to deliver patient-centric and quality-focused outcomes. Information that our providers need to improve outcomes with our members can become dated quickly and challenging to make meaningful interventions, so we continue to roll out a series of enhancements to our providers in member reports and dashboards, all backed by big data. Not only can our providers use this enhanced data to improve patient outcomes, that same data allows us to monitor care, measure incentives, monitor engagement and compliance and compare performance to provider peers.</p><p>We are also making investments in connectivity with providers by building out interfaces with our enhanced data and also with electronic medical records. Holly Benson will share more on what we are doing with Interpreta in just a few moments.</p><p>With all of these enhancements, we hope to increase the speed of physician interventions, improving the health of our members and further tightening our relationships.</p><p>I appreciate the opportunity to share just a few of these operational highlights this morning on what our teams are working on in support of our purpose and mission.</p><p>At this time, I'd like to introduce Holly Benson, Executive Vice President and CEO of our Health Care Enterprises.</p><p>HOLLY BENSON, EVP, CENTENE CORPORATION: Thank you, Brandy. Good morning. It is a pleasure to join you today to talk about the great work being done by the Health Care Enterprise companies. In December, I talked about some of our latest technology. Today, I would like to talk to you about the impact our primary care providers are having, whether it's the VPA providers in the home or the Community Medical Group physicians in their clinics, we are finding that these models are having a significant impact on the quality and cost of care for our patients and our health plan members.</p><p>You may recall that last spring, we announced an investment in Community Medical Group. CMG has developed an integrated model that really enhances their ability to provide high-quality care to their patients. They have a great partnership with Florida's Department of Children and Families and host several access sites. Through their access sites, they can get patients access not only to Medicaid but also to temporary cash assistance, housing, food stamps and other services. Beyond that, they've integrated transportation, pharmacy, specialists and hospitals. The team works closely with a network of preferred providers. And by so doing, they can ensure that their patients get appointments quickly and that care is coordinated among the providers. This has been particularly impactful for their patients with behavioral health needs.</p><p>USMM has also built a continuum of services, physicians, home health, hospice, lab, DME, radiology, in order to meet the broad range of their homebound patients' needs. USMM started long ago with just home-based primary care. But because their patients' needs were so complex, they quickly added the other services that patients would need in the home.</p><p>One of the important goals of the ACO program is to keep patients out of the hospital. By being able to alternate home health visits with our physician visits, USMM is better able to address all of the patients' care needs and impact those conditions that might otherwise lead to hospitalization. That ability to integrate services has led to significant improvements in quality for both organizations. USMM's ACO has consistently had high-quality scores. On GPRO and HEDIS measures that are appropriate for homebound patients, USMM consistently exceeds benchmarks.</p><p>And every year, we tackle specific quality initiatives. Particularly for our members, urinary tract infections are a significant driver of ER visits and inpatient admissions. So we invested in lab technology, which allows us to detect a wider spectrum of urine -- of types of urinary tract infections. And as a result of improving our testing procedures, we have seen ER admits related to UTIs drop 17%. In addition, the USMM team works diligently to keep patients out of the ER. And through a variety of interventions, they've reduced ER admits by about 20%, as you can see there.</p><p>CMG's patients have traditionally averaged around 4 stars for HEDIS across all of their health plans, and they too have turned their focus to strategies that improve overall quality of care. They have designed more targeted interventions that have resulted in steady declines in inpatient admissions per 1,000. You can see here that their Medicare admits per 1,000 have decreased from just over 243 to just under 206 per 1,000 across their membership from all payers. And with the addition of care navigators who oversee these patients and coordinate services between the PCPs and the hospitals and specialists, the number of Medicare members who fall in the catastrophic category, that is members who exceed $100,000 in health care expenses annually, has decreased from 90 to 56 per 1,000.</p><p>And you all know that delivering better quality usually results in overall lower cost. CMG's integrated care model means that patients who come in through their access sites typically have an HBR that is more than 20% lower than patients who are referred by health plans. USMM has consistently delivered significant savings in the ACO program, the Independence at Home Demonstration pilot and for Centene's members. The savings for Centene's health plans have steadily increased as the health plans membership has diversified, as Chris Bowers talked about. The more complex members the health plans refer to us, the more we are able to improve outcomes and reduce costs.</p><p>As the health plans have added more long-term care, more dual-eligible and more Medicare members, we've been able to add more value. And with the addition of WellCare, our impact will only grow.</p><p>I'm also pleased to announce the recent addition of a new CEO, Dr. Rajiv Patel, and we believe his experience as a physician leader and hospital administrator will be valuable in helping us recruit physicians and refine our strategy.</p><p>Because these primary care models have demonstrated the impact on the quality and cost of care, we want to expand them to other markets. As Michael talked earlier, CMG is based in Miami, Florida. And since we invested in them, they've opened a new Medicare-specific site in Miami-Dade Country and 2 new sites in the Tampa area. We'll be opening 2 more clinic sites in Polk County before year's end. And we're now in talks to expand to at least 3 other states, and their underserved markets in the southeast.</p><p>Rather than acquiring other practices, we believe CMG gives us a valuable platform for strategic growth. With USMM, establishing a provider continuum in various locations is key to our success, and we try to have Visiting Physicians Association, Pinnacle Home Health and Grace Hospice all in the same city. This year, we're adding 6 new VPA sites, 4 home health sites and 1 new hospice site. Because of the hospice moratoriums in many states, it is harder to expand that footprint. But with the addition of our quality of care program, we were able to meet a portion of that demand. These expansions will bring us to a total of 46 VPA sites, 29 home health sites and 28 hospice sites.</p><p>In addition to their value as stand-alone entities, CMG and USMM also provide our health plans and operational leaders with insight into the provider experience. They've offered insight to Brandy's network team as they work to develop new reports, as Brandy mentioned earlier. These operational reports are complemented by the reporting Interpreta shares on quality measures and risk adjustment gaps. When providers have this information in hand, they really can impact quality and cost in ways that health plans cannot. We're working to make these tools available through multiple channels in order to increase our chances that providers will use them. These channels include Availity, Centene's provider portal, Epic, FTP sites and a new app that Interpreta has developed. We want this information in providers' hands.</p><p>And when we get this information in providers' hands, they really have an impact. For example, Peach State has worked diligently to educate their providers on the value of Interpreta, and they found that providers who use Interpreta are statistically significantly more likely to have patients with 0 care gaps than providers who have not.</p><p>As you can see, adding primary care to Centene's portfolio of companies has helped us provide quality care to our members, reduce the overall cost of care and give us insight into ways that Centene's health plans can be better partners to providers. Community Medical Group and USMM will continue to set high standards of care and service for the patients they serve.</p><p>Thank you all very much for the opportunity to talk with you today. We will now move to questions and answers.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Well, thank you, everybody, that presented this morning. Very informative. Thank you. I will now open it up to any questions. We have microphones because we are webcast.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Scott Fidel with the first question.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Scott?</p><p>SCOTT J. FIDEL, MD &amp; ANALYST, STEPHENS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: First question, just had a question on Medicare and the philosophy on sort of accelerating growth for 2020. Looks like the footprint expansion that you talked about in terms of the geographies might be a little bit smaller for 2020 relative to 2019. At the same time, you're going to have a significantly improved pricing position with the strongest weighted average rate increase, at least amongst the public plans in terms of the CMS rate update. So just thinking about a few of those factors, maybe talk about other considerations and sort of confidence in accelerating Medicare enrollment growth -- MA enrollment growth stand-alone, separate obviously from WellCare.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Yes. I'll initiate and other members of the team can jump in. We have spent this past year developing real-time reporting for physician consortiums. In other words, we're sitting down with a group of physicians to talk about how they're doing on a risk-based contract. On a Friday afternoon, we can have data, print it off based through claims paid this past Wednesday. That was very important to have the ability because risk contracts are very important to the Medicare environment, and we want to really move to 100% risk in that area. That's the first part, and that's gone away.</p><p>Now with the addition of WellCare, they have a very strong platform in that, and they have the understanding of the regulatory environment, things that -- and strength that we've been attempting to build and hire people. So what we've decided is to try and focus and go deep in a few markets rather than have a real wide footprint and get this working right. So it's a matter of how fast we can get closed, put these 2 together, do it effectively from the start. That's controlling that aspect of it, Scott. In other words, we don't want to start -- have kind of a false start, get them involved because we can't -- what we can talk about is somewhat limited until we close, so that's kind of impacting a little bit. But in the end, I think when we put it together, we'll see real accelerated growth. Does that answer your question?</p><p>SCOTT J. FIDEL: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Next question is from Steve Halper.</p><p>STEVEN PAUL HALPER, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD &amp; CO., RESEARCH DIVISION: This is really for Jeff. You talked about $200 million in lower risk adjustment payables that you have to pay out in June. Can you talk about how much of that is offset by the MLR minimums and how much of that is included already in guidance?</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SCHWANEKE: Yes. So a couple things. We talked historically about the consistent methodology that we have for accounting to the risk adjustment. And if you go back in time and look at the December -- development that we've had in June, it's a little over 10%. So I would say the number we've got in the Q2 number is roughly $100 million. And so what I would say on -- with respect to the $200 million is that the numbers aren't final, right, and state-by-state and mix calculations matter. So we're not going to give what we think is the net number here today because that could change between now and June 30, so we're not far away from the final answer. And we'll give that on our Q2 earnings call.</p><p>But we do know that what we did on Centene Forward had quite a bit of improvement and higher than expectations. And it gives us comfort on our $100 million we have in the forecast, right? And then we're just going to have to see how much of MLR, RADV and other adjustments play out as we get the final number from CMS on June 30.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Ana Gupte?</p><p>ANAGHA A. GUPTE, MD OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, SVB LEERINK LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Could you give us any updates on all of the contracts that have come up for reprocurement, starting with Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky, but with WellCare, I guess, you've got approval now and antitrust and then Pennsylvania, I believe, at the end of the year?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Yes, it's Brent Layton who looks to that.</p><p>BRENT LAYTON, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CHIEF DEVELOPMENT OFFICER, CENTENE CORPORATION: I'll give you the updates for the states that we're in. For Louisiana, the award will be, we believe, sometime in late July from that standpoint, still going live we believe on the 1st of the year; for Texas STAR+ PLUS, later this month for the award; for Texas STAR and CHIP, later this summer, maybe late August from that standpoint; and then Oregon, July 9 is the date that they had talked about for the award.</p><p>ANAGHA A. GUPTE: Any color on the level of confidence you have on reprocuring rate?</p><p>BRENT LAYTON: Well, in my remarks, I'm going to say that we feel very confident about it. We've been in Texas for 20 years. We've been in Louisiana since the start of the Medicaid managed care program. So we know the states very well, and we believe that we've partnered with the states very strongly. So we feel very confident.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Kevin Fischbeck?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Kevin?</p><p>KEVIN MARK FISCHBECK, MD IN EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Question on the exchanges, I guess maybe 2 parts. First, this year, we have a little bit more competition from some other types of plans. I wanted to see what you were seeing in the marketplace from that.</p><p>But then second, I guess last night, we had from Trump the ability to potentially use HSA funding to buy individual products. I wanted to hear what you thought that might do either to the amount of membership on the exchanges or the risk profile of the exchanges.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Kevin?</p><p>KEVIN J. COUNIHAN: Yes. So a couple of things. On the pricing side, I think that we're going to see increased competition, which actually is something that we welcome. I think Michael has mentioned before that the more people that are actually in the market, actually benefits the market and benefits the stability of the exchanges. So we're actually in favor of that.</p><p>I'm going to get to a point that I think is tangential to one of your points raised, which is on the payment notice -- which is on the payment notice overall, I think we view that as a positive for us and positive also for the stability and growth of the exchanges.</p><p>Now, with respect to the release of what came out last night, this seems to be part of a broader pattern, from what we can tell, about encouragement for more adoption of individual type of products. I think when you look at the HRA -- the proposed HRA regs that are also supposed to be coming out in a couple of months, that's another very interesting way to help encourage growth of nonexchange individual market. So we see -- we're very bullish about the exchanges and the individual market.</p><p>KEVIN MARK FISCHBECK: I guess when you think about the benefit to you though, I guess specifically talking to the lower-income side, does having employer-sponsored coverages that go into exchanges, does that help you as much? Or...</p><p>KEVIN J. COUNIHAN: I think it's part of an evolution. I think that we see ourselves evolving as that market opportunity evolves. And both those things, whether it's either the HSA or on the HRA, are part of that evolution.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: I think as we commented, we are a net payer on MLRs, the minimum MLRs and the risk adjusters. So people can drop the rates, it's not going to impact us if we have some [easier situation] coming out of those numbers. Equally, the area in which we're operating, at 250% of the [total] profit level, it's highly subsidized. And it's not on our advantage to look at every products that have less benefits compared to what we're offering in our exchange product.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Matt Borsch?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Hi, Matt.</p><p>MATTHEW RICHARD BORSCH, RESEARCH ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Just asking a follow-up on your Medicare growth strategy, and you laid out a number of the different areas where you're going to be pursuing growth. Could you just talk about the D-SNP opportunity and MMP? And how do you think that is maybe going to be tied to regular TANF Medicaid participation in the state or not going forward? And maybe just the momentum that you think is there or not there for the MMP program.</p><p>KEVIN J. COUNIHAN: Well, I think as we may have described at an earlier meeting, we are -- we've got a very strong depth of D-SNP members. And what we're seeing this year, just as an example, is successful conversion of those members. So we've got a very strong base of D-SNP. We understand the D-SNP population well. We understand the medical management needs of that population. And I think, as you know, that's critical to that successful conversion. So when we look at the installed base we have, when we look at our capabilities with respect to medical management and our opportunities to convert those, that's where we're seeing good growth and future opportunity.</p><p>MATTHEW RICHARD BORSCH: What about the MMP?</p><p>KEVIN J. COUNIHAN: What did you say? MMP?</p><p>MATTHEW RICHARD BORSCH: MMP in greater dual. I'm just curious with the momentum that you see there or not, and do you think that's going to be a big growth driver moving forward?</p><p>KEVIN J. COUNIHAN: Yes. I think our view is that it will be. So again, we have a decent enrollment of MMP. We do think when we look at the -- where CMS seems to be going with respect to integration and coordination of programs, that plays very well much into our sweet spot, again, because of medical management and experience. I think if you were to compare those to the D-SNP opportunity, we probably have a greater opportunity on the D-SNP side because of the installed base.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Justin Lake?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Justin?</p><p>JUSTIN LAKE, MD &amp; SENIOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH, LLC: Question for Michael. First, on the deal, I think you said that Kentucky had given approval for the deal. I'm curious. I think you also said publicly that Nebraska and Missouri were 2 states where you probably have to make divestitures. I was hoping maybe you can give us an update there on how the broader state conversations have gone and any other states where you feel like there might have to be divestitures.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: I think it's going -- they're going very well. They -- we've [the Form As and Es have been filed], we're still in discussions with them. There's been a great deal of interest in new major players that would like to acquire those businesses. So that part, Justin, is going really well. And we hope to have some announcements on it in the near future.</p><p>There is -- some of these approvals, I want to emphasize one aspect of it. Just there is some hesitancy on some states until Justice has to go in. They've told us we got caught on the Aetna deal. We just want to be cautious, so there's a variety of things that involve that. But on the 2 states, that's moving along very well. As we identify who's going to acquire, that eliminates any concerns those states have, and we'll move forward on that. There may be some membership in one of those states or so that we might lose, but it is well within and below, and Jeff can comment on this, the dis-synergy numbers. Jeff?</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SCHWANEKE: Yes. I guess what I would say is we're still working through the process, right? We've commented publicly about Missouri and Nebraska because we have some finality there as far as what the plan is. Still working through the process on a lot of the other ones. But what I said in my prepared remarks is that we're still comfortable that the net $500 million synergies, with that number. And that -- remember, that number had a prudent amount of divestiture in it. So I think we're comfortable with that number as we sit here today based on all the information and discussions we have with the states.</p><p>JUSTIN LAKE: Great. Just a quick follow-up, Michael, on the deal timing. It sounded like from comments at a recent conference that you're still comfortable with the first half of next year, but feel like that's conservative. And if I look back over the last couple of deals, Health Net got caught up in California, and it sounded like Fidelis had some negotiations with the state that took a little longer than you thought. If there's a wrench in this that does make you take it to the first half of next year and you need that conservatism, what do you think it would be? What's kind of the final hurdle you think might kind of be for this deal?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Well, it's interesting you said that, because the Fidelis CEO is a case of we -- it could have got done, the state was moving along very quickly. And the Fidelis -- not their lawyer, but the Treasury's lawyers slowed it down quite a bit and lack of experience or something. And so what we've had -- what we've done is in saying that first half of next year is to try and reflect the experience we had with California and with Fidelis so that we don't say an earlier date and have to delay it. So I believe that first half of the year is still a very effective time frame in which to consider it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (inaudible)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Just wanted first just to clarify the $200 million risk adjustment, Jeff. So it sounds like you've baked in $100 million. To the extent there is and ultimately is some upside there in that number, I just wanted to understand that commentary relative to the Centene Forward, because I think you mentioned savings would be sort of reinvested back. So is that a source of upside, or is it -- would it -- we shouldn't think of it that way? That it would just get reinvested back and they'll pull through to the bottom line?</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SCHWANEKE: Well, we -- so a couple of things. We don't know the exact number, so that makes it a little challenging. All the activities that we did cost money, right? So there is cost associated with doing everything that we've done, and we have other initiatives in process, like what Brandy mentioned. So I think for 2019, I would say we still expect Centene Forward to be a 0, meaning we would reinvest the dollars. Is there a possibility that there's a timing difference if the number in Q2 is a little higher? Maybe, but we just -- we don't have the information yet. So we're not really going to comment on that until we get the actual results from CMS at the end of this month.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay. All right, fair enough. And then, just my question, you've talked a lot about risk-based contracting today, I think more than you have in sort of the past, and that obviously goes with the MA strategy. You've got the Ascension JV as well, that's sort of ramping. I guess the question is, can you just help a little bit on sort of -- just give a sense a little bit on how the risk contracting maybe works? Michael, you mentioned getting to 100% penetration, where -- sort of just give us a sense. I must admit it's really low today. And then just anything more on provider relationships on a go-forward basis, how important is that to the strategy?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: In risk-based -- I've done Medicare several times, and -- MA and risk-based is a key factor for success of that program, long term. It's one in which you really have several pools. There's an ambulatory pool. In that, the physician has full control, it's broken into a primary care cap that they get every month. There's a specialty pool. Now the primary care cap includes ER, technical and professional. What he does not spend in the specialty pool, and there are controls for quality issues, he keeps. So it's a case of where -- we've done it in Medicaid, too. I'll use that as an example, where if a child has a rash, he gives them a tube of hydrocortisone and says, \"Does that clear it up?\" It was the same for the dermatologist, which is hard to get. So it really gives him full control when a doctor orders, when he makes the referral to the cardiologist, he says, \"I want to do this.\" It doesn't give the cardiologists carte blanche to do whatever he wants without discussing it with him. And the doctors, as they get into this, find out how well they can do, they really like it.</p><p>There is then an in-patient pool, and that in-patient pool is divided 2 ways, the surplus: the primary care, the hospital and the plan. There is a management contract with it that the subsidiary Centene could have. That has a margin built into it as well that's declared. So it's a very much shared risk thing. We take the risk on the in-patient. The doctor takes the risk on the ambulatory care. But the in-patient is something we'll do on-site, concurrent review, we're able to manage very well. We then have all these other systems that come in, and you'll more hear about them today, that become predictive. So you put that combination together. That's what we've been working hard to put together.</p><p>The key to this, as I said earlier, is having real-time data, so when you sit down at the doctors once a month, the provider relations people, they have their reports that they show them that say, here's how you're doing, here are some cases you could have done better, and it's a training process. And I've seen it and we're very enthusiastic about what it can mean. Put that together with the WellCare capabilities in the regulatory side, the marketing, the compliance side, which we're building, trying to build capability on, you end up with the combination that will make us a key player, we believe, in that market. Does that help? I'll take that as a yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes. No more further questions, (inaudible) on the web?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Why don't we take a break and get back together here in the next 20 minutes or so and continue. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>EDMUND E. KROLL: Okay. If everybody can start heading back to your seats. We're going to reconvene in about 5 minutes. So please head back to your seats, and on the webcast, we'll be restarting in approximately 5 minutes, Centene's Investor Day. Thank you.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Okay. Just before we get started, pick up the next panel, we have the agenda. I'm going to introduce Mark Brooks, our CIO. I have to tell you several people approached me on break and said when they saw $100 million -- $100 billion, they almost fainted, too. So we'll have to be very careful when we start. It's $150 million, $200 million, okay?</p><p>With that, I'm going to ask Mark Brooks to pick it up.</p><p>MARK J. BROOKS, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, CENTENE CORPORATION: Thank you, Michael. Advancing Health care Through Technology is both a broad and complex topic. As Centene's Chief Information Officer, I have many responsibilities. One of the most significant is integration of our technologies. Whether we acquire, purchase or build a solution, we do it to optimize business value. Today, I will focus on our philosophy for managing a structured integration framework, demonstrated through the evolution of our partnership with Interpreta and RxAdvance.</p><p>Centene is a technology company that delivers health care services. This means that technology is a core competency of the enterprise. While many of our peers are choosing to outsource, we do not. We prefer to own and operate the platforms that run our business. Additionally, technology at Centene is a centralized function. We operate national platforms that are configured to meet the local needs of our business, which is a critical element of our exceptionally local business model.</p><p>Scale is always at the top of mind, demonstrating its value during integration. Centene's grow through acquisition and investment is a constant. Michael continues to remind us that it's not how fast but how well you integrate. Therefore, Centene will continue to pursue platform consolidation as a core part of our technology strategy. This requires a methodology that continuously evaluates and integrates acquired assets, which we call functional migration, a process that enables integration without business disruption.</p><p>Centene technologies consistently enables integration, leveraging the most modern technology. Our next-generation platforms and capabilities are built to be cloud ready, services enabled and event driven. And we're actively using Centene Forward as a mechanism to digitally enhance our key platforms with incremental funding and dedicated business focus. More importantly, headlines about Centene's rapid growth, in combination with focused talent development programs, are allowing us to attract some of the best talent in the industry to ensure our systems remain industry best practices.</p><p>Talent is a hot topic in the technology industry. Explaining how we work is integral to understanding our technology approach. Talent is more than hiring the right people. It's empowering our people, employees and partners to build a culture of trust and transparency to lead the organization in the direction that enables us to continue to evolve our modern technology mindset.</p><p>In the last 3 years, we have undergone an agile transformation within Centene technologies. We've embraced human-centered design practices, and we are developing and integrating systems based on feedback from hands-on product owners who understand how technology influences our growing business and the needs of our members. The skills associated with this transformation have been embodied in our Centene University training program with agile featured as a core pillar in the curriculum.</p><p>Leveraging agile and human-centered design practices puts everyone on the same page, speaking the same language. Over the last 4 years, we've established nationally diverse delivery and innovation centers. These centers are highly collaborative, leading-edge incubators, looking ahead at our technology needs. This has enabled our ability to expand our talent acquisition footprint in order to get the best resources to solve complex problems. Geography matters, but the method for recruiting matters more. We use our local approach focused to hire strategically at campuses and unique staffing channels to further ensure a highly diverse and talented workforce. These 3 elements working together are our formula for successful Centene technologies culture that will continue to attract and retain the right talent and partnerships to lead our organization to the next generation of health care.</p><p>Now I'd like to walk you through an example of how this all works together. Recently, Dr. Yamaguchi and his medical management team brought me into a conversation about uncontrolled diabetes. More specifically, how do we, Centene, leverage our data and processes to provide our clinical care teams the right information at the right time to have the right conversations or take the right actions to help a member with uncontrolled diabetes? During this conversation, it occurred me that in answering this complex question, there's an opportunity to illustrate the power of Centene technologies integration philosophy, combined with our modern technology mindset, collaborative culture and how we leverage our partnerships such as Interpreta and RxAdvance.</p><p>The specific question that started this conversation was how can we leverage our platform to make the largest difference in our members with diabetes? To answer that question, we needed to start with an even more fundamental question, what is the probability that a member will become an uncontrolled diabetic? We built the model leveraging inputs from several sources, claims data from our core platforms, prescription adherence data from RxAdvance and several Internet of Things, IoT solutions. This is no different than what every other plan is doing, but what legacy systems are lacking is our ability to engineer predictions directly into our software platform. Said specifically, this is an advantage that comes from leveraging our scale to deliver platform technologies, a concept which John Sculley will expand upon in his remarks.</p><p>Our investment in data science capabilities, world-class engineering talent and strategic partnerships has produced a real-time predictive analytics system. We are able to scale our infrastructures to the speed of our claims systems, which is capable of producing 20,000 predictions per second. This enables our software platform, we call it Centene-as-a-Platform, to integrate and productize these predictions as part of our human-centered design practice.</p><p>The result of the model enables 2 things. First, the data goes into our Centene-as-a-Platform fully integrated system and leverages an omnichannel approach to distribute findings to the care teams. The care team is then able to develop a specific care plan to address, in this case, uncontrolled diabetes. Simultaneously, our continuous evaluation technology through Interpreta is able to monitor populations in multiple products in real time and share these findings to both providers and medical management teams, enabling intervention in a timely and sometimes proactive fashion.</p><p>The second result is a dramatically improved outcome of member health through maintenance rather than urgent intervention. But it doesn't stop there. We continue to monitor our actions and impact to refine our models through continuous evaluation and learning. This leads to improved predictions and recommendations, all coordinated through our tightly integrated technology ecosystem and unique approach to medical management. The result is compelling. We can identify this population in real time, deliver health information through multiple channels and enable coordinated care and action that results in lower cost, but more importantly, better care management for diabetic members. This is what differentiates Centene model and approach to this complex question.</p><p>When viewed comprehensively, this is a true competitive advantage that differentiates Centene from other managed care organizations. This is a result of our unique approach to investing in our modern technology, talent and culture and strategic partnerships.</p><p>In closing, this is just one example that gives you a view of our complex ecosystem and our integrated approach to serving as a fully enabled technology company that delivers health care services. Now I'd like to introduce you to 3 of our technology partners: John Sculley and Ravi Ika of RxAdvance; and Dr. Ahmed Ghouri with Interpreta, who will provide additional examples of our work in collaboration. Thank you.</p><p>JOHN SCULLEY, CHAIRMAN AND CMO, RXADVANCE CORPORATION: Thank you, Mark. I'm John Sculley, I'm RxAdvance Chairman and Chief Marketing Officer, and my role is to present the high-level RxAdvance vision.</p><p>Prescription drug prices have been steadily rising and PBMs are taking a lot of the blame. The current health care ecosystem and many traditional PBMs are unable to control these costs due to the fragmented nature of the industry and its underlying technology. Pharmaceutical manufacturers set the list prices. Health plans have access to all prescription drug data, but few useful and actual analytics available from traditional PBMs to create cost and quality of care improvements. Providers are unable to assist in medical cost reduction because they have limited information about their patient's prescription drug medical data. And the PBM rebate system is broken. PBMs have traditionally retained a percentage of the rebate monies as a concession that is paid to them for their middlemen services. And as prescription drug prices increase, the PBM rebates increase proportionally. The PBM pricing process is complex, it's opaque and there is no transparency about what drug prices really are, who is getting paid and how much they are getting paid.</p><p>Well, RxAdvance is an entirely new kind of PBM, a platform PBM. And you will hear shortly from Ravi Ika, RxAdvance Founder and CEO, that we have excellent solutions for these problems.</p><p>Now all of the largest PBMs were built before platform automation technology became foundational in every major industry, that is, with exemption of the U.S. health care industry. Traditionally, PBMs are organized as silos of discrete modular systems, requiring many thousands of employees to be involved in the claims adjudicating process. A platform PBM is designed as a horizontal business architecture, not a collection of modular systems. It's so efficient that it involves lower capital cost and fewer employees.</p><p>What is so different with a platform PBM business architecture is it's possible to deploy an integrated health care system that will empower all of the patients' physicians and health professionals, regardless of where these providers are, all the way to both current and new points-of-care, points-of-care in the doctor's office, points-of-care in a seniors home, points-of-care at the point of retail.</p><p>Now why was there such late adoption of platform technology in the health care industry? Well, big tech long understood platform technology, but not the deep health domain understanding that is extremely complex, which has over thousands of rules, regulations, protocols and compliance requirements. There's a limited number of highly competent systems engineers in the health care industry who also have the proven experience of building transactional platforms. And RxAdvance is greatly advantaged by our entrepreneurial culture and our founder leadership.</p><p>Over the many years that I have been an eyewitness to several major systemic changes in the high-technology industry, I know what it looks like at every stage. After systemic change occurs, it's obvious to everyone. But in the early days when it starts, it's not so obvious unless you know what to look for. Systemic change happens when really big problems are solved in a better way, and here's an example.</p><p>Fact #1. Over the next 5 years, it's expected that 40% of hospital beds in the U.S. will be eliminated. Now, in parallel, remote patient monitoring technology is going through amazing technology changes. The new generation of health -- or telehealth services will move beyond today's low acuity care to higher acuity care to serve chronic care patients at home.</p><p>Fact #2. Just 5% of the population accounts for 49% of the $3.6 trillion U.S. health spend. Now these particular patients are stressing the sustainability of the U.S. health care system with their high cost of care. Sometimes, there are duplications of prescribed drugs by multiple physicians who may not have accurate information about what a patient's other physicians are prescribing. Sometimes, there are unintended side effects from a bad combination of prescription drugs, dosage and frequency. Correct these types of problems, and fewer patients will be readmitted back into the hospital after discharge.</p><p>Now these 2 facts will be driving systemic change for the next decade. The health care industry is pivoting away from in-patient hospital care for chronically ill patients and is pivoting towards technology empowered innovation that can enable a better quality of outcomes at an expanding list of points-of-care.</p><p>The growth profiles of patients that can be served in the future at new points-of-care will include Medicaid members with chronic conditions, particularly aging populations as people are living longer, Medicare Advantage members, Medicaid members. This systemic change will be particularly important for government-sponsored health care.</p><p>RxAdvance is a 5-year old company. We were able to build our PBM platform in only 2.5 years. RxAdvance is well-positioned to be a change agent in the systemic transformation of health care. We're helping Centene, at a timing of their choosing, to be able to move to direct prescription drug prices. RxAdvance can be foundational as a resource to Centene's vision of adopting machine learning, robotic process automation to deploy an integrated health system. I'm impressed that Centene is making important strategic investments in Interpreta and RxAdvance, talent acquisition and organizational decisions to integrate high technology into our platform business architecture.</p><p>The rollout of smart process automation on a huge scale is foundation to leadership in government-sponsored health care, and this adds up to the flexibility to innovate rapidly at scale.</p><p>I'd now like to introduce RxAdvance Founder and CEO, Ravi Ika.</p><p>RAVI IKA, FOUNDER AND CEO, RXADVANCE CORPORATION: Thank you, John. As we all know, there has been -- as a result of PBM provide just commoditized transactional services with very little clinical value, resulting in a variable drug impact to medical costs that are comparable to overall pharmacy cost, RxAdvance was launched to control overall pharmacy costs and the variable drug impact to medical costs, taking the PBM function beyond their current offering. What is our noble cause? It is well-established fact that there is about $900 billion vested in health care system. PBMs -- I think I have the wrong script there. That's the problem.</p><p>So I just want to go ahead and present. We -- last year, we presented RxAdvance, I know, initiation, how the Centene -- are we contracting with Centene, and then we are bringing the Centene license to HCBS. And I would like to bring you up to speed here.</p><p>Today, we are live in 4 states with Centene plans, and that equates to servicing 670,000 lives. And then we are on track to onboard Centene 14 million lives. That does not include Medicare, that includes Medicaid and commercial plans. But by 2020, we'll have all those plans live. And please go to the next slide.</p><p>So what I would like to share is there are many areas how we are improving Centene, obviously, through cross automation, just like John explained. Through the cross automation, we are reducing administrative cost substantially. In addition to that, holistically, like you all know, Centene, in the PBM business, one needs just to reduce administrative costs across the board and then second thing is how can you bring in optimal value to the health plan through the pharmacy-negotiated contracts. We have done extremely well negotiating the pharmacy contracts, but Centene substantially increasing -- reducing their net unit prices and, obviously, again, at the end of the day, we're also trying to be fair with our pharmacies out there, what we are trying to project there. And I'd also -- we renegotiated using the Centene lives all the net rebates contracts for Centene, and we have substantially improved their rebate returns. And also we, in the -- now we are -- as we are launching -- by July 1, we'll have 6 plans live, which surpasses over 1 million lives. So we are going back from October of last year, our first plan. We are now looking at it, what kind of value-based contracts we have to implement. And as Centene is moving from risk-based contracts to the -- to more like a value-based risk-based contracts and the more value-based contracts, how can we bring in 360-degree view to the providers at the point-of-care, and how can we help the risk-based contracts much more efficient and profitable for Centene.</p><p>And next slide, please. So if you go to any PBM, probably about 10 to 12 departments will be there. Out of those 10 to 12 departments, if you combine all the functional points within the PBM, so you're talking about over 500 functional points, what RxAdvance did was we brought in all those functional points together into the platform so that we eliminated. Wherever there is a human being is not required, we eliminated the human being. So that's how we are able to bring in substantially lower than any other PBM out there in the administrative cost side.</p><p>And so if I give you an example here, if you go to any health plan, any PBM out there, so you are talking about basically some multiple hundreds of people doing the prior authorizations. So in RxAdvance, what we did was we automated entirely the prior authorization process right from intakes coming from the provider's office, all the way to the determination, auto determination and communication to the providers and members all being automated. So we have what were 95% of the prior authorizations completely automated into the system.</p><p>And also, and there is another PA called Advanced PA. In the Advanced PA, at the point-of-sale, if you -- if somehow, the prior authorization is not being obtained, since we integrate the medical pharmacy and lab data, so we are able to deliver the Advanced PA at the point-of-sale, so that you will be able -- a patient will be able to get the prior authorization in the back end and then also adjudicate the claim. So that automated the entire prior authorization process as an example. So we have substantially reduced the number of people required in the prior authorization process, and also, there's a consistency of approvals and reduced error rates and increased operational efficiency.</p><p>Can you go to the next slide, please? So again, at that core, when we -- as Michael always said, do it right, and then how fast you do it doesn't matter, but do it right. So with that in mind, so we have on-boarded 6 plans. Obviously, every plan, we take very seriously, and our customer focus, as you can see those, they echo that we innovate and our agility partnership, collaboration, those are the key factors of how we bring in, we take the customer focus as a center of our offering here.</p><p>So with that said, thank you very much. Now I invite Ahmed Ghouri here.</p><p>AHMED GHOURI: Good morning, everybody. Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak with you today about Interpreta. I wanted to follow-up on some of the technology innovations we're doing that are very exciting, and provide you an update since the last time I spoke.</p><p>Following the central point made by Mark Brooks on the importance of integration, what we're doing at Interpreta is both real-time integration, as well as clinical interpretation as fast as data can arrive. To briefly refresh, we're aggregating disparate fields, such as real-time claims from the insurer, real-time data from FHIR-compliant EMRs using the new interoperability standard; real-time ambient data, which includes things like wearables, biosensors, Fitbits and retail kiosks; and finally, we can also accept the entire whole genome, all 3 billion base pairs centrally into a cloud that around one person, we compute forward-looking real-time clinical guidance for a single member.</p><p>Next slide. There's a lot of talk about the role of AI in clinical management. And while there's so many buzzwords that abound, in our view, Interpreta's view, it can simply be stated as who to see, what to do, in which priority order and to make recommendations in real-time using any interfaces, ranging from voice to smartphones, to devices so that actions can occur within clinical workflow.</p><p>The next slide is an example of what to do. And what you can see in the simple picture is there are some patients that need to be seen in less than a week. There are some people that can be seen in a month and some people that can wait 3 months. This kind of analysis is not possible with latent processing. So for example, if we run a report once a month, we don't need it, we can't tell who can be -- needs to be seen within 2 days. So real-time integrated processing allows us to do what I call clinical resource balancing because we live in a world where most symptoms are managed reactively and emergently rather than proactively with a lead time. So clinical resource balancing is as important as it is in computer science, in hardware, in logistics, et cetera.</p><p>Next slide. This is an example of what to do. This is a mobile device that is voice-activated, also touch- and imaging-activated, that is showing in real time that a single member has precipitously stopped taking their diuretic. And so this is an actionable, immediately actionable clinical item that's in the pocket of a physician.</p><p>Next slide. This slide shows an example of the states throughout the country which have gone live in 2018 and are going live in 2019. Last year, we added approximately 2 states per month with real-time processing, while connecting the multiple-user interfaces, multiple applications and user roles. Within the Centene ecosystem alone, we are analyzing 8 million members daily comprising 2 billion claims, with a clinical interpretation velocity of 8.3 million claims per minute. Unlike a payment processing system, every new signal we get has to be contrasted against the lifetime history of a member, which might range from 5 to 10 years. For example, a member may have 25,000 total medical claims and pharmacy claims and lab claims, but one of those might be a heart attack from 3 years ago. Today, we receive a new signal that the patient has hyperkalemia. That, today's finding, has to be contrasted against a 5-year old event to make a clinical interpretation. So we have to literally sift through billions and billions of claims on a daily basis at a rate of millions of claims per hour to recalibrate the clinical guidance for this individual.</p><p>So in summary, with every new signal, a member's lifetime history has to be retrieved and interpreted in real time. In this regard, Interpreta delivers the highest clinical performance that I am aware of in the entire health care industry today.</p><p>Next slide. This slide shows the future state vision of the real-time ecosystem that we are developing and actively deploying, which represents a powerful new future for health care. In this ecosystem, all stakeholders, from a nurse or a doctor in the clinic, to the member at home, to the pharmacist at a retail clinic, to the care manager in the health system at the health plan are connected bidirectionally with a diversity of interfaces that include mobile phones, voice interfaces, tablets and desktops. Using a single common API and a platform architecture, every single user has the same clinical view, the same medical record, all with near 0 analytical latency, including the clinical goals shown here as 1, 2, 3, which are prioritized by a powerful interpreter. Prioritization of tasks is a critically important aspect of interpretation.</p><p>Care services in this platform are then orchestrated to the highest quality, most affordable organization and clinicians. Continuously accumulated data through this platform becomes part of a learning health system that can determine which treatments, protocols and clinicians perform the best. Major inefficiencies such as duplication, paperwork and medical errors can be eliminated by this platform.</p><p>Ultimately, our technology platform will increase clinician-to-member face time for diagnosis, for management and for compassion, which is what matters the most.</p><p>Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</p><p>JONATHAN DINESMAN, VP OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, CENTENE CORPORATION: Good morning, everybody. As Michael has mentioned before, we have provided these health care policy discussions to really give you a better flavor of how we see things in the current environment.</p><p>So a couple of years ago, when the ACA -- it's now more than a couple of years ago, but when the ACA was in play, we had a panel of experts that really were focused in terms of, especially, where the Democrats saw the ACA moving. And then when it transitioned to the repeal and replace debate, we had people focus on, number one, how were states going to look at repeal and replace and how were the Republicans going to look at repeal and replace in Washington.</p><p>Today, with divided government, we have an esteemed panel that brings, number one, the Governor, who needs no introduction, Governor Kasich, who was the very first, or either first or second in terms of Republican Governors looking to expand Medicaid in Ohio, also a well-known commentator and author. And he's going to give a perspective in terms of kind of what are Governors grappling with at this time of divided government?</p><p>We also have one of the longest tenured former Medicaid directors, also led the National Association of Medicaid Directors, Tom Betlach, who will give the perspective in terms of kind of what are some of those opportunities that Medicaid directors are seeing nationally.</p><p>And then also, we have the former Chief of Staff for Speaker Pelosi, played a significant role in the ACA debate. And also from our perspective, it was a challenge finding somebody who is so well-known, listened to by Democrats, but finding a Democrat in Washington who's not currently running for President.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JONATHAN DINESMAN: So with that, I'd like to open it up to you, Nadeam, in terms of, because you've worked so closely with the Democrats in Washington, how do you see kind of, number one, the debate in terms of policy in terms of where health care is moving forward?</p><p>NADEAM ELSHAMI: Thanks so much, Jon, and thank you so much for having me here. No, I am not running for President, so that's why I'm very excited to be here. The way I view the debate in Washington, D.C. really, the way I want to frame it is political desire and legislative realities.</p><p>Currently, the legislative realities is there is some support for moving a prescription drug legislation this Congress, maybe at the administration, you had the Republicans in the Senate and you have the Democrats in the House. The political desire is you take a look at what a minority of the Democrat at caucus, maybe close to a majority perhaps, wants to move a legislation like Medicare-for-All. It's got 112 co-sponsors. Medicaid Buy-In has 42 co-sponsors. Medicare Buy-In has 48 co-sponsors. You take a look at these bills, they will have hearings, perhaps, but they're not going anywhere. And what passed the House in a bipartisan basis by 238 votes, was a piece of legislation that helped shore up the Affordable Care Act, and that is a perfect position where Democrats believe that they could strengthen the ACA, improve upon the ACA and, currently, that is a place where Centene is very well positioned.</p><p>JOHN SCULLEY: Thank you very much. Governor, when we talk about -- one of the things that you mentioned before is governors have to be very pragmatic in their approach. And the one thing that we've known about you is you've never waited on Washington in terms of doing what you believe was best for your state. Can you tell me kind of what you see in terms of what are states grappling with? In your experience, kind of where do you see states moving forward?</p><p>JOHN KASICH: Well, I learned not to wait on Washington. I was waiting on Godot, and Godot never showed up. So I decided, I needed -- for those that don't read much, that's a very important and famous thing, okay? But anyway, look, one thing you got to understand, people are painting the governors as the greatest, okay? They're political animals. And you have some that are willing to step up and some that are not. It depends who that person is. But I'm, for the first time, was really glad we kind of hit gridlock. In fact, when John McCain put the thumbs down on repealing Obamacare, I was very, very involved in that, fought it nationally on television, and came up with an alternative plan with John Hickenlooper, and Hickenlooper is a Democrat nominee. There was a rumor that he and I would run together, but I said, \"That can't happen,\" because you couldn't fit Hickenlooper and Kasich on a bumper sticker. So to make a long story short, McCain put the thumbs down, and they have -- the Republicans, at one point, talked about another repeal, but they didn't get there because if you don't have something to replace it with, then you start stripping health care away from 20 million Americans.</p><p>Look, things are dead down there right now, as Nadeam says. You have a Senate that doesn't want to work with the House, you have a House that, in some respects, wants to pass some things that are just never going to happen, abolishing private insurance, I mean, that's crazy, that's not going to happen.</p><p>So what are governors going to do? Well, I was, I think, the first big Governor to pass Medicaid expansion. I did it because it was the right thing to do. I did it because all of a sudden, people who needed treatment for mental health and drug addiction could get help instead of living under a bridge or being in jail, I gave them opportunity to rehab, and it has worked out beautifully.</p><p>And so states are kind of playing around with it. But just in Virginia, they had an election in Virginia, I just heard about, where one person was defeated because they favored Medicaid expansion, but another one was able to save his seat.</p><p>So it still remains kind of a controversial issue about Medicaid expansion, but I think little by little, with them adding in the work requirements, Nadeam, it gave some governors cover. See, when you need cover, that means you play politics. And the way I approached it is, look, I'm -- got the wheel -- my hand's on the wheel, I'm going to drive the car. If people like it, great. If they don't like it, great. So what you have to look at, at the states, is the character of who's the governor and what they are willing to do and what kind of political heat they're willing to do, to do what, in our view, is the right thing.</p><p>I think that the future in ACA is going to be making it more effective, more flexible for states with some sort of a safety net. It is not unusual to think that we may have an ACA that says instead of going to 138 of poverty, you go to 100, everybody else gets put on the exchange,</p><p>that there be some flexibility in Medicaid, that when it comes to the exchange, that the essential health benefit may be loosened to some degree, which can help bring down cost.</p><p>But ultimately, as you listen here today, and I was just listening to the Sculley. You know who Sculley is, right? You ever heard of the Macintosh? That's Sculley, okay? Bringing technology -- and the presentation at the end by the Technology Director for Centene, think about what they're talking about. They're talking about transparency, they're talking about paying for performance, they're talking about treating each individual uniquely and they're talking about managing health care cost and taking inefficiency out. What does that mean? Not multiple tests, not paying for quantity but paying for quality. This is the direction where I think we're going to go. I sat on a panel with 3 former CMS Directors. They're all talking about transparency. They're all talking about competition. This is where I think it's going to go ultimately if we're right in this country and we may have no choice when you take a look at the rising cost of Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>So it's -- I think that the private sector can drive a lot of the reform and companies like Centene with this program that they have can be one of the leaders in the way this all turns out.</p><p>One final thing. The PBMs are a controversial issue now in the states, and we were the first state, I think, to bring about transparency as it related to the PBMs. Now, my understanding of the Centene model, and I'm certainly not an expert, I've been working with them for a while but not a long time, is that you get to net pricing, that there's no side deals, that the PBMs can provide a very good service in terms of dealing with pharmacies, controlling the costs, but it's the side deals that everyone was so concerned about. If you get into a net pricing without the rebates, then you have clarity in this. It's something that needs to be presented around the country because I think the PBM issue is one that's alive and well in the states so...</p><p>JONATHAN DINESMAN: So Tom, Arizona was the last state to go to Medicaid, first state to go to Medicaid managed care. You were a Medicaid director for, I believe, over 10 years and saw and oversaw a lot in the state. And more importantly, you were even seen across the country as that leader that other Medicaid directors looked at, based on your experience and how to move things forward. So from your perspective, what are those opportunities that you see in the private sector?</p><p>TOM BETLACH: So thanks, Jon. Thanks for the opportunity to be here. The governor touched on something that I think is important, and that's that public-private partnership that states are looking for and managed care really gives you that opportunity to leverage a platform for innovation and looking to be able to do things that oftentimes state government can't do because of the limits around bureaucracy.</p><p>So to have a competitive public-private partnership, I think is vital and it's laid out in terms of some of the statistics you saw earlier. I mean in the last dozen years, think about this, Medicaid's gone from 45 million lives to 70 million lives, the percent of spend in managed care has gone from 20% to 50%, which still means there's a lot of opportunities out there as it relates to a company like Centene, and a lot of that is in the complex populations.</p><p>There was an earlier question around dual special needs plans, and I think that's a tremendous opportunity in the managed care space. Duals are a bipartisan policy area where governors, the federal government, they want to see progress. There was a study done recently that looked at when you can get an individual in the same plan for Medicare and Medicaid, that was looked at in Minnesota, 40% reduction in inpatient, 40% reduction in readmissions, so I think there's real opportunities there. And now there's a platform.</p><p>So for the first 40-plus years that we had in Medicare and Medicaid, there was really no opportunity to work together and bring those programs together. But now we have an office of the duals, there's actually a regulatory infrastructure so that if you have some somebody that's Medicaid enrolled and they're becoming Medicare eligible, you can enroll them into the same plan. We did that in Arizona using our managed care organizations and D-SNPs. 90% of the members that were enrolled into that Medicare platform stuck. And so Arizona was 1 of only 2 states that had that authority and now other states are looking to move forward with that. So I think there's tremendous opportunities there.</p><p>There's tremendous opportunities to get more services into managed care. Oftentimes, states carve out behavioral health services, which I think is completely the wrong model. Some of the most complex individuals, and the governor touched on this as well, require substance use disorder services. They require intense behavioral health services and to have an organization that's responsible for all those services is incredibly important. And states are starting to catch on to that. But still, too many states have a carved out model, and I think there's real opportunities as it relates to bringing services into the managed care model.</p><p>And then finally, this was touched on as well, there's still expansion opportunities out there. I think some of the flexibility that the administration has identified not only through work requirements but now having conversations with the state of Utah about going to 100%. And if they can make that happen, that's going to open the door for more states like Georgia and others potentially to look at opportunities as well around expansion. So I think 3 real strong opportunities: complex populations; services; and still some expansion states.</p><p>JOHN KASICH: And let me just say one thing. We did the duals. And this is one place where actually Washington is working. In fact, I think, we've just -- we're commended for what we did on duals. The issue here is if, in fact, you combine that program, is the federal government going to come back and give you the benefit of what you save for them by not putting people in hospitals, by keeping them in the right setting? And that seems to be working. I don't know if you...</p><p>TOM BETLACH: No. I agree. I mean Iowa is a good example of a state that pursued the demonstration and is generating savings. The challenge for a state is exactly what the governor identified. So oftentimes the dual program saves Medicare money, it doesn't save Medicaid money. So the states need an incentive. But some of the incentive is just doing the right thing for that member. I mean when you think about some of the most complex frail individuals in our system, they sit in both Medicare and Medicaid and that becomes very challenging from a care coordination perspective.</p><p>JOHN KASICH: And the final one is this whole business of behavioral health. This is a rising issue. This is a very big deal. Trying to treat somebody for physical health without considering the behavioral issues that are around them is ridiculous. Now, you're going to probably have to inch into that. Because what do we mean by behavioral health? And my sense is that over time, there'll have to be some definition of what we mean, whether it involves -- it has to have some clinical analysis attached to it in my opinion in order to fully integrate behavioral health with physical health. This is really, really important, starting with children and going all the way through a lifetime, the ability to combine them. And this should be a big push for everybody in this country. And it will help us to reduce the stigma of mental illness. The #2 cause of death between people between the ages of 15 and 25 is suicide. This behavioral health needs to be properly compensated, and it needs to be -- we just need to do this. This is important for our country.</p><p>TOM BETLACH: Well, and to that point, individuals with serious mental illness in the U.S. die on average 25 years younger than their peers, and oftentimes it's an untreated chronic conditions. So again, it's that lack of linkage between behavioral health services and physical health services that impact mortality rate.</p><p>NADEAM ELSHAMI: And this is a clear demonstration of what it's like to have a governor, somebody who worked in a state because they're getting things done. And unfortunately right now in Washington, things have kind of slowed down big time.</p><p>JONATHAN DINESMAN: So let's talk about Washington real quick though, Nadeam, because we've talked about the headline volatility that's out there. But this isn't the first time that we've seen a major piece of health reform that has had a party kind of push back on it and try to weaken it. Can you give maybe an example of what's happened in the past that where maybe the Democrats had concerns? And kind of what -- how did that play out afterwards?</p><p>NADEAM ELSHAMI: Sure. Medicare Part D. Democrats fought against it tooth and nail. They felt it was bad policy. They felt there was giveaway to the pharmaceutical industry, and it came down to one vote, really, and it was a -- was it a 3-hour vote, 4-hour vote, governor?</p><p>JOHN KASICH: Yes. I wasn't there. Thank God, but...</p><p>NADEAM ELSHAMI: Yes. 3:00 a.m. in the morning. It was a very interesting display of how whip politics works on the House floor. Once that piece of legislation passed and became the law of the land, Democrats had a choice. And the choice was do we attack it in courts? Do we attack it with bills? Or do we tell our constituents, \"Look, this is the law of the land. We're going to let you know what kind of benefits you're going to get. And we're going to try to make it better?\" Democrats chose the latter, and until this day, we're dealing with Medicare Part D, and we're supportive of making improvements to Medicare Part D.</p><p>Right now, take a step to what's happening today with the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act has been the law of the land since 2010. Unfortunately, it has not experienced the success it deserves, but companies like Centene has been able to go into the marketplace, go into bare counties and cover and take steps that are necessary to cover millions of Americans.</p><p>The challenge over the next 1.5 years for the Affordable Care Act, I believe, is when will the Republican Congress decide enough is enough, ACA is the law of the land, we are going to work with Democrats to try to get this the best piece of -- best law that we can, going forward. And I believe that's going to happen once the Texas case is decided. And the Texas case is going to get thrown out, and then we're going to move forwards because there's no other alternative at the moment. And then you could talk about the private-public partnerships. You could talk about prevention. You could talk about other exciting new proposals that can make the ACA much more accessible.</p><p>JONATHAN DINESMAN: So I'm happy to ask questions, but I also want to open up to the group in terms of any questions you may have for the panel. Just jump up and shout it. Go ahead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Governor, my question is on Medicare and I know you were involved (inaudible)?</p><p>JOHN KASICH: Right. I think that, ultimately, with Medicare, and there is no secret little barn sitting in someplace in West Virginia where they can take -- I mean it's all big game, okay? I think where we're going to end up with Medicare is that a managed care Medicare model will be the default option rather than the fee-for-service. There are more and more people, of course, going into Medicare Advantage because there are advantages to it. And so I think at some point, that could be a change. Instead of the default option being the fee-for-service, which is clearly higher, if you move to the other program, then I think you're going to have some savings and people are still going to get quality. That's my sense of it. What do you...</p><p>NADEAM ELSHAMI: I don't think -- I think that's right, but look, Medicare, currently, there's no bandwidth right now in Congress to deal with some of the issues that the governor had just raised. And that's the reality of the situation currently. And he is right, nothing will happen in the next 1.5 years.</p><p>JOHN KASICH: Just to answer all that because there's a big article yesterday in The Wall Street about Social Security going bankrupt, okay? There are 21st century answers to these problems. It doesn't mean you got to go to the dentist and have a root canal. There are ways in which we can save money, provide better quality. It happens in every aspect of our lives today. And part of what you saw with Sculley up here and the Centene team is a drive towards these technological solutions that allow us to take the inefficiencies or the over-expenditure in health care. And remember the other part of this, a big chunk of health care costs are related to about 5% of the population. If you can figure out how to move the 5% and give them the specific treatment they need, you are going to significantly reduce your health care costs over time, but that's the way you have to think about it. I don't...</p><p>TOM BETLACH: No, I agree completely, and that's really the reason why you need to look at those most complex population and get them into some form of managed care versus the fee-for-service system, which oftentimes we refer to as fend for yourself.</p><p>JOHN KASICH: We like to get managed care into our senior population in Ohio but the nursing home industry has basically bought the legislature fair and square, so it's been very hard to be able to get that done, but it will happen.</p><p>SCOTT J. FIDEL: Scott Fidel. I had a question just around the Medicare for All proposals. And maybe to start with, Nadeam, just in terms of -- one thing I found interesting is that all the Medicare for All proposals are based on the Medicare chassis when you look at the fact that over a number of decades, most of the coverage expansion successes that Democrats have executed on had been on the Medicaid platform. So one, what do you think drives? Why is there that disconnect?</p><p>And then for the other -- the Governor and for Tom as well, one thing about going to an all Medicare chassis is it essentially pushes the states out of being a partner as you see in Medicaid as well. So I guess for all of you, too, how much recognition is there from these Medicare for All proposals from these Democratic candidates about how much pushback the states will have from that as they'll be essentially crowded out of policy around health care as a result of that?</p><p>NADEAM ELSHAMI: Sure. Medicare for All really is a single payer plan that the Democrats have talked about in the past but they've never really put on a -- in legislative format. And then when they decided to go ahead and propose that the cost for Medicare for All is astronomical, there's no way to pay for it, there's no funding mechanism for. But it is, down the road, what I view an opportunity for expansion would be in something perhaps like a Medicaid Buy-In. That may not happen in the next 3 or 4 years, but it could happen later. But I think that Medicare for All is going to be necessarily a big piece of legislation that is not going to go anywhere in the next 5, 6, 10 years. And I just don't see it happening.</p><p>JOHN KASICH: If the House passed a Happy Father's Day resolution, the Senate wouldn't even take it up, okay? Let me just kind of paint it to you this way. So let's say Trump wins reelection, okay? I don't see the House flipping. So you got Democrats controlling the House, right? I mean these are all predictions and who the hell knows what's going to happen in the next hour, let alone what's going to happen, what is it, 19 months from now? But -- so the house isn't going to go along with kind of destroying these programs that are basically sort of safety nets for the most vulnerable.</p><p>NADEAM ELSHAMI: That's right.</p><p>JOHN KASICH: If Trump loses and the Democrats win, I don't see the Senate going Democrat. I see the Republicans being able to maintain control of the Senate. And so therefore, anything that passes will be moderated. I really believe when I listen to Sebelius, I listen to former governor of Utah, very smart guy who ran CMS, if you talk to probably -- Tommy Thompson, Sylvia Burwell, they are all talking about reform and transparency and paying for quality.</p><p>NADEAM ELSHAMI: That's right.</p><p>JOHN KASICH: That's where everybody's head is. I think that the pharmaceutical firms have got to be careful because this is vulnerability and Americans don't like what it costs for pharmaceuticals. So I think that's an area and the Trump administration wants to go with transparency. Nadeam said it, I think there's an opportunity for something there. But if you want to think about health care reform, it's probably going to come in slivers is the way that I would analyze it today. But then again, I've been wrong in my analysis on almost a week-to-week basis about how this country is going to work but...</p><p>TOM BETLACH: Just 2 seconds. I'd spent 27 years at the state and I'm a state person, so I'm biased from that perspective, but from my perspective, states are the incubators of innovation, and you have programs like managed long-term services and supports where now the majority of spending for long-term care is to keep the individual in their home and in the community. That would not happen on a Medicare chassis because Medicare has too difficult of a time being innovative and creative and really redefining a service delivery system. So from my perspective, I'm glad that states have had the opportunity for Medicaid to show some of that innovation. I would be concerned about that going forward.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I think John Sculley?</p><p>JOHN SCULLEY: I would just like to add a technology point of view. The estimate of McKinsey Global Institute is there are $350 billion of avoidable drug impact medical cost, and that's just around prescription drugs. And if you look at the health care system sustainability, there's no way that health care can be sustainable as a system without solving problems for the chronically ill people, particularly for the people with high comorbidity diseases, 8 or 9 comorbidity diseases. That 5% or almost 50% of the health spend.</p><p>The encouraging thing about technologies, whether it's what Ahmed Ghouri talked about with Interpreta or what RxAdvance is doing with our platforms and there are other people developing platforms in the health care industry now as big tech starts to take a serious interest in it. The reality of platforms is all about scale, and it's the first time that the health care industry has the chance for technology that is incredibly inexpensive, smart process automation, intelligent machine learning systems, the ability to scale and go in and cut through the complexities of all of the lobbyists' rigged ways in which health care is unrealistically illogically complex, a lot of this can be solved with platform technologies.</p><p>So as you look out as politicians, governor, to what can be done, a lot of help is going to come from the technology industry, not just from things we're doing but from other people and technology. As platforms become as well understood and adopted in the health care industry as they are in financial services, telecommunications, e-commerce, entertainment and other industries, it's inevitable that technology is going to be there to help.</p><p>AHMED GHOURI: Including analytics.</p><p>JOHN SCULLEY: Absolutely, including analytics.</p><p>JONATHAN DINESMAN: If I could just jump in. With your question in regards to the coverage issue, the one thing that we've seen historically, as you've said, is the Medicaid chassis has been the way that either Washington or the state have kind of helped with the coverage issue. The other thing that I think is really interesting is you look at some of that volatility out there, the talk about trying to hurt the ACA, when you look at like the HRA proposal that came out yesterday or you look at the automatic reenrollment in regards to the Marketplace, there are things being done that are going to stabilize the Marketplace and that's really critical because when you look at that HRA issue as an example, in the event you do something like partial expansion, you get healthier people, let's say, 100 to 138 into the Marketplace, you create a healthier risk pool. You're also going to create an opportunity that the Trump administration is really focused on. And that is, what are they going to do for the unsubsidized population? And those costs will also go down in the Marketplace so long as you could bring those healthier populations that we're really focused on from that 100% to 250%. And I think that we're going to go to 1 or 2 more questions, Ed?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, Josh Raskin?</p><p>JOSHUA RICHARD RASKIN, RESEARCH ANALYST, NEPHRON RESEARCH LLC: Nephron Research. I guess a question for all 3 of you. And I'm curious from the provider side of the world, right, the hospitals and you mentioned nursing homes but docs as well. A lot of the proposals that we're hearing are about expansion of coverage and different models that tend to have an impact of shifting individuals from the commercial world into the government world, and that has ramifications for the providers in terms of payments, et cetera. And one thing I still continue to think about is the BBA of '97, nursing homes were not bluffing, right? I mean massive chains went bankrupt within 2 years. And so I'm curious. How do you sort of think about that if you're in D.C. or at the state level and there's a potential where the government's going to have to at some point increase reimbursement or whatever it is to sort of offset that impact? Is that part of the calculus? Or is it just sort of hey, there's inefficiencies in the health care system and the providers will figure it out?</p><p>TOM BETLACH: So can I start?</p><p>JONATHAN DINESMAN: Yes, go ahead.</p><p>TOM BETLACH: What we saw in Arizona was uncompensated care get cut in half as a result of the Medicaid coverage being expanded. And what I always told hospital executives was you may complain about Medicaid rates, but last I saw, 80% was better than 0 in terms of uncompensated care. So the hospitals were strong supporters of that.</p><p>On the nursing facilities side, one of the interesting dynamics that we saw is we saw higher penetration of individuals be in the same plan for Medicare and Medicaid was a significant reduction of individuals in nursing facilities going to the hospital, which it came to my attention when the nursing facilities came to me and complained that their patients were going to the hospital. And what a misaligned incentive that is in the health care sector that the nursing facilities need to have that individual go to the hospital so that they can get the post-acute stay on the Medicare side, which exactly goes to what the governor was talking about is we need more value-based payment transformation to better align the incentives, so that the nursing facility gets rewarded for that individual staying in the hospital. And you're seeing more and more of that, and you're seeing states really be the drivers of that and requiring managed care to have higher expectations and more of their percent of spend in these types of value-based arrangements.</p><p>NADEAM ELSHAMI: And I'll go back to my original point, is really nothing is going to be happening in that space in Washington, D.C. over the next couple of years.</p><p>JONATHAN DINESMAN: Last comment by the Governor because then we're going to have to cut this off.</p><p>JOHN KASICH: Let me just speak to that. First of all, when I was elected, I said that it made more sense to allow people who could stay in their own homes, to stay in their homes rather than being put in the nursing home. You would not believe the war that I had to fight to get that done, okay? Number two, we were willing to pay the industry money for improved quality. We were going to give them incentives. What the legislature do? They kept the money in but they stripped out the quality measurements, okay? This is what happens. This is the power of this lobby. Now look, we're for nursing homes, but we're for quality nursing homes. We're for transparency. We're for incentives to get them to deliver quality. And if at some point, you get to a place where they're not getting enough money, of course, you're going to have to do it. But we have a long way to go to reform that. We can't get managed care into our nursing homes now. You know why? What do you think that's -- the reason for that is? And you know what the reason is. I'll let you figure it out. And it's disturbing but -- and there's -- in my state of Ohio, I'm not sure it's very likely to have it happen, and it should happen. It's the right thing to do for the taxpayer. It's the right thing to do for the person that's in the nursing home.</p><p>JONATHAN DINESMAN: And with that, we will call it...</p><p>JOHN KASICH: Not that I feel strongly about it, okay?</p><p>TOM BETLACH: Well, in a -- you can see the impact in a state like Arizona that was able to do it. We have 85% of those at risk of being in institution in the community or in their home.</p><p>JOHN KASICH: Yes. Yes.</p><p>JONATHAN DINESMAN: Thank you, all.</p><p>JOHN KASICH: That's fun.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>JESSE N. HUNTER, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER, CENTENE CORPORATION: Thanks, Jon, and thanks to the panel. So good afternoon. I want to -- you heard a lot about a range of topics this morning from the Centene team. And as we head into the final portion of the agenda, I'd like to focus on the continued success of our strategies and how we're positioned to sustain our growth over the long-term. My comments are focused on the status for our 2020 vision, our go-forward plans for strategic investments and the increasing importance of enterprise partnerships.</p><p>So we'll start with a refresh of our 2020 vision that we've shown at previous Investor Days. We established a clear goal for 2020 for Centene to be the leader of government-sponsored health care. In order to achieve this vision, we've focused on building a diversified platform of markets and products, with enabling technology and services to deliver on our mission of providing better outcomes and lower cost for our customers.</p><p>As we walk through the execution of our strategy, it will be clear that we have delivered on our 2020 vision. The best way to demonstrate the execution of our strategy is to share the measurement tool that we use internally. As you can see, this is a purpose-centered representation of the outcomes we use to measure our performance. So I'd like to take a moment to share some of the examples of key achievements across these categories.</p><p>Everything starts with leadership, and we've made significant progress in this area. Not only has our workforce grown more than 50% over the last 3 years, but we've also built flagship leadership programs through Centene University, and we continue to receive national recognition for our thought leadership, including the 2019 Health Equity Award from CMS. We are broad-focused on quality and had made improvements in our quality scores across markets and products, including the return to 4-star rating from Medicare in 2020.</p><p>You've already heard from Jeff and Brandy about the results of our Centene Forward transformation, and this is a key component of our operational excellence efforts.</p><p>And we've got a long-standing goal to improve margins for Centene, and through our financial disciplined strategy, we've improved adjusted net income margins by over 70 basis points over the last 3 years.</p><p>Finally, consistent with our track record for over the last 20 years, Centene has achieved industry-leading growth of over 80%. It's worth noting that our growth isn't just industry leading within health care, as Centene was once again the fastest-growing company in the Fortune 500 over the last decade. Importantly, this growth has been driven by increasing diversity of products and services, and I'll discuss diversification specifically in a few minutes.</p><p>So when you put all the pieces together, it's clear that we've delivered on our 2020 vision and have established Centene as the leader in government health programs as evidenced by the scale of our membership and revenues delivered across the breadth of the geographies that we cover. These results are reflective of Centene on a stand-alone basis and would only be enhanced with the addition of WellCare.</p><p>As we've said many times, WellCare has a high-quality portfolio of assets that are complementary to Centene's and enhance the execution of our 2020 strategy. Many of you have seen this slide before, but I think it's the best representation of the scale and diversity of our position in government health care. The combined business is expected to have both the scale and expertise across a range of government programs that are poised for growth for years to come.</p><p>So I mentioned that we'd come back to the topic of diversification. Jeff touched on this earlier this morning, and to emphasize the progress we made on our diversification strategy, it's important to take a longer-term view to get a full perspective.</p><p>Going back to 2009, Centene had just over $4 billion in total revenues, with over 90% coming from Medicaid programs. One of the things we're most proud of is our ability to grow and diversify our business simultaneously. When you look at the state of the business 10 years later, you can see total revenues have grown over 17x to $73 billion. Medicaid revenues have grown over 13x to $50 billion while we've also grown the non-Medicaid portfolio to over $23 billion, nearly 1/3 of our revenues.</p><p>On a pro forma basis with WellCare, the proportion of Medicaid business remains consistent, and you can see the scale of other programs, particularly in Medicare Advantage and Marketplace, representing nearly $30 billion of our $100 billion combined portfolio.</p><p>M&amp;A has been a key part of our growth strategy and is expected to continue to play an important role in our growth going forward. We maintain a consistent set of criteria for our M&amp;A transactions, including both quantitative metrics like returns, accretion and debt to cap, but also qualitative measures around leadership, quality and systems. Obviously, we're focused on closing and integrating the WellCare deal, and you'll hear more on that from Michael shortly. But we will continue to evaluate strategic investments in targeted areas.</p><p>Two particular categories I'd like to highlight are international and technology-enabled services. We've made targeted investments in Spain and the U.K. over the last 4 years and have learned valuable lessons about the health care ecosystems in those markets and where there's opportunity for Centene. As a result, we are prepared to expand our international investments, and Brent will talk more about our international strategy momentarily.</p><p>We've made a number of technology investments over the years, and we expect that trend to continue going forward. We understand the critical role that technology and innovation will play in transforming the health care systems around the world, and we cannot be a bystander for that transformation. We have developed a more than a customer orientation for technology and service capabilities in key areas. This approach provides insights for strategically important categories of service and optionality for future ownership of assets that are aligned with our purpose and strategy.</p><p>We've talked about one such investment here today, which is RxAdvance. We recently exercised an initial option for Centene to increase our position in the company. We continue to be pleased with the progress of implementations to date as well as the ongoing opportunity to play a leadership role in the transformation of the pharmacy management model.</p><p>As announced earlier this week, we made a strategic investment in and launched a commercial relationship with Quartet Health. Quartet is a great example of an innovator using technology to create health care solutions, in this case, enhancing physical and behavioral health integration for primary care providers. Centene is committed to serving the whole person, and we recognize that mental health challenges have a disproportionate impact on the population that we serve. We have over a decade of experience on behavioral health integration. And we're excited to bring technology solutions to our provider community to address these important challenges. We look forward to working with more companies like RxAdvance and Quartet to connect Centene assets and innovative technology solutions in the future.</p><p>Finally, I'd like to highlight an emerging opportunity for Centene, enterprise partnerships. As the company has grown, we have entered a new peer group of leading companies that share our objective of collaborating to solve the challenges of health care. While Centene has the scale and assets to drive meaningful impact for our members, providers and customers, we recognize that we can accelerate these efforts if we work with strong partners. We've developed a new enterprise partnership strategy that is designed to leverage our key assets, including scale, the diversity of our population and our data and technology with select partners in targeted areas.</p><p>We've identified 4 key sectors for enterprise partnerships: provider; retail; technology; and financial services. These categories all have credible players that are invested in health care transformation, and all have industry leaders that want to partner with Centene. Obviously, there's a continuing -- continuum of discussions with these potential partners, and there are plenty that we are not in a position to discuss today. But we've already demonstrated our commitment to this approach through the partner -- provider partnership with Ascension.</p><p>We've made tremendous progress with the Ascension team and are excited about this addition to our Medicare Advantage growth strategy. Brent will provide additional details on Ascension in his comments.</p><p>And there's another interesting element of the Ascension partnership. Since we announced the partnership last year, multiple provider organizations have expressed interest in similar models. This reinforces the opportunity we see in provider partnerships, and we'll continue to build momentum in this area along with the broader enterprise partnership strategy.</p><p>In conclusion, Centene has had an ambitious growth strategy as part of our 2020 vision, and we've consistently executed against that strategy. We believe we have the scale and quality of assets that create a diversified portfolio that will continue to drive growth of revenue and earnings well into the future. We have a range of options to build, buy or partner with other leading organizations to drive positive change for the health care industry, and importantly, for those that we serve.</p><p>Thank you, and I'll now turn it over to Brent Layton, our Chief Business Development Officer.</p><p>BRENT LAYTON: Thank you, Jesse, and good afternoon. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you regarding our growth prospects. Since we last met in December and as you heard this morning, we've been busy and we continue to remain confident in our future growth prospects.</p><p>Each time I've had the opportunity to speak here, I'll start with a slide showing the addressable markets. As you can see, there is great opportunity and the ability for expansion and growth. All these areas combined represent an addressable market over $2 trillion. And as you'd expect from Centene, we see Medicaid and Medicare constitute the majority of the market of almost $1.5 trillion. Health Insurance Marketplace, Federal Services and international also represent strong opportunities for our growth.</p><p>Of the $2 trillion health care space, we have a targeted pipeline which today sits at $290 billion. If you recall in December of last year, I mentioned our targeted addressable market was approximately $270 billion. So the opportunities continue to grow. They are not shrinking.</p><p>And as I've said a few times here, to better judge Centene's future, it's important to look at our successes. Let's look at 2014 through 2018 in a different way. Jeff spoke to this financially, but I want to look at it from an RFP win rate and growth stance. Centene saw 45 opportunities, we bid on 34 of them and won 27 of them for an 80% win rate. So far in 2019, we've been awarded 2 RFPs, a reprocurement in New Hampshire and a new market contract in North Carolina.</p><p>In New Hampshire, we began serving Medicaid recipients in 2013 through the launch of their Medicaid managed care program, and we are honored to continue to be a partner with the state of New Hampshire. Now while we're honored to win 2 very important regions in North Carolina, we believe that ultimately, the provider-led entity model is the best approach to creating quality-based, evidence-based approach to managing care and should be an option for all beneficiaries across the state.</p><p>Our unique partnership ensures participation of physicians in ownership and governance of the health plan. And before you ask, I've already been asked, we are waiting for news on the outcome of STAR+ PLUS bid and STAR and CHIP bid in Texas, reprocurement in Oregon and also reprocurement in Louisiana. Based on our track record, we remain confident with these reprocurements. And as an example, we've been fortunate to serve Medicaid recipients in Texas for 20 years and in Louisiana since the beginning of the Medicaid managed care program. We have been operating as a high-quality player that partners with our state customers.</p><p>Now I think it's important to look at the level of activity of Centene's footprint demonstrates today. This map does not include WellCare, but it's strictly showing Centene's reach: 27 Medicaid states, 20 Medicare states, 20 Marketplace states, 16 correctional states and 3 international markets.</p><p>Our future is strong, and we believe there's a tremendous growth left in our existing states with Medicaid expansion opportunities, also with states that do not have aged, blind and disabled, such as Georgia and Nevada, and LTSS that is not offered in a handful of our states for managed care today.</p><p>Last December, we spoke about a joint venture with Ascension, which is the largest nonprofit health system in the U.S. to create a unique partnership for Medicare Advantage. The JV will begin in 4 initial markets in 2020 and additional targeted markets in 2021. Our name for the Medicare Advantage company is Ascension Complete.</p><p>As you've seen with our strategy in North Carolina, we believe the future of health care lies in provider partnerships, empowering physicians and creating transformational partnerships. Have no doubt, our future is on the massive growth opportunities in the United States.</p><p>But we structure ourselves to be able to look at international opportunities as well. A leader has to have a global perspective, and that is what Centene is doing. Now Ribera Salud as you've heard us discuss before is our Spanish operation. And when we spoke previously, we announced an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in Torrejon Hospital in Madrid. This transaction closed in late December, thereby increasing the number of Spanish members we serve under a capitated public-private partnership model by nearly 150,000 to over 605,000 citizens. Additionally, we'll be able to recognize the full revenue of Ribera Salud when our investment increases to 90% at the end of June.</p><p>With this, our annualized Spanish revenue will represent approximately USD 430 million. And through Ribera's investment in Slovakia, we've been able to find a low risk profitable approach to gain experience in this part of the world. Our imaging diagnostic business is a market leader in Slovakia, providing state-of-the-art MRI and CT technologies for approximately 30% of the Slovakian population.</p><p>We see great opportunities internationally: in some situations that we've seen in Spain that are more provider services and provider-led opportunities; and in other markets, insurance approach will be our path to future possibilities. But whatever the opportunity, we believe that Centene is positioned with its knowledge, skill, its systems no matter what a country's approach in their health care landscape to provide innovative through cutting-edge technology, creating value and positive outcomes.</p><p>I always close with a statement, which is true. We're a growth company. We've a demonstrated ability to convert opportunities to Centene with a robust pipeline; a total revenue in excess of $79 billion for 2020, with significant opportunities and prospects; and a diversified strategy across all markets and products.</p><p>Now I'll turn this over to Michael to discuss WellCare integration planning and new organizational structure.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Jesse, Brent, everybody in our panel, thank you. I'm expecting an e-mail. I'm just waiting to see if it comes in. Can somebody else watch this for me? If I get it, tell me. Okay. Thank you, Brent.</p><p>Before we wrap up our program today, I wanted to give you a brief update on our integration planning activities to date as well as share the top line leadership structure of the combined company.</p><p>Both Centene and WellCare have proven track records of executing and implementing transactions. We believe our similar values, including our local approaches and integrated care models, will help ensure we achieve a seamless integration.</p><p>I spoke to our regulatory activities in my comments earlier this morning. Our interactions have been positive and constructive, and we are moving expeditiously through the transition clearance process. Based on our actions thus far, we continue to maintain a time line for approval in the first half of 2020.</p><p>Internally, we have established an integration management office, specific to this deal, which includes the engagement of PwC as our external integration consultant. We are currently assessing the responses from companies to a cultural assessment that will help us identify similarities, address cultural differences and combine best-in-class disciplines. I have always said in every one of our acquisitions that is where culture is where it gets confusing at times. So we point out the differences and make it clear, it is the Centene culture that will survive, very important to be that commonality of approach.</p><p>Dedicated integration planning teams have already been established to focus on the key operational areas of the business. These functional teams are under the oversight of an executive steering committee, and all of these groups consist of both Centene and WellCare representatives.</p><p>Additionally, the integration planning teams have already met in St. Louis and have established the work plans and meeting cadence that will ensure we hit the ground running when we close. We also remain respectful of the separation of the 2 companies until the completion of the deal.</p><p>Before I go on, I want to pause here to make it clear that Centene teams working on the WellCare integration are separate from the teams working alongside Mackenzie for our Centene Forward initiative. Additionally, the savings being captured through Centene Forward are discrete and independent from the WellCare deal.</p><p>As I stated earlier, upon completion of the acquisition, Ken Burdick and Drew Asher will join Centene in executive leadership positions reporting directly to me. Ken and Drew are accomplished public company executives, each with a strong track record of success that includes building WellCare into a high-performing company that it is today.</p><p>They share Centene's values that health care is best delivered locally as well as a strong commitment to smart execution and efficient management. As you can see from the leadership chart, Ken's position is pivotal as he will oversee markets and product segments of the business. This includes Markets, Medicaid, Marketplace, Medicare, Complex Care and Marketing. Aligning the core areas will enable us to further drive integration and innovation for our members and communities and accelerate future growth for the company.</p><p>Drew will bring his discipline and expertise to our specialty service lines of business, which involve -- which include Envolve, PeopleCare, Benefit Options and Pharmacy Solutions. This is yet another pivotal leadership role as WellCare will significantly increase Centene's scale in pharmacy, and we will ask Drew to really focus on this pharmacy area because of the synergies that we expect to see.</p><p>On a combined basis, the pro forma annual drug spend will be approximately $30 billion. Drew's experience in this space as well as his success in running the growing business segments of this size make him a natural leader to focus on that particular significant project.</p><p>When we were structuring the deal, Ken shared with us that he planned to retire in 2 years, and we are pleased that he has agreed to work with us for this pivotal 2-year period. Drew's contract is evergreen. After 2 years, it automatically renews on a year-by-year basis. So we look forward to this ongoing participation in our growth story.</p><p>At this stage in the planning process, we project the rest of the Centene leadership team will stay in place, including those in the office of administration, which are not shown on this chart. This ensures the combined companies' culture remains purpose driven and committed to those we serve, that it prevails as a culture committed to compliance and is one driven by execution, accountability and authority.</p><p>As we move forward with the integration, this leadership team will ensure that Centene's culture remains the combined company's foundational guiding principle.</p><p>You may recall from my earlier comments that we are looking forward to welcoming 2 new directors from WellCare on to Centene's strong and accomplished Board of Directors. We will also be talking to the Board about possibly adding in a 12th director over time. These new additions will help enhance and refresh our governance in more general terms. As always, I remain committed to racial and gender diversity, and we'll continue to work to demonstrate that commitment.</p><p>I will also share with you the matrix we utilize to ensure that we have the appropriate Board experience necessary to run the business. We use the experience criteria when recruiting Board members to ensure that we have the diverse skill sets necessary and are able to identify skill gaps as needed. This matrix has been in place for many years.</p><p>Further, the Board continues to take its responsibility for succession planning very seriously and has succession plans in place for the company's leadership, including me. These plans are reviewed regularly and adjusted if necessary to reflect the growing depth and breadth of the enterprise.</p><p>So in closing, this is a transaction about growth, adding expertise and capabilities across the enterprise and improving our competitive position for long-term success. Centene and WellCare each have extraordinary talent across all levels. We look forward to leveraging the strength of our combined organization to realize the benefits of this transaction for all our stakeholders.</p><p>With that, I thank all my team for the work they put into this to deliver this conference. And we conclude this program. We're looking forward to provide updates as we move through the transaction process, and we would like to thank you all for your continued support for Centene.</p><p>I'll say thank you and open it up for any further questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Scott Fidel, microphone?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Scott?</p><p>SCOTT J. FIDEL: I just have a follow-up question just on the Spanish business and the update on taking a larger stake and how that's going to add to the revenues, $430 million is a bit meaningful.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Sorry, which business, Scott, did you say?</p><p>SCOTT J. FIDEL: In the international and the Spanish business?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Oh yes.</p><p>SCOTT J. FIDEL: Just in terms of the $430 million in terms of when that starts to actually flow into the P&amp;L and what the margin profile may look like on that business.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Jeff?</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SCHWANEKE: Yes. So it's in the numbers. We've had it in the numbers. We knew this transaction was coming. So it's been in process. We had an option on this for some time. So the $400 million of revenue is in our guidance for this year, not the full year, obviously, it's from July 1 going forward. And the profitability -- you have to remember, the profitability was already in our numbers, at least our proportionate ownership. So I guess what I'd say is it's not a significant needle mover on the profitability side.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Kevin Fischbeck?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Kevin?</p><p>KEVIN MARK FISCHBECK: And then maybe talk about the 2020 revenue guidance. I know you guys provide guidance at this point in the year that you feel comfortable with, to say the least. But with that $79 billion, how much of it is kind of annualizing what you've already got versus kind of the growth that you need to go out and win as far as Medicare or exchanges, so just trying to get a deeper level of just how -- look where the visibility is into that?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Jeff?</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SCHWANEKE: Yes. So as we've done in the past, we're not going to get into great visibility here. This isn't our 2020 guidance day. But what I will tell you is, typically, this is kind of what we know as of on the Medicaid side as far as wins. We are projecting growth in both Medicare and the Marketplace business. And then you also have to remember, you have the health insurer fee coming back and then we also have the lower pass-throughs, right? We had an unusual amount of pass-through revenue this year. So as you jump off from this year's midpoint into next year, you got to take some of that pass-through revenue out. So that's all the color I'll give you today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Dave Windley?</p><p>DAVID HOWARD WINDLEY, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Dave Windley, Jefferies. A couple of, I guess, I'll call them platform kind of technology questions. Dr. Ghouri talked about implementing 2, I think 2 states a month in Interpreta last year. And then you're now up to 4 states on RxAdvance. I was wondering if there are any examples of or any, let's call it, case study numbers about the cost savings that those implementations have yielded so far? Again, Interpreta last year and RxAdvance so far?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Jeff?</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SCHWANEKE: Yes. A couple of things I would say is it's still early, right? We just went live on the platform in 4 states. We have 2 more states, I think, coming on in July. So we'll be up to 6 states, and I think over 1 million members. And I think our perspective as we've done in the past is we want to validate those savings first and do that internally. We're optimistic, but we want more time to pass on the platform and obviously, to get more scaled on the platform to validate those.</p><p>Yes. Just real quick, I missed the Interpreta piece. We are seeing improvements on the Interpreta side. It's been very helpful. A part of the risk adjustment commentary that I've had in care gap closure, some of the Centene Forward initiative included the utilization of Interpreta to that so...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: This one is from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. In the unlikely event the ACA is overturned via a Supreme Court ruling of Texas v. Azar, could there be bipartisan support in Congress to continue the ACA until a replacement plan could be passed?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: I think it's, one, the likelihood of having, is what everybody say, is remote. And at the current court makeup the conventional wisdom, and Jon and others can confirm it, it's not 5 4, it's 6 3 7 2. Am I right, Jon? If it gets that far. If the district appeals overturns it, we believe that the Supreme Court won't even take it up because it said, it was good advice. In the incredible unlikely -- and [shareholders] like to say, the what ifs and things like that, I believe no one is prepared to leave 20 million, 22 million people uninsured. And you will find very quickly that people will fall behind it, particularly in an election year. Nobody wants to deal with health care right now in my opinion and you don't know this until after the election. But if that happens, they don't want to go into the election not having done something and leaving 22 million people uninsured.</p><p>JONATHAN DINESMAN: I was just going to add that when you speak to even Republicans in Washington, I know that there's public talking points that you would be even hard-pressed to find Republicans that believe that, that court case is going to remain intact.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: And we said -- in fact, it's interesting, some of you may remember, it was the last Investor Day when we stood here and said that this judge was guaranteed to rule the way he did, and he waited until about 2:00 that afternoon after what he had just said, I think. And we had a great Investor Day and the stock took a hit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (inaudible) from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible) from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Just a follow-up question from what David asked about RxAdvance. Can you guys give us some more color around what data points and checkpoints do you plan to capture, which will kind of drive the pace of how quickly you roll out RxAdvance further so that Centene lives? Any color around those?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Who like to take that, John? Is John here? Yes, Ravi?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Ravi?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Yes. John Sculley or Ravi?</p><p>JOHN SCULLEY: So are you specifically talking -- just to clarify the question. Are you specifically talking about the speed of implementation, like what...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: What data points or checkpoints you want to capture. Like what are the data you're looking for, which will drive like how quickly or slow down the pace at which...</p><p>JOHN SCULLEY: Okay. So it's a variety of things, right? So a lot of it's around the prior authorization. But it's touchpoints, it's manual touchpoints. It's the number of things have begun -- can be done systemically by the platform. So it's a variety of different metrics around speed, accuracy, patient safety. Also how easy it is for pharmacists. We spend a lot of time with independent pharmacists on each thing because many of them, as you know, have -- are all sort of a family of 1, so it's a variety of different things.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And then one more follow-up. On your $290 billion targeted pipeline you talked about, can you help us understand conceptually how this figure gets impacted by the WellCare deal?</p><p>BRENT LAYTON: Just to restate the question. You're talking on the $290 million pipeline, right?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes.</p><p>BRENT LAYTON: I guess what I'd say is that's the Centene pipeline, right? We're still 2 independent companies. So we haven't rolled in or put any of the opportunity on the pipeline for WellCare. I guess I'll just leave it at that.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Any other questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes. We have (inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Two pharmacy-related questions. First, I'm still a bit confused about RxAdvance's capabilities. Do you guys have a Part D -- do you have a Part D offering? And if yes, are you in a position where you can actually bid on WellCare's RFP coming up this year?</p><p>Second, on the rebate rule, now that you guys are going to be big in Part D, what is your expectations in terms of timing of the final rule coming out? And when is the latest it can come out and the reinsurance programs still be live? I keep getting mixed signals in terms of when it will expire.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Kevin will take that.</p><p>KEVIN J. COUNIHAN: If I could just take it in reverse order. On the rebate rule, I think it's our strong sense that the timing, we kind of missed the time when this is practical to put into effect for January. I know what you're saying that you keep hearing more and more, but I think that some of the silence is deafening with respect to what's practical. So again, we'll have to see, but we're already here now in mid-June. It just doesn't seem particularly likely that this will be in effect for 1/1.</p><p>The second thing had to do with Part D, right? So we're not a Part D player. Our new -- our WellCare friends certainly are.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Kevin Fischbeck has a follow-up question.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Kevin?</p><p>KEVIN MARK FISCHBECK: So I wanted to go back to Centene Forward for a second. The $500 million, you mentioned that part of it is the risk adjustment, and then you came in -- you're coming in $100 million higher. How does that impact the $500 million?</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SCHWANEKE: I would say, right, we're managing a portfolio of projects, right? So I would say to the extent we were done with all the projects, I would say yes, that would impact that number, move it higher. We are certainly targeting a much higher number than $500 million. But right now, we're still maintaining the $500 million as something that we think that we can achieve.</p><p>So as we continue to progress through all the work streams and get the more challenging and complicated work streams that usually require a lot of process improvements and technology, once we get some of those completed and validate the savings, then I think there's additional opportunity there.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: And Kevin, I think that it's an important point. This is not a point-in-time project. It's an ongoing project. And once you start, we're going to continue to look at overheads because growth can hide issues. And so what we need to do, we're taking this head on. Until we get to $500 million, we're going to keep going.</p><p>And initially, what's really nice and it's proven to be very valid, it's funding our investments in the technology without affecting the day-to-day margin expansion. So I think that's -- it's all coming together.</p><p>KEVIN MARK FISCHBECK: And unless I missed it, I don't think you guys talked directly about cost trend or really expectation in Medicaid, so love to hear your thoughts on this.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SCHWANEKE: Yes. So nothing -- I'd say nothing different than what we talked about on the first quarter; still continue to see stable cost trends. Rate outlook is the same. Of course, we're managing a broad portfolio of rate adjustments given the number of states we participate. And so nothing new that -- nothing new other than what we talked about on the Q1 earnings call.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes, I have a question if I could. Yes, for Michael. You've built the company that was like less than $0.5 billion. It's heading to $100 billion now. And so much has to change in an organization to make that successful. And I'd looked at all the risks that you have, and I just wanted to get a sense for, is there anything there that keeps you up at night? I mean when you look at the external risks of antitrust, which you have at WellCare; the policy risks not just Medicare for All but the Texas lawsuit; there's all of this contract reprocurement risk that you have.</p><p>And then just assuming everything works out, there's just a huge amount of execution challenges. You're bringing your PBM in-house. You're integrating with WellCare. You have to make the numbers. What makes this work for you? And is there anything that worries you, if at all?</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Well, none of the things you mentioned. I do worry. I mean I tell everybody, I wake up scared every morning because you never want to be complacent, and that's part of it.</p><p>But I think there's a series of things just related to what you're saying. Antitrust risks and those kinds of things, we have -- we spent a lot of time analyzing with some, what I consider, very good minds. And I -- well, you can't take it for granted, and justice has a job to do, and we respect that. I think we're going to move through that process well. We're having good results in the states, and we think that's all going to work out very well. And we think that we're doing the best efforts. We're controlling it as much as we can.</p><p>And I'm trying to remember the whole series of things, what you raised, but give me a couple more, I should have made notes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Oh, there was the policy stuff with what's going on in Congress and then you have all the states and the court and everything.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Yes. I think with the court, I think, I've already spoken to.</p><p>In terms of the Medicare for All and some of these things we're hearing, that is -- the low estimate is $25 trillion over 10 years. The high is $38 trillion. And as we heard earlier from the experts, nobody can afford that. The total budget for 10 years is $58 trillion. You can't pay enough. Some people will say, \"Well, we'll eliminate the insurance companies.\" And what we say is there, we'll pay for it.</p><p>And I understand that because we were talking last night, everything government do is from the Postal Service to anything you look at, they're much more efficient than private industry. So I mean I say that tongue-in-cheek, and they know it. I'm not saying that they don't know. So I don't -- they're realistic words. So I separate the political rhetoric where people are trying to -- and the reality of it.</p><p>But what I do worry about really, 2 things. I worry about compliance. I know we continue to be compliant at every level because I think that's an obligation we have. And we have Matt here, who has a lot of experience at it; Brandy and others. And we're really focused on that.</p><p>The other thing I'm concerned about is having people for the opportunities we have, not opportunities for the great people. But I also think a lot about are we outpacing in our growth the competency of some of our people? And that's why we just -- we formed several years ago Centene University, have a major training program to help people develop and grow with the company because -- and we really feel that, okay?</p><p>But I think what's really importantly to me, when I look around the Centene team that we really are showcasing here, there is incredible confidence. And our whole organization is predicated on we agree to the \"what needs to be done.\" We know how things get done. But they are given the responsibility, accountability and the authority, okay? And that's part of our culture. But it's all done within the same work the way Centene does things. And so I think we have the competency here to make it happen. I look at how the other companies have come together and folded in. It's really worked very well. Did I answer your question?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes. Very impressive.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Ralph Giacobbe.</p><p>RALPH GIACOBBE, DIRECTOR, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two quick ones. I guess, one, just want to go to the margin question, the 1.8% going to 2.6% over the last kind of 5 years. Any help either in terms of the -- I guess, the target margin, or directionally, how we should think about that? Obviously, a lot of moving parts with WellCare obviously coming in; the high acuity mix coming on; pass-through revenues that you mentioned; obviously faster growing service lines. So there's just a lot of components. If you could help us at all think about sort of the margin profile on how you see that sort of playing itself out hereon.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: Jeff?</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SCHWANEKE: Yes. I guess what I would say is just look at the track record, right? So I mean we've steadily improved margins for quite some time. And so we're not -- again, I'm not here giving an earnings number for 2020 yet. We're a little bit ahead of that. But I would say we continue to expect to expand margins in the future. And a lot of these programs that you've heard today and a lot of the technology that we have today is heading in that direction.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: And I'm not trying to be controversial when I say this, but it's just who we want to be. We want to be -- do margins, do everything we do in a sustainable fashion. But we're not looking to jump up and down and bounce all -- it should be sustainable. That's why we're using system capabilities and things you heard about today to continue to expand our margins and make it happen the right way. And I think that's what's key, and we expect more.</p><p>Now I also want to be very, very clear that we believe that on a pretax basis, we look for 3% to 5%, it may reach 6%, in terms of total margins. You're going to have the Marketplace that does better than Medicaid, and Medicare should do a little bit better than that.</p><p>But this is not a business where the regulatory authorities and others would not react if you show excessive margins over a long period of time. So it's all a matter of being very balanced, but very important to be sustainable. And as -- hopefully, at some point, interest income goes up, and we'll be able to improve margins using that, which is discrete from margins from operations.</p><p>RALPH GIACOBBE: Fair enough. One more quick one, if I could. There's been recent efforts in California to expand coverage there. How impactful or not is that specifically around bringing subsidies up to sort of 600%? And any other sort of incremental states or others that you've heard of potentially sort of taking that dynamic or tact to look at some of their...</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: I'll start off, and then if any members of the team want to jump in and add something. I think what they're talking about in California, it can be a positive. We talked about what we want to do. When we have 600%, that's fine and we have -- we used to have off -- outside of here a program, where we're pushing -- it goes from 100% to 400% internal profit level for Marketplace-type products. So I think that's all good in the expansion. The undocumented aspect of it, they cover -- we're going to provide the services that the state expects from us.</p><p>Kevin, do you want to add something?</p><p>KEVIN J. COUNIHAN: I was just going to say that Massachusetts is doing something similar, and there's actually a very interesting paper written by an economist at Harvard named Mark Shepard that has studied the impact of what these higher subsidy levels can do with respect to morbidity and the stability of a risk pool. So it's not -- it's Mark Shepard, and if you want to copy of it, see me, but it's a very interesting paper.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: That's it.</p><p>MICHAEL FREDERIC NEIDORFF: No other questions? Well, this was so much fun, but I guess we will now adjourn. Thank you. We'll see you in December and talk to you on our quarterly calls.

The moratorium on Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approvals would provide Congress time to close the ILC loophole and ensure ILCs and their parent companies don't pose unnecessary risks to consumers and taxpayers.</p><p>\"ILCs offer banking products and services that are functionally indistinguishable from those offered by banks, but the ILC loophole allows the parent companies of ILCs to avoid oversight by the Federal Reserve Board and to engage in commercial activities, thus introducing risk to the banking system and to taxpayers,\" the groups wrote. \"Legislative action to close this loophole is necessary to eliminate these risks.\"</p><p>ILCs are FDIC-insured, state-chartered institutions that can generally engage in the full range of banking activities, such as taking deposits and making loans. But unlike banks, their parent companies are not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act, which means those companies are not subject to any federal supervision, regulations or standards. For this reason, there has historically been considerable opposition to the charter, and both Congress and the FDIC have placed temporary moratoria on ILCs.</p><p>Big Tech company ownership of an ILC introduces a new concern: that consumer data, including sensitive personal financial information, will be inadequately safeguarded and used in inappropriate and unauthorized ways. With global e-commerce giant Rakuten recently joining tech firms such as Square and Nelnet in applying to form ILCs, the risk associated with this legal loophole is greater than ever.</p><p>\"In the era of dominant Big Tech, we should be cautious before giving technology companies even greater reach into the economic life of Americans by allowing them to own banks,\" the groups wrote. \"The integration of technology and banking firms would not only result in an enormous concentration of financial and technological assets but also would pose conflicts of interest and privacy concerns to our banking system.\"</p><p>The groups further noted, \"A growth in ILCs poses broader consumer protection risks as well, because non-bank lenders, including very high-cost lenders, view the ILC charter as a far easier way to obtain banking privileges than obtaining a traditional bank charter and, consequently, becoming subject to consolidated Federal Reserve supervision.\"</p><p>In March, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking related to parent companies of industrial banks and industrial loan companies. BPI, CRL, ICBA and a coalition of civil rights groups wrote to the FDIC requesting that the FDIC not approve ILC deposit insurance applications until its ILC rulemaking is final. However, in recent months, the FDIC has approved some ILC applications and is reviewing others, including some whose parent companies engage in commercial activities.</p><p>[Category: Financial Services]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7192696 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7192696</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GB-HGJ1-JC11-1031-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"528\"/><timeReceived>5:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But where will it take us? In \"On the Horizon,\" a new CSIS series, our scholars offer their insights into the fundamental changes we might anticipate for our future social and economic world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One theory of governance is that democracies only make major changes when confronted with a crisis. It is too early to conclude whether Covid-19 was such a crisis, but the immediate response to it was a rebalancing, perhaps temporary, of individual and collective rights. Long-standing political assumptions about the benefits of restricting the role of government were shattered, and the reverberations of this shift will shape policy in the future. As one commentator put it, \"They say there are no atheists in a foxhole, and there aren't a lot of libertarians in a global pandemic.\"</p><p>Even before Covid-19, there was pressure to reconsider the \"shrink government\" approach that has shaped U.S. policy for the last 25 years. The revived discussion of industrial policy in response to technological competition with China is one example. But, reconsidering small government does not mean renewed public faith in Washington. For privacy, leadership has devolved to state legislatures and to the European Union, which has set itself the goals of becoming the global privacy regulator and holding the United States to higher privacy standards. But neither states nor the European Union are an adequate substitute for federal policy.</p><p>The Post-privacy World</p><p>Privacy has been defined as the right to be left alone. But, measured by the amount of data routinely collected and stored by commercial entities, we live in a post-privacy environment. \"Natural\" privacy--where an individual's personal information was unknown and often unknowable--is an artifact of the Industrial Age, before ubiquitous sensors and digital connectivity. Increasingly we have \"artificial privacy,\" where masses of data are collected for commercial purposes, and privacy, to the extent it exists, is created by rules and regulation that govern how this data is used.</p><p>There are still plenty of libertarians on the internet, and the libertarian impulse (reinforced by commercial interests) still guides privacy and internet policy in the United States. There is some justification for this, as anything other than a laissez-faire approach will require modernizing the laws, regulations, and institutions needed to govern a digital environment. (Laissez-faire has been American practice for two decades.) Moving toward greater regulation of the internet (including for privacy) will damage innovation--the European experience is evidence of that. But laissez-faire policies do not protect privacy and face increasing skepticism and growing demands from governments for greater control of data (called \"data sovereignty\"). These external pressures will force some reconsideration of privacy policy in the United States.</p><p>Let's review what companies can currently collect on individuals through their mobile phone. This includes location (down to the square meter), rate of travel, and, in some cases, altitude. Those with health apps may also provide heart rate, diet, and hours of sleep. Sophisticated algorithms expand the knowledge available from this data. For example, knowing location, speed, and altitude identifies mode of transport (e.g., foot, motor vehicle, or plane). Some operating systems allow location data to be correlated with web searches, contacts, or reading lists. A few widely used mobile operating systems are part of larger commercial activities that scan emails for keywords and correlate them with location data and online searches. Using the enhanced privacy settings on some major operating systems does not stop this collection.</p><p>Health Surveillance</p><p>Recognition that the data generated by these commercial surveillance technologies could be used for public health purposes led governments to adopt intrusive measures to create what can be called \"smart quarantines\"--targeted measures that track those infected or exposed. There are appreciable benefits from surveillance of location and contacts for managing the spread of disease. Israel uses location data already collected by its intelligence agencies for this. Singapore and Korea created \"apps\" for mobile phones that tracked compliance with quarantine rules. In the United States, the White House is developing a national virus surveillance system, and the recent stimulus package directs and funds the Centers for Disease Control to develop a \"public health data surveillance and analytics infrastructure.\" The two tech giants who control the majority of the world's smartphone operating systems agreed to cooperate with the federal government to develop technologies that allow surveillance from mobile devices. Some of these technologies allow people to choose to \"opt-in\" rather than making surveillance mandatory. In each case, the data is anonymized, at least in the initial phases, but allows for the discovery of an individual's identity so that they can be contacted if needed.</p><p>In the face of emergency, existing privacy regulations did not obstruct efforts to manage Covid-19. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has not been an obstacle to the creation of government health surveillance programs or technologies in Europe, even though European officials describe these measures as \"an infringement of fundamental rights and freedoms.\" The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Art (HIPAA), which governs the collection and use of health-related data in the United States, was interpreted by the Department of Health and Human Services to allow the sharing of \"protected health information\" (e.g., patient information) to protect health workers, manage outbreaks of infectious disease, and assist patients.</p><p>These measures are temporary relaxations on government use of health data and do not touch directly on privacy's central problem--commercial use of personal data. Americans seem willing to trust their location and contact data to health providers rather than to law enforcement or security agencies. Survey data suggests individuals will accept this intrusive surveillance during a pandemic but are reluctant to see it become permanent. The issue is whether, once Covid-19 is under control, to continue health surveillance to warn of and control any future pandemic.</p><p>When there is a tangible threat, Americans and Europeans give privacy lower priority. But when Covid-19 pressures decline, there will be a renewed debate on whether citizen concerns over surveillance outweigh public health. Privacy groups have already lined up to oppose permanent change or the retention of health surveillance system. \"We cannot allow the COVID-19 pandemic to serve as an excuse to gut individual's right to privacy,\" said a statement issued April 2 by 100 human rights groups. However, it seems clear that as long as the threat of Covid-19 remains, the public will support health surveillance.</p><p>Health surveillance becomes complicated when it involves commercial actors and the data they already collect. If the public objects to continued health surveillance post-Covid-19, the distrust that greets government surveillance may spread to commercial surveillance if they are seen as agents of government. On the other hand, if commercial surveillance data is not shared with health authorities, it creates a significant vulnerability. The surveillance that people accept now amid a pandemic may have less support afterward, and continuation will require new rules and an oversight structure. This could increase demand for opt-in provisions, but opt-in runs counter to the need for continued broad health surveillance.</p><p>Uncertainty and Redefinition</p><p>The post-privacy environment is marked by uncertainty, in part because people are unaware of the scale of collection and in part because there is disagreement over the form new privacy rules should take. Privacy faces a complicated landscape of digital interconnections that follows the logic of networks and business, not the logic of political borders. The most obvious fault line is between Europe and the United States. The United States has taken a sectoral and self-regulatory approach to privacy where constraints largely apply only to government use of personal data. The European Union has taken a comprehensive regulatory approach. There are disadvantages with each, as the digital environment continues to redefine itself in response to technological change.</p><p>What people say about privacy and what they do are very different. Perhaps people may be unaware of how little privacy they have left online, but consumers make choices that suggest their attitudes toward privacy are changing. Europeans, for example, are hostile toward Google (and other U.S. tech giants) as Google collects immense amounts of personal data, but the great majority of Europeans still avail themselves of Google's services. An EU-funded, privacy-respecting alternative search engine (Quaero) unveiled a decade ago has so little appeal that one has to google it to find it. This acceptance of intrusive commercial surveillance may be because consumers have little choice (to use a service, you must provide your data), but this raises anti-competitiveness concerns and (at least in Brussels) the question of whether online services should be regulated like public utilities.</p><p>Privacy is being redefined. The response to Covid-19 will accelerate this. In a digital environment, you surrender the possibility of being left alone the moment you connect to a digital network, and very few are willing to completely disconnect. Digital technologies create surveillance opportunities that make people uncomfortable but, as in the case of health surveillance, offer real benefit. The process of redefinition will be lengthy and complicated by the increased interest outside the United States in regulation and \"data sovereignty.\" The immediate issue is whether to continue health surveillance and under what rules would such collection be governed.</p><p>Legislating Privacy</p><p>Covid-19 will expand public awareness of how technology has commercialized personal data, but it will take time for this awareness to play out in public attitudes and policy. The general sentiment seems to be that the measures of enhanced digital surveillance created in response to the virus are expedient and temporary, justified by health and not security. While these have been presented as provisional, and to be discontinued once the crisis is over, this global pandemic opens the possibility of permanent measures for monitoring disease and health using the data generated by digital devices. If this is the case, both U.S. and European privacy rules will need to be amended to permit it.</p><p>While it is unlikely that Congress will pass a national privacy bill in the next year, the need to amend existing laws to accommodate health surveillance, the antitrust implications of a few giant companies dominating the information space, and the growing discontent over privacy will eventually force it to enact legislation. Industrial Age privacy has been eroded to the point of vanishing by the data created by and harvested from digital networks, but Europe is not a good guide on how to construct a new American privacy policy. The EU's privacy rules helped stifle the European information technology industry and explain why there are no European internet giants. An overly expansive definition of privacy hurts innovation; a minimalist definition (like that in the United States) and the relentless commercialization of personal information leaves citizens vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation, as with Cambridge Analytica. Informed by the experience of Covid-19, Congress may wish to consider the following points:</p><p>* \"Personally Identifiable Information\" (PII) is a commodity. The business model of the internet is based on trading this commodity for services. No alternative to this business model has emerged, but trade in PII is unstructured and lacks markets or pricing mechanisms. This creates inefficiencies in the exchange and use of personal data and makes individual control over data more difficult.</p><p>* Absent judicial and regulatory pressure, privacy will continue to shrink as new technologies (particularly the combination of fast 5G networks, widespread sensors, and artificial intelligence and data analytics) create new sources of data and make greater use of it. Access to and use of data is essential for economic growth and for public health, but making PII a commodity creates discontent. GDPR is an attempt to change this, but the European experience shows that poorly designed privacy regulations create obstacles to innovation in information technologies.</p><p>* The response to Covid-19 will accelerate corporate and individual concerns over cybersecurity, but there has been no new thinking in a decade on public policy to address the cybersecurity problem. Cybersecurity and privacy are related--both deal with data protection--but have a fundamental difference. Privacy is based on an expectation that rules will be followed. Cybersecurity is a response to rules violations. Covid-19, with its eruption of cyber fraud and cyber espionage, will increase demand for better data protection.</p><p>* Antitrust affects privacy, as the data practices of regulated and unregulated service providers differ significantly. Tensions over antitrust will be exacerbated as changes in telecommunications technology pit large tech companies offering largely unregulated network services against highly regulated telecommunications service providers. As big tech companies begin to offer telecommunications services, they will gain an unintended advantage if this is preserved. Unbalanced regulatory treatment of increasingly similar services guarantees a battle. It will not be a repetition of the Uber experience, where a well-financed tech company offered an unregulated service in competition with the highly regulated taxi companies. Unlike the hapless cab drivers, the regulated competitors this time are also financial giants and experienced in the ways of Washington.</p><p>* The imbalance between highly regulated government use of personal data and lightly regulated commercial use dates to the 1980s and no longer makes sense. The response to Covid-19 is an opportunity to move toward greater use of personal data by government agencies for health and economic purposes and more constraints on commercial use. Privacy advocates care about government surveillance but have often given commercial surveillance a pass. Covid-19 has not fundamentally changed their views, and we can expect a backlash from these groups against the measures created for health surveillance. At the same time, the benefits of health surveillance and data analytics for controlling the risk of pandemic will be widely recognized and demand for some continuation of these measures will probably be unstoppable. A key issue for policymakers will be whether to keep health surveillance in place even after the virus is under control</p><p>Covid-19 came at a time of already heightened attention to the ways that technology reshapes societies and economies. Although there are many contradictions in public attitudes on data collection and use, the broad outlines of a new concept of privacy is emerging that balances greater access with increased transparency and rules on use, since privacy depends on public trust that there are rules that are followed and enforced.</p><p>A new rules-based approach to privacy and data protection lies somewhere between the United States' commercial minimalism and European regulatory overreach. The health surveillance created for Covid-19 can help reframe the issue for Congress to better balance regulation, oversight, government use, and commercial practices.</p><p>James Andrew Lewis is a senior vice president and director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.</p><p>[Category: Political]</p><p>Contact: H.

Hello and ni hao to everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're going to be talking today to John Demers who's the assistant attorney general for national security--a job he's held for more than two years. </p><p>He leads DOJ's efforts to combat national security-related cybercrime, terrorism, espionage and (INAUDIBLE) controls, oversea FISA and conduct national security reviews under CSIS and the DOJ. </p><p>He was selected about two years ago--almost two years ago--to lead the China initiative at DOJ to counter the Chinese persistent and aggressive economic--economic espionage. And that's a lot of what we'll be talking about today. </p><p>Prior to his service as the assistant attorney general, John was the vice president and assistant general counsel at Boeing. And prior to that, he was also at the--you were in the first generation, right? Of the NSD initiation? </p><p>DEMERS: Yes, that's right. Yeah. </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah. So, NSD's relatively new and you were there starting in 2006. </p><p>DEMERS: Right. </p><p>LEWIS: Right, so long career, distinguished and thank you for doing this. </p><p>What we're going to do today is John will talk for a few minutes. I'll ask him some questions. We'll have a conversation. </p><p>And then, we'll turn to the audience. So, get your questions ready. We will screen them, so. But we'll be happy to entertain anything you want to ask. </p><p>John, over to you. </p><p>DEMERS: Great! Well, thanks very much, Jim. And thanks for having me and--and proposing that--that we do this on this topic. I know, you know, that National Security Division's done a number of events with CSIS including our 10-year anniversary event in 2016. </p><p>And, you know, more recently on this topic like just earlier this year we were kind of looking at the one year--a little bit more than one year mark on this topic. But this is a topic obviously, that continues to develop over time. So, thank you for having me again. </p><p>So, just for a little background then on the--what the China initiative is here at the Department, you know. It really was an organic outgrowth of the intelligence briefing that the prior Attorney General and I were receiving on, you know, a--a daily/every other day basis. </p><p>And we were just seeing in those briefings how much theft of intellectual property was emanating from China and directed by the Chinese government. And began talking about what could we do to, you know, step up our efforts to combat this. </p><p>Obviously, this falls squarely in NSD's portfolio. And for years, NSD has been working on this issue. But the question was what more can we do. </p><p>And so, we came up with this China initiative which as you said, was to focus on theft of intellectual property by the Chinese government mainly on the theft side. Just, you know, to give some statistics, 80 percent of our economic espionage cases at the department reigns, so that means theft of intellectual property on behalf of a state---on behalf of the government itself--or for the benefit of the government involved China--the Chinese government. </p><p>Sixty percent of our trade secret cases involve China, so that trade secret denominator is much bigger. That includes any theft of intellectual property by anyone anywhere, not necessarily government oriented or--or for the benefit of the government. </p><p>So, significant numbers and that was before the initiative. So, that's--that's the kind of thing we were looking at when we were deciding to put this together. </p><p>And we put this together for a couple of purposes. One, to make sure that we here obviously at Main Justice were focused on this issue and prioritizing the input. </p><p>A lot of it was to message the United States attorneys--94 U.S. attorneys around the country who are doing the bulk of the investigations and prosecutions together with the FBI. And these cases are difficult. They're not cases where you're going to have high numbers every year. </p><p>And so, we wanted the U.S. attorneys to understand though that they were a priority of the AGs. And he was going to understand, you know, if you had one economic espionage case in a year that's actually a good year in a given district. Two is fantastic and zero is, you know, not a shocker. </p><p>So, these are not going to be cases where you've got 30, 50, 100, 150 cases a year. Wanted to focus on them. </p><p>The second thing we wanted to do was empower the U.S. attorneys around the country to develop relationships with the private sector, and with academic, and research institutions. </p><p>So, a lot of what we see when we see it on the Intelligence side--those of us who sort of live in this space--what becomes difficult is when you go out and you talk about it. And you can get paralyzed because you think, \"Well, I learned a lot of this in a classified environment. What can I say? What's classified? What's not classified?\" </p><p>So, we--but we need those U.S. attorneys around the country to develop locally the relationships with the companies and academic institutions in this--in their area. So, we empower them and in terms of the materials, and trainings that we get, etc. on, you know, what it is that they could say to the companies to sensitize them to this risk and to try to develop the relationships. We need the private sector in this working with us to help us defend them. </p><p>And--and then, the third goal really is to look also at our other tools like you mentioned, Jim, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. that looks at foreign acquisitions here in the U.S. mainly of technology, but increasingly of data. We can talk a little bit about that as well within China, and--and--and work that process, and make sure that we were adequately focused on the National Security risks. </p><p>So, you know, we ticked that off about two falls ago--two autumns ago. Look, we were building as I said, on a series of cases that began in about 2014 with the first indictment of People's Liberation Army officers for cyber intrusions into a variety of--of companies and institutions. </p><p>That was really a--a seminal moment. So, I always like to start there because, you know, as you start to think about it, you realize that many of these cases are traditional law enforcement actions. But ones with significant foreign policy ramifications. </p><p>So, back then--that was back in the Obama administration--getting, you know, the entire sort of interagency on board with the idea that the Justice Department was going to charge members of another country's military with cyber intrusions is--was a big lift, you know. </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah. </p><p>DEMERS: But we get it. We went ahead and that has--is a precedent that we've been able to build on and, you know, we had a cyber indictment just a couple of weeks ago. Again, that one involving the Ministry of State Security to Chinese Intelligence Services. </p><p>So, we were building on that and what we were trying to combat in this is, you know, what I've called a rob, replicate and replace approach to economic development that we were seeing from the People's Republic of China. And that is, you know, stealing American intellectual property, replicating that product, and then replacing the U.S. company first on the Chinese market and if all went well, on the global market. </p><p>And we saw this being done as I mentioned, through cyber cases. But if you look at our more recent cases, what most of the cases we charge are actually insider cases. </p><p>So, there's individuals at companies or academic institutions here in the U.S. who are stealing and bringing the technology to China. Now there's--even within that, there's a couple of different kinds. </p><p>There's one set which I think of as sort of the state directed cases. What we saw since 2014 was an expansion of responsibilities within the Chinese government from pure People's Liberation Army hacking--cyber intrusions--to the use of MSS or the Chinse Intelligence Services to take intellectual property. </p><p>As a consequence I think of that shift in who's working on this issue on the Chinese side, you have a shift in tactics because when you bring in the Intelligence Services, what they're really good at is developing relationships to get information. That's their trade, right? </p><p>Since the beginning of civilization for all of us. And what we're seeing in China is then using that same trade craft and those same approaches to develop relationships with individuals in companies here-- </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah. </p><p>DEMERS: --in order to coop them to give information there. And that's what they do on the traditional espionage side and--and have done for a long time. </p><p>So, that means that a lot of our cases aren't just the cyber intrusion cases. Although the MSS does that too. They're these insider cases. </p><p>And--an, you know, an example of that would be the MSS officer who we extradited from Belgium two years ago who had coopted an individual at a U.S. aerospace company in order to steal commercial jet engine technology and bring it to China. </p><p>The--the second category in this--these individuals--these insiders--are people who have been induced by Chinese programs like the Thousand Talents Program to take intellectual property from their employer--whether it's a company or it's a university--and take that to China one way or another by entering into these Thousand Talents contracts and get paid either for doing work there or really, ultimately for transferring the intellectual property. </p><p>So, the Thousand Talents' just a level set everybody is program that at one level is totally fine. It's about recruiting the best human talent you can from around the world and bringing it to China. Something obviously, a lot of companies do, right? </p><p>And a lot of organizations do when they go after the best people. But it has a underbelly and the underbelly is that when you apply for this program--it's a very formal, bureaucratic process to apply for this program--you've got to show that you're going to bring intellectual property there. </p><p>And an aspect of this--and if you look at our cases that we brought--a lot of our academic cases involve individuals who were members of this Thousand Talents' Programs. And a hallmark of the ones we've charged is that they're hiding their Thousand Talents' affiliation. </p><p>So, this isn't as if, you know, \"I worked at one company--\" </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah. </p><p>DEMERS: \"--and then, I openly sort of, you know, have a--have a weekend job\" or something like that. These are individuals who are hiding from the U.S. government from which they were getting grant money to do the same research hiding from their institutions, their affiliations with Chinese universities or other Chinese entities and they're work there. </p><p>And--and so, if you look at our cases, they all kind of sound in, you know, fraud, tax fraud-- </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah. </p><p>DEMERS: --you know, grant fraud, things like that. </p><p>So, that's, you know, the way. And that--and that last piece, you know, Jim, has really developed. I--I mean, when we started this initiative, I--we didn't really have that piece in mind. That's developed through the investigations that we have done, you know, together with the Bureau. </p><p>So, you know-- </p><p>LEWIS: So, I was talking--I was just talking to somebody who's on the Board of one of the big Tech universities. And what do you think the reaction is to the universities to this? </p><p>I know this is a little off-topic, but they weren't entirely persuaded that all their Board colleagues were understanding of our problem. </p><p>DEMERS: Yeah. I mean, look, I think here's the thing. When I go to a company and I say, \"You know what the most important thing is that you protect the intellectual property that different--differentiates you from your competitors and people are trying to steal it. You should really protect it.\" It's, you know, like, \"No, duh. This is what I'm supposed to be doing.\" </p><p>If you go to a university with a very different environment which is one that begins--and frankly that the Chinese are taken advantage of--which is an open environment sharing information, you know. The hallmark of being successful at universities is publishing your findings, not keeping them secret to monetize them, right? </p><p>LEWIS: Right. </p><p>DEMERS: And--and you go there, and you start to talk about theft of intellectual property. It sounds very different. </p><p>So, the--the--what we have been emphasizing for the universities is one, \"Here's the risk that you're facing. Here's what's happening. \" </p><p>We can talk about, you know, the recent actions involving the PLA researchers in this context. And look, what we're saying is we expect you to have clear conflict of interest and conflict of commitment policies, so that your disclosures to the federal government are accurate. </p><p>But if you're comfortable that you're professor has this relationship with China and it's all openly disclosed to you, we're not going to tell you not to do it unless, you know, the information is classified or exported whole. </p><p>So, we're not telling. So, unless it's government information or exported whole information, we're not going to tell them what to protect. But we are going to push the value of a transparency at those colleges. </p><p>And if you look at the cases that we indicted, if you look for instance, at the Harvard case which-- </p><p>LEWIS: Sure. </p><p>DEMERS: --since it's Harvard got, you know, the most notice. Here's an individual who unbeknownst to Harvard, was using Harvard's logo and name in China. I should say these are all allegations. That case is still pending. </p><p>Using that name in order, you know, as part of a collaboration with--with a Chinese university. And again--and again, that if he had been doing that openly--at least with respect to the university piece, you know, the university could decide what is inbounds and what's not inbounds. </p><p>So, the differing reaction, but we've been working very hard with the universities--the Bureau has. </p><p>Coronavirus has, you know, sort of hand--hampered us in our ability to continue our outreach to them, but we're doing what we can, you know. </p><p>LEWIS: It's been a busy couple of months for you. So, I think people will be disappointed if we don't talk about TikTok and WeChat, if we don't talk about the Houston Consulate and, you know, then the whole China telecomHuawei clean network thing. </p><p>DEMERS: Right. </p><p>LEWIS: So, I don't know where you want to start, maybe with Houston? </p><p>I mean-- </p><p>DEMERS: Sure. </p><p>LEWIS: --why Houston? </p><p>DEMERS: Yeah. So, you know, a couple of things on Houston. One, Houston has long been on the radar screen of the FBI as the source both of a significant intellectual property theft emanating from it including--including recruitment into the--the Talent Program-- </p><p>LEWIS: Yes. </p><p>DEMERS: --spotting and assessing of folks. </p><p>And then, on the foreign influence side or the covert foreign influence side which we at least at this point can talk a lot less about, but I hope one day we'll be able to--to talk more about. </p><p>So, that's why Houston and, you know, was not chosen at random out of the consulates out there. They were actually at the forefront in both of these hearings. And the closer of the Houston Consulate and the simultaneous actions taken with respect to the PLA folks who were here, but not disclosing their affiliation. If they were here on J1 research visas, they were not disclosing their affiliations with the PLA--were all attempts at disruption of what we had been tracking for quite some time of activity here in this country. </p><p>And what you've seen sort of publicly in terms of those disruptions for arrests, you know, I think more than 50 interviews in 30 different cities. Even if that number is still just a tip of what was going on under the surface and what we were trying to disrupt together with the Bureau and together with the State Department, of course, whenever you're talking about a consulate closure. </p><p>So, if we recognize that we're not going to just be able to prosecute our way through these issues. There have been years of folks being sent here undercover in a variety of covers. And what we need to take are actions to disrupt that level of activity. And that's really the best way to understand what happened in Houston and also to understand what was happening on the--on the PLA side of things. </p><p>LEWIS: Now I'm going to warn you that what you say next could alienate millions of 15-year-olds, but do you want to talk a little bit about TikTok? </p><p>DEMERS: Yeah. Well, it alienated me from my daughter as well, so. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You think, you know, so what are our National Security concerns with TikTok? </p><p>TikTok, look, is a very interesting case. Let me just step back and say one of the things we've seen and--and really kind of exploded on the scene with the pack of OPM, right? </p><p>LEWIS: Uh-huh. </p><p>DEMERS: And Office of Personnel Management Records, but after that with, you know, as recently as the Equifax indictment we brought a few months ago, Anthem, the healthcare company hack and other cases we've seen. </p><p>LEWIS: Sure. </p><p>DEMERS: It is a Chinese appetite for large volumes of sensitive personal data, right? </p><p>LEWIS: Uh-huh. </p><p>DEMERS: And we have seen that on the cyber intrusion side as I just talked about. We also see it on the CFIUS side. </p><p>So, we see targeted acquisitions or proposed acquisitions of U.S. companies that wouldn't traditionally be thought of as falling within CFIUS because CFIUS was traditionally thought of as protecting technologies, right? </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah. </p><p>DEMERS: On the data side, you know, that brings into sort of the CFIUS purview health insurance company, financial services companies, all sort of data especially as you think about the fact that more and more smart technologies exist. And those smart technologies are gathering data continually on your life and the way you're living your life. We've had a lot more of those come through the CFIUS process. </p><p>So, what's interesting about TikTok is you have one of the first instances in which individuals are signing up for and providing the app with their sense of a personal data. First, when they sign up for it, right? </p><p>And there's, you know, information you can give. And some people tell the truth and some people don't, right? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And then, there's the data that the app collects about you while it's on your phone. And like a lot of other apps, that app is collecting geo-location data. If you enable it, it's connecting your contact list. It's--it--it is following your use of the phone and other apps on the phone. </p><p>Part, you know, certainly on the surface to provide you with a better TikTok user experience, right? </p><p>LEWIS: Sure. </p><p>DEMERS: But can also be used--abused really by--by the--the State. So, once is the sense of the personal data piece. </p><p>The second is, you know, what we saw a lot of allegations on TikTok when it comes to censorship of certain policy views. So, you know, Uyghurs, Hong Kong protests, Tibet, Taiwan, all those issues, you know. There are many reports of the content being censored from a--from a foreign influence perspective. </p><p>So, those are the National Security risks associated with TikTok. What's interesting about TikTok is you have an instance of, you know, Americans voluntarily signing on to this product as opposed to the Chinese stealing the data or the Chinese buying the data. </p><p>And that's what, you know, the--the recent executive order was--was meant to address. And we'll kind of--obviously there's more for that process to play out. But we'll see how it goes. </p><p>LEWIS: So, when you look at the actions over the last really year, I mean, you've got Huawei. You've got China Telecom in the U.S. You've got Clean Network. You've got TikTok and Tencents. And maybe we'll come back to that, but what is the goal here for the administration? What is it they're driving for? </p><p>DEMERS: Well, certainly, very focused on telecommunications as you point out in--in--in the way you strung together there. There's a--a real I think appreciation that especially as we move to 5G technologies, you know, as I think any of us who'd think about it for a little while realize is just so much of your life is running over telecommunications network right now. And never more so than during Covid, right? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>As we're doing right here. Your professional life, your banking life, your personal life, you know, your social life, on and on. And with the internet of things, of course, more and more things are going to be connected through 5G cards, you know. </p><p>Your--I just bought a new oven. Your oven is connected to your phone if you want it to be, your refrigerator, you know, all of those things. All of which can be used to paint a very interesting picture of your life to someone who wants to learn more about you. </p><p>So, one is that an understanding that the security therefore, of the networks over which all that data is running is really paramount to National Security in this century. And so, what you're seeing with the focus on the telecommunications licenses, the use of Huawei and the resistance of the use of Huawei and 5G networks is a desire to ensure that we have trusted vendors from trusted countries. And that is countries that share our same political values that are running these telecommunications networks over which our entire lives are already running and only will run more so in the future. </p><p>LEWIS: Huawei brings up the issue of cooperation with other countries and we're not the only one to experience Chinese espionage. And, you know, I--the Canadians, of course, now have people being taken hostage in China. What's it like working? Where do you--how do you assess cooperation not just Five Eyes, but NATO, others--Japan, Australia? What's the effort to cooperate with these in these cases? </p><p>DEMERS: There's--on the 5G, you know, there's been a tremendous effort to--to cooperate with these other countries starting with the Five Eyes, but then growing out from there in Europe and in Asia. </p><p>And it's been a--a difficult road, but it has. It's also born successes. Obviously, the U.K. just changed its position on the use of Huawei in--in 5G networks. </p><p>That is, you know, the result of I think a lot of discussions with--with these countries and trying to illustrate to them the risk. But we're--the main thing that we're up against  in these discussions is not a failure to appreciate what the risk is. It's a worry about the economic impact that angering a country like China can have. </p><p>China remains a tremendous market for a number of these countries, investment opportunities both sort of foreign direct investment into them, and then investment by their companies, and the Chinese market for their companies. </p><p>So, that's always a--and we've seen numerous reports of this. But that is very openly an economic stick that's, you know, held over the heads of these countries as they're making a decision on--on the 5G front. And that's been something that we have had to--to work through. </p><p>I think in this regard actually, China's behavior during the Coronavirus has actually, you know, helped move some folks into our camp especially in Europe by illustrating some of--some of the risks. </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah. It just is a footnote. We have a separate project with my colleague Heather Conley interviewing Scandinavian countries. And one thing that surprised me about Chinese investment and one thing about surprised me is how many of them brought up Hong Kong as-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Yeah-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Something that--that created, you know, unhappiness and-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Right-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Bad feeling in the relationships. So-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Yeah-- </p><p>LEWIS: --I don't know if the Chinese always get that far. Chinese viewers, no offense, you know. </p><p>DEMERS: Yeah. I mean, I think you're right, Jim. Hong Kong and the Uyghurs have been two of the biggest issues especially in my discussions with the Europeans. </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah. </p><p>DEMERS: Those are the two issues that have really, you know, sort of brought to life I think some of the risks we're talking about and also solidified the importance of sort of--look, we have a lot of our disagreements with the Europeans and about different things. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But the truth is at the end of the day, we do share the same political values. And that is very helpful when we're having these discussions. </p><p>And I think, you know, what happened in Hong Kong with the--the breaking of the promises-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Yeah-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Obviously that they made in '97 was happening with the Uyghurs has--has really helped us. </p><p>LEWIS: Well, I want to come back to the economic issues. But since you brought it up, one of the things that I admired kind of in the executive order was it looked like it was very skillfully written in a way to try and catch apps. </p><p>So, apps are a new problem. You've got-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Yep-- </p><p>LEWIS: --A foreign service located outside the U.S. made by another country. </p><p>So, what were you guys thinking when you wrote the app language which, you know, the Europeans share that problem. They like to catch apps. Not just Chinese apps, but what are you thinking in terms of extraterritorial, sovereignty? What's the story on apps? </p><p>DEMERS: I mean, apps are, you know, really raise the problem that I think TikTok illustrates best and that is, you know, you have there available in your app store. And you have U.S. users who are choosing to download those. </p><p>But once you do that, you really have no idea where any of that data is going. I think all of us even use the most ubiquitous apps that we use. We--we don't really appreciate everything our phone is collecting on us in our lives. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And we tolerate that risk. Maybe if we think that the worst thing that's going to happen is I'm going to get strange solicitations for something that I didn't realize anyone ever knew that I was interested in. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But I was talking while Siri was on and Siri picked that up. And suddenly-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Yeah-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Sent me an ad on my Washington Post app for the very thing that I was talking to my wife about. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, you know, we--we sort of tolerate that because it provides us I think with benefits. But once you start looking at that from a National Security perspective, and--and thinking about the data that--that the phone and the apps are collecting on you, it's a very different matter if a country with very different values from a--a--and without the same rule of law, and separation of powers that we have, and impacted court system is collecting all that data. </p><p>And what--what we see or in terms of what--what are the Chinese doing with this data? Which is the other question that often comes up. And--and we see two different things. One, huge quantities of data are needed to perfect artificial intelligence tools/algorithms. </p><p>So, one of them is, you know, that. The second is more from a counterintelligence perspective--99 percent of that data they will not be interested in from a counterintelligence perspective. </p><p>But once they're interested in somebody if it's as a potential compete [sic], or somebody who has just gotten an important government job, or something like that, if they can mine those existing data sources to find out what that person's financial like--life is like, what their health life is like, what their, you know, married life is like, you know. </p><p>If you're a married person and you have a dating app on your phone, that's a little strange and of great interest to an intelligence officer, right? </p><p>And they can use all that to paint a very effective picture of you and to think about where your vulnerabilities might be or even how best to approach you. If the purpose is cooptation, how to--how to approach you for that purpose. </p><p>LEWIS: Yes. </p><p>DEMERS: So, you know, that's what we think they're doing with these--with the information. Then, of course, geolocation is very important for--for targeting someone if in fact, that's what you're doing. I don't mean targeting like killing. I mean, targeting just by following around. </p><p>LEWIS: Sure, yeah. </p><p>DEMERS: In fact, for instance, that my phone doesn't move throughout the workday would tell you--if you didn't already know--that I work in a secure facility, right? </p><p>LEWIS: Uh-huh. </p><p>DEMERS: Because your phone probably moves during the workday, right? </p><p>It's--it's--it's in your pocket. It's in, you know. And so, if I'm--let's say I'm undercover and I'm pretending that I have one job, but in fact, you see my phone behaving in a way that suggests I have another job, that tells you a lot about me too. </p><p>LEWIS: So, the other company that the executive orders went after was Tencent and WeChat. And Tencent's a great company. If they were located anywhere else, they would be giving American companies a real run for their money. </p><p>But the EO is crafted in a way that--that it goes after WeChat, very popular app. Not a lot of users in the U.S., but it didn't seem to go after the game side of Tencent. Is--was that intentional? Was it an oversight? </p><p>I don't want to tag you guys on--I don't want to ruin Tencent's business here. They'll probably be mad at me. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You know-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Yeah-- </p><p>LEWIS: --That's where they make most of their money in the U.S. is on gaming and they have some really good games. So-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Is that your chance to alienate even more teenagers? </p><p>DEMERS: Exactly. </p><p>(LAUGHER)  </p><p>No, look, the--the--the--the--there--there was not an oversight in the grafting of that EO there on--on the WeChat part. It's--it's a little different, right? </p><p>It's a communications app. Fundamentally. It--it does collect a lot of the same information about the users that we were talking about before. </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah. </p><p>DEMERS: Back to TikTok, there's that piece of it. In addition, WeChat is used here in the U.S. as a method by the Chinese Communist Party to communicate with Chinese individuals here in the U.S. </p><p>For instance, I'll give you an example from the university setting where the Chinese students at a university--students who are visiting here from China--all have WeChat. And they will be in a group chat with the other students at the university. And the Chinese will use the WeChat to message what they want to the Chinese students. </p><p>So, for instance, the State Department has some great examples of messaging by the--here's the goal of the Chinese government. Send the Chinese student here to reap all the benefits of the U.S. technical education, but not allow them to get polluted by ideas like liberal democracy or religious freedom, right? How do you do that? </p><p>You need to control the space around them both electronically and you need to encourage what already happens with foreign exchange students just like, you know, they like to hang out with people who speak the same language and of the same cultural references as them. </p><p>You look at U.S. students in Rome, for instance, all like, \"Are you really learning Italian here? You just keep hanging out with each other.\" </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, the--they--they try to encourage that by creating these bubbles around the Chinese students. And by messaging, for instance, America's very violent. Look what's happening. Look at this picture. The--the--the Global Engagement Center estate has great examples of this. </p><p>Look at this picture of this Chinese guy who was beaten by the police. I have no idea whether the picture is true or not. But they message the--how, you know, dangerous America is. \"Don't go out there.\" Don't--you know, basically get to know the country. </p><p>So, WeChat has a kind of foreign influence. And in this case, it's a little even less foreign influence and more controlling aspect to it which, you know, obviously an app like TikTok doesn't have. </p><p>So, it's a slightly different risk profile, but still one that's been on our radar screen as a used--because of the Chinese government's use of it here in the U.S. </p><p>LEWIS: We have a boatload of questions. So, I'm just going to start going down the list. </p><p>DEMERS: Yeah. </p><p>LEWIS: One of--one of the first was that the recent indictments have highlighted the efforts to steal vaccine and anti-viral activity. </p><p>DEMERS: Yeah. </p><p>LEWIS: You--you know, are there other hacking teams? What's the situation going on there? How much is China focused on stealing vaccine data? </p><p>DEMERS: Yeah. So, look, first of all, you have to sort of see that in context. We know from our prior cases that the Chinese have long been interested in biomedical research of all kinds, right? </p><p>LEWIS: Uh-huh. </p><p>DEMERS: So, just recently we stopped someone in Boston who had vials of biomedical material in--in her--on herself--on themselves as they were trying to, you know, go back to China. They'd been a researcher here in the U.S. </p><p>We--we've seen it in--in other cases that we've indicted. It's on the Made in China 2025 plan, right? So that-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Uh-huh-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Gives you a sense of where the focus of Chinese efforts are. So, in that context, it would be surprising if they were not trying to steal the most valuable biomedical research that's going on right now. Valuable from a financial point of view and invaluable from a geopolitical point of view to be the first--maybe the Russians have them beat now. I don't know--to develop a coronavirus vaccine or treatments. </p><p>So, what you saw charged in that one case was just one of multiple that was an attempted intrusion--intrusion of attempted intrusions that we have seen around the country. And, you know, obviously we haven't charged all of those for--for a variety of reasons. </p><p>But it--that isn't sort of the exclusive piece of it. It--it's part of a--of a greater effort to see, you know, to try to collect whatever research there is to try to get ahead of this. </p><p>LEWIS: I can combine a couple because they overlap. People ask, \"How do we avoid the appearance of racism?\" </p><p>And then, among Chinese students and researchers of Chinese consent, there's a concern that this might lead to a Red scare and racial profiling. So-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Yeah-- </p><p>LEWIS: --The Red scare one is a legitimate one. Racial profiling? I know. What are you thinking on that? How do we avoid that impression? </p><p>DEMERS: Yeah. So, look, this is something that we are very focused on--have sort of flagged as an issue from the beginning. </p><p>LEWIS: Wow. </p><p>DEMERS: We launched this. I mean, one, if you look at our cases you'll see that although many do involve individuals of Chinese descent, others do not. </p><p>The Libre case, the Harvard case in Massachusetts-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Right-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Is not a--a--a Chinese American person. To the extent that they do, it's because we--what we've seen is that the Chinese government itself focuses on--and when they're trying to coop, they focus on individuals of Chinse ethnicity. </p><p>The more recent the immigration, the better because-- </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah. </p><p>DEMERS: --Part of the--the focus could be coercive. So, if you have family back in China that you feel like is at risk or--or are planning on going back to China and want to make sure you have a job, then you're going to be more willing to help the Chinse government. </p><p>But the--what we always say on the--to the businesses we talk to, obviously to the--the agents we work with, and to the schools, you need to focus on behaviors. Ethnicity is not a risk factor. Don't focus on ethnicity. </p><p>Then the upside of focusing on behavior as well as being of course, consistent with, you know, the values that we hold dear is that you're going to catch people who are misbehaving regardless of their motivation. </p><p>So, you're going to find that person who's trying to take intellectual property of your company, and is stealing it, and wants to send it to the Chinese. But you're also going to find the guy who is just unhappy with the company and looking to get revenge. </p><p>You're going to find the guy who wants to sell it to another U.S. competitor or who wants to go out on his own and set up a competing enterprise. </p><p>So, it's really to your benefit not to focus on--on this security risk as a Chinese intellectual property theft risk, but as an intellectual property risk. And then, you'll find people, you know, as I said, regardless of motivations. </p><p>But where we are very sensitive to this, we like to talk about it in terms of what the Chinese Communist Party is doing, what the PRC government is doing because it really is a concerted top-down authoritarian plan here. It's not about, you know,  people of a certain ethnicity, you know, doing this kind of activity on their own. </p><p>LEWIS: So, related question that I got from a couple of people is a concern that screening Chinese students or Chinese researchers when they leave the U.S.--screening them at the airport is going to become a new norm. Is that a realistic concern? Is that what, you know, what's the attitude on that? </p><p>DEMERS: I think, you know, what we're trying to do is really write with a fine pointed pencil as opposed to a big magic marker. </p><p>So, if you're, you know, that means, you know, folks may get screened on the way out. But that's not going to be everybody. That's going to--may depend on what institution they're coming from in China if we have reason to believe that that institution's been involved in intellectual property theft in the past, what fields they were studying in here. </p><p>A guy who's a younger graduate studying Mesopotamian architecture is probably not going to get screened at the airport. But-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Oh-- </p><p>DEMERS: --The-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Go ahead, you know. </p><p>DEMERS: But someone who's here as a visiting researcher who's a professor in, you know, in an advanced field and comes from a university that's been affiliated with the PLA, and, you know, who we know folks have come and gone from there in the past, they may get screened. </p><p>So, you know, I think, you know, there has been some--for sure some significant screening at the airports as people leave. But it--it's not, you know, it--it's more targeted than it may first appear. </p><p>LEWIS: Someone asked if you see a connection--a strategic connection--between the soft power and cultural propaganda activities in the U.S. that we talked about with TikTok and WeChat. And the data theft--the data I.P theft--the acquisition of stolen I.P. Is there a connection between these two that you see? Is it--or are they two separate programs run by the Chinese? That's a hard one. </p><p>DEMERS: At first blush, I would say that they are separate. Certainly, you can use the data as I said, to create targeting practice for individuals who you might want to--to influence. But for the most part, I would say that these are two separate efforts, but some overlap on the part of the government. But I'd have to think about that a bit more. </p><p>LEWIS: Okay. We're getting a ton of questions, so we'll try and get through as many as we can. I appreciate it. </p><p>DEMERS: Yeah. </p><p>LEWIS: They're really good too. We got one. Someone was actually listening to what you said and they noted that you said, \"China's behavior during the coronavirus has actually helped move some folks into our camp--\" </p><p>DEMERS: --Yeah-- </p><p>LEWIS: \"--Especially in Europe.\" Could you talk about specific behaviors that prompted this move? </p><p>DEMERS: Yeah. I think the somewhat ham-handed attempts, for instance, to dole out assistance--personal protective gear, et cetera, while requiring countries to thank them publicly for the great assistance they receive-- </p><p>(LAUGHER) </p><p>From the wonderful country of China. Now you can do this subtly. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But when you do it really obviously-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Yeah-- </p><p>DEMERS: --It comes off the wrong way, right? </p><p>And it looks like you're conditioning humanitarian assistance on deep expressions of gratitude. And I think folks don't appreciate that and they see through your ostensibly charitable intentions. </p><p>So, that is a--a piece of it. I do think that there's been, you know, continued questions about not necessarily the--although it's still open questions for the origins of the virus, but, you know, did--how did the Chinese government respond initially in terms of their suppression of knowledge about the virus and even their--their retaliatory acts they took against or the pressure they put on countries that were starting to for instance, restrict flights to certain parts of China. </p><p>That was very offensive to the Chinese government when those things were happening. In hindsight, you might say, \"Gosh, I wish we had all done that sooner.\" But while it was happening, the Chinese government reacted to those actions by certain European countries like it was a--a--a--an--a--an offensive to them and pushed them--including through, you know, economic means--to reverse their decisions. </p><p>So, all of those things I think sort of illustrated to individuals and coming on top of what you mentioned, Jim, which was the backdrop of the Hong Kong and the Uyghurs that, you know, maybe this isn't a country that we share the same values with. </p><p>LEWIS: So, one of the questions--this is actually a question I was going to ask too. They said, \"How do you differentiate what the Chinese are doing both in trade craft and in objectives from what other countries do when they spy on us?\" </p><p>And I was going to ask specifically about Russia, how we would compare Russia-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Yeah-- </p><p>LEWIS: --To China. Questions from the floor are raised about other countries who I shall not name. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But how does Chinese--how does Chinese espionage compare? </p><p>DEMERS: Yeah. So, if you look at--let's start with economic espionage-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Yeah-- </p><p>DEMERS: --If you look at that--because that's where we've been focused today-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Yeah-- </p><p>DEMERS: --We definitely see Russians attempts to steal military technology and export control technology. We don't see the same effort to steal commercial technology for the purpose of developing Russian competitors to American companies or to European companies. </p><p>So, the breadth of that Made in China 2025 plan inclusion on that plan of technologies that run the gamut from agriculture to, you know, engines that could be used in fighter planes is not something that we see not just in Russia, but honestly we don't see it in any other country. </p><p>LEWIS: Instead of-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Although we do see and we've charged a number of cases that involve-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Right-- </p><p>DEMERS: --As from Russia, they're--they tend to be more focused on the--the military controlled technology aspects of it. </p><p>LEWIS: Maybe a related question is people ask--and it's reasonable--as the--the U.S. and China go into a more tense relationship, as we move down the path of decoupling, have you seen a more urgent set of Chinese efforts or expanded Chinese efforts? Has--has decoupling effected the--the level of Chinese espionage? </p><p>DEMERS: I don't think it's affected the espionage that I've seen so far. I think that, you know, clearly the talk on both sides--including on the Chinese side--is stronger, you know, including out of, you know, folks who tend to use diplomatic ways of speaking. </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah. </p><p>DEMERS: So, there's been an increase in--in rhetoric. But I don't see an increase in economic right now as a result of this, you know. </p><p>We have seen this espionage for many, many years. I think it has gotten more persistent, more sophisticated and more well-resourced over time, but that's kind of a longer time trend. </p><p>And a lot of these programs take quite some time to develop. And programs like the undisclosed PLA individuals are things that we're trying to undo now. But they've actually, you know, been going for quite some time. </p><p>LEWIS: Someone asked related to that is most of the--and you said this in your remarks. Most apps collect this kind of data. So-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Yeah-- </p><p>LEWIS: --What's to stop the Chinese from simply turning around and purchasing it or hacking it and stealing it? What? And this is--this is on some ways a privacy question is that-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Okay-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Do the relative porousness of our privacy rules give China other avenues even if you show off their apps? </p><p>DEMERS: Yeah. Look, probably the biggest avenue that that gives them is purchasing both data on the open market. There are data of (INAUDIBLE), you know, who will sell--who will collect data and then sell it either for commercial purposes or they're happy enough to sell it to--to nation states as well. </p><p>The--so, what's to stop them from like stealing, you know, some other, you know, U.S. apps--data? I mean, not, you know, that country's information security protocol. And it's just another avenue. </p><p>So, if we're talking about purchases of data, some of which when it comes to a purchase of the companies we can regulate through the investment review process. We are trying to combat the theft of data--and that's in our cyber intrusion cases--and, you know, our work with the private sector. </p><p>And then, the app is just sort of a third way to get data from--from users and--and who are voluntarily providing the data whether it's knowingly or unknowingly. </p><p>LEWIS: So, we did get one question that started off by saying, \"WeChat is so critical to business and social life in China. I have WeChat. I have WeChat on my China phone. It's currently in a drawer with the battery out, but that's a different story. </p><p>Is the EO designed to really speed decoupling to going beyond simply WeChat and TikTok? Is it--is it a measure to really decouple the U.S. and China?\" </p><p>DEMERS: Well, I--I certainly didn't read it that way or think of it that way. The, you know, and look, there's a lot to be left now with the Commerce Department to work on their--the--the regulations and how this is actually going to work. </p><p>So, I think there's a lot that needs to be worked out there. But I didn't see it as a greater effort to--to--to decouple or to accommodate. </p><p>LEWIS: Related to that, someone asked, \"What sort of things do you think the Commerce Department will ban or could ban for TikTok under the EO?\" </p><p>And one of the things I've been saying is IEPA gives the president a lot of authorities. There is perhaps some First Amendment issues, but where do you see the--how do you see the ban playing out? What do you think Commerce should do when they--when they implement this? </p><p>DEMERS: They shouldn't ban people embarrassing themselves on WeChat. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>No, that would raise serious First Amendment concerns, so. </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah. </p><p>DEMERS: Now-- </p><p>LEWIS: --No, sorry. That's permitted. </p><p>DEMERS: Exactly. You can always make a fool out of yourself. </p><p>LEWIS: That's right. </p><p>DEMERS: I think that look, I don't want to get ahead of where Commerce is with this. This is going to be-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Yeah-- </p><p>DEMERS: --A pretty quick process. We'll know the answers in September, but I--I don't want to get ahead of that process. </p><p>LEWIS: Okay. Someone came--that makes sense. Someone asked, \"Can you give an example of TikTok collecting data for analytical purposes?\" </p><p>Does--in--in the--the--I shouldn't be asking this one. I should've read it before I asked it. They said, \"Is this what you think TikTok can do or do you have evidence that it's being done?\" </p><p>I can answer that one for you if you want, but you should take it. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>DEMERS: Look, it's certainly what TikTok can do. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>It's not TikTok itself that we're worried about obviously. It's the Chinese government's access to the TikTok data under their National Security laws that we worry about. </p><p>And, you know, beyond that to what we know, then I--I just--I'm not going to get into that piece of it. </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah. Someone asked, \"Given the scope of the problem, how much additional hiring has the U.S. achieved?\" </p><p>I know when I go up to the Hill I always say more FBI agents in California. But are we expanding our efforts or are we expanding our personnel? What are we doing? </p><p>DEMERS: You know, I think we have. I mean, I--I can speak for the department. At Main Justice, we have certainly increased the number of prosecutors who work generally on that counterintelligence side of the house. </p><p>So, for many, many years, we have, you know, ramped up the counterterrorism prosecution side and had-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Yeah-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Less growth on the nation's state--countering nations' state right side. Over the last few years, as the terrorism threat, you know, let's all knock on wood that it sticks--has receded somewhat and the nation's state threat has amped up. Those are the two big differences. By the way, Jim, you know, when I was here from 2006-2009 when NST got started-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Sure-- </p><p>DEMERS: --It was a counterterrorism-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Yeah-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Organization. And coming back to it nine years later-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Yeah-- </p><p>DEMERS: --You know, seeing how much I've grown on the National Security side, the cyber work. So, we have definitely increased resources on that side. In the U.S. Attorney's offices, I think it's been more about a redeployment of resources than an increase in resources. </p><p>The Bureau has increased resources on the nation's state side. So, there has been an increase. Obviously, you know, Director Wray gave some pretty startling numbers about the number of Chinese investigative--counterintelligence investigations that are opening up each day. </p><p>So, there's--there has been an increase in resourcing this problem generally. </p><p>LEWIS: We have a few more questions. And so, if we can slide a little bit over on the time, I think we can hit-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Yeah-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Almost all of them. I'll stop taking questions now. But one of them is, \"With the focus on Chinese,\" this is a good one, \"focus on Chinese students and academics, do you see the Chinese coopting people from other countries--country--foreign students in academics of other nationalities who might be under less scrutiny?\" Classic intelligence technique. </p><p>DEMERS: Yeah, it is. But it's also a lot harder to pull off-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Yeah-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Because if that foreign student isn't looking to get a job in China, and doesn't have a family in China, and has no ties to China, it's just that much less likely that they're going to be willing to be coopted. </p><p>It doesn't mean that they won't, you know, that it can't happen. People obviously susceptible to all sorts of inducements, right? </p><p>Usually financial. But it's that much harder. And look, we know, you know, a lot of what we're doing here every step of the way, you know, these are not silver bullets to end the problem. But we're trying to make the job a lot harder, right? So, when we extradited-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Sure-- </p><p>DEMERS: --That Intelligence officer from China, what was the significance of that? Obviously, we disrupted that one instance of intellectual property pathway. But the broader significance was that Europe was a place that Chinese Intelligence officers liked to meet Americans because they both felt safe there, right? </p><p>LEWIS: Right. </p><p>DEMERS: Chinese Intelligence officers don't want to come here. A lot of Americans who are being coopeted especially at the beginning felt nervous going to China. But you can meet in Europe. If the Chinese Intelligence officers don't feel safe doing that kind of activity in Europe following that extradition from Belgium, that's a broader disruption than that. Now that doesn't mean they can't do it, but it just makes their job that much harder. </p><p>LEWIS: So, we had a couple of questions on the Thousand Talents' Program. One of them is, \"To how--what extent do you see the people recruited by the program? Is this according to the Chinese military or are the cases mainly commercial?\" </p><p>DEMERS: Mainly it's been commercial, but I'd have to--I haven't sort of gone through the cases. But that's sort of at first blush, that's my impression has been mainly commercial. It's easier to do on the commercial side, but, you know, there's obviously a lot more controls on the military, technology and information. </p><p>But I wouldn't exclude it from the risks. But as I think about it, most of our cases have been on the commercial side. </p><p>LEWIS: What about other countries--particularly small countries that might have a strong high-tech industry in D.C. and not a Chinese (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>I have a funny story to tell you about the Middle East after the call. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>LEWIS: But what do you see on--what do you see outside the U.S. when it comes to Thousand Talents? Are we the primary target? Are they going after other high-tech sectors? What are the Chinese up to? </p><p>DEMERS: They're, no. Well, we're probably the primary target because that's where the bulk of that high-end technology is that they're interested in. But certainly, Europe is also a--a target. </p><p>And, you know, again, you--you---you step back and you look at that Made in China 2025 plan. If you go through those areas of technology, you know, you could figure out which countries have either companies, or professors, or institutions that are at the cutting edge of all of these different technologies. And there's definitely going to be, you know, a--a--any number of Europeans and European countries that fit into that--Japan, South Korea, etc. </p><p>So, it's not exclusive to the U.S. It is a means of developing China in part by taking technology from outside China. </p><p>LEWIS: So, we're--we're almost done. We just have a couple more questions if you'll bear with me. </p><p>I'll give you a break. Someone asked, \"Is there any evidence of data surveillance being used to suppress ethnic and religious minorities such as the Uyghurs?\" Yes. </p><p>Okay. The next question is-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You've got to be kidding me. This one's a little outside your bailiwick, but it touches on things that you--you pay attention to. \"How do you think the administration is thinking about balancing the needs of the semiconductor industry that continue to sell commodity items to China with the need to close off maybe the high end?\" </p><p>And so, when you think about Intel, Qualcomm, Micron, and the other guys, how can we--how can we find a balance in permitting safe sales to go? </p><p>I will say I was talking to someone from DOD who said there are no safe sales to China. A little extreme, but where do you think we're going to go with balancing controls and continued sales? </p><p>DEMERS: I mean, on that topic, I can say that that is a topic of discussion, you know, in the interagency. And I think, you know, I--I don't want to say-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Yeah-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Where I think they are headed in the future. I think, you know, it has been an issue that we have considered while we've had these policy discussions. And, you know, when I talk about sort of write--writing with a fine pencil, those are the kinds of distinctions I think that we could make and--but, you know. There are a lot of players in this. </p><p>LEWIS: So, two quick questions at the end. One is, \"Can we expect more indictments for Chinese hacking this year?\" That's a yes or no question. Now you can go a little further if you-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Yes-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Want. Okay. </p><p>DEMERS: Yes. </p><p>LEWIS: Good. So, yes. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Any predictions on when? No. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>DEMERS: If I say it, it wouldn't be a prediction. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah, that's right. That's right. So--so, what are the--and this will be the final question. What are the next steps you think for the Chinese initiatives? What? Where do you think? How's the momentum going? How's this expansion going? What are the things you're going to target on? Will they be additional things? What are the next steps for the China counterespionage initiatives? </p><p>DEMERS: I think look, this has been an initiative that sort of as I said, it was born kind of organically and it's developed organically from what we've seen in the cases and as we talked about, the academic side of things. I think we're going to continue to work with the universities. I think our work has been somewhat interrupted by coronavirus and our inability to do the same level of outreach and thinking we were in, you know, in--in the spring--as recently as the spring. </p><p>I think, but we're going to, you know. What I've appreciated is I think we've all--and this event proves that Jim is--we're starting to shift from the, \"Well, let's delay that and, you know, see if we can do it in person later\" to the \"Let's just do it.\" </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah. </p><p>DEMERS: \"And do it perfectly now.\" </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah. </p><p>DEMERS: Right? </p><p>LEWIS: I know. </p><p>DEMERS: And as we do that, our activity has sort of ramped up. And I appreciate getting back into that both on the private sector side, but especially on the academic side. </p><p>I, you know, I think, you know, that--that we continue with the cyber investigations and we continue on the traditional espionage side. I don't see any big new initiatives. But that's not really the way this has grown. It's just kind of-- </p><p>LEWIS: --Yeah-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Follow our investigative leads and--and let those leads take us to wherever we end up. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>LEWIS: And that's kept you kind of busy. </p><p>DEMERS: Yeah. </p><p>LEWIS: It's-- </p><p>DEMERS: --The ground is fertile, Jim. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>LEWIS: Any final thoughts or words you'd like to leave the audience with? </p><p>My request is help me figure out how to persuade people that this is a major--perhaps the major national security problem for the U.S. What are your final thoughts on this? </p><p>DEMERS: Well, my final thought on that is think about the many, many, Jim, bipartisan issues that we are taking on at this time in the United States. You'll come up with a very short list, but China will be at the top of it. </p><p>So, that's how serious this issue is. That's, you know, how much the facts underpin, you know, everything I think that--that we've been saying and looking at. </p><p>And it's not that over time folks can't take different approaches to the problem. But I think there's a real appreciation that the problem is real and it needs to be addressed. And there is more, you know, just from my perspective, more sort of coalescing in the interagency process around this issue that I've seen. </p><p>And then, I saw the first time I was in government, you know, on--on--on--on these sets of issues, so. But I--look, thank you for all the attention that you're paying and thanks for putting on this event. It's always great to talk about these issues and, you know, I really appreciate you doing this despite all the--the technical issues that go along with this. </p><p>LEWIS: No, it's one of my favorite issues and I really appreciate you coming on. This has been very helpful. </p><p>I would--at this point, I would normally say please thank John Demers--John Demers-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--And wait for applause. But-- </p><p>DEMERS: --Right-- </p><p>LEWIS: --You'll just have to--you'll have to take my word for it that people are applauding. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Thank you for doing this. </p><p>DEMERS: Okay. Thanks a lot. </p><p>LEWIS: Okay, John. Thanks. </p><p>DEMERS: Appreciate it. </p><p>LEWIS: Yeah, talk to you later. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KD-T2J1-JDPT-T01H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Now, central banks are expressing concern as well.  Multiple reports over the past few weeks suggest that the central bankers are beginning to step into the fray on the issue, and are considering ways that the financial system could better protect itself from data breaches like the one that occurred at Capital One Financial (NYSE: COF[3]) earlier this year. In a speech on Nov. </p><p>21, Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester reportedly said that banks and other financial firms should be stress-tested on their cybersecurity preparedness, according to Reuters[4]. She also recommended that banks, regulators, and other government agencies be more open and transparent with each other with information regarding cybersecurity issues. \"Such a test could help evaluate the financial system's plans for data and core systems recovery and its reliance on third parties to implement that plan,\" she said. The country's largest banks are already stress-tested annually on their capital requirements as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. That same day, the Wall Street Journal reported[5] that Richard Ashton, deputy general counsel for litigation, enforcement and system matters at the Federal Reserve, said at a conference that the Fed is considering increasing its supervision of technology firms that serve the banking industry. 'How far the authority goes to conduct examinations, I think, is something we are closely looking at,' he said, according to The Journal. 'Is it something that we can look at the governance structure at these third-party providers? Can we look at their overall compliance management program?' Ashton specifically singled out cloud providers as an area where more oversight may be needed. As is the case with just about every major industry in the world, the U.S. banking industry (central banks included[6]) has become increasingly reliant on third-party vendors like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN[7]) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT[8]) for their cloud storage\u2014though some have recently made moves[9] to move onto their own cloud. Other central banks around the world have made recent comments on the issue as well. Filipe Denis, chief operating officer of The Bank Of Canada, said last month[10] the central bank needs to update its cybersecurity regulations. Elsewhere, Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, asked its financial institutions[11] to implement stronger cybersecurity measures in the wake of a recent ATM hacking exposed flaws in the system.  These comments all come in the wake of an incident at the European Central Bank in August [12]in which the ECB had to shut down one of its websites after it was infected with malware. 'The time to define and share best practices is not after a data breach,' said Darren Conte, founder and CEO of Siftsort.com, a secure document sharing and messaging platform. Conte is a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS[13]) executive who was the point person for crisis management and business continuity after the September 11 terrorist attacks. In that time, he saw many institutions scrambling to put better contingencies in place. 'It was a wake-up call that forced Wall Street to come together to share tactics and be better prepared,' he said. 'With today's ever-changing technology landscape, it would seem appropriate for the Fed to reach out to the industry's stakeholders to conduct cybersecurity stress tests and share best practices and standards so that everyone can do their part to protect the financial infrastructure we rely on.' 0   2019 Benzinga.com.

He presented four cases and an article during the session, including the case of an insurance company, a Big Tech company, a toy manufacturer and a GCC-based family owned conglomerate. These cases presented real life situations for independent directors and invoked interesting discussion among the participants about how they would respond. Another topic discussed was directors' diversity and business expertise. The key lessons learned from these case studies are mentioned below:</p><p>Independence is essentially a state of mind, but the importance of structures and incentives cannot be ignored. If an independent director is paid in equity then his independence can be compromised.</p><p>If a person is an independent director on the parent company's Board he may be nominated as independent director for its subsidiary's Board, but not its associates. Nevertheless, it is not a clear-cut situation.</p><p>When a CEO nominates his father's best friend as Chairman of the company or his own best friend, he may not be breaching any law or regulation but the nominees may not be considered as truly independent.</p><p>Regulators may need to place a ceiling on the number of years a person can remain as an independent Board member of a company. To be more effective companies may use a search firm to look for independent directors.</p><p>Independent directors should not be afraid of asking tough questions especially when there is a whiff of self-dealing or when the CEO's or CFO's actions raise questions about their duty of loyalty.</p><p>It is important to design the CEO's performance incentives (Key Performance Indicators) correctly and carefully in order to elicit the kind of behavior that the Board wants to encourage. People do what you pay them to do.</p><p>To be effective on a Board the independent director needs to build rapport and form alliances with other Board members (remember Warren Buffet's quote - 'Boards are 50% business enterprises and 50% social clubs').</p><p>The job of an independent director becomes more difficult if other directors are conflicted or do not fully appreciate what is going on (due to lack of understanding of the business).</p><p>The independent director should reassess whether he/she wants to remain in the Board in certain situations, e.g. overly defensive CEO while the other Board members are overly protective or accept management viewpoint unquestioningly.</p><p>10. An independent director must be clear in his mind about his reasons to join a Board, what he is willing to do and what he is not willing to do.</p><p>11. Regulators may consider taking a more proactive role to increase the effectiveness of independent directors.</p><p>12. Diversity of opinions, backgrounds and perspectives on a Board is a very welcome thing and should always be encouraged.</p><p>13. Board members must remember their duties of candor, care and loyalty - always make full disclosures, always be informed, always put the company's interest first.</p><p>14. When a company becomes insolvent or approaches the \"zone of insolvency\" the directors need to prioritize the creditors' interests ahead of the shareholders'.</p><p>15. Boards can rely on the management for facts, but they are entitled to question the management's judgment.</p><p>The Waqf Fund, which hosted the workshop, has been serving the Islamic finance industry in Bahrain since 2006. It offers several programs targeted to Islamic finance practitioners, Shari'ah resources and other stakeholders. The Waqf Fund has 22 member institutions including the Central Bank of Bahrain.</p><p>Source: Central Bank of Bahrain</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IFINNW-0040192247</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IFINNW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S8R-3D61-JB5M-W38B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365424</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"648\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Islamic Finance News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Islamic Finance News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 8, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00024WS</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANK OF BAHRAIN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000404</classCode><className>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDQ3M0RFODczN0I4NDg2RjlFRDNFMUNBODRDQTU0Q0E7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTJGRkVBNjc4MzI3NDA5MTlEMDI1NjU2NzMyNkYzNTc</classCode><className>Corporate Governance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000194</classCode><className>BOARDS OF DIRECTORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CMR7</classCode><className>PARENT COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000A1SO</classCode><className>BUSINESS EDUCATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009SR8</classCode><className>FAMILY COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009S59</classCode><className>CASE STUDIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>PE0009VLS</classCode><className>WARREN BUFFETT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

He presented four cases and an article during the session, including the case of an insurance company, a Big Tech company, a toy manufacturer and a GCC-based family owned conglomerate. These cases presented real life situations for independent directors and invoked interesting discussion among the participants about how they would respond. Another topic discussed was directors\u2019 diversity and business expertise. The key lessons learned from these case studies are mentioned below:  <br/>    Independence is essentially a state of mind, but the importance of structures and incentives cannot be ignored. If an independent director is paid in equity then his independence can be compromised.<br/>     If a person is an independent director on the parent company\u2019s Board he may be nominated as independent director for its subsidiary\u2019s Board, but not its associates. Nevertheless, it is not a clear-cut situation.<br/>     When a CEO nominates his father\u2019s best friend as Chairman of the company or his own best friend, he may not be breaching any law or regulation but the nominees may not be considered as truly independent.<br/>     Regulators may need to place a ceiling on the number of years a person can remain as an independent Board member of a company. To be more effective companies may use a search firm to look for independent directors.<br/>     Independent directors should not be afraid of asking tough questions especially when there is a whiff of self-dealing or when the CEO\u2019s or CFO\u2019s actions raise questions about their duty of loyalty.<br/>     It is important to design the CEO\u2019s performance incentives (Key Performance Indicators) correctly and carefully in order to elicit the kind of behavior that the Board wants to encourage. People do what you pay them to do.<br/>     To be effective on a Board the independent director needs to build rapport and form alliances with other Board members (remember Warren Buffet\u2019s quote \u2013 \u2018Boards are 50% business enterprises and 50% social clubs\u2019).<br/>     The job of an independent director becomes more difficult if other directors are conflicted or do not fully appreciate what is going on (due to lack of understanding of the business).<br/>     The independent director should reassess whether he/she wants to remain in the Board in certain situations, e.g. overly defensive CEO while the other Board members are overly protective or accept management viewpoint unquestioningly.  <br/>10.  An independent director must be clear in his mind about his reasons to join a Board, what he is willing to do and what he is not willing to do.  <br/>11.  Regulators may consider taking a more proactive role to increase the effectiveness of independent directors.      <br/>12.  Diversity of opinions, backgrounds and perspectives on a Board is a very welcome thing and should always be encouraged.  <br/>13.  Board members must remember their duties of candor, care and loyalty \u2013 always make full disclosures, always be informed, always put the company\u2019s interest first.  <br/>14.  When a company becomes insolvent or approaches the \u201czone of insolvency\u201d the directors need to prioritize the creditors\u2019 interests ahead of the shareholders\u2019.  <br/>15.  Boards can rely on the management for facts, but they are entitled to question the management\u2019s judgment.  <br/>The Waqf Fund, which hosted the workshop, has been serving the Islamic finance industry in Bahrain since 2006. It offers several programs targeted to Islamic finance practitioners, Shari\u2019ah resources and other stakeholders. The Waqf Fund has 22 member institutions including the Central Bank of Bahrain.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN797816320180508</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S8R-B8R1-J9XT-P1CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"667\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 8, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Monetary policy carried out by the priestly caste of centr...</p><p>15 mins. to read       Javen / Shutterstock.com    Central banks all over the world are using monetary economics to bail out governments whose finances have been wrecked by the coronavirus pandemic of 2020. Monetary policy carried out by the priestly caste of central bankers, who are unelected, has become a means of facilitating fiscal policy, as determined by the politicians. This extraordinary change in the economic landscape is sure to have important implications for investors over the medium to long term, writes Victor Hill.   QE: From adolescence to adulthood   The economist Liam Halligan recently wrote that quantitative easing (QE) started out as an emergency measure in the financial crisis of 2008-09 but has since become a lifestyle choice for central banks. QE was first initiated in order to inject liquidity into the banking sector which was teetering on the brink in the fallout from the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. It worked, and banks managed to reduce their balance sheets, resulting in a huge contraction in the money supply in most advanced economies which was only partially offset by the massive creation of new money by the central banks. The banking system was saved.    But thereafter, QE was mobilised at every critical moment of economic uncertainty \u2013 the European Sovereign Debt Crisis, the Greek bailout, and now the Covid-19 pandemic. Famously, Signor Draghi said in the autumn of 2012 that the ECB would do whatever it takes to forestall financial crisis \u2013 much to the dismay of the German establishment which regards QE with extreme suspicion. Since then, QE has bolstered asset prices (nice for the rich) and suppressed bond yields. The latter outcome has had the effect of tempting governments to borrow even more aggressively (because debt is so cheap) and thus drive up their debt-to-GDP ratios even further.    The balance sheets of the Federal Reserve, The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan have all swollen during the pandemic by approximately one third. Everybody\u2019s doing it \u2013 even the Sveriges Riksbank (the Bank of Sweden).    By the end of this fiscal year the UK government will have sold about \u00a3400 billion of new gilts in order to raise fresh funds and to roll over outstanding debt. It is quite possible that the bond markets will eventually demand a premium return given the avalanche of new paper \u2013 and yet for now much of the UK\u2019s sovereign debt (out to seven years\u2019 maturity) is trading with negative yields. The two-year gilt was trading in late July at a yield of minus 0.13 percent.    This increased borrowing results from the financial black hole opened up by the coronavirus pandemic. This results from the cost of the Job Retention Scheme (popularly known as the furlough scheme) and numerous bailouts from the arts to the charity sector on the one hand, and the severely reduced tax-take on the other. It seems that about one half of these newly issued gilts will be purchased by the Bank of England . The economist Roger Bootle reckons that the UK\u2019s money supply has already increased by 35 percent in the first half of 2020.    Another reason for the huge rise in public expenditure in the UK is that the Johnson government is wedded to a massive programme of infrastructure investment summarised by the Prime Minister\u2019s slogan build, build, build . Mr Johnson has talked in the past about bridges between Scotland and Northern Ireland and between England and France though whether these will materialise in the current financial climate is doubtful. I discussed the parlous state of UK public finances in a recent post on the MI website .   The price of QE   QE may get governments out of holes, short-term, but it does nothing to improve productivity or innovation. On the contrary, it creates the conditions where highly indebted zombie companies , which contribute little or less to the economy, are sustained indefinitely. More significantly, there are zombie states \u2013 Italy is one of them \u2013 which have proven to be incapable of reducing their debt-to-GDP ratios despite near-zero interest rates. There is a growing body of economic evidence \u2013 though it is not conclusive \u2013 that highly indebted countries grow more slowly than lowly indebted ones. Italy has had a growth problem since the inception of the single currency in 2002.    Also, excessive valuations have become normalised. That has had paradoxical implications. On the one hand, adventurous investors have bid up the prices of high-profile stocks; on the other hand, many traditional equity investors have withdrawn from the equity markets entirely in the expectation of an eventual correction. The latter cohort have also been discouraged by de-equitisation \u2013 the phenomenon that the menu of available stocks has become much smaller in most developed markets over the first two decades of this century.    By forcing interest rates down QE also penalises savers who, in the Keynesian model at least, finance investment. This has hit retired folk particularly badly. Provident, hard-working people who saved up a nest-egg for their retirement now receive negligible income from their savings. This has often forced them to seek higher returns in dubious investment schemes \u2013 and even scams. It is not an exaggeration to say that QE has mugged elderly savers.   Inflation ahoy!   One of the great unsolved economic puzzles of our age is that central banks have desperately tried to inject some inflation into the system by printing money but have generally failed \u2013 probably because the newly printed money has gone to bolster asset prices.    True, they have succeeded in avoiding deflation, which looked possible after the financial crisis as banks deleveraged rapidly. Deflation is considered a nightmare scenario by many economists as it ensnares both corporates and governments in a debt trap. Where deflation takes hold \u2013 for example in the USA at the end of the 19 th century \u2013 there can be huge social and political disorder. In contrast, governments benefit from inflation over time to the extent that inflation reduces the value of their debt. On the other hand, higher inflation entails higher interest rates which, in turn, makes servicing the debt more costly. Higher inflation also aggravates government spending costs, for example by pushing up the wages of public sector workers.    Other reasons for the failure of central banks to trigger inflation are long-term secular trends: in particular, that of an ageing population and the glut of savings pushing down on equilibrium interest rates. Furthermore, under the Basel III bank capital adequacy regulations that were introduced after the financial crisis, banks are required to maintain substantial liquidity buffers which are mostly composed of sovereign debt (i.e. government bonds). This again has pushed government bond yields down.    Many central banks, the Bank of England amongst them, have an inflation target of around two percent. If inflation exceeds that level, then the Governor is required to write to the Chancellor of the Exchequer (the UK Minister of Finance) to explain what measures will be taken to restrain it. No such letter has been sent since the financial crisis.   Why would the Fed buy Apple\u2019s bonds?   Under its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) the Federal Reserve is buying the individual bonds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) of about 800 investment-grade entities. High up on the list is one of the biggest corporations by market capitalisation of them all \u2013 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) which is currently worth around $1.5 trillion. But then why does Apple, which famously has a cash mountain of around $200 billion, need to issue bonds at all? Probably because much of that cash is held offshore by subsidiaries in places like the Republic of Ireland and if it were to be repatriated to the USA it would be subject to a levy of 35 percent.    Other eligible companies under the SMCCF include Volkswagen (ETR:VW), Ford (NYSE:F), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), BP (LON:BP), AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) .    Under the SMCCF the Fed will buy up to $750 billion of debt obligations. In so doing the Fed is likely to push down interest rates across the debt markets, making it cheaper for businesses to raise new finance by injecting additional liquidity. This scheme sits alongside others designed to lend to small and medium sized businesses.    The Bank of England includes Apple, EDF (EPA:EDF) and Siemens (ETR:SIE) as eligible bond issuers under its own equivalent scheme, the Covid Corporate Financing Facility . The Bank has stated that it wants to support all creditworthy businesses with UK activities \u2013 regardless of domestic or foreign ownership or industrial sector.   Bond cancellation and other tools   One proposal which has had central bankers scratching their heads is that central banks could be induced to buy government bonds with invented money \u2013 which is credited to the government\u2019s bank account \u2013 and that the government could simply cancel those bonds at the stroke of a pen (or the click of a mouse) . That would mean that the bond asset would disappear from the central bank\u2019s balance sheet and its capital account would be written down by the same amount. Hey presto! The government gets its cash without increasing the national debt. Most of us, however, would be left feeling uncomfortable by this kind of monetary magic. Isn\u2019t that kind of cheating? And if it is cheating that means that someone is going to lose out.    Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s Chief Economist, told the Daily Telegraph in May this year that the optics of bond cancellation \u201clook absolutely horrific\u201d. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think bankrupting your central bank and having to recapitalise it is a good look right now\u201d. This suggests that there would be resistance to bond cancellation by the current management \u2013 but that does not mean that this kind of monetary sleight of hand could be ruled out in the future. The Bank of England has reserves (capital) of over $100 billion.    Just two years ago in June 2018 the UK Treasury paid \u00a31.2 billion to the Bank of England to bolster its capital so that it could play a more active role in stimulating the economy. The then Governor, Mr Carney said a larger balance sheet would make it easier to start selling off the \u00a3435 billion of government bonds it had bought under numerous QE programmes since 2009 [i] .    Another tool available to central banks is yield curve control . The Bank of England may wish to follow the example of its Japanese counterpart and adopt this. That is to say, it could buy bonds at the far end of the borrowing curve in order to lower rates overall. It should be noted that this would have the effect of lowering annuity rates on which most people in the UK who have defined contribution pension schemes depend. Annuity rates have fallen dramatically since the financial crisis for people in their sixties and seventies such that many are retiring on smaller pensions than anticipated.    The gilts that the Bank of England has bought in the open market and which reside on the assets side of its balance sheet could, in turn, be sold off to third parties in exchange for cash. That would have the effect of reducing the money supply \u2013 in effect, it would be QE in reverse. That would drive up the yields on those bonds and so could prospectively increase the government\u2019s funding costs. But few commentators see that happening quite yet.   QE Case Study: Japan   The contemporary dependence on QE as an economic tool began in Japan. In the late 1980s Japan was booming with stock and property prices bid up to insane levels. Famously, the grounds of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo (about five hectares) were thought to be worth more than all the real estate in California. But after the boom came the bust and Japan spent virtually all of the lost decade of the 1990s in economic stasis with almost no growth at all.    In a bid to forestall imminent deflation interest rates were set to near-zero in 1999; and, in 2001, the Bank of Japan first conjured with the dark arts of modern monetary policy. There was some respite after 2006 but QE was resumed after 2008 and has been almost continuous ever since. The balance sheet of the Bank of Japan now stands at about 90 percent of the country\u2019s GDP and has grown more than any other. And yet there has been no inflationary outcome. Since 2000, Japan\u2019s average inflation rate has been 0.1 percent, despite the official inflation target of two percent.    Over the same period Japan has become one of the most indebted countries in the world. At the beginning of this year its debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 240 percent. Most analysts are not too spooked by that because most of that debt is held by domestic financial institutions. More surprisingly, the huge expansion in the country\u2019s money supply (it has quadrupled even since 2013) has had little effect on bank lending. And the government has still tried to contain the expanding fiscal deficit, even by hiking indirect taxes.    Part of Japan\u2019s tug towards deflation arises from demographics: the country has an ageing population which has actually begun to decline. A recent report by the University of Washington and published in The Lancet estimated that Japan\u2019s population is projected to fall from a peak of 128 million in 2017 to less than 53 million by 2100.    Japan may not necessarily be a role model \u2013 but nor does it stand as a warning of the dangers of excessive reliance on monetary economics.   QE in Emerging Markets   Until recently QE was an esoteric practice unique to the cosy club of the G-7\u2019s central bankers. But now we know that even some developing countries have jumped on the bandwagon.    During the week of 06 July, Bank Indonesia agreed to buy Indonesian Rupiah 574 trillion of government bonds in the primary market at below market interest rates, thus beginning the direct monetary financing of the Indonesian government\u2019s fiscal deficit. That equates to US$ 40 billion or 3.6% of the country\u2019s GDP. Indonesia\u2019s parliament suspended the legal limit on the government\u2019s fiscal deficit to three percent earlier this year.    Bank Indonesia\u2019s move takes QE in the emerging markets in a new direction. Faced with this year\u2019s Covid-19 pandemic many emerging market central banks have started to use QE to stimulate their economies. Hitherto, they had been highly circumspect. With only shallow pools of domestic institutional savings, most developing countries have been concerned to reassure the foreign investors who have traditionally funded much of their governments\u2019 fiscal deficits.    The Philippines\u2019 and South Africa\u2019s central banks have previously characterised their secondary market purchases of government papers as a strategy to smoothen short-term market volatility, rather than to fund government borrowing. In Brazil, the central bank president has resisted using his new powers to undertake QE so long as local interest rates remain above zero. And in India, Narendra Modi\u2019s government has favoured the use of loan guarantees and other liquidity support measures over any recourse to QE.    Thus far, Bank Indonesia\u2019s initiative with has not incited any negative market reaction. The yield on the 10-year local currency government bond fell by ten basis point, while the rupiah remained stable. In part this reflects relief that Indonesia\u2019s proposed plan is relatively modest. Although Jakarta\u2019s 2020 fiscal deficit is now projected to hit 6.3% of GDP, up from earlier estimates of 1.8%, it will be considerably smaller than the double-digit deficits expected in Brazil and India.    Over recent years Indonesia\u2019s monetary aggregates have been growing in line with nominal GDP, analysts suggest; so extra fiscal spending is unlikely to create any additional demand pressure. Therefore, there is little immediate risk that Jakarta\u2019s fiscal expansion will unleash inflation.    However, the potential impact on Indonesia\u2019s external position is a cause of concern. With only a thin base of domestic savings, Indonesia has long been dependent on foreign capital to finance government spending. This foreign funding is sensitive to external liquidity conditions. All emerging market economies are at risk of financial shocks which trigger a flight to quality . In March, for example, the central bank of Turkey burned through about half of its foreign exchange reserves to prop up the Turkish Lira. Without a deep domestic institutional investor base, which has stabilising effect, any combination of rising yields and a weaker currency could precipitate forced selling by foreign investors who wish to reduce their risk exposures.    Overall, if more emerging markets embrace QE, that will not necessarily result in inflation, but will likely make those markets more volatile, not less. On the other hand, if emerging markets can print money to buy up local bonds, then solvency risk on domestic currency papers (both government and corporate) will fall \u2013 though inflation risk (and therefore currency risk) will rise.   Conclusion &amp; Action   We still don\u2019t know if, long-term, the universal adoption of aggressive monetary policy by central banks will result in a new wave of inflation. But the risk that that could occur is rising. Thus far the forces of deflation and inflation have been tightly balanced. Traditionally, the ultimate hedge against inflation has been gold. Thus, the stocks of gold miners and the price of bullion have done well of late. But the case for gold is even stronger than that. Investment guru Doug Casey thinks that the era of QE, with China vigorously promoting the renminbi, will inevitably end with the return to the gold standard . My own view is that it is likely to be a digital gold standard \u2013 i.e. a universal digital currency which becomes the benchmark for all commodities. I\u2019ll unpack that idea elsewhere.    In a sense, the escalation in the price of big tech stocks is also a symptom of rising inflation risk as investors favour large firms with strong cash flows that seem to be inflation-proof.    Economic policy globally is being set on the basis that interest rates will remain at near-zero levels indefinitely. That is not realistic \u2013 unless global deflation further to population decline kicks in earlier than expected, which is going to happen in Africa soon. MoneyWeek\u2019s Merryn Somerset Webb recently recommended for summer self-isolating reading The Shock of Population Decline . I\u2019ll have more to say on that soon.    Suffice to say that it reinforces the case for non-financial assets such as agricultural land (my personal preference) and precious metals \u2013 gold, and of increasing interest, silver. As I sign this article off (27 July) gold has reached a record high. Something significant is afoot.

President Donald Trump retreated from his quest to add a question about U.S. citizenship to the 2020 census on Thursday, instead asking government agencies to provide records that could determine a head-count of citizens without polling census-takers directly. The U.K. is raising the security level for British tankers in the Strait of Hormuz after Iranians tried to seize a British ship in the critical shipping route just hours earlier.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[05:30:36] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GOV.

Heavy rain coupled with high water along the Mississippi presenting a problem never seen before.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: The president is abandoning the fight for a citizenship question on the census. Instead, he's going with an executive order suggested to him a year ago. We'll explain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SANCHEZ: Plus, breaking overnight, new sex trafficking charges against R&amp;B star R. Kelly.</p><p>ROMANS: And how many calories would you have to cut per day to stay healthy? Not as many as you might think.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>SANCHEZ: And, I'm Boris Sanchez. We are 31 minutes past the hour.</p><p>And we start in the Gulf Coast. They are bracing for Barry. It's now a tropical storm but there are hurricane warnings along the Louisiana Coast.</p><p>The Weather Service says Barry presents a problem they've never seen before -- the combination of heavy rain from the storm itself, on top of extremely high water levels from record flooding already on the Mississippi River this year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDWARDS: Look, there are three ways Louisiana floods -- storm surge, high rivers, and rain, and we're going to have all three.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) ROMANS: The Mississippi already so high around New Orleans that heavy rain, plus a storm surge, could overwhelm its pumping system. The result would be a repeat of Wednesday's flash flood emergency.</p><p>The mayor of New Orleans not issuing evacuation orders, though, at this point.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR LATOYA CANTRELL, NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA: We are not issuing a voluntary or mandatory evacuation. Sheltering in place is our strategy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMAN: States of emergency have been declared in Orleans, St. Bernard, St. Charles, Jefferson, and Plaquemines Parish.</p><p>President Trump, yesterday, approved an emergency declaration for Louisiana to speed up federal help.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Tropical Storm Barry is moving very slowly, just about three miles an hour, and that pace is one reason the Weather Service has issued a rare \"high risk\" outlook for excessive rainfall along the Louisiana coast. The warning has only been used two other times since 2007 -- for hurricanes Florence and Harvey.</p><p>Let's check in with meteorologist Derek Van Dam. He is live in the Weather Center.</p><p>Now, Derek, we got an update on this storm a short while ago. What are we hearing?</p><p>DEREK VAN DAM, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Yes, well, here's that excessive high risk of flash flooding, from Baton Rouge to New Orleans, all the way to the southern coastline of Louisiana.</p><p>According to the 5:00 a.m. update from the National Hurricane Center, there has been no change to the strength of the storm. We still believe that this will make landfall late Friday night into early Saturday morning as a strong tropical storm or perhaps a low-end category one Atlantic hurricane equivalent.</p><p>We don't want to get lost in the minutia here, though, because we're not trying to point home the idea that this is a major wind problem. We believe that the rain and flood potential is the major overarching concern.</p><p>We have over five million Americans under a flash flood warning, including New Orleans and the Lake Charles area, as well as Baton Rouge, and that's because we have over 10 to 15 inches of rain in the forecast from Saturday to Sunday. On top of that, you factor in three to six feet of potential storm surge.</p><p>We already have a swollen Mississippi River. Its current level, 16 feet. Projected forecast crest at 19 feet by Saturday. Don't forget about the heavy rainfall in New Orleans and some of the levees protecting the city downriver along the Mississippi River actually are below that 20-foot threshold. So the potential here for flooding certainly exists.</p><p>Back to you guys.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, Derek, thanks for that. We know you'll stay on it for us.</p><p>President Trump apparently trying to pump up his base with some unprecedented action on two fronts -- one involving the census; the other immigration.</p><p>First, the census. The president will not defy a Supreme Court order to keep a citizenship question off the 2020 census.</p><p>Instead, he is taking executive action to get the information a different way. It's the idea census officials recommended to him a year ago. If adopted, it could have saved millions of dollars and an awful lot of time, not to mention gray hair at the Justice Department.</p><p>Jessica Schneider has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Christine and Boris, the president pulling back on his plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. After a week of insisting his administration would continue to fight in court to get it on the questionnaire, President Trump has now simply signed an executive order.</p><p>[05:35:02] DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I am hereby ordering every department and agency in the federal government to provide the Department of Commerce with all requested records regarding the number of citizens and non-citizens in our country.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: But the president, in backing down here, he's also hinting though at another possible political fight. He said that politicians may also soon use this citizenship data to try to draw voting districts in states by counting only voters as opposed to all residents. And, of course, that is a whole other issue that would draw a whole other set of court battles, so this might not actually be the end -- guys.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: All right, so you've not heard the last of this. Jessica, thank you for that.</p><p>Let's bring in \"Washington Post\" congressional reporter Karoun Demirjian. She's a CNN political analyst. Good morning.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Good morning.</p><p>KAROUN DEMIRJIAN, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST: Good morning.</p><p>ROMANS: You know, is this between the census -- you know, the president not going to defy the Supreme Court but he's going to go back and find a way to get this information. Between that and his announcement of raids in these -- in these states and cities, is this a play to his base?</p><p>You know, you've got the Mueller testimony next week, you've got some energy in the Democratic field at the moment. You know, he's had some recent setbacks.</p><p>Is this a play to his base, do you think?</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: Well, I think the president has been very conscious of where his base is on any issue related to immigration and he has never completely backed down from the fights even when he's lost the battles. And so, it's his way, basically, of threading that needle.</p><p>It's very hard to go up against the Supreme Court -- your Supreme Court, really. This is like a court that has many nominees that President Trump put there. So many justices that President Trump nominated to that bench.</p><p>And so, he is kind of stuck to try to come up with a different solution but the fact that he isn't completely letting it go communicates to his base that look, I still think this is important and I'm still going to be on this side of these issues, which are, of course, extremely divisive in the country but do seem to motivate the people who are Trump's faithful supporters.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Right. Karoun, I want to play for you some sound. These are officials in these 10 cities across the country where these ICE raids are going to take place on Sunday. Listen to what they're saying about them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR LORI LIGHTFOOT (D), CHICAGO, ILLINOIS: Just fearmongering and making immigrants scapegoats and really disrupting families who are just here trying to live their life. That's not who we are or should be.</p><p>MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ (R), MIAMI, FLORIDA: They haven't told us what the parameters are. They haven't asked us to support what they're doing or given us any information on the -- on who they're targeting and how they're targeting them. So, frankly, we're in the dark.</p><p>ART ACEVEDO, POLICE CHIEF, HOUSTON, TEXAS: There's great fear amongst our immigrant community as to what's going to happen. I've had children come up to me at forums (ph) saying what -- I'm afraid to go to school, I'm afraid to leave the house, I'm afraid to come home and find that my parents are gone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ: Now, I just want to point out they were originally 10 cities. New Orleans has been postponed because of Tropical Storm Barry, so no raids happening there.</p><p>There are two surprising things about this that you hear from these officials. First, the federal government hasn't really communicated much to them at all. But the fact that we know about this is surprising. These ICE raids typically aren't something that's publicized.</p><p>Karoun, how much is this just President Trump trying to send a message and make public that he is not backing down -- that he's forcing the issue of immigration front and center?</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: This goes, again, to the question of is this a political play to make to the people who -- you know, maybe your supporters are listening to you -- or is this a pragmatic sort of strategy that will actually effectively result in rounding up the maximum number of people.</p><p>And if it's the latter, it's not really following what would be considered to be the normal process of doing that --</p><p>ROMAN: Yes.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: -- which is that if you tell people when you're going to have -- conduct raids, there is an incentive for people to maybe not go to the place where you might raid that day if you know when it's going to happen.</p><p>And also, for years, there -- look, we've been talking about coordination between state-local level and federal government for a very long time. You can either have that debate based on the communities that have signed up to work with the federal government on these issues or communities that have been dubbed sanctuary cities because they say no.</p><p>But for a very long time, part of the entire process of doing these sorts of immigration internal policing domestically has really been reliant on there being a partnership or at least some sort of communication between the people who are on the ground and the federal officials who come in just for these more dramatic moments.</p><p>And that does not seem to exist, which means that it would suggest that it would be more haphazard and potentially less effective --</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: -- in its execution as a result.</p><p>SANCHEZ: And potentially, more dangerous, too.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: And potentially, more dangerous as well -- of course, especially when you have the resistance now, as you can see, from some of the local police --</p><p>ROMANS: Yes. DEMIRJIAN: -- police outfits who are responsible for maintaining the order.</p><p>ROMANS: We don't know who they're going to be targeting.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Right.</p><p>ROMANS: We don't know if they're targeting people who are violent criminals with deportation orders. We don't know if they're targeting workers. We don't know what this interior enforcement is actually going to look like, so that's another big uncertainty here.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: The president had his social media summit yesterday, which seemed to be a room packed with people who mostly agree with the president -- you know, things that they would -- that they craft or tweet or things that the president generally likes.</p><p>[05:40:00] And he said something that got a lot of attention at that -- at that summit. So remember, it's a friendly audience there in the room and this is what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I certainly don't want to stifle free speech, but that's no longer free speech. See, I don't think that the mainstream media is free speech either because it's so crooked, it's so dishonest.</p><p>So, to me, free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposely write bad. To me, that's very dangerous speech.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Now, the president seems to not think it's free speech when it's something he doesn't like to read -- something that is critical of him. This is the man sworn to defend the Constitution and the right to free speech in this country.</p><p>Is it -- is it too much to make of it to say this is someone who is sworn to uphold free speech and he is its biggest -- it's biggest threat?</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: Well, look, the First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and freedom of the press, so that example that he brought up about the media not being free speech is just flat-out wrong when we're talking about the Constitution.</p><p>Also, if the -- you know, it's interesting. It does not -- it doesn't comport with what an American president is supposed to do to start to qualify free speech. Free speech is pretty absolute in this country.</p><p>No, you can't yell \"fire\" in a crowded theater. Yes, there is the question of when speech is incitement. But, generally speaking, you can express your opinion -- good, bad, even abhorrent or positive, and that is protected by the Constitution. And it's odd that we're having a conversation about dangerous speech because of things that the president doesn't like listening to about himself. You could maybe have a debate in this country about dangerous speech when it comes to things like hate speech.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: We talk about that quite a bit. But still, that falls more often than not under the protections of the First Amendment.</p><p>And it's strange to be having this conversation based on what the president finds distasteful to the coverage of himself. That's not really the epicenter of where this discussion should be given the fact that the Constitution exists and protects these things very, very clearly.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes, not to mention odd that he would host trolls and conspiracy theorists at the White House and give them that platform.</p><p>Karoun Demirjian of \"The Washington Post\". Thank you so much for the time.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: Thank you.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Now to a story we've been following overnight.</p><p>R. Kelly arrested in Chicago. He's been charged with sex trafficking in New York. The entertainer also facing charges for child pornography and attempting to influence a case in Atlanta. The NYPD, Homeland Security, and other agencies assisting in his arrest.</p><p>The R&amp;B star has been fighting sexual abuse allegations for nearly two decades. In February, he was charged with aggravated sexual abuse involving four women -- three of them minors. He pleaded not guilty. He was released after posting bail.</p><p>ROMANS: A 3,000-acre brush fire forcing residents from their homes on the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p><p>Kahului Airport was operating on emergency generators and diverting flights at one point but operations are now back to normal.</p><p>The late-day sky flowing with fire and smoke. More than 600 people are in shelters.</p><p>The Maui Humane Society is evacuating its animals to Maui High School.</p><p>Oprah Winfrey, who has a home in Maui -- the private road on her property has now been opened to help fight the fire.</p><p>SANCHEZ: New warnings overnight for British tankers in a critical shipping route in the Persian Gulf. We have a live report, next.</p><p>[05:47:15] SANCHEZ: New overnight, the U.K. raising the security level for British tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. The Iranians tried to seize a British ship in that critical shipping route just hours earlier.</p><p>CNN's Nic Robertson is live in London with the latest. Nic, the U.K. clearly concerned that Iran is going to stay aggressive and maybe try to do this again.</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Sure. What they've done is raise the threat level to level three, the highest level state -- which essentially states that they believe that an attack on a British-flagged vessel at the moment is critical. Therefore, they believe that it could happen.</p><p>And they say they base this on a variety of open source intelligence, experience of past behavior and recent events, international partnerships before making a decision to raise it in this way. So they're looking at a lot of information.</p><p>We know that the commander of the Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain, very close by to the Straits of Hormuz, has said that he is aware of what the Iranian Revolutionary Guard tried to do -- trying to interdict that British vessel, the British Heritage -- the tanker ship which -- and it took the intervention of the British naval vessel, the HMS Montrose, to train its guns on the IRGC small fast boats to secure the safe passage of the British -- of the -- of the British merchant ship. It is now in safe waters.</p><p>The State Department, as well, condemns the actions of the -- Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p><p>Both the prime minister's office here, the Ministry of Defense, and the Foreign Office in the U.K. condemn it. They're urging Iran to deescalate at this time. But at the moment, Iran seems to be in no mood for that.</p><p>They are demanding the release of the Grace 1 tanker that was taken into custody by British naval marines -- by British marine force, along with the Gibraltar authorities. The captain and the first officer of that ship are now being charged with essentially sanctions- busting -- taking that Iranian oil on board that supertanker, trying to take it to a refinery in Syria.</p><p>In the meantime, however, the State Department does seem to be leaving the door open to diplomacy with the Iranians a little. They have decided for now, at least, not to put sanctions on Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif -- Boris.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes, a show of restraint even as the Revolutionary Guard declines to admit that anything happened. They're still apparently in denial.</p><p>Nic Robertson reporting from London. Thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, let's get a check on \"CNN Business\" this Friday morning.</p><p>The Fed may have to change its tune on inflation and potential rate cuts after a key report on consumer prices was stronger than expected.</p><p>The government said overall prices rose one-tenth in June. So-called core prices, which exclude food and energy, rose three-tenths of a percent. Prices rose for housing, clothing, home furnishings, medical care, and auto insurance, among other things.</p><p>Investors still expect a small rate cut from the Fed later this month, but calls for a larger move have quieted a bit after this CPI report.</p><p>[05:50:00] Let's take a look at global markets right now. You can see the Asian markets closed a little bit higher. Europe opened mixed.</p><p>And on Wall Street, leaning higher here after record highs for the Dow and the S&amp;P 500. The Dow up 228 points, topping 27,000 for the first time in history. The S&amp;P 500 beat the record it set last week, rising above 3,000. The Nasdaq fell just a bit.</p><p>But the market is strong. Look at stocks since President Trump's inauguration. This is a number the president clearly likes to tout.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: The Dow is up 36 percent. The S&amp;P 500 up 32 percent. The Nasdaq --</p><p>Tech stocks have just been on fire. On the tech front, there are now two trillion-dollar companies in the stock market, Amazon and Microsoft.</p><p>Big tech stocks have soared this year despite concerns about the possibility of more regulation in the U.S. and trade tensions with China.</p><p>OK, speaking of Amazon, adapt or be left behind. In a world of advanced robotics and artificial intelligence, American workers need more training to stay relevant.</p><p>Amazon is about to see how that works out. It is spending $700 million to retrain 100,000 of its U.S. employees. Called \"Upscaling 2025,\" workers can use this training to transfer between positions that without it, they might not have been qualified for.</p><p>Robotics and artificial intelligence are rapidly advancing and honestly, more capable of replacing more human jobs. Amazon is also fighting for employees in a very tight labor market. The plan could help attract and retain them.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>[05:55:51] SANCHEZ: At least two people are dead in an assisted living facility in Springfield, Virginia. Health officials are blaming what they call an outbreak of a respiratory illness. Eighteen residents were taken to the hospital and several dozen others have symptoms ranging from a cough to pneumonia. Investigators are working to identify the cause of the outbreak.</p><p>The Greenspring Retirement Community has been closed to new residents and current residents are being quarantined.</p><p>ROMANS: A new video this morning of an incredible Coast Guard operation to stop drug traffickers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COAST GUARDSMAN: Alto tu barco! Alto tu barco!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: \"Stop your boat,\" he's yelling. The boat is actually one of the infamously illusive narco-submarines built by the cartels to haul huge amounts of drugs.</p><p>On June 18th, a Coast Guard cutter on patrol found a narco-sub hundreds of miles off the Colombian and Ecuadorian coast. Three guardsmen slip onto that sub, pound on the hatch, and a suspected trafficker pops out with his hands up.</p><p>Officials say the operation netted $569 million worth of cocaine and marijuana, more than $230 million on this boat alone.</p><p>SANCHEZ: And that video gets your heart racing, doesn't it?</p><p>Not exactly a routine traffic stop in Guthrie, Oklahoma. Officers pulled over Stephen Jennings for expired tags on June 26th and they found a bunch of weird stuff in his car.</p><p>First, they found a gun. Then they discovered an open bottle of deluxe bourbon whiskey and a rattlesnake in a terrarium in the back seat.</p><p>The fun was only just beginning. Officers then noticed a canister containing radioactive powdered uranium.</p><p>ROMANS: What?</p><p>SANCHEZ: Jennings is facing a slew of charges, none of them apparently involving the uranium. It seems like almost everything you need for a good road trip except you probably need some beef jerky in there.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes. Whiskey and a rattlesnake, not a road trip I want to be taking there.</p><p>All right, cutting just 300 calories from your daily diet could significantly help your heart. That's just a modest 12 percent drop in average calories according to \"The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology\" journal. Now, study participants on a calorie restriction diet saw a decrease in blood pressure and bad cholesterol. Now, you, too, can achieve these results either by intermittent fasting or by simply skipping that slice of cheesecake for dessert.</p><p>About 610,000 people die of heart disease in the U.S. every year. That's one in every four deaths.</p><p>All right. She captured the hearts of millions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCENE FROM DISNEY'S \"MOANA\".</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: She's Disney's Moana. She's so beloved, 25-year-old Kensli Davis in Atlanta, wanted the character's image on her birthday cake. So her mom called the local baker and ordered the Moana cake. The woman on the other end of the phone heard \"marijuana\" and delivered a cannabis-themed caked instead.</p><p>No worries. Kensli said she and her mother laughed hysterically. Even without any case of the munchies, the cake was delish.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes, \"My Little Pony\" is a bit confusing there.</p><p>Well, sorry, Knicks fans, you lost again. ESPN reporting the Oklahoma City Thunder will trade Russell Westbrook to the Houston Rockets for Chris Paul -- two protected first-round picks and two draft pick swaps.</p><p>The move reuniting Westbrook with his old Thunder teammate James Harden, a pair of former MVPs.</p><p>After trading Westbrook and Paul, OKC now has 15 first-round draft picks through 2026, starting all over again with a fresh rebuild.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Thanks for joining us. Have a great rest of your day, everybody, and a great weekend. I'm Christine.</p><p>SANCHEZ: And I'm Boris Sanchez. \"NEW DAY\" starts right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Flash flooding and mandatory evacuations as Gulf Coast residents brace for a strong storm.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is going to be a major weather event.</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): If you are told to evacuate, don't question it, leave -- get out, now.</p><p>TRUMP: We are not backing down on our effort to determine the citizenship status of the United States population. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not just about citizenship on a questionnaire. It's about telling supporters before an election, we've won. You have somebody who represents you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president has the right to do it. This is data that we have a right to know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is NEW DAY with Alisyn Camerota and John Berman.</p><p>JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to our viewers in the United States and all around the world.

Although the report acknowledges the positive aspects of social media targeting, it warns that it often operates without enough \"transparency and accountability\" and that it can lead to the \"erosion of autonomy and the exploitation of people's vulnerabilities\". It also warns that online targeting has resulted in big tech companies having immense power to influence users' behaviour, as well as potential impacts on political outcomes and users' mental health. The report also examined public attitudes to social media targeting, and found that while many appreciate the convenience it can offer, and do believe targeting should be stopped entirely, they do want to have \"meaningful control over how they are targeted\" and are concerned by the increased prevalence and sophistication of such systems. </p><p>Analysis of public attitudes, conducted with Ipsos MORI, found that only 29% of people trust platforms to target them in a responsible way. Roger Taylor, Chair of the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, said: \"Most people do not want targeting stopped. But they do want to know that it is being done safely and responsibly. And they want more control. Tech platforms' ability to decide what information people see puts them in a position of real power. To build public trust over the long-term it is vital for the Government to ensure that the new online harms regulator looks at how platforms recommend content, establishing robust processes to protect vulnerable people. \" Based on this, the CDEI recommends that the government works to increase the accountability of social media platforms, that regulation is updated to promote \"responsibility and transparency and safeguard human rights\", and that regulation should respond to advances in technology. It also calls for a a code of practice for online targeting, and that independent researchers should have greater access to the data used by online platforms to check that they are being compliant. Finally, platforms should be required to store online advertising archives for certain types of targeted ads that \"pose particular societal risks\", such as political ads. Dr Bernadka Dubicka, Chair of the Child and Adolescent Faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: \"We completely agree that there needs to be greater accountability, transparency and control in the online world.\u00a0 It is fantastic to see the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation join our call for the regulator to be able to compel social media companies to give independent researchers secure access to their data.\" .gd-report-modal {display: none !Important;} div#Unit5 {display: none !Important;} div#Unit2 {display: none !Important;} div#Unit9 {display: none !Important;} .article-mpu {display: none !Important;}</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-DC1079494B484BB19B90942A2A4D5AB4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4T-CXP1-JC0X-H0SH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"487\"/><timeReceived>2:04 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 4, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

You didn't hear it much in everyday language, and it certainly wasn't associated with trust-busting. In the digital world of today, it's come to mean the measurable tidbits and inputs that add up to make every program and app - and thus much of the world's economy - function. And the fact that it isn't anywhere to be found in antitrust rules is a big problem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To have data is to have power, and collecting it is the lifeblood of four of the most valuable companies in America: Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Together, they are worth more than $5 trillion by market cap. That's like adding up the market values of Walmart, Johnson &amp; Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Procter &amp; Gamble, Pfizer, Coca-Cola, Exxon Mobil, Nike, McDonald's and Walt Disney Co. - and then multiplying that sum by two. Calling it \"Big Tech\" doesn't even do it justice.</p><p>These leaders of social-media, online-search, e-commerce and smartphones are so embedded in consumers' lives that it's nearly impossible to avoid interacting with them on a given day and handing over reams of data, all for free, in the process: checking emails, \"liking\" a post about Taylor Swift, clicking on an enchiladas recipe, joining a group for novice knitters, searching for bug spray and new eyeglass frames, looking up the UPS store's hours and directions to it, downloading a fitness app and geo-tagging a selfie at the beach - innocuous activities that are meticulously tracked to build a profile of who you are and predict how you'll spend your money.</p><p>That power hasn't gone unnoticed by regulators, Congress and other critics, many of whom wonder whether the companies' dominance is a sign that current antitrust laws have come up short in regulating this relatively new industry. The answer is, they have - and that's not all that surprising considering current laws were written with largely traditional businesses in mind, in which a tangible product or a service is built using suppliers and then sold to an end user. How Big Tech makes money can feel a bit more nebulous to an outsider, as well as who exactly is hurt by some of the industry's practices. Their customers are advertisers and other large and small businesses. The product is, well, you.</p><p>Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, appeared last Wednesday over video chat before a congressional committee that's investigating whether the industry has a monopoly problem. The Federal Trade Commission is also examining whether past acquisitions by these companies were anticompetitive. The industry doesn't see it that way; when the members of Congress pointed to known instances of data misuse or overreach, the CEOs often chalked it up to one-offs or minor mishaps, rather than patterns of harmful business practice aimed at squelching competition. Where critics see an anticompetitive move, Big Tech sees a noble effort to improve service for consumers.</p><p>It's time that antitrust laws were updated so regulators can better chaperone the industry - and its treasure trove of data - for it is both an immense intellectual and economic national asset and an opaque force with the power to capitalize on unknowing consumers and suppress rival businesses. Even with the best of intentions to create beneficial services that keep the world connected and informed, the result of Big Tech having such unchecked power over reams of valuable information has been to leave consumers and third-party partners comparatively powerless.</p><p>Amassing so much data isn't inherently anticompetitive - nor does it directly hit people's wallets - but regulators need to look at how it's collected and used, and take action when competition is harmed in the process. Amazon makes for the simplest example of how it can become problematic: The company has been accused of using the highly detailed information it gathers from sellers on its marketplace to inform what products to make for its own private label, AmazonBasics, and to undercut the competition. That's a major conflict of interest and an unfair advantage over third-party sellers, but there's nothing those sellers can really do about it - Amazon is practically the only game in town. (Would any reasonable person consider Etsy or even EBay to be substitutes?) Bezos said using seller data to aid Amazon's own brand would be a company violation, but he didn't deny that it happens and said he's looking into the issue.</p><p>This type of accusation against Amazon is the clearest example of monopoly power. Others aren't so clear-cut. Take the U.S. guidelines on mergers, which state:</p><p>\"A merger enhances market power if it is likely to encourage one or more firms to raise price, reduce output, diminish innovation, or otherwise harm customers as a result of diminished competitive constraints or incentives.\"</p><p>Rising prices are the most obvious way mergers can be harmful. But small acquisitions by Big Tech tend to fall into that all-encompassing \"otherwise harm\" category described above. Facebook's 2012 takeover of Instagram was harmful because it left social media users with few alternatives, forcing them in effect to accept the company's terms and further widening its lead over newcomer apps. Even if regulators couldn't have predicted this at the time, it's indisputable now that Facebook dominates social media and that spinning off Instagram would restore competition. (It would probably be good for shareholders, too, as my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Tae Kim has argued.)</p><p>The FTC says that antitrust laws were intentionally written in general terms, allowing them to be broadly applied and interpreted in changing times on a case-by-case basis. But it may be that they are overly broad to the point of being antiquated, or at least not specific enough to effectively govern Big Tech. For example, the idea of \"prices\" should also include the price social-media users pay - the level of data they must fork over and the loss of control they have over that data. Another steep price that can be paid in the digital era is a privacy breach. Facebook's controversies involving its data aren't merely public-relations matters - they stem from competitive dominance and insufficient regulatory oversight.</p><p>Antitrust enforcement also comes down to how regulators define markets. \"In the absence of price competition, market definition can be difficult,\" Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said in a November speech regarding the data industry. \"Antitrust enforcers may need to play an even greater role in zero-price markets,\" he said. Rather than a zero-price market, Google and Facebook would argue that they compete healthily in the $333 billion global digital-advertising space, with Amazon nipping at their heels in the U.S. and Apple's devices serving as conduits. But the ad market provides an incomplete picture, and that framing implies that these companies are merely a powerful foursome. Defining the market more narrowly - and more accurately - shows how each one has instead become a monopoly of sorts, having carved out its own silo with few, if any, true competitors.</p><p>Advertisers may regularly adjust how much money to allocate to each site, but they generally need to be present on all of them. Facebook provides the ability to target ultra-specific subsets of people. Google isn't just a search engine, it's the primary verb people use for search, and it further feeds that dominance by scraping useful information from other pages, making its products priority destinations. For sellers of goods, Amazon's marketplace offers the best reach. App developers don't have much choice than to agree to the Apple app store's onerous terms and fees. Consumers don't pick and choose between these products and services either - they must use them all or accept life under a rock.</p><p>Regulators would also be more effective if antitrust laws specified how data can be used and with what limitations, as well as requirements for safeguarding it. That would prevent Amazon from having such porous walls between its marketplace and internal brand. It could put an end to Google's practice of paying to keep its search engine dominant and being able to direct so much traffic toward its own sites.</p><p>Data should no longer be thought of as just an input for effective advertising, but rather the focal point of the question of whether Big Tech has too much power. If the answer is yes, and the remedy is creating an environment that would allow more Instagrams and Googles to flourish, wouldn't everyone benefit?</p><p>--Bloomberg Opinion</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRTPRH-2431415514</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRTPRH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JD-KMH1-DY0W-40VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409746</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1465\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Portland Newspapers Aug 9, 2020</copyright><publicationName>Portland Press Herald</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 26895900</issn><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 9, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

All interest is diverted to the companies backing Libra's governing body, while holders of Libra itself earn nothing - giving the founders profits akin to the seigniorage made by central banks.\"</p><p>But one of those partners, PayPal, saw its stock drop more than 2% on Friday. While some of that decline may have been in response to the news that Bill Ready, its chief operating officer,plans to leaveby the end of the year, \"the stock's fall comes asthe future of paymentsis potentially changing.\" Libra, for example, could be \"a threat or an opportunity for PayPal. Payments companies have been anxious that a tech heavyweight could eat away at their business, but participating in Libra can allow them to watch Facebook's ambitions and potentially gain from it. Still, the prospect of regulatory scrutiny has swirled around Facebook's Libra project and the entire social-media operation, which could weigh on shares of the company and its payment partners.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, bitcoin on Friday rose over $10,000 for the first time in over a year, before climbing above $11,000 the following day, \"riding a new wave of optimism about the value and future of digital currencies.

Under the current rule, \"banks must get their customers' express permission before charging a penalty for overspending, whether through most debit card purchases or ATM withdrawals. If customers don't accept overdraft coverage, banks simply decline transactions that would drop an account balance below zero. If customers do \"opt in\" to overdraft coverage, the bank approves the purchase or cash withdrawal and charges a fee - typically about $35. Consumer advocates say they are watching carefully for any proposed changes in the rule, which they credit with helping people avoid excessive penalties.

Payments companies have been anxious that a tech heavyweight could eat away at their business, but participating in Libra can allow them to watch Facebook's ambitions and potentially gain from it.

In one week, on September 28, he will introduce a new line of Kindles to the world. He has already shown me two of them\u2014one with a touchscreen, the other costing just $79\u2014but that's not what's truly exciting him. It is a third gadget, the long-awaited Amazon tablet called the Kindle Fire, that represents his company's most ambitious leap into the hearts, minds, and wallets of millions of consumers.</p><p>Bezos runs through the features that will soon set the tech world ablaze\u2014the $199 price tag, the easy-to-hold size, the seamless access to Amazon's rich and growing collection of digital media. When the Fire is introduced, analysts will declare it the strongest competitor yet to the iPad. Yet the Fire is not just a rival gadget, but something essentially different. The iPad is the flagship of the post-PC era\u2014in which the desktop is replaced by lean, portable, gesture-driven tablets. The Fire is an emblem of a post-web world, in which our devices are simply a means for us to directly connect with the goodies in someone's data center.</p><p>While users of the iPad and the Fire will engage in many of the same activities\u2014watching movies, reading books, playing <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Angry Birds</emphasis>\u2014the philosophy behind the two tablets could not be more different. Apple is fundamentally a hardware company\u201491 percent of its revenue comes from sales of its coveted machines, compared to just 6 percent from iTunes. The iPad's design, marketing, and product launches all emphasize the special character of the device itself, which the company views as a successor to the PC\u2014complete with video-chat capabilities and word-processing software. Amazon, on the other hand, is a content-focused company\u2014almost half of its revenue comes from sales of media like books, music, TV shows, and movies\u2014and the fire-sale-priced Fire is designed to be primarily a passport to the large amount of that content that's available digitally. The gadget comes preloaded with customers' Amazon account information, and anyone who signs up for Amazon Prime, the company's $79-a-year shipping service, will be able to access more than 12,000 (and counting) movies and TV shows on the Fire at no extra charge.</p><p>Bezos doesn't consider the Fire a mere device, preferring to call it a \u201cmedia service.\u201d While he takes pride in the Fire, he really sees it as an advanced mobile portal to Amazon's cloud universe. That's how Amazon has always treated the Kindle: New models simply offer improved ways of buying and reading the content. Replacing the hardware is no more complicated or emotionally involved than changing a flashlight battery.</p><p>The iPad emphasizes downloads\u2014customers who buy music, TV shows, or movies through iTunes must download them to their machine. (Even users of its new iCloud service must download their music to listen to it\u2014at least for now.) This keeps iPads tethered to the paradigm of local storage, putting a premium on machines with more memory (which cost hundreds of dollars more). Amazon, by contrast, emphasizes streaming. Fire users can store up to 20 GB of music for free on the company's servers (or an unlimited amount of music bought from Amazon). They can then stream it freely, along with more than 100,000 videos. That's probably why the Fire's hard drive is just 8 GB, half the size of the smallest iPad.</p><p>The glory of the iPad, as well as the iPhone, is its operating system; Apple's proprietary iOS is one of the main selling points, and the company regularly adds new features\u2014most recently Siri, the voice-activated personal assistant. The Fire is built on Google's competing Android OS, but a simplified version of it. (Fire users will have access to a heavily curated subset of the 250,000 Android apps.) Bezos seems to believe that people should care less about what their OS can do and just be able to stream the damn movie. (It's a similar philosophy to Google's Chrome OS, but tied to a proprietary piece of hardware and Amazon's universe of media services.)</p><p>The Fire does have one compelling new piece of software: a faster browser called Silk. But even that is a servant of Amazon's cloud vision. Over the past eight years, the company has capitalized on its data center expertise to build a vast cloud computing platform, which hosts web operations for some of the world's largest Internet companies\u2014even competitors like Netflix. When surfing the Internet, the Silk browser harnesses those cloud servers to do much of the processing. \u201cWe call it a split browser, because it's half in the cloud and half on the Fire,\u201d Bezos says. It's a hack that aims to make web pages download much faster. But it also has grand ramifications: It points to an era in which the device is so secondary that even computation takes place in the cloud.</p><p>The release of the Fire showcases how forward-thinking Bezos has been. After 15 years near the top of the tech heap, he doesn't have the same outsize profile of other Internet innovators. (Nobody has made a TV biopic or Academy Award-winning drama about his rise to power, for instance.) But that may be changing. People are slowly beginning to realize just how much of the Web is powered by Amazon's cloud services. And industry observers see Amazon's entry into the tablet sweepstakes as further evidence that Bezos may well be the premier technologist in America, a figure who casts as big a shadow as legends like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.</p><p>In a series of interviews in Seattle and New York, Bezos sat down with WIRED to share his thoughts on the cloud, commerce, management, and outer space.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEVY: The Fire seems like more than merely another iPad competitor.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEZOS:</emphasis> Yeah. What we really built is a fully integrated media service. Hardware is a crucial ingredient in the service, but it's only a piece of it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Price is a piece of it, too, and yours costs just $199.</emphasis></p><p>We think it's a unique approach in the marketplace\u2014premium products at nonpremium prices. We're a company very accustomed to operating at low margins. We grew up that way. We've never had the luxury of high margins, there's no reason to get used to it now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How has Amazon been able to reinvent itself so consistently over the past 15 years?</emphasis></p><p>As a company, one of our greatest cultural strengths is accepting the fact that if you're going to invent, you're going to disrupt. A lot of entrenched interests are not going to like it. Some of them will be genuinely concerned about the new way, and some of them will have a vested self-interest in preserving the old way. But in both cases, they're going to create a lot of noise, and it's very easy for employees to be distracted by that. It could be criticism of something that we actually believe in. It could also be too much praise about something that we're not doing as well as the outside world says we're doing it. We're going to stay heads-down and work on the business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Eric Schmidt has said that there are four horsemen of technology now: Google, Apple, Facebook, and you. Do you view Amazon in those terms?</emphasis></p><p>Lists like that are fine and interesting, but if I were making that list I would have a hard time not having Microsoft on it. They've done a lot of innovative things, some of which get overshadowed by their big existing businesses. You look at something like Kinect, it's pretty cool.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">As they'll be the first to tell you.</emphasis></p><p>As they should. It's genuine. But one question to ask when you see a list like that is, who would have been on it 10 years ago? That will keep you humble. Go back to 1980. Who would you have predicted to be among the four horsemen of the personal computer era?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IBM.</emphasis></p><p>Right. And Intel, maybe. But you might've had Commodore, too, or Atari. There are always shiny things. A company shouldn't get addicted to being shiny, because shiny doesn't last. You really want something that's much deeper-keeled. You want your customers to value your service. And there are companies that haven't gone through tough times, so they're not really tested.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon has had those tough times\u2014it took years before you made a profit, and your stock fell dramatically as the first tech bubble popped. Are there things that you've done smarter because you went through that crucible?</emphasis></p><p>If you go back to 1999, it's hard to remember how effervescent the bubble was. People who really didn't have any passion for technology or the Internet were giving up their careers as doctors and mining Internet gold. And when the bubble popped, a meaningful fraction of our people left. They realized they didn't really want to be doing this. Some of them got laid off, some of them left of their own accord. Those were not happy days. This super-valuable person you really liked leaves. So your skin gets thicker. Not just me, but all of the executives who stayed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To the consternation of publishers, Amazon is now publishing its own books. What are you doing differently?</emphasis></p><p>For one thing, pricing. For your typical consumer book\u2014I'm not talking about textbooks or anything specialized\u2014$9.99 is really the highest price that's reasonable for customers to pay.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Some publishers don't agree with you.</emphasis></p><p>As a company, we are culturally pioneers, and we like to disrupt even our own business. Other companies have different cultures and sometimes don't like to do that. Our job is to bring those industries along. The music industry should be a great cautionary tale: Don't let that happen to you. Get ahead of it. I think with books, we have gotten ahead of it, as have some very forward-leaning publishers. But some of them are really leaning backward, and that's going to hurt their business. They'll find that other publishers are going to do very well in that vacuum.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What else are you doing differently than other publishers?</emphasis></p><p>We believe that some of the royalty streams being paid for ebooks are not high enough. That's why, in our Kindle Direct Publishing program, if you price your book between $2.99 and $9.99, we give you 70 percent of the revenue.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What plans does Amazon have to produce content in other media?</emphasis></p><p>Well, we have studios.amazon.com. It's a completely new way of making movies. [Amazon crowdsources the production of a \u201ctest movie\u201d until it reaches the point where a real studio takes over. Warner Bros. Pictures has a first-look deal with Amazon.] Some would say our approach is unworkable\u2014we disagree.</p><p>\u201cWE ARE CULTURALLY PIONEERS. WE LIKE TO DISRUPT EVEN OUR OWN BUSINESS. OTHER COMPANIES HAVE DIFFERENT CULTURES AND SOMETIMES DON'T LIKE TO DO THAT. OUR JOB IS TO BRING THOSE INDUSTRIES ALONG.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Let's talk about web services. Amazon Web Services is dominant in hosting\u2014one observer says that you are the Coke of the field, and there's no Pepsi. How did an ecommerce site wind up in the position where it's hosting web powerhouses like Foursquare, NASA, Netflix, and The New York Times</emphasis></p><p>Approximately nine years ago we were wasting a lot of time internally because, to do their jobs, our applications engineers had to have daily detailed conversations with our networking infrastructure engineers. Instead of having this fine-grained coordination about every detail, we wanted the data-center guys to give the apps guys a set of dependable tools, a reliable infrastructure that they could build products on top of.</p><p>The problem was obvious. We didn't have that infrastructure. So we started building it for our own internal use. Then we realized, \u201cWhoa, everybody who wants to build web-scale applications is going to need this.\u201d We figured with a little bit of extra work we could make it available to everybody. We're going to make it anyway\u2014let's sell it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What was the internal argument against it?</emphasis></p><p>Stick to the knitting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I'm going to guess that you don't find that argument convincing.</emphasis></p><p>No. The common question that gets asked in business is, why? That's a good question, but an equally valid question is, why not? This is a good idea, we have a lot of skills and assets to do this well, we're already going to do it for ourselves\u2014why not sell it, too?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Young startups all tell me that even if Google offers them free hosting, they still want to use Amazon. Why do you think that is?</emphasis></p><p>We were determined to build the best services but to price them at a level that customers couldn't match, even if they were willing to use inferior products. Tech companies always have high margins, except for Amazon. We're the only tech company with low margins.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How did you do it?</emphasis></p><p>We really obsess over small defects. That's what drives up costs. Because the most expensive thing you can do is make a mistake. We can afford to focus on smaller and smaller defects and eliminate them at their root. That reduces cost, because things just work.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target recently left Amazon Services to build its own web infrastructure. Three weeks after launch, a popular promotion took down the site. Did you get some satisfaction from that?</emphasis></p><p>No. Do you know how long we served Target? It was 10 years. We worked our butts off to serve them extraordinarily well. Some people misunderstood\u2014\u201cWhy are you aiding and abetting a competitor?\u201d But they were great partners. We worked hard for two years to help them migrate to the new system. It was the ultimate in friendly divorces. We wanted to see their transition go smoothly. So, no.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">They could've used a few more servers, though.</emphasis></p><p>Well, maybe they should've built their new thing on top of AWS. [<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Laughs.</emphasis>]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You've leveraged Amazon Web Services by making use of it in your new Silk browser. Why?</emphasis></p><p>One of the things that makes mobile web browsing slow is the fact that the average website pulls content from 13 different places on the Internet. On a mobile device, even with a good Wi-Fi connection, each round trip is typically 100 milliseconds or more. Some of that can be done in parallel, but you typically have a whole bunch, as many as eight or more round trips that each take 100 milliseconds. That adds up. We've broken apart this process. If you can be clever enough to move the computation onto our cloud platform, you get these huge computational resources. Our cloud services are really fast. What takes 100 milliseconds on Wi-Fi takes less than 5 milliseconds on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud. So by moving some of the computation onto that cloud, we can accelerate a lot of what makes mobile web browsing slow.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Was it difficult to turn yourself from a retail company into a consumer electronics company?</emphasis></p><p>It's not as different as you might think. A lot of our original approaches and techniques carried over very well. For example, we've always focused on reducing the time between order and delivery. In hardware, it's the same principle. An example is the time between when we take delivery on a processor to when it's being used in a device by a customer. That's waste. Why would we own a processor that's supposed to go into a Kindle Fire that's not actually in a customer's hands? That's inventory management.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By the way, how many Kindles have you sold?</emphasis></p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bezos gives a long, loud example of his famous laugh.</emphasis>]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You don't even answer!</emphasis></p><p>I know you don't expect me to.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">For years you've been touting e-ink as superior to a backlit device for reading. But the Fire is backlit. Why should Kindle users switch?</emphasis></p><p>They should buy both. When you're reading long-form, there's no comparison. You want the e-ink. But you can't watch a movie with that. And you can't play Android games. And so on.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">And you now are selling a new version of the basic Kindle for $79. At this point, why not give it away\u2014offer a deal where if people buy a certain amount of books, they get a free Kindle?</emphasis></p><p>It's an interesting marketing idea, and we should think about it over time. But $79 is low enough that it's not a big deal for many people.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Speaking of pricing, I wanted to ask about your decision to include streaming video as part of Amazon Prime. Why not charge separately for that? It's a completely different service, isn't it?</emphasis></p><p>There are two ways to build a successful company. One is to work very, very hard to convince customers to pay high margins. The other is to work very, very hard to be able to afford to offer customers low margins. They both work. We're firmly in the second camp. It's difficult\u2014you have to eliminate defects and be very efficient. But it's also a point of view. We'd rather have a very large customer base and low margins than a smaller customer base and higher margins.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Right now, the more recent movies and TV shows, the ones you call premium, aren't included in the Prime membership. You have to buy or rent them separately. Wouldn't it be better to offer an all-you-can-eat package that includes premium films, even if you have to charge a bit more?</emphasis></p><p>I'm a big fan of all-you-can-eat plans, because they're simpler for customers. We work together with a bunch of different parties\u2014the studios, content owners\u2014and they get a say in how we offer their content, too. But my view is, if you can simplify it for consumers, that's the way to do it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You've built some social features into Amazon, but it's not a huge part of what you do. What's Amazon's role in the social arena?</emphasis></p><p>It's an open question. I think what we're wondering is, if we have a list of 500 of your friends, how can we use that to improve ecommerce? We have some ideas. We've actually already done some experiments but haven't found anything that we think is exciting yet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">But your rivals treat social interaction as an essential component of life online.</emphasis></p><p>\u201cWE WORK VERY, VERY HARD TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO OFFER CUSTOMERS LOW MARGINS. WE'D RATHER HAVE A VERY LARGE CUSTOMER BASE AND LOW MARGINS THAN A SMALLER CUSTOMER BASE AND HIGHER MARGINS.\u201d</p><p>For better or worse, it is really not a part of our culture to look at things defensively. We rarely say, \u201cOh my God, we've got to do something about that existential threat.\u201d Maybe one day we'll become extinct because of that deficiency in our nature. I don't know. We look at things through a different lens. We say, \u201cOh, here's this incredible phenomenon called social networking. How can we be inspired by that to make our business better?\u201d I hope we find something.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Two years ago, you bought Zappos. Was that an attempt to absorb their so-called culture of happiness and customer service?</emphasis></p><p>No, no, no. We like their unique culture, but we don't want that culture at Amazon. We like our culture, too. Our version of a perfect customer experience is one in which our customer doesn't want to talk to us. Every time a customer contacts us, we see it as a defect. I've been saying for many, many years, people should talk to their friends, not their merchants. And so we use all of our customer service information to find the root cause of any customer contact. What went wrong? Why did that person have to call? Why aren't they spending that time talking to their family instead of talking to us? How do we fix it? Zappos takes a completely different approach. You call them and ask them for a pizza, and they'll get out the Yellow Pages for you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So where's the synergy?</emphasis></p><p>It's on the back end. Amazon has a huge shoe business. Zappos has a huge shoe business. Zappos may have the size-8 customer, and we have the size-8 shoe. Having one set of fulfillment services for these two very different front ends, you get to satisfy more customers more often, because you're more likely to have their size and style and color and so on.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Let me change the subject to your fight against paying state sales taxes. Why have you been so aggressive?</emphasis></p><p>Our view on this is very clear and consistent. More than half of our worldwide business is in places where we collect sales tax or its equivalent. There are five states where we collect sales tax. We do great in those states. That's not what this is about. We want federal legislation. That's what we've been working on. And I think we can get that done this year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Some years ago, there was some controversy when Amazon got a patent for its 1-Click shopping. Now, technology patents are so widespread that they're seen as a real hindrance to creativity and innovation. Has your thinking changed?</emphasis></p><p>For many years, I have thought that software patents should either be eliminated or dramatically shortened. It's impossible to measure the toll they've had on the software industry, but on balance, it has been negative.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">But without software patents, you wouldn't have exclusive rights to 1-Click shopping.</emphasis></p><p>If that were the price of having a dramatic reduction in software patents, it would be great.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You have a separate company called Blue Origin that hopes to send customers into outer space. Why is that important to you?</emphasis></p><p>It is a serious effort. When I was 5 years old, I watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon. It made me passionate about science, physics, math, exploration.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will you walk on the moon someday?</emphasis></p><p>Me? Are you saying would I if I could?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I bet you'd like to, but do you think you will?</emphasis></p><p>Boy. I've been asked to make tough predictions before. That one's very tough. But that's not what this is about. If I wanted to buy tourist trips to fly to the International Space Station and Soyuz and those things, there's nothing wrong with that. But that's $35 million. I want to lower the cost of access to space.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How do you do that?</emphasis></p><p>I like to say, \u201cMaintain a firm grasp of the obvious at all times.\u201d For Amazon, that's selection, speed of delivery, lower prices. Well, for Blue Origin it's cost and safety. If you really want to make it so that anybody can go into space, you have to increase the safety and decrease the cost. That's Blue Origin's mission. I'm super passionate about it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you feel that it's a bit disconnected to start a space-exploration company in this economically grim time?</emphasis></p><p>No. We employ a lot of aerospace engineers. They have families, their kids go to college. We buy a lot of materials. Somebody made those materials, right?</p><p>\u201cAmazon is willing to plant seeds and let them grow. We're stubborn on vision and flexible on details.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You've also given $42 million to the Long Now Foundation for the development of a giant clock designed to last for 10,000 years. Does that project relate at all to what you're doing at Amazon?</emphasis></p><p>It does fit into my view. Our first shareholder letter, in 1997, was entitled, \u201cIt's all about the long term.\u201d If everything you do needs to work on a three-year time horizon, then you're competing against a lot of people. But if you're willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you're now competing against a fraction of those people, because very few companies are willing to do that. Just by lengthening the time horizon, you can engage in endeavors that you could never otherwise pursue. At Amazon we like things to work in five to seven years. We're willing to plant seeds, let them grow\u2014and we're very stubborn. We say we're stubborn on vision and flexible on details.</p><p>In some cases, things are inevitable. The hard part is that you don't know how long it might take, but you know it will happen if you're patient enough. Ebooks had to happen. Infrastructure web services had to happen. So you can do these things with conviction if you are long-term-oriented and patient.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Speaking of longevity, you're still relatively young, but you've been at this for a long time. A lot of the other big tech CEOs from your generation aren't around anymore.</emphasis></p><p>Don't worry, they'll make more.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">But you'll miss Steve Jobs, I assume.</emphasis></p><p>Steve was a teacher to anyone paying attention, and he's gone way too soon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's the right shelf life for a CEO?</emphasis></p><p>It's variable. I like invention. For me, it feels like the rate of change on the Internet today is even greater than it was in 1995. It's hard for me to imagine a more exciting arena in which to invent. And so it's pretty easy to wake up excited.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Senior writer</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEVEN LEVY</emphasis> (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:steven_levy@wired.com\">steven_levy@wired.com</email>) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">also wrote about Steve Jobs on page 230.</emphasis></p><h>Competing Visions</h><p>The Kindle Fire isn't just a rival to the iPad.

The streaming video giant doesn't have an advertising-based business and it's more of a media company than a tech firm, he noted on a video conference call Monday following the company's earnings report. \"I think we're substantially inoculated from the other issues that are happening in the industry,\" Hastings said. \"And that's great.\"<br/> Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified on Capitol Hill about his company's data protection and privacy practices following news that data on up to 87 million Facebook users was leaked to a data analysis firm linked to President Trump's election campaign. During the hearings, members of Congress brought up the possibility of new laws to protect consumer privacy, and to ensure transparency in online political ads. They also touched on the potential for new antitrust actions against some of tech's giants.<br/> But Netflix stands apart from Facebook because it doesn't sell advertisements, Hastings said. Unlike Facebook, which at one point allowed app developers to download data it had collected about its users, Netflix has placed a premium on protecting the information it has on its customers' viewing habits, he said.<br/> Hastings is intimately familiar with Facebook's business model, because he serves on its board as a director.<br/> \"I'm very glad that we built this business to not be advertising supported, but to be subscription,\" he said. \"We're very different from an ad-supported business.\"<br/> But Netflix differs from other tech companies, because it's much more focused on producing, acquiring, and licensing movies and television shows than it is on building technology, Hastings said. The company expects to spend more than $10 billion on such content this year, compared with about $1.3 billion on technology, he said. \"We're really pretty different from the pure tech companies,\" Hastings said.<br/> Earlier on Monday, Netflix announced that it added 5.5 million subscribers in the first quarter, exceeding Wall Street's expectations. The company's also announced earnings and revenue that were in-line with analyst forecasts.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10469637</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S47-KVF1-DYDW-70M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"427\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 17, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Companies like Share-Chat, one of the most prominent in its portfolio that is valued at around $500 million, are now competing with Chinese ones, in this case Bytedance. The problem for these fledgling startups is two-fold, one of facing big technology firms, and then of raising capital while these foreign competitors pour a slug of cash to grow their business here.</p><p>\u201cFrom the Indian perspective, there should be some sort of regulation so that the overall environment is conducive for homegrown champions because many of these startups are too small and vulnerable,\u201d Koh says.</p><p>\u201cIf you leave the gates wide open for foreigners to come in, it is easy for the whole ecosystem to be dominated by foreign players.

PwC's annual Global CEO survey \u2014 1,581 CEOs across 83 territories \u2014 was conducted in the fall and released tonight as the World Economic Forum opened. It makes for some pretty alarming reading. </p><p>The big picture: 53% of CEOs expect global economic growth to decline in 2020, up from 29% in 2019 and just 5% in 2018. Their views of their own companies' prospects were the bleakest since 2009. That sentiment was spread across all regions, though CEOs in the Asia-Pacific are most optimistic and North American CEOs least so. What they're worried about: CEOs in the Asia-Pacific view trade conflicts as the top threat to their organizations' bottom lines, while geopolitical uncertainty is the top concern in the Middle East, populism ranks first in Latin America, policy uncertainty in Africa and cyber threats in North America.Over-regulation is the biggest concern among CEOs in Europe, and also finishes top in the global average. What they're doing about it: Trade conflicts didn't even register as a top 10 concern until last year, but are now top-of-mind, particularly in China.Chinese CEOs who are 'extremely concerned' about trade conflicts are far more likely to say they're shifting production to alternative territories than a year ago (44% then, 63% now). Among \"extremely concerned\" U.S. CEOs, 50% are adjusting supply chains but just 23% are moving production, while 34% aren't making any changes at all (compared to 5% in China).Worth noting: Chinese CEOs now list Australia, not the U.S., as the most important country for their growth prospects. What they foresee: CEOs around the world expect massive changes for big tech. By 2022, most anticipate more regulations (71%), including on social media, the break-up of dominant firms (63%), and compensation of individual users for their data (51%).While companies are eager to stress their climate consciousness while in Davos, just 24% of CEOs are 'extremely concerned' about climate change.In China, though, the percentage of CEOs who see new opportunities for their companies through climate change initiatives has jumped from 2% in 2010 to 47% now \u2014 far higher than in Germany (20%) or the U.S. (15%).Who's coming to Davos 15,000 total attendees (3,000 of them with official invitations) including 100 billionaires and 53 heads of state or government, per Politico[2]. Climate will dominate the official agenda. I eavesdropped on a few attendees tonight discussing whom they most wanted to see, and Greta Thunberg was the consensus pick. Soon after, placard-waving climate protesters chanted their way through the streetsSeveral panels will also be dedicated to inequality and human rights. Between the lines: The irony of the uber-rich and super-powerful arriving by private jet to discuss these topics in a proudly exclusive setting (there are at least 10 tiers[3] of access badge) is lost on no one. But the sheer concentration of power and wealth in one Alpine town makes Davos, now in its 50th year, a hard-to-match destination for deal-making and consensus-building.Trump in town Davos opened this evening on the third anniversary of President Trump's inauguration, and on the eve of impeachment proceedings that will likely be watched more closely than his speech on Tuesday morning.The big picture: Trump's America First populism and climate skepticism are anathema to the Davos set, but his tax cuts and economic record are not. Two candidates who scare many CEOs more than Trump \u2014 Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 are among the top contenders in the Iowa caucuses, which begin two weeks from today.Kellyanne Conway told reporters ahead of Trump's trip that he planned to 'take on the perils of socialism right there in Davos,' while heralding his NAFTA replacement deal and partial trade agreement with China.

However, in nearly five hours of interrogations, the shocking revelations and outrageous clashes shone through his absence. Despite hostile questions and frequent interruptions by lawmakers from both parties, few blows seemed to make a dent.</p><p><br/>It was not clear to what extent they made progress in their goal of imposing themselves on these gigantic companies on their dominance of the sector and the allegations of monopoly practices that suffocate competition.<br/>Diatribes abounded Wednesday at the hearing of a lower house antitrust judicial subcommittee with Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg; Jeff Bezos, de Amazon; Sundar Pichai, Google and Tim Cook, apple. For the past year, the panel has investigated the business practices of Silicon Valley giants to determine whether they need to be regulated or even divided.<br/>CEOs videoified to lawmakers, who sometimes appeared together as small individual figures on a screen divided into mostly empty squares. Most of the congressmen were sitting, wearing masks, in the courtroom in Washington.<br/>Executives abounded in data that sought to demonstrate the strong competition they face and the value of their innovation and essential services to consumers, but sometimes hesitated to answer sharp questions about their business practices. They were also questioned about their alleged political tendencies, how they affect American democracy, and its role in China.<br/>Panel President David Cicilline said every platform controlled by Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple \"is a bottleneck in a crucial distribution channel.\"<br/>\"Whether they control access to information or a market, these platforms have the incentive and ability to exploit this power,\" he said. \"They can charge exorbitant fees, impose stifling contracts, and extract valuable data from the people and businesses that depend on them. In short, they have too much power.\"<br/>The four CEOs run companies whose products are part of the daily life plot, with billions of customers and a combined market value that surpasses the entire German economy. Bezos is the richest individual in the world; Zuckerberg is fourth on the list of billionaires.<br/>The interrogations went through some trouble. Pichai and Zuckerberg found them uncomfortable when they were questioned about seemingly murky aspects of their businesses, but took a break when their inquisitors ran out of time. Bezos acknowledged that Amazon's alleged misdeeds\u2014for example, allegations that the company has used data generated by independent vendors on its platform to compete against them\u2014would be \"unacceptable\" if proven.<br/>Regulators in the United States and Europe have scrutinized Amazon's relationship with companies that sell on its website and whether the online commerce giant has used vendor information to create its own-branded products.<br/>\"We have a policy of not using vendor-specific information to help our private label business,\" Bezos said in response to a question from Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal. \"However, I cannot guarantee that this policy was not violated.\"<br/>External observers were able to draw diametrically opposed conclusions from the event. Attorney Richard Hamilton Jr., a former antitrust officer from the Department of Justice, said everyone on the commissionseemed to agree on the need to regulate companies more strictly, which was an \"ominous\" sign, but Stephen Beck, CEO of entrepreneurial consultancy cg42, said that tech and their brands came out relatively unharmed.<br/>Cook, he added, was particularly skilled and well-prepared and gave a \"master class on how to handle these situations.\" He received fewer questions than his colleagues after claiming that Apple is not dominant in any market.<br/>While Democrats focused primarily on market competition, several Republicans voiced long-standing complaints that tech companies are censoring conservative voices, and questioned their business activities in China. \"Big tech companies go for the Conservatives,\" Rep. Jim Jordan said.<br/>In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to take action against companies, which he has accused, without presenting evidence, of prejudice against him and conservatives in general.<br/>___<br/>The Associated Press journalist Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this firm.<br/>___<br/>Gordon is at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twitter.com/mgordonap\">https://www.twitter.com/mgordonap</url><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-13550767</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GG-C6Y1-DY1R-B38P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"744\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

For the past 13 months, the Subcommittee has been analyzing an enormous pile of documents from Big Tech companies to understand how they have come to dominate their respective markets. Asking the CEOs the right questions might lead to more adequate legislation that ensures fair competition and thus better chances for new market entrants and smaller players. For scale, Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook currently have a combined market cap of around $5 trillion and generated revenues of $773 billion in 2019. The hearing is not meant to seek punitive action against the four tech companies, but it should serve as the basis for an updated legislation that could prevent further abuse of market power from the dominant forces in the tech industry. </p><p>Lawmakers had already acquired 1.3 million documents[1] from the tech giants and conducted several interviews and public hearings, meaning they should be well prepared with the right line of questioning. Specifically, the bipartisan antitrust panel wants to find out if Big Tech has grown too big and whether this has allowed a relatively small number of platforms to dominate their respective markets by working around current competition law.The hearing will be livestreamed this Wednesday, starting at 12pm ET/9am PT. You can watch it here (embed at the end of the story, we'll move it to the top once the hearing begins tomorrow).In a joint statement[2], House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler and Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline explained that \"given the central role these corporations play in the lives of the American people, it is critical that their CEOs are forthcoming. As we have said from the start, their testimony is essential for us to complete this investigation.\"Some speculate the biggest target of the hearing will be Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who is now the world's richest man[3]. Bezos will have to explain to antitrust regulators how his company's mission \"to continually raise the bar of the consumer experience\" relates to practices of predatory pricing[4], burying competitors in search queries[5], and abusing third-party seller data[6] to create its own products. For some of the members of the Judiciary Committee, earlier testimony with respect to how Amazon manages its marketplace may have been \"misleading, criminally false or perjurious[7].\" Bezos will likely bring into attention an Amazon-commissioned study[8] that showed how small businesses have actually seen \"rapid sales and hiring growth\" as a result of joining the retail giant's online marketplace, with the majority of these companies using Amazon as an online sales channel.Apple's Tim Cook almost managed to avoid antitrust scrutiny by forging[9] strong relationships with White House officials and supporting[10] president Trump's \"Made in America\" initiative with the Mac Pro line. He has also been very vocal[11] about large social platforms that tend to amass user data and profit from it, which is part of Apple's strong stance on user privacy.However, as the App Store has grown into a large business that accounts for $519 billion[12] in consumer spend every year, many have brought into question the company's tight control over it. Specifically, the company has been accused of \"Sherlocking[13]\" functionality from certain apps and rendering them obsolete. Some companies feel they're being coerced[14] into paying 15 to 30 percent of their revenue made from digital goods and services that are sold through the App Store.Last week, an Apple-commissioned study[15] defended the practice, noting that most app stores charge the same 30 percent commission rate. It also pointed fingers at other marketplaces where retailers and travel booking services take an even higher cut on the revenues made through them. The study also mentions how most app stores and marketplaces require users to go through the platform owner's payment mechanism and actively police other behaviors like redirecting to an outside service.Google is a different beast that holds dominant positions in search, mobile services, advertising, and online video. The company has made a number of acquisitions and mergers including DoubleClick, AdMob, YouTube, and Android -- all of which have allowed it to amass the data of billions of consumers and potentially guided its overall strategy over the years through things like Android Lockbox[16].Moreover, CEO Sundar Pichai will have to explain why Google has been making controversial changes to Search[17] over the years that have mostly served to benefit Google at the expense of its competitors. Pichai can always point fingers at Amazon, as the retail giant has taken the lead in recent years when it comes to products searches. It also helps that YouTube, which is arguably one of the world's largest search engines, operates as an independently-led subsidiary of Google. However, regulators can still attack Pichai on Google and Apple's billion-dollar search agreement[18], which leaves competitor search services in the dust when it comes to over one billion users who buy the latter company's high-end devices.Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is also expected to get grilled on issues relating to the company's many past acquisitions[19], including WhatsApp and Instagram. A case can be made that Facebook owns not one, but three of the largest social platforms out there, when it could have owned just one -- the others it acquired before they could challenge its market position.Then there's the acquisition of VPN provider Onavo[20], which was reportedly used to collect data on users and inform on which online services to purchase[21] or clone[22]. Last year, court filings revealed[23] that Facebook had been leveraging its data policies to thwart potential rivals, as confirmed through recordings of internal communications that were presented in court.Facebook also operates a large advertising business that may be too big and too permissive with controversial topics. Zuckerberg will likely have to explain why a large ad boycott[24] by several companies and civil rights groups has done little to hurt the company's bottom line.Ultimately, the hearing won't reveal any surprising facts about these companies and will likely feature some theatrics, as is often the case with antitrust hearings. Still, it will be interesting to see how regulators intend to make their case -- after all, these companies compete more or less in the same markets.*{padding:0;margin:0;overflow:hidden}html,body{height:100%}img,span{position:absolute;width:100%;top:0;bottom:0;margin:auto}span{height:1.5em;text-align:center;font:48px/1.5

The hearing is not meant to seek punitive action against the four tech companies, but it should serve as the basis for an updated legislation that could prevent further abuse of market power from the dominant forces in the tech industry.</p><p><br/>Lawmakers had already acquired 1.3 million documents from the tech giants and conducted several interviews and public hearings, meaning they should be well prepared with the right line of questioning. Specifically, the bipartisan antitrust panel wants to find out if Big Tech has grown too big and whether this has allowed a relatively small number of platforms to dominate their respective markets by working around current competition law.<br/>Update: The CEO's opening statements have been posted on the House Judiciary Committee's site.<br/>A quick excerpt from Apple CEO Tim Cook's statement reads \"After beginning with 500 apps, today the App Store hosts more than 1.7 million.. .if Apple is a gatekeeper, what we have done is open the gate wider. We want to get every app we can on the Store, not keep them off.\" Google's Sundar Pichai: \"free services like Search, Gmail, Maps, and Photos provide thousands of dollars a year in value to the average American.\"<br/>Meanwhile part of Mark Zuckerberg's opening statement reads \"the American way, by starting out with nothing and providing products that people find valuable ... I believe it's important to maintain the core values of openness and fairness that have made America's digital economy a force for empowerment and opportunity here and around the world.\"<br/>Jeff Bezos says \"We should scrutinize all large institutions, whether they're companies, government agencies, or non-profits. Our responsibility is to make sure we pass such scrutiny with flying colors.\"<br/>In a joint statement, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler and Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline explained that \"given the central role these corporations play in the lives of the American people, it is critical that their CEOs are forthcoming. As we have said from the start, their testimony is essential for us to complete this investigation.\"<br/>Some speculate the biggest target of the hearing will be Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who is now the world's richest man. Bezos will have to explain to antitrust regulators how his company's mission \"to continually raise the bar of the consumer experience\" relates to practices of predatory pricing, burying competitors in search queries, and abusing third-party seller data to create its own products.<br/>For some of the members of the Judiciary Committee, earlier testimony with respect to how Amazon manages its marketplace may have been \"misleading, criminally false or perjurious.\" Bezos will likely bring into attention an Amazon-commissioned study that showed how small businesses have actually seen \"rapid sales and hiring growth\" as a result of joining the retail giant's online marketplace, with the majority of these companies using Amazon as an online sales channel.<br/>Apple's Tim Cook almost managed to avoid antitrust scrutiny by forging strong relationships with White House officials and supporting president Trump's \"Made in America\" initiative with the Mac Pro line. He has also been very vocal about large social platforms that tend to amass user data and profit from it, which is part of Apple's strong stance on user privacy.<br/>\u00a0<br/>However, as the App Store has grown into a large business that accounts for $519 billion in consumer spend every year, many have brought into question the company's tight control over it. Specifically, the company has been accused of \"Sherlocking\" functionality from certain apps and rendering them obsolete. Some companies feel they're being coerced into paying 15 to 30 percent of their revenue made from digital goods and services that are sold through the App Store.<br/>Last week, an Apple-commissioned study defended the practice, noting that most app stores charge the same 30 percent commission rate. It also pointed fingers at other marketplaces where retailers and travel booking services take an even higher cut on the revenues made through them. The study also mentions how most app stores and marketplaces require users to go through the platform owner's payment mechanism and actively police other behaviors like redirecting to an outside service.<br/>Google is a different beast that holds dominant positions in search, mobile services, advertising, and online video. The company has made a number of acquisitions and mergers including DoubleClick, AdMob, YouTube, and Android -- all of which have allowed it to amass the data of billions of consumers and potentially guided its overall strategy over the years through things like Android Lockbox.<br/>Moreover, CEO Sundar Pichai will have to explain why Google has been making controversial changes to Search over the years that have mostly served to benefit Google at the expense of its competitors. Pichai can always point fingers at Amazon, as the retail giant has taken the lead in recent years when it comes to products searches.<br/>It also helps that YouTube, which is arguably one of the world's largest search engines, operates as an independently-led subsidiary of Google. However, regulators can still attack Pichai on Google and Apple's billion-dollar search agreement, which leaves competitor search services in the dust when it comes to over one billion users who buy the latter company's high-end devices.<br/>Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is also expected to get grilled on issues relating to the company's many past acquisitions, including WhatsApp and Instagram. A case can be made that Facebook owns not one, but three of the largest social platforms out there, when it could have owned just one -- the others it acquired before they could challenge its market position.<br/>Then there's the acquisition of VPN provider Onavo, which was reportedly used to collect data on users and inform on which online services to purchase or clone. Last year, court filings revealed that Facebook had been leveraging its data policies to thwart potential rivals, as confirmed through recordings of internal communications that were presented in court.<br/>Facebook also operates a large advertising business that may be too big and too permissive with controversial topics. Zuckerberg will likely have to explain why a large ad boycott by several companies and civil rights groups has done little to hurt the company's bottom line.<br/>Ultimately, the hearing won't reveal any surprising facts about these companies and will likely feature some theatrics, as is often the case with antitrust hearings. Still, it will be interesting to see how regulators intend to make their case -- after all, these companies compete more or less in the same markets.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1274453</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-TKP1-JBYT-H2F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1151\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Authorities there have also taken aim at Amazon and Apple recently.</p><p>Adweek will be devoting a day to privacy and data regulation during NexTech 2020, a four-day summit beginning July 27. Register now for this complimentary virtual event.</p><p>Although these investigations will examine the breadth of the respective players\u2019 platforms within the digital ecosystem, their collective dominance of the $135 billion U.S. digital advertising market is likely to be a key area of focus.</p><p>For instance, news of the July 27 testimony follows weeks of speculation that the Justice Department and multiple state attorneys general are probing Alphabet-owned Google\u2019s dominance of this sector, with some expecting lawsuits within months, if not weeks.</p><p>A recent eMarketer report forecast that Google, Facebook and Amazon would collectively account for 62.3% of digital ad spend this year, with the latter two eroding the Alphabet-owned company\u2019s market lead:</p><p>Apple, which does not break out advertising revenue in its earnings reports, is a comparative minnow in the ad game compared to other members of the quartet. However, its influence in the digital media landscape was underlined recently with the privacy overhaul to its upcoming iOS 14 update prompting fear that it could decimate the $45 billion in-app mobile ad market.</p><p>The privacy updates Apple unveiled as part of iOS 14 prompted several EU-based trade bodies, including the IAB Europe and IAB Tech Lab, to co-author an open letter to Apple\u2019s Cook last week.</p><p>In it, they implore him to make the iOS 14 updates, which require consent\u00a0from iPhone users in order for third parties to access their data on a per-app basis, more compatible with the trade bodies\u2019 guidelines for complying with privacy laws such as GDPR.</p><p>\u201cApple\u2019s initiative raises competition issues, especially for industry stakeholders specialized in mobile app promotion and measurement,\u201d reads the letter. \u201cThe ability for these companies to conduct businesses and provide their services could be severely restricted.\u201d</p><p>In recent weeks, two academics (and Department of Justice veterans) have co-authored papers outlining the case against both Facebook and Google: Fiona Scott Morton, professor of economics at the Yale University School of Management; and David Dinielli, senior adviser on beneficial technology at philanthropic investment firm Omidyar Network.</p><p>Both papers are based on the findings gathered by the U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority, and outline possible roadmaps for an antitrust case against the two companies, commonly referred to as \u201cthe duopoly\u201d among media buyers.</p><p>\u201cEvidence provided by the U.K. authority reveals a great deal about the lack of competition in ad tech and the anticompetitive behavior of Google in recent years,\u201d alleged Scott Morton in her assessment of Google. \u201cIt adds up to a very concerning situation that warrants close scrutiny on this side of the Atlantic Ocean by U.S. antitrust authorities.\u201d</p><p>These arguments build on those of fellow noted scholars Dina Srinivasan of Yale University\u2019s Thurman Arnold Project, which brings together academics to collaborate on research about competition and antitrust enforcement. In a December 2019 paper, she alleged that Google\u2019s dominance of programmatic media trading is based on principles and structures prohibited in other industry verticals where commodities are traded electronically.</p><p>\u201cIn advertising, a single company, Alphabet (\u2018Google\u2019), simultaneously operates the leading trading venue, as well as the leading intermediaries that buyers and sellers go through to trade,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBecause ads now trade on electronic trading venues too, should we borrow these three competition principles to protect the integrity of advertising?\u201d</p><p>Google has tried to meet these criticisms head-on recently by publishing blog posts outlining how it shares ad-tech fees with publishers. This was in addition to Google\u2019s formal announcement of a content licensing program \u201cto support the news industry\u201d in the same week, which some predict will be a rival to Apple News+.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1174965</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609H-MGV1-DYRK-H0GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 7, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Antitrust probes have been begun at both the state and federal levels.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Given the central role these companies play in the lives of everyday Americans, it is critical that their CEOs are forthcoming, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) said in a joint statement.</p><p>As we have said from the start, their testimony is essential for us to complete this investigation, they said in the July 6 release.</p><p>The witnesses called are con- firmed to be Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Sundar Pichai of Google, and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, according to the committee. The hearing is the sixth such session.</p><p>According to Reuters, lawmakers are expected to release a report on the findings of their antitrust investigation in the coming weeks. Cicilline didn't respond to an emailed request for comment from The Epoch Times.</p><p>The CEOs would be answering questions \"about their compliance with antitrust laws, with their anticompetitive practices, and with a real understanding as to how our existing laws tend to benefit, protect, and indemnify big tech,\" Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said in a statement.</p><p>Gaetz added that it's obvious companies such as Apple and Amazon are censoring Americans, noting practices by those companies to benefit the Chinese Communist Party at the expense of Americans.</p><p>\"There are circumstances and experiences that we have uncovered in our investigation where people submit their products and then Amazon finds a way to steal the IP [intellectual property], replicate the tech, and then provide the product at a lower cost, harming the innovator who is often American and benefiting a manufacturer willing to cheat, often in China,\" he said.</p><p>Last year, House lawmakers demanded all four of the firms turn over a wide range of documents, including sensitive internal emails from the companies' top executives, in what was the biggest development of the probes at the time.</p><p>Leaders of the House Judiciary Committee and its subcommittee on antitrust also sought detailed financial information and other company records. They also requested internal emails over the past decade from the CEOs of the companies, as well as other top executives, about acquisitions.</p><p>Doug Melamed, a law professor at Stanford University with expertise in antitrust law and intellectual property, said theoretically the probes could result in a wide range of outcomes, \"from new legislation to no litigation at all.</p><p>\"As a practical matter, I think the most likely outcomes are somewhere in the middle, some kind of litigation that will probably result in a settlement with restrictions on the conduct of one or more of the platforms,\" Melamed told The Epoch Times previously.</p><p>At the same time, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FCC) are investigating Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon for potential violations of antitrust law.</p><p>A partnership of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, also is reviewing Google's practices, while a separate bipartisan coalition of attorneys general in eight states is looking at possible antitrust concerns with Facebook.</p><p>The Justice Department has since hired outside litigators as part of its examinations, an indication the department is preparing an antitrust suit against Google, according to a recent report from Fox Business.</p><p>In addition to the antitrust probes, President Donald Trump in May signed an executive order directing federal agencies to develop regulations under an existing law that protects social media companies from being sued for user-generated content. The regulations aim to protect users from unfair or deceptive content restriction practices employed by these companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2424920115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-NCR1-DYR7-83T1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 745</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 9, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English UK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Feature</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
