Mandatory masks everywhere, the airport almost completely empty. The streets quieter, much more so than London. I've come during a monster week for tech though. </p><p>Many of the stories based on theme that are likely to dominate tech journalism in the years to come. On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations, after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I'll be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US. It was also a week that Twitter launched its election hub, to promote accurate information and resources for voters. How companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook regulate their platforms in the run-up to the elections are likely to have a massive impact on that November poll, and it is something that Click will be doing more on. It also happened to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change's impact on the environment. Going forward, could big tech do more by not just being green companies themselves, but by leading the way in innovation, perhaps even reversing some of the damage that humans have done to our planet? At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks But it did centre its new iteration of products around healthcare, including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about anti-trust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are simply too big and whether they should be broken up, remains a central challenge to governments around the world. The tech stories that we have seen this week perhaps underpin the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco, and he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done! What a time to move to San Francisco though! It's a really strange time for two reasons. I mean, obviously, you've seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly, and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and, you know, review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US, and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that - so have Amazon, so have Apple too - but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story of the next 5-6 weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make, you know, when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and, indeed, the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NW-359e7fb983e54dcb923d3471e8073fc8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WR-N5G1-JBH6-C4GW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400429</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about anti-trust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are simply too big and whether they should be broken up, remains a central challenge to governments around the world. The tech stories that we have seen this week perhaps underpin the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco, and he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done! What a time to move to San Francisco though! It's a really strange time for two reasons. I mean, obviously, you've seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly, and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and, you know, review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US, and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that - so have Amazon, so have Apple too - but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story of the next 5-6 weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make, you know, when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and, indeed, the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EM-4cd0dd1e688a40c1a645d32fea1559f9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WR-N5G1-JBH6-C4NS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400421</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

I've been to San Francisco a few times before, but this was San Francisco only different. Mandatory masks everywhere, the airport almost completely empty. The streets quieter, much more so than London. </p><p>I've come during a monster week for tech though. Many of the stories based on theme that are likely to dominate tech journalism in the years to come. On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations, after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I'll be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US. It was also a week that Twitter launched its election hub, to promote accurate information and resources for voters. How companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook regulate their platforms in the run-up to the elections are likely to have a massive impact on that November poll, and it is something that Click will be doing more on. It also happened to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change's impact on the environment. Going forward, could big tech do more by not just being green companies themselves, but by leading the way in innovation, perhaps even reversing some of the damage that humans have done to our planet? At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks But it did centre its new iteration of products around healthcare, including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood.

Mandatory masks everywhere, the airport almost completely empty. The streets quieter, much more so than London. I've come during a monster week for tech though. </p><p>Many of the stories based on theme that are likely to dominate tech journalism in the years to come. On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations, after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I'll be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US. It was also a week that Twitter launched its election hub, to promote accurate information and resources for voters. How companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook regulate their platforms in the run-up to the elections are likely to have a massive impact on that November poll, and it is something that Click will be doing more on. It also happened to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change's impact on the environment. Going forward, could big tech do more by not just being green companies themselves, but by leading the way in innovation, perhaps even reversing some of the damage that humans have done to our planet? At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks But it did centre its new iteration of products around healthcare, including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about anti-trust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are simply too big and whether they should be broken up, remains a central challenge to governments around the world. The tech stories that we have seen this week perhaps underpin the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco, and he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done! What a time to move to San Francisco though! It's a really strange time for two reasons. I mean, obviously, you've seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly, and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and, you know, review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US, and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that - so have Amazon, so have Apple too - but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story of the next 5-6 weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make, you know, when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and, indeed, the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YL-f63cc770f5b94c8982d01ce8201dab94</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WR-N5G1-JBH6-C4R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400425</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

Mandatory masks everywhere, the airport almost completely empty. The streets quieter, much more so than London. I've come during a monster week for tech though. </p><p>Many of the stories based on theme that are likely to dominate tech journalism in the years to come. On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations, after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I'll be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US. It was also a week that Twitter launched its election hub, to promote accurate information and resources for voters. How companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook regulate their platforms in the run-up to the elections are likely to have a massive impact on that November poll, and it is something that Click will be doing more on. It also happened to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change's impact on the environment. Going forward, could big tech do more by not just being green companies themselves, but by leading the way in innovation, perhaps even reversing some of the damage that humans have done to our planet? At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks But it did centre its new iteration of products around healthcare, including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about anti-trust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are simply too big and whether they should be broken up, remains a central challenge to governments around the world. The tech stories that we have seen this week perhaps underpin the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco, and he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done! What a time to move to San Francisco though! It's a really strange time for two reasons. I mean, obviously, you've seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly, and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and, you know, review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US, and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that - so have Amazon, so have Apple too - but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story of the next 5-6 weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make, you know, when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and, indeed, the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SE-686a19bb424d445dae89cb0bdc818e98</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WR-N5G1-JBH6-C4RR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about anti-trust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic?</p><p> Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are simply too big and whether they should be broken up, remains a central challenge to governments around the world. The tech stories that we have seen this week perhaps underpin the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco, and he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done! What a time to move to San Francisco though! It's a really strange time for two reasons. I mean, obviously, you've seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly, and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and, you know, review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US, and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that - so have Amazon, so have Apple too - but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story of the next 5-6 weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make, you know, when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and, indeed, the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down the rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log in to a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice, A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to. You are now ready to go further into Wonderland. And before the show, they can chat to it, flirt to it. It's been asked out on dates a couple times. And then, the second thing we do is, we've really pushed Zoom into sort of video game territory. So we have taken the tiles that everyone is used to in videoconferences, separated them out and then dropped them into a 3D games' engine. You can wave to all to the other members of the audience just before you Zoom down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. I think for us, we started experimenting really early on in lockdown. So two weeks into lockdown, we did a production</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EA-88a5d47fe5d249d5ba1b01be358687f9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WR-N5G1-JBH6-C4KH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about anti-trust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic?</p><p> Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are simply too big and whether they should be broken up, remains a central challenge to governments around the world. The tech stories that we have seen this week perhaps underpin the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco, and he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done! What a time to move to San Francisco though! It's a really strange time for two reasons. I mean, obviously, you've seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly, and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and, you know, review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US, and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that - so have Amazon, so have Apple too - but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story of the next 5-6 weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make, you know, when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and, indeed, the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down the rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log in to a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice, A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to. You are now ready to go further into Wonderland. And before the show, they can chat to it, flirt to it. It's been asked out on dates a couple times. And then, the second thing we do is, we've really pushed Zoom into sort of video game territory. So we have taken the tiles that everyone is used to in videoconferences, separated them out and then dropped them into a 3D games' engine. You can wave to all to the other members of the audience just before you Zoom down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. I think for us, we started experimenting really early on in lockdown. So two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of the Tempest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WE-a26af58663e2435881d07b9e27489c51</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WR-GNN1-DY08-31Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402026</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about anti-trust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic?</p><p> Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are simply too big and whether they should be broken up, remains a central challenge to governments around the world. The tech stories that we have seen this week perhaps underpin the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco, and he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done! What a time to move to San Francisco though! It's a really strange time for two reasons. I mean, obviously, you've seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly, and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and, you know, review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US, and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that - so have Amazon, so have Apple too - but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story of the next 5-6 weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make, you know, when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and, indeed, the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down the rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log in to a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice, A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to. You are now ready to go further into Wonderland. And before the show, they can chat to it, flirt to it. It's been asked out on dates a couple times. And then, the second thing we do is, we've really pushed Zoom into sort of video game territory. So we have taken the tiles that everyone is used to in videoconferences, separated them out and then dropped them into a 3D games' engine. You can wave to all to the other members of the audience just before you Zoom down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. I think for us, we started experimenting really early on in lockdown. So two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of the Tempest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SC-3d5252390028424d99b794b23ffb00e2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WR-N5G1-JBH6-C4X0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400433</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about anti-trust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic?</p><p> Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are simply too big and whether they should be broken up, remains a central challenge to governments around the world. The tech stories that we have seen this week perhaps underpin the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco, and he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done! What a time to move to San Francisco though! It's a really strange time for two reasons. I mean, obviously, you've seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly, and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and, you know, review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US, and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that - so have Amazon, so have Apple too - but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story of the next 5-6 weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make, you know, when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and, indeed, the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down the rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log in to a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice, A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to. You are now ready to go further into Wonderland. And before the show, they can chat to it, flirt to it. It's been asked out on dates a couple times. And then, the second thing we do is, we've really pushed Zoom into sort of video game territory. So we have taken the tiles that everyone is used to in videoconferences, separated them out and then dropped them into a 3D games' engine. You can wave to all to the other members of the audience just before you Zoom down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. I think for us, we started experimenting really early on in lockdown. So two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of the Tempest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WM-5fb4eb3e288345d086a8bfe109177aab</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WR-N5G1-JBH6-C4W0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402028</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

It is Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly, and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and, you know, review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US, and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that - so have Amazon, so have Apple too - but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story of the next 5-6 weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make, you know, when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and, indeed, the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down the rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log in to a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice, A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to. You are now ready to go further into Wonderland. And before the show, they can chat to it, flirt to it.

So we have taken the tiles that everyone is used to in videoconferences, separated them out and then dropped them into a 3D games' engine. You can wave to all to the other members of the audience just before you Zoom down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. I think for us, we started experimenting really early on in lockdown. So two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of the Tempest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NE-126f688cba864ef28e52c4fc80508890</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WR-GNN1-DY08-320D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about anti-trust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic?</p><p> Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are simply too big and whether they should be broken up, remains a central challenge to governments around the world. The tech stories that we have seen this week perhaps underpin the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco, and he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done! What a time to move to San Francisco though! It's a really strange time for two reasons. I mean, obviously, you've seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly, and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and, you know, review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US, and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that - so have Amazon, so have Apple too - but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story of the next 5-6 weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make, you know, when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and, indeed, the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down the rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log in to a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice, A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to. You are now ready to go further into Wonderland. And before the show, they can chat to it, flirt to it. It's been asked out on dates a couple times. And then, the second thing we do is, we've really pushed Zoom into sort of video game territory. So we have taken the tiles that everyone is used to in videoconferences, separated them out and then dropped them into a 3D games' engine. You can wave to all to the other members of the audience just before you Zoom down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. I think for us, we started experimenting really early on in lockdown.

Going forward, could dig tech do more by not just being green companies themselves but by leading the way in innovation and perhaps even reversing some of the damage humans have done to the planet. In Apple's launch on Tuesday, the couple didn't release an iPhone or a new range of matter walks but did talk about its new healthcare products, including a new happy couple watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech response to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. </p><p>And finally this week, Google was grilled by Senators asking questions about anti-trust, or in other words, companies like Google not political. Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are to be and should be broken up, a central challenges to governments around the world. The tax stories we have seen this week underpin perhaps the fundamental question of our age, how can we harness the progress humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco. And he is online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done, what a time to move to San Francisco though. Is a really strange time for two reasons. Obviously, you have seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. It's not just California but pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, Washington, then of course you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly and California is no exception. It is really noticeable. How do you feel about being there because yellow if you look at all of the conferences are coming up literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and actually review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know the different people feel differently about climate change within the US and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral or I think, Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think that the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the welds might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? At the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon and Apple. It really is a limb in the last year that has happened. Would also looking forward to covering? The big tech story of the next few weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You are already seeing all sorts of this information and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google who owns YouTube are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. We're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and there stop you know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and indeed the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And at least perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March and until actors can tread the boards again, technology seeing whether it can fill the void. But cannot really provide the excitement of a live performance? Mark has disappeared down a rabbit hole to find out. We are late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, or we have to do is look into a video chat. Alice, a virtual theme park is actually an immersive theatre show which due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It is the result of a collaboration between theatre companies, Creation, big television, and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire cat that the audience talks to. You are now ready to go further into wonderland. And before the show, they can add to it, fled to it.

It also happened to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change was make impact on the environment. Going forward, could dig tech do more by not just being green companies themselves but by leading the way in innovation and perhaps even reversing some of the damage humans have done to the planet. In Apple's launch on Tuesday, the couple didn't release an iPhone or a new range of matter walks but did talk about its new healthcare products, including a new happy couple watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. </p><p>How the world of tech response to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by Senators asking questions about anti-trust, or in other words, companies like Google not political. Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are to be and should be broken up, a central challenges to governments around the world. The tax stories we have seen this week underpin perhaps the fundamental question of our age, how can we harness the progress humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco. And he is online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done, what a time to move to San Francisco though. Is a really strange time for two reasons. Obviously, you have seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. It's not just California but pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, Washington, then of course you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly and California is no exception. It is really noticeable. How do you feel about being there because yellow if you look at all of the conferences are coming up literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and actually review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know the different people feel differently about climate change within the US and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral or I think, Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think that the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the welds might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? At the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon and Apple. It really is a limb in the last year that has happened. Would also looking forward to covering? The big tech story of the next few weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You are already seeing all sorts of this information and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google who owns YouTube are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. We're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and there stop you know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and indeed the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And at least perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March and until actors can tread the boards again, technology seeing whether it can fill the void. But cannot really provide the excitement of a live performance? Mark has disappeared down a rabbit hole to find out. We are late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, or we have to do is look into a video chat. Alice, a virtual theme park is actually an immersive theatre show which due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It is the result of a collaboration between theatre companies, Creation, big television, and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI.

Going forward, could dig tech do more by not just being green companies themselves but by leading the way in innovation and perhaps even reversing some of the damage humans have done to the planet. In Apple's launch on Tuesday, the couple didn't release an iPhone or a new range of matter walks but did talk about its new healthcare products, including a new happy couple watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech response to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. </p><p>And finally this week, Google was grilled by Senators asking questions about anti-trust, or in other words, companies like Google not political. Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are to be and should be broken up, a central challenges to governments around the world. The tax stories we have seen this week underpin perhaps the fundamental question of our age, how can we harness the progress humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco. And he is online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done, what a time to move to San Francisco though. Is a really strange time for two reasons. Obviously, you have seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. It's not just California but pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, Washington, then of course you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly and California is no exception. It is really noticeable. How do you feel about being there because yellow if you look at all of the conferences are coming up literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and actually review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know the different people feel differently about climate change within the US and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral or I think, Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think that the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the welds might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? At the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon and Apple. It really is a limb in the last year that has happened. Would also looking forward to covering? The big tech story of the next few weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You are already seeing all sorts of this information and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google who owns YouTube are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. We're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and there stop you know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and indeed the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And at least perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March and until actors can tread the boards again, technology seeing whether it can fill the void. But cannot really provide the excitement of a live performance? Mark has disappeared down a rabbit hole to find out. We are late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, or we have to do is look into a video chat. Alice, a virtual theme park is actually an immersive theatre show which due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It is the result of a collaboration between theatre companies, Creation, big television, and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire cat that the audience talks to. You are now ready to go further into wonderland. And before the show, they can add to it, fled to it. It is been asked out on data couple times.

Going forward, could dig tech do more by not just being green companies themselves but by leading the way in innovation and perhaps even reversing some of the damage humans have done to the planet. In Apple's launch on Tuesday, the couple didn't release an iPhone or a new range of matter walks but did talk about its new healthcare products, including a new happy couple watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech response to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. </p><p>And finally this week, Google was grilled by Senators asking questions about anti-trust, or in other words, companies like Google not political. Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are to be and should be broken up, a central challenges to governments around the world. The tax stories we have seen this week underpin perhaps the fundamental question of our age, how can we harness the progress humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco. And he is online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done, what a time to move to San Francisco though. Is a really strange time for two reasons. Obviously, you have seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. It's not just California but pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, Washington, then of course you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly and California is no exception. It is really noticeable. How do you feel about being there because yellow if you look at all of the conferences are coming up literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and actually review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know the different people feel differently about climate change within the US and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral or I think, Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think that the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the welds might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? At the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon and Apple. It really is a limb in the last year that has happened. Would also looking forward to covering? The big tech story of the next few weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You are already seeing all sorts of this information and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google who owns YouTube are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. We're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and there stop you know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and indeed the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And at least perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March and until actors can tread the boards again, technology seeing whether it can fill the void. But cannot really provide the excitement of a live performance? Mark has disappeared down a rabbit hole to find out. We are late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, or we have to do is look into a video chat. Alice, a virtual theme park is actually an immersive theatre show which due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It is the result of a collaboration between theatre companies, Creation, big television, and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire cat that the audience talks to. You are now ready to go further into wonderland. And before the show, they can add to it, fled to it. It is been asked out on data couple times.

Going forward, could dig tech do more by not just being green companies themselves but by leading the way in innovation and perhaps even reversing some of the damage humans have done to the planet. In Apple's launch on Tuesday, the couple didn't release an iPhone or a new range of matter walks but did talk about its new healthcare products, including a new happy couple watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech response to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. </p><p>And finally this week, Google was grilled by Senators asking questions about anti-trust, or in other words, companies like Google not political. Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are to be and should be broken up, a central challenges to governments around the world. The tax stories we have seen this week underpin perhaps the fundamental question of our age, how can we harness the progress humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco. And he is online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done, what a time to move to San Francisco though. Is a really strange time for two reasons. Obviously, you have seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. It's not just California but pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, Washington, then of course you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly and California is no exception. It is really noticeable. How do you feel about being there because yellow if you look at all of the conferences are coming up literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and actually review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know the different people feel differently about climate change within the US and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral or I think, Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think that the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the welds might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? At the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon and Apple. It really is a limb in the last year that has happened. Would also looking forward to covering? The big tech story of the next few weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You are already seeing all sorts of this information and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google who owns YouTube are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. We're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and there stop you know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and indeed the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And at least perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March and until actors can tread the boards again, technology seeing whether it can fill the void. But cannot really provide the excitement of a live performance? Mark has disappeared down a rabbit hole to find out. We are late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, or we have to do is look into a video chat. Alice, a virtual theme park is actually an immersive theatre show which due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It is the result of a collaboration between theatre companies, Creation, big television, and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire cat that the audience talks to. You are now ready to go further into wonderland. And before the show, they can add to it, fled to it. It is been asked out on data couple times.

It is been asked out on data couple times. The second thing we do is, we have really pushed Zoom into sort of videogame territory. We have taken the files that everyone is used to in videoconferences, separated them out and dropped them into a 3D games engine. You can waive, talk to the other members of the audience just before you Zoom down the rabbit hole into wonderland. I think for us, we started experimenting really early into lockdown. Two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of the Campus. We discover that it's really exciting when it really comes to life is when the audience alive and can be seen live to. It is performers and audience alive and you can see each other. A lot of our shows before lockdown were insights to fit locations, moving around, giving the audiences, small groups, little challenges to do. It is as much live Fillmore gaming and I think what the pandemic has created is this sort of opportunity put real people into a digital world is. Few industries have escaped the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Theatre has been badly hit. What theatre is about is about to physically being with other people. It is about being shoulder to shoulder with somebody. It is about having the freedom to laugh, the freedom to cry. You know, theatre is fundamental to shared experience. And the phrase we keep hearing is the theatre industry has been decimated, but as the buzz phrase in the industry at the moment. And you know what, it is right. It is calculated that theatre is worth... In annual ticket revenue. UK government has allowed indoor performances with social distancing to start again.

At the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon and Apple. It really is a limb in the last year that has happened. Would also looking forward to covering? The big tech story of the next few weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections.

And at least perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March and until actors can tread the boards again, technology seeing whether it can fill the void. But cannot really provide the excitement of a live performance? Mark has disappeared down a rabbit hole to find out. We are late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, or we have to do is look into a video chat. Alice, a virtual theme park is actually an immersive theatre show which due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It is the result of a collaboration between theatre companies, Creation, big television, and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire cat that the audience talks to. You are now ready to go further into wonderland. And before the show, they can add to it, fled to it. It is been asked out on data couple times. The second thing we do is, we have really pushed Zoom into sort of videogame territory. We have taken the files that everyone is used to in videoconferences, separated them out and dropped them into a 3D games engine. You can waive, talk to the other members of the audience just before you Zoom down the rabbit hole into wonderland. I think for us, we started experimenting really early into lockdown. Two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of the Campus. We discover that it's really exciting when it really comes to life is when the audience alive and can be seen live to. It is performers and audience alive and you can see each other. A lot of our shows before lockdown were insights to fit locations, moving around, giving the audiences, small groups, little challenges to do. It is as much live Fillmore gaming and I think what the pandemic has created is this sort of opportunity put real people into a digital world is. Few industries have escaped the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Theatre has been badly hit. What theatre is about is about to physically being with other people. It is about being shoulder to shoulder with somebody. It is about having the freedom to laugh, the freedom to cry. You know, theatre is fundamental to shared experience. And the phrase we keep hearing is the theatre industry has been decimated, but as the buzz phrase in the industry at the moment. And you know what, it is right. It is calculated that theatre is worth... In annual ticket revenue.

We're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and there stop you know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and indeed the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And at least perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March and until actors can tread the boards again, technology seeing whether it can fill the void. But cannot really provide the excitement of a live performance? Mark has disappeared down a rabbit hole to find out. We are late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, or we have to do is look into a video chat. Alice, a virtual theme park is actually an immersive theatre show which due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It is the result of a collaboration between theatre companies, Creation, big television, and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire cat that the audience talks to. You are now ready to go further into wonderland. And before the show, they can add to it, fled to it. It is been asked out on data couple times. The second thing we do is, we have really pushed Zoom into sort of videogame territory. We have taken the files that everyone is used to in videoconferences, separated them out and dropped them into a 3D games engine. You can waive, talk to the other members of the audience just before you Zoom down the rabbit hole into wonderland. I think for us, we started experimenting really early into lockdown. Two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of the Campus. We discover that it's really exciting when it really comes to life is when the audience alive and can be seen live to. It is performers and audience alive and you can see each other. A lot of our shows before lockdown were insights to fit locations, moving around, giving the audiences, small groups, little challenges to do. It is as much live Fillmore gaming and I think what the pandemic has created is this sort of opportunity put real people into a digital world is. Few industries have escaped the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Theatre has been badly hit. What theatre is about is about to physically being with other people. It is about being shoulder to shoulder with somebody. It is about having the freedom to laugh, the freedom to cry. You know, theatre is fundamental to shared experience. And the phrase we keep hearing is the theatre industry has been decimated, but as the buzz phrase in the industry at the moment. And you know what, it is right. It is calculated that theatre is worth... In annual ticket revenue. UK government has allowed indoor performances with social distancing to start again. But to make money, theatres often rely on packed houses which aren't possible</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SO-dc32435235814a7eb0043996cc447278</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W3-RM51-DY08-3530-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"789\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the welds might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change?

It is really noticeable. How do you feel about being there because yellow if you look at all of the conferences are coming up literally all of them are virtual.

I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the welds might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? At the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon and Apple. It really is a limb in the last year that has happened. Would also looking forward to covering? The big tech story of the next few weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You are already seeing all sorts of this information and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google who owns YouTube are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. We're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and there stop you know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and indeed the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And at least perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March and until actors can tread the boards again, technology seeing whether it can fill the void. But cannot really provide the excitement of a live performance? Mark has disappeared down a rabbit hole to find out. We are late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, or we have to do is look into a video chat. Alice, a virtual theme park is actually an immersive theatre show which due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It is the result of a collaboration between theatre companies, Creation, big television, and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire cat that the audience talks to. You are now ready to go further into wonderland. And before the show, they can add to it, fled to it. It is been asked out on data couple times. The second thing we do is, we have really pushed Zoom into sort of videogame territory. We have taken the files that everyone is used to in videoconferences, separated them out and dropped them into a 3D games engine. You can waive, talk to the other members of the audience just before you Zoom down the rabbit hole into wonderland. I think for us, we started experimenting really early into lockdown. Two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of the Campus. We discover that it's really exciting when it really comes to life is when the audience alive and can be seen live to. It is performers and audience alive and you can see each other. A lot of our shows before lockdown were insights to fit locations, moving around, giving the audiences, small groups, little challenges to do. It is as much live Fillmore gaming and I think what the pandemic has created is this sort of opportunity put real people into a digital world is. Few industries have escaped the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Theatre has been badly hit. What theatre is about is about to physically being with other people. It is about being shoulder to shoulder with somebody. It is about having the freedom to laugh, the freedom to cry. You know, theatre is fundamental to shared experience. And the phrase we keep hearing is the theatre industry has been decimated, but as the buzz phrase in the industry at the moment. And you know what, it is right.

At the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon and Apple. It really is a limb in the last year that has happened. Would also looking forward to covering? The big tech story of the next few weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You are already seeing all sorts of this information and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google who owns YouTube are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. We're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and there stop you know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and indeed the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And at least perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March and until actors can tread the boards again, technology seeing whether it can fill the void. But cannot really provide the excitement of a live performance? Mark has disappeared down a rabbit hole to find out. We are late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, or we have to do is look into a video chat. Alice, a virtual theme park is actually an immersive theatre show which due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It is the result of a collaboration between theatre companies, Creation, big television, and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire cat that the audience talks to. You are now ready to go further into wonderland. And before the show, they can add to it, fled to it. It is been asked out on data couple times. The second thing we do is, we have really pushed Zoom into sort of videogame territory. We have taken the files that everyone is used to in videoconferences, separated them out and dropped them into a 3D games engine. You can waive, talk to the other members of the audience just before you Zoom down the rabbit hole into wonderland. I think for us, we started experimenting really early into lockdown. Two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of the Campus. We discover that it's really exciting when it really comes to life is when the audience alive and can be seen live to. It is performers and audience alive and you can see each other. A lot of our shows before lockdown were insights to fit locations, moving around, giving the audiences, small groups, little challenges to do. It is as much live Fillmore gaming and I think what the pandemic has created is this sort of opportunity put real people into a digital world is. Few industries have escaped the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Theatre has been badly hit. What theatre is about is about to physically being with other people. It is about being shoulder to shoulder with somebody. It is about having the freedom to laugh, the freedom to cry. You know, theatre is fundamental to shared experience. And the phrase we keep hearing is the theatre industry has been decimated, but as the buzz phrase in the industry at the moment. And you know what, it is right. It is calculated that theatre is worth... In annual ticket revenue. UK government has allowed indoor performances with social distancing to start again. But to make money,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NW-bed5725ffd70433d82886e7cc32b3388</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W3-RM51-DY08-351S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400429</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

The big tech story of the next few weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You are already seeing all sorts of this information and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google who owns YouTube are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. We're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and there stop you know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and indeed the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And at least perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March and until actors can tread the boards again, technology seeing whether it can fill the void. But cannot really provide the excitement of a live performance? Mark has disappeared down a rabbit hole to find out. We are late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, or we have to do is look into a video chat. Alice, a virtual theme park is actually an immersive theatre show which due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It is the result of a collaboration between theatre companies, Creation, big television, and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire cat that the audience talks to. You are now ready to go further into wonderland. And before the show, they can add to it, fled to it. It is been asked out on data couple times. The second thing we do is, we have really pushed Zoom into sort of videogame territory. We have taken the files that everyone is used to in videoconferences, separated them out and dropped them into a 3D games engine. You can waive, talk to the other members of the audience just before you Zoom down the rabbit hole into wonderland. I think for us, we started experimenting really early into lockdown. Two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of the Campus. We discover that it's really exciting when it really comes to life is when the audience alive and can be seen live to. It is performers and audience alive and you can see each other. A lot of our shows before lockdown were insights to fit locations, moving around, giving the audiences, small groups, little challenges to do. It is as much live Fillmore gaming and I think what the pandemic has created is this sort of opportunity put real people into a digital world is. Few industries have escaped the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Theatre has been badly hit. What theatre is about is about to physically being with other people. It is about being shoulder to shoulder with somebody. It is about having the freedom to laugh, the freedom to cry. You know, theatre is fundamental to shared experience. And the phrase we keep hearing is the theatre industry has been decimated, but as the buzz phrase in the industry at the moment. And you know what, it is right. It is calculated that theatre is worth... In annual ticket revenue. UK government has allowed indoor performances with social distancing to start</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EA-acc51d97ac62466ba0ab534b12338dfb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W3-RM51-DY08-3521-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

The tariff is like an entrance fee for goods to get into a country. You have to pay just to get past the gate. So when the US imposes a 25% tariff on say, disk drives coming in from China, someone has to pay that tax on every disk drive. </p><p>So who pays? President Trump thinks who sells the disk drive pays the tax. Paid for mostly by China, by the way. Well, it is sometimes true that Chinese companies are selling the disk drive will lower the price is a little stop they do not want the US customers go elsewhere but it is whoever buys the disk drives and ships into America that pays. So it could be an American electronics retailer that sells them in stores, an American company like General Electric 's that uses them, or just your average American family business, run by Mr and Mrs Smith, that just need a lot of disk drives. Look, at some point, these American companies are going to have to pass on the higher costs to that customers. Walmart has already said it will raise prices because of the tariffs. We can make the product right here if we have to. According to President Trump that is exactly what tariffs are going to do, make American shoppers by made in USA instead of, say, made in China. Not so fast. A lot of these goods are just cheaper to make in China, producing them in America could cost more than the tariffs imposed. China has become the biggest customer for many US firms, like Boeing and Cadillac. What hurts China will eventually hurt the US... Sure, but, wait a minute, who is paying again? The head of global affairs at Facebook, Sir Nick Clegg, has said the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former UK deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the Brexit result using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of Internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you preferred the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best Internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EA-bc38650f8dac4b54b6497a6ef4cc5fdb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDP-XNB1-JBH6-C3M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"727\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. </p><p>Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Women's World Cup Round of 16 knock-out phase is drawing to a close. The United States and Sweden clinched their spots in the tournament's quarter finals, while later on Tuesday, Italy will play China and the NetherlandsJapan. The current World Champions edged past Spain 2-1. Megan Rapinoe converting an early penalty, gave the tournament favourites the lead in the first seven minutes. But Spain held their nerve and equalised two minutes later through Jennifer Hermoso. The US were awarded a second spot kick in the second half, sealing the win. Meanwhile, Sweden beat Canada in a hard-fought match in Paris. A 55-minute chipped effort by Stina Blackstenius the difference as they ended Canada's campaign 1-0. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects, like translocating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos, brought together here from three different zoos in preparation for their 6,000 kilometre journey. They are looking pretty content, munching on their breakfast. These are three of the five animals that are going to be taken to Rwanda for the reintroduction, from all over Europe. They represent the countries that all of these animals come from. From Denmark, the UK, and the Czech Republic. In the early hours of this morning, the flight they've been preparing for finally arrived at Kigali International Airport. Once unloaded, this most precious of cargo is transferred to trucks for the final stage of the journey. This is their final destination and their first footsteps onto African soil. The rhinos will stay in these specially-built areas for several months while the team checks they're settled, healthy and ready for life beyond the fences. You see these animals having arrived safely. How does that make you feel? Very, very happy and I feel that they are a survivor, they arrive in Rwanda safely. It shows me a future of 100 rhinos, so for me conservation is not just for the sake of conserving but I see it as a way of improving our life today and in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SO-2d2c3088fc6a42ada48ec5335c6b80d7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDP-XNB1-JBH6-C3H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. </p><p>Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Women's World Cup Round of 16 knock-out phase is drawing to a close. The United States and Sweden clinched their spots in the tournament's quarter finals, while later on Tuesday, Italy will play China and the NetherlandsJapan. The current World Champions edged past Spain 2-1. Megan Rapinoe converting an early penalty, gave the tournament favourites the lead in the first seven minutes. But Spain held their nerve and equalised two minutes later through Jennifer Hermoso. The US were awarded a second spot kick in the second half, sealing the win. Meanwhile, Sweden beat Canada in a hard-fought match in Paris. A 55-minute chipped effort by Stina Blackstenius the difference as they ended Canada's campaign 1-0. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects, like translocating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos, brought together here from three different zoos in preparation for their 6,000 kilometre journey. They are looking pretty content, munching on their breakfast. These are three of the five animals that are going to be taken to Rwanda for the reintroduction, from all over Europe. They represent the countries that all of these animals come from. From Denmark, the UK, and the Czech Republic. In the early hours of this morning, the flight they've been preparing for finally arrived at Kigali International Airport. Once unloaded, this most precious of cargo is transferred to trucks for the final stage of the journey. This is their final destination and their first footsteps onto African soil. The rhinos will stay in these specially-built areas for several months while the team checks they're settled, healthy and ready for life beyond the fences. You see these animals having arrived safely. How does that make you feel? Very, very happy and I feel that they are a survivor, they arrive in Rwanda safely. It shows me a future of 100 rhinos, so for me conservation is not just for the sake of conserving but I see it as a way of improving our life today and in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1OX-28e31d4aa21343469f184e0d904d7654</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1OX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDP-XNB1-JBH6-C3H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400431</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Women's World Cup Round of 16 knock-out phase is drawing to a close. The United States and Sweden clinched their spots in the tournament's quarter finals, while later on Tuesday, Italy will play China and the NetherlandsJapan. The current World Champions edged past Spain 2-1. Megan Rapinoe converting an early penalty, gave the tournament favourites the lead in the first seven minutes. But Spain held their nerve and equalised two minutes later through Jennifer Hermoso. The US were awarded a second spot kick in the second half, sealing the win. Meanwhile, Sweden beat Canada in a hard-fought match in Paris. A 55-minute chipped effort by Stina Blackstenius the difference as they ended Canada's campaign 1-0. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects, like translocating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos, brought together here from three different zoos in preparation for their 6,000 kilometre journey. They are looking pretty content, munching on their breakfast. These are three of the five animals that are going to be taken to Rwanda for the reintroduction, from all over Europe. They represent the countries that all of these animals come from. From Denmark, the UK, and the Czech Republic. In the early hours of this morning, the flight they've been preparing for finally arrived at Kigali International Airport. Once unloaded, this most precious of cargo is transferred to trucks for the final stage of the journey. This is their final destination and their first footsteps onto African soil. The rhinos will stay in these specially-built areas for several months while the team checks they're settled, healthy and ready for life beyond the fences. You see these animals having arrived safely. How does that make you feel? Very, very happy and I feel that they are a survivor, they arrive in Rwanda safely. It shows me a future of 100 rhinos, so for me conservation is not just for the sake of conserving but I see it as a way of improving our life today and in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EM-27f5c56c8c8e4ffd97a4f96c028278de</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDP-XNB1-JBH6-C3HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400421</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. </p><p>Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Women's World Cup Round of 16 knock-out phase is drawing to a close. The United States and Sweden clinched their spots in the tournament's quarter finals, while later on Tuesday, Italy will play China and the NetherlandsJapan. The current World Champions edged past Spain 2-1. Megan Rapinoe converting an early penalty, gave the tournament favourites the lead in the first seven minutes. But Spain held their nerve and equalised two minutes later through Jennifer Hermoso. The US were awarded a second spot kick in the second half, sealing the win. Meanwhile, Sweden beat Canada in a hard-fought match in Paris. A 55-minute chipped effort by Stina Blackstenius the difference as they ended Canada's campaign 1-0. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects, like translocating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos, brought together here from three different zoos in preparation for their 6,000 kilometre journey. They are looking pretty content, munching on their breakfast. These are three of the five animals that are going to be taken to Rwanda for the reintroduction, from all over Europe. They represent the countries that all of these animals come from. From Denmark, the UK, and the Czech Republic. In the early hours of this morning, the flight they've been preparing for finally arrived at Kigali International Airport. Once unloaded, this most precious of cargo is transferred to trucks for the final stage of the journey. This is their final destination and their first footsteps onto African soil. The rhinos will stay in these specially-built areas for several months while the team checks they're settled, healthy and ready for life beyond the fences. You see these animals having arrived safely. How does that make you feel? Very, very happy and I feel that they are a survivor, they arrive in Rwanda safely. It shows me a future of 100 rhinos, so for me conservation is not just for the sake of conserving but I see it as a way of improving our life today and in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1LO-51a2d7ad8a1d4a4899a664eb86f99a63</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1LO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDP-XNB1-JBH6-C3H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. </p><p>Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Women's World Cup Round of 16 knock-out phase is drawing to a close. The United States and Sweden clinched their spots in the tournament's quarter finals, while later on Tuesday, Italy will play China and the NetherlandsJapan. The current World Champions edged past Spain 2-1. Megan Rapinoe converting an early penalty, gave the tournament favourites the lead in the first seven minutes. But Spain held their nerve and equalised two minutes later through Jennifer Hermoso. The US were awarded a second spot kick in the second half, sealing the win. Meanwhile, Sweden beat Canada in a hard-fought match in Paris. A 55-minute chipped effort by Stina Blackstenius the difference as they ended Canada's campaign 1-0. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects, like translocating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos, brought together here from three different zoos in preparation for their 6,000 kilometre journey. They are looking pretty content, munching on their breakfast. These are three of the five animals that are going to be taken to Rwanda for the reintroduction, from all over Europe. They represent the countries that all of these animals come from. From Denmark, the UK, and the Czech Republic. In the early hours of this morning, the flight they've been preparing for finally arrived at Kigali International Airport. Once unloaded, this most precious of cargo is transferred to trucks for the final stage of the journey. This is their final destination and their first footsteps onto African soil. The rhinos will stay in these specially-built areas for several months while the team checks they're settled, healthy and ready for life beyond the fences. You see these animals having arrived safely. How does that make you feel? Very, very happy and I feel that they are a survivor, they arrive in Rwanda safely. It shows me a future of 100 rhinos, so for me conservation is not just for the sake of conserving but I see it as a way of improving our life today and in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WE-1b209d736b804f50ad7437042db89e2e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDP-XNB1-JBH6-C3HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402026</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Women's World Cup Round of 16 knock-out phase is drawing to a close. The United States and Sweden clinched their spots in the tournament's quarter finals, while later on Tuesday, Italy will play China and the NetherlandsJapan. The current World Champions edged past Spain 2-1. Megan Rapinoe converting an early penalty, gave the tournament favourites the lead in the first seven minutes. But Spain held their nerve and equalised two minutes later through Jennifer Hermoso. The US were awarded a second spot kick in the second half, sealing the win. Meanwhile, Sweden beat Canada in a hard-fought match in Paris. A 55-minute chipped effort by Stina Blackstenius the difference as they ended Canada's campaign 1-0. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects, like translocating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos, brought together here from three different zoos in preparation for their 6,000 kilometre journey. They are looking pretty content, munching on their breakfast. These are three of the five animals that are going to be taken to Rwanda for the reintroduction, from all over Europe. They represent the countries that all of these animals come from. From Denmark, the UK, and the Czech Republic. In the early hours of this morning, the flight they've been preparing for finally arrived at Kigali International Airport. Once unloaded, this most precious of cargo is transferred to trucks for the final stage of the journey. This is their final destination and their first footsteps onto African soil. The rhinos will stay in these specially-built areas for several months while the team checks they're settled, healthy and ready for life beyond the fences. You see these animals having arrived safely. How does that make you feel? Very, very happy and I feel that they are a survivor, they arrive in Rwanda safely. It shows me a future of 100 rhinos, so for me conservation is not just for the sake of conserving but I see it as a way of improving our life today and in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WA-890ad058b0784f0a87bb61ef9b7951af</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDP-XNB1-JBH6-C3H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402024</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. </p><p>Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Women's World Cup Round of 16 knock-out phase is drawing to a close. The United States and Sweden clinched their spots in the tournament's quarter finals, while later on Tuesday, Italy will play China and the NetherlandsJapan. The current World Champions edged past Spain 2-1. Megan Rapinoe converting an early penalty, gave the tournament favourites the lead in the first seven minutes. But Spain held their nerve and equalised two minutes later through Jennifer Hermoso. The US were awarded a second spot kick in the second half, sealing the win. Meanwhile, Sweden beat Canada in a hard-fought match in Paris. A 55-minute chipped effort by Stina Blackstenius the difference as they ended Canada's campaign 1-0. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects, like translocating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos, brought together here from three different zoos in preparation for their 6,000 kilometre journey. They are looking pretty content, munching on their breakfast. These are three of the five animals that are going to be taken to Rwanda for the reintroduction, from all over Europe. They represent the countries that all of these animals come from. From Denmark, the UK, and the Czech Republic. In the early hours of this morning, the flight they've been preparing for finally arrived at Kigali International Airport. Once unloaded, this most precious of cargo is transferred to trucks for the final stage of the journey. This is their final destination and their first footsteps onto African soil. The rhinos will stay in these specially-built areas for several months while the team checks they're settled, healthy and ready for life beyond the fences. You see these animals having arrived safely. How does that make you feel? Very, very happy and I feel that they are a survivor, they arrive in Rwanda safely. It shows me a future of 100 rhinos, so for me conservation is not just for the sake of conserving but I see it as a way of improving our life today and in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YN-8fa2ab2d6d1441c3acc924e36c3f451f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDP-XNB1-JBH6-C3HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402030</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. </p><p>Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Women's World Cup Round of 16 knock-out phase is drawing to a close. The United States and Sweden clinched their spots in the tournament's quarter finals, while later on Tuesday, Italy will play China and the NetherlandsJapan. The current World Champions edged past Spain 2-1. Megan Rapinoe converting an early penalty, gave the tournament favourites the lead in the first seven minutes. But Spain held their nerve and equalised two minutes later through Jennifer Hermoso. The US were awarded a second spot kick in the second half, sealing the win. Meanwhile, Sweden beat Canada in a hard-fought match in Paris. A 55-minute chipped effort by Stina Blackstenius the difference as they ended Canada's campaign 1-0. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects, like translocating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos, brought together here from three different zoos in preparation for their 6,000 kilometre journey. They are looking pretty content, munching on their breakfast. These are three of the five animals that are going to be taken to Rwanda for the reintroduction, from all over Europe. They represent the countries that all of these animals come from. From Denmark, the UK, and the Czech Republic. In the early hours of this morning, the flight they've been preparing for finally arrived at Kigali International Airport. Once unloaded, this most precious of cargo is transferred to trucks for the final stage of the journey. This is their final destination and their first footsteps onto African soil. The rhinos will stay in these specially-built areas for several months while the team checks they're settled, healthy and ready for life beyond the fences. You see these animals having arrived safely. How does that make you feel? Very, very happy and I feel that they are a survivor, they arrive in Rwanda safely. It shows me a future of 100 rhinos, so for me conservation is not just for the sake of conserving but I see it as a way of improving our life today and in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YL-e1c1d4a0939f40af99b0f894145f4729</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDP-XNB1-JBH6-C3HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400425</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Women's World Cup Round of 16 knock-out phase is drawing to a close. The United States and Sweden clinched their spots in the tournament's quarter finals, while later on Tuesday, Italy will play China and the NetherlandsJapan. The current World Champions edged past Spain 2-1. Megan Rapinoe converting an early penalty, gave the tournament favourites the lead in the first seven minutes. But Spain held their nerve and equalised two minutes later through Jennifer Hermoso. The US were awarded a second spot kick in the second half, sealing the win. Meanwhile, Sweden beat Canada in a hard-fought match in Paris. A 55-minute chipped effort by Stina Blackstenius the difference as they ended Canada's campaign 1-0. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. It's the largest ever transportation of the critically endangered animal from Europe. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects, like translocating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos, brought together here from three different zoos in preparation for their 6,000 kilometre journey. They are looking pretty content, munching on their breakfast. These are three of the five animals that are going to be taken to Rwanda for the reintroduction, from all over Europe. They represent the countries that all of these animals come from. From Denmark, the UK, and the Czech Republic. In the early hours of this morning, the flight they've been preparing for finally arrived at Kigali International Airport. Once unloaded, this most precious of cargo is transferred to trucks for the final stage of the journey. This is their final destination and their first footsteps onto African soil. The rhinos will stay in these specially-built areas for several months while the team checks they're settled, healthy and ready for life beyond the fences. You see these animals having arrived safely. How does that make you feel? Very, very happy and I feel that they are a survivor, they arrive in Rwanda safely. It shows me a future of 100 rhinos, so for me conservation is not just for the sake of conserving but I see it as a way of improving our life today and in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SC-83a117796c344e9ba6d8bfc5f7f9e82c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDP-XNB1-JBH6-C3HC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400433</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

But of course Bill Gates wasn't really like that at all, just as Mark Zuckerberg recently isn't really like that at all. He's not just the uber-geek, he's a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market. I would not endorse a statement that broad. </p><p>What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place, say, in Europe, around something like privacy. But almost everywhere you look, I think we need additional guardrails. We need to guardrails that will be essential for the decade ahead, the 2020s, and we need to start building those now. Let's get specific, and let's start with privacy and data. Goodness knows technology allows every single one of us now to use our smartphones and our laptops and our tablets to acquire and use information, and thereby to also provide information about ourselves to tech companies such as yours. In the United States, there is a law which in essence says that the tech companies can't be held legally responsible for online</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1LO-f81b423951dc4226a5922c5f7b19a152</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1LO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X44-8C41-DY08-33MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"799\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Because it was tempting, of course, this was personified perhaps by Bill Gates more than anybody else, tempting to see this sort of geeky, extraordinarily smart business leader in a new enterprise, tech-oriented, who really was sort of in it for the purity of developing the knowledge. But of course Bill Gates wasn't really like that at all, just as Mark Zuckerberg recently isn't really like that at all. He's not just the uber-geek, he's a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market. </p><p>I would not endorse a statement that broad. What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place, say, in Europe, around something like privacy. But almost everywhere you look, I think we need additional guardrails. We need to guardrails that will be essential for the decade ahead, the 2020s, and we need to start building those now. Let's get specific, and let's start with privacy and data. Goodness knows technology allows every single one of us now to use our smartphones and our laptops and our tablets to acquire and use information, and thereby to also provide information about ourselves to tech companies such as yours.

What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them.

If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place, say, in Europe, around something like privacy. But almost everywhere you look, I think we need additional guardrails. We need to guardrails that will be essential for the decade ahead, the 2020s, and we need to start building those now. Let's get specific, and let's start with privacy and data.
